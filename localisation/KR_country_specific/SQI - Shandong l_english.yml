 SQI_qu_yingguang: "Qu Yingguang"
 SQI_qu_yingguang_leader_desc: "Qu Yingguang was born March 14th, 1883, in Zhejiang. He was inspired by Qiu Jin to become a revolutionary, but later aligned himself with the cliques of the Beiyang Army. In 1919 Qu was appointed Governor of Shandong, which became an adoptive home province for him. He distinguished himself as a good leader, improving management of the Yellow River and making efforts to protect the province’s religious and cultural legacy, in part by fostering ties with the Duke Yansheng. Years later, he joined the Beiyang Government and grew close to Duan Qirui. Both men were followers of Buddhism, a belief Qu learned from the maternal side of his family. He spent time working with religious societies and charitable organisations, earning the Buddhist name “Faxian” and the nickname of “Qu Bodhisattva”. He then moved to Shanghai shortly before Duan’s overthrow in 1926, dissatisfied with authoritarianism and corruption in Beijing.\n\nThe Shanghai Uprising of 1932 devastated his charity, the “Benevolence Alliance”, as it was feared to be infiltrated by Syndicalist agents. He fled the city like many of his peers, choosing to return to Shandong, but there witnessed the horror that China’s “Basest Warlord”, Zhang Zongchang, had wreaked upon it with opium and debauchery. Through ties to members of the Anti-Drug Association in Shandong, as well as friends like the Duke Yansheng and allies in Beijing, his Benevolence Alliance was reformed in Qufu as the “Society for Restoring Benevolence”. Though rarely publicly opposing Governor Zhang, Qu opened secret talks with the Zhili and the Imperial Court, working to find a way to pull the corruption in Shandong up by the root. Qu believes China must defeat corruption and sin, which a religious-political order upheld by an Emperor can best achieve. He’s cautious of the Manchu princes but supports Emperor Puyi, with whom he was granted an audience once. He is greatly interested in Puyi’s Buddhist sympathies, having come to believe that the Emperor is the best candidate to impose a harmonious, dharmic political order in China."

 SQI_zhang_zongchang: "Zhang Zongchang"
 SQI_zhang_zongchang_leader_desc: "Zongchang himself felt no great national pride for Qingdao when it was lost in 1897 to Germany, but the 1911 revolution did bring him to action. Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. But when Feng died in 1919, Zongchang returned to Manchuria and joined the Fengtian Clique just in time to participate in the First Zhili-Fengtian War in 1922. Fengtian's defeat in that war didn't dissuade him, and he went on to play a prominent role in the second war in 1924, capturing the crucial Lengkouguan Pass. With the near-total collapse of the Northern Zhili Clique following the Beijing Coup, Zongchang went on to conquer Shandong, and pushed as far south as Nanjing and Shanghai. An ability to utilise railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as \"filthy\", even by his allies, carried him through to victory after victory. Following a period of debauched rule in China's most international city, Zongchang thoroughly entrenched himself in Shandong, and through back-and-forth wars over Jiangsu eventually found himself trapped in the province during the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928. In the years since, Shandong has become both a refuge and a prison, where his illegal but tolerated presence remains under the shadow of the Qing government in Beijing. More recently, a bout of seemingly incurable sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zongchang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honoured Teacher, Zhang Tianran himself. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, Zongchang promised Tianran that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."

 SQI_zhang_tianran: "Zhang Tianran"
 SQI_zhang_tianran_leader_desc: "Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognised her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occurred after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for Zhang Tianran and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Tianran’s supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

Li's first major decoration was in fighting the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. An association with Anhui general Qu Tongfeng guided Li towards clique politics during the republican years. Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appraisal turned sour by 1928, when Zongchang became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong. Li, having taken inspiration from the declaration of Xue Dian as the Yiguandao's minor Emperor in Shandong, decided to present himself as spiritually enlightened. Li publicly began training in Wudang swordsmanship, and named himself 'the Magic Sword' to provide an air of mystery. This ultimately caught the attention of Zhang Tianran who has given Li several offers to train with Big Sword militias at Taishan."

The Zhang family, seeing the future in western businesses up north, moved Huizhi to Tianjin at a young age. As a student at the Tianjing military equipment school, Zhang Huaizhi join in the Boxer rebellion with his regiment, and was commended for bombarding the Legation quarter. The guilt of losing to the westerners drove the disgraced Zhang into the army of Yuan Shikai, whose ambitious goal of becoming an Emperor felt like more of a natural evolution for Zhang than republicanism. After Yuan died, Zhang fell in with the Anhui clique, and briefly served under Zhang Shuyuan as an administrator in Shandong in 1918. Zhang eventually failed his leader again after his regiment fell fighting in Hunan. This left Zhang Huaizhi destitute again, and the only people who would take him was the Yiguandao. Citing his age, experience, and service against western imperialism, Zhang Tianran appointed Zhang Huaizhi a commander of the Red Spears of Shandong."

In 1912, Xu cooperated with the Nanjing Interim Government, rallying students in favour of revolution against the Qing. Xu used this political position to lead the Guangfu Cavalry regiment in 1913, briefly spending time in Xinjiang as well. Xu was send with the 6th Mixed Brigade Battalion into Shandong for the KMT to secure the province. Xu was unable to secure the province upon Zhang Zongchang's arrival in 1926. Xu choose to betray the KMT and surrender his brigade to Zongchang, while remaining untrustworthy to Zongchang. Xu was instrumental in riling Zongchang into feeling insecure, ultimately causing him to remain in Shandong during the 1928 offensive. Xu developed an addiction to opium during this time, and became complicit in the drug trade in Shandong, leading to a reduced discipline in his ranks."

Kohinata deserted the Kwantung military in 1920 to visit the mysterious Urga in Mongolia, being captured by bandits on his journey. The bandits took a liking to Kohinata, and allowed him to join their gang of horse thieves. These horse thieves taught Kohinata Daoism, martial arts, and gave him the name 'Asahi-Higashi' - 'Gun of the Devil'. When the Qing were restored, Kohinata began going by the pseudonym Shao, hiding his Japanese ancestry. Kohinata was captured by Zhang Zuolin and initially sentenced to death, but was pardoned on the stipulation that he serve Zhang Zongchang in 1928.

While in prison, Date joined the Oomoto Church, which was popular with young officers at the time. Date was released from prison in 1916, and travelled to Manchuria. A plan to assassinate Zhang Zuolin by Prince Yamagata Aritomo ran afoul with Zuolin, forcing Date to swear loyalty to him.

Sun also joined the Temple Road Society, a folk religion, and eventually rose into a leadership position within the society. Sun convinced the society to join the Mount Song Pacification Force, an anti-bandit group composed of former bandits. After being routed and witnessing Han Yukun's suicide in 1925, Sun deserted with loyal soldiers. These soldiers entered Bozhou, Anhui, and swore allegiance to the KMT as cover.

Siding with Yuan Shikai, Qu entered the Tianjin Naval School, and furthered his education at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, which he graduated from in 1904. Qu returned to China and served as instructor at the Wuyang Academy of Military Sciences in 1910. Initially cooperating with the Republicans in the Wuchang uprising of 1911, Qu bounced around to different posts in the Republic, eventually returning to Yuan briefly before running the Shandong Military Affairs Office in 1916. Qu made an agreement in 1917 with Li Yuanhong to sell mineral rights to an aluminium mine in Shandong to Japan, and allow shipments out of Yantai. The Anhui Clique in 1920, feuding with Li Yanhong, rescinded this right and requested Qu to Nanjing to stand trial. Rather than stand trial, Qu faked illness and postponed his trip until the Anhui Clique became disinterested in 1925. A letter from Sun Yat-sen, requesting Qu rally himself against Wu Peifu stirred him into action, attempting to organise a force in Shandong to join. This force choose to fight Zhang Zongchang upon his arrival to Shandong in 1926, being soundly defeated, and Qu went into hiding. The lack of central authority, and the idea that Sun Yat-sen ordered him to fight but he failed weighed heavily on Qu. Qu was then invited to Fengtian by Zhang Zuolin, who offered to redeem Qu if he joined the Beiyang Navy. Qu, distrusting the Japanese presence in Manchuria, refused and left.

 SQI_committees_against_vice: "Committees against Vice"
 SQI_committees_against_vice_desc: "The moral obligations of government officials have faltered in Shandong. What little that has been done to prevent drug abuse, gambling and debauchery has so far been handled solely by salvationist sects that operate completely out of government oversight. We must proclaim our leadership in the moral struggle against decadence and work to restore the people’s trust in government. To do so, we will begin by establishing new oversight committees, akin to the longstanding Anti-Drug Association of Shandong, with mandates to suppress illegal activities."

 SQI_break_the_black_markets: "Break the Black Markets"
 SQI_break_the_black_markets_desc: "The concentration of both native Chinese and foreign capital in Shandong, along with ready access to vices such as opium, alcohol and women of ill repute, have all contributed to an incredibly vast network of black markets stretching from Weihaiwei to Jining. They mainly operate through shady backroom deals, or under the cover of nighttime carnivals with their wild Hua Hoey lotteries. The Association for Restoring Benevolence’s first goal was to uncover these black market networks. Now, we must strive to eliminate them!"

Composed of mostly students, this group can only prosper with massive guidance from foreign powers.§!"
 SQI_syndicalist_party: "Anti-Japanese Solidarity Society"
 SQI_syndicalist_party_long: "Anti-Japanese Solidarity Society (Fanri Tuanjiehui)\n§gA radical splinter of the initial Kuomintang mission in Shandong, this group has spent several years underground in Qingdao waiting for the opportunity to arise. Influenced by translated socialist works published by the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, their organisation can only survive with the support of these foreign influencers.§!"
 SQI_radical_socialist_party: "Kuomintang"
 SQI_radical_socialist_party_long: "National Party (Kuomintang)\n§gSince the foundations of the New China movement were laid in Shandong, there is still an undercurrent of progressivism and change in the Shangqing. These people all seek closer ties to the underground Kuomintang south of the Yangtze River.§!"
 SQI_social_democrat_party: "Progressive Party"
 SQI_social_democrat_party_long: "Progressive Party (Jinbudang)\n§gFounded in 1916 by Kang Youwei, the Progressive Party grew largely through donations from ex-patriots and within the margin of democratic opportunism of the decade. When this opportunism was replaced by the Qing Restoration, several party members in Shandong chose to go underground.§!"
 SQI_social_liberal_party: "Guiyidao Society"
 SQI_social_liberal_party_long: "Guiyidao Society (Guiyidao Hui)\n§gThis organisation has a similar background to the Yiguandao, but is inclusive of Christianity and western esotericism. As such their funding has sharply declined in recent years due to the divided nature of Shandong. Those seeking Christianity have already moved to Qingdao. They do however have a strong reputation for nonpartisan welfare, giving to the poor of every race.§!"
 SQI_market_liberal_party: "Dragon Flower Society Heavenly Way"
 SQI_market_liberal_party_long: "Dragon Flower Society Heavenly Way (Yixin Tiandao Longhua Hui)\n§gFounded in Zouping county to combat the excessive poverty in the region, the Dragon Flower Society represents an alternative to banditry that attracted so many that decade. The founder, Ma Shiwei, intended the organisation to unify several different schools of Xiantiandao under a common goal to improve welfare in Shandong. The Dragon Flower Society was only recognised as a political party when interventionists and western observers sought out an alternative to the Yiguandao's latent militarism and the Guiyidao's generous welfare ideals.§!"
 SQI_social_conservative_party: "Research Clique"
 SQI_social_conservative_party_long: "Research Clique (Yanjiuxi)\n§gAn offshoot of the 1916 Progressive Party founded by Kang Youwei during the reign of Yuan Shikai, The Shandong Research Clique has struggled since the restoration of the Qing for relevance in Shandong. With membership unwilling to compromise with the intellectual climate of Shandong intelligentsia, party membership is mostly built on donations from ex-patriots and appeals to visiting westerners.§!"
 SQI_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Society of Restoring Benevolence"
 SQI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Society of Restoring Benevolence (Guiren Hui)\n§gThe turmoil of the century of humiliation is just another page in the long history of Shandong. For many in Shandong, enlightenment is the only way to escape it, others seek to dominate in their short lives. Traditionalists around Qu Yingguang and the Duke Yansheng oppose all changes that were introduced by foreigners of the last century. The Zongchang Clique’s open secret drug trade is seen as degenerate behaviour by many in Shandong. Not to mention the extravagance and boorishness on display with Zhang Zongchang himself. To many, the failure of the Qing is their lackadaisical attitude towards Shandong, not their monarchy. Qu Yingguang’s public commitment to the Qing is resounded in southeastern Shandong, who wish to return home to Weihaiwei and Qingdao.§!"

This extends along the Shandong railway up until Weifang, and along the main road to Yantai. The clique is run by Zongchang along with his associates loyal to him including Zhang Jingyao and Zhang Zizhong. Zongchang’s true power is in the well armed remnants of the Shandong Revolutionary Army that patrol the province. Although they still technically adhere to a ban on opium, in practice Zongchang uses the railway to get his supply from Qingdao.§!"

 SQI_national_populist_party_long: "Yiguandao Society (Yiguandao Hui)\n§gThe Yiguandao is a cult originally part of the White Lotus Society that was practised throughout China in the 19th Century. Their syncretic beliefs combine the structure of heaven of Confucianism, the variety of gods of Buddhism, and the life extending practices of Daoism. The Yiguandao doctrine was confided by Teacher Lu Zhongjie to his small group during the Weltkrieg, and most subsequent converts learn in stages. This ensures that the core leadership has enough chips to adjust the cult to fit their personal goals. First among this group is Teacher Zhang Tianran, the successor to Lu Zhongyi. Through Tianran’s political manoeuvring, the cult has grown to about 7 million adherents across China, with only 500,000 members located within the Shangqing itself.\n\nPeasant armies throughout Northern China, particularly the Big Swords Society and Red Spears Society, see the Yiguandao as the most morally upright government in China.§!"

### Political focuses ###
 SQI_Two_Zhangs_Enter: "Two Zhangs Enter"
 SQI_Two_Zhangs_Enter_desc: "Years of tension between the Yiguandao and Zhang Zongchang has reached a breaking point. Zongchang's promises to stay clean have withered away, and Qu Yingguang's infiltration into the drug trade has unearthed valuable evidence to convict him in the eyes of the world. With the arrival of Lu Zhongjie to Jinan, Zongchang has put himself on a path of destruction for all three in Shandong."

 SQI_Zhang_Tianran_focus: "Announce Revelationary Order"
 SQI_Zhang_Tianran_focus_desc: "As all great teachers in Chinese history have done, Zhang Tianran will reveal revelationary order to the Chinese public through public sermons. While the warlords of China shout and break their men, Zhang Tianran will calmly dictate the future of China as told to him through spirit writing. Through Tianran, Wujimu, Sun Yat-sen and the Buddha speak."

 SQI_Mobbing_Drug_Dealing_Bureaucrats: "Destroy Drug Dealers"
 SQI_Mobbing_Drug_Dealing_Bureaucrats_desc: "The generations of pain China is crawling out of are threatened by vicious seeds of Opium. Opium is not a medicine but a poison upon Chinese people, and something the noble Boxers and Sun Yat-sen sought to end. Zhang Tianran has organised a list of known drug dealers, and is relying on citizens to uproot them."

 SQI_Moving_The_Provincial_capital: "Back to the Basics"
 SQI_Moving_The_Provincial_capital_desc: "The whole bureaucracy of Jinan is rotten with blind faith in warlords. The Shandong independence council, Zongchang's Governor's office, and the corrupt importation office must all be condemned. From their failure, the Yiguandao will establish Managers and Teachers to oversee civil governance. "

 SQI_Recruiting_Red_Spears_And_Big_Swords: "Absorbing the Guiyidao"
 SQI_Recruiting_Red_Spears_And_Big_Swords_desc: "The Guiyidao's innovative ability to connect pious men from outside China to our cause of salvation is commendable. It is with great regret that they have abandoned Shandong for Beijing and Tianjin. No matter. Their offices are prime locations for Managers to distribute charity."

 SQI_Qu_Yingguang_focus: "Benevolence and Morality"
 SQI_Qu_Yingguang_focus_desc: "Zhang Tianran's Benevolence and Morality Association was set up as a backup plan back in 1930 if the Yiguandao was ever banned by the Qing again. Now with Tianran's leadership role public knowledge, the organisation can be fully merged into the Yiguandao. Tianran's leaflets on morality can be publicly read as commentaries on the classics. "

 SQI_Preparing_Integration_With_The_Qing: "Return to the Source"
 SQI_Preparing_Integration_With_The_Qing_desc: "Now that the two Zhangs have been eliminated, Shandong can now return to the source of legitimacy in China, Beijing. Our mutual interest in seeing China freed of foreign influence will be fulfilled, and the cultural institutions of Shandong will be preserved. "

 SQI_Zhang_Zongchang_focus: "A Story of a Bastard"
 SQI_Zhang_Zongchang_focus_desc: "The crowds that laughed at Zongchang when he rode into Jinan in a coffin are now in wooden boxes themselves. Governor Zhang Zongchang announced to his soldiers that they are all bastards like he is. They are also the biggest and most virile bastards in China. Shandong's destiny is to outplay the big dogs and keep Zongchang alive at all costs."

 SQI_Appointing_Lu_Zhongyi_Leader_Of_The_Yiguandao: "Appoint Lu Zhongjie to Master"
 SQI_Appointing_Lu_Zhongyi_Leader_Of_The_Yiguandao_desc: "The most important lesson Zhang Zongchang took from Taishan is that the people of Shandong have flocked to religion as their disillusionment with him increases. In order to cut them off at the pass, Zongchang has invited the grateful Lu Zhongjie to resume her position as Honoured Teacher of the Yiguandao, and to stay out of politics."

 SQI_Clearing_Out_Mount_Tai_Of_The_Yiguandao: "Tour Taishan"
 SQI_Clearing_Out_Mount_Tai_Of_The_Yiguandao_desc: "After the Boxer Temple at Dezhou, Sun Dianying got a taste for the golden decor of temples. The Yiguandao still persist up on Taishan, and Song Dianying has devised a more careful plan of starving them out then ransoming all their valuables to let them live."

 SQI_Assassinating_Bureaucrats_Threatening_The_Opium_Trade: "Save the Drug Trade"
 SQI_Assassinating_Bureaucrats_Threatening_The_Opium_Trade_desc: "The looming threat of discovery that Yingguang and Tianran held over our head is over. Once we eliminate the remaining nannies that try and disrupt the drug trade, we can enjoy that freedom the monarchists and philosophers disparage."

 SQI_Advertising_Shandong_As_A_Model_Province_In_Beijing: "Shandong as Model Province"
 SQI_Advertising_Shandong_As_A_Model_Province_In_Beijing_desc: "The idea of model governance is not what kept Shandong independent, but soon it may be the only argument in favour of autonomy. The civil servants in Shandong are implored to distribute positive assessments of the province, as well as ensure that foreign visitors do not venture too far from the cities."

### Army ###
 SQI_Bolstering_The_Army: "Reaffirm The Northeast Army"
 SQI_Bolstering_The_Army_desc: "The Northeast Army was decamped at Shandong, and was declared by most observers to be defunct. Despite our best efforts, the foreign observers are largely correct. Many veterans of Fengtian's force are in hiding, and need to be called in from the reserve to fight. The old banners of Shandong should be brought out to call all capable men to our army."

 SQI_A_Modern_Army: "An Army of Professionals"
 SQI_A_Modern_Army_desc: "Past experience with recruits deserting and disobedience indicates that we should focus on training professional soldiers. Having to draw from a more mature selection of soldiers, providing them with proper training, and given specific orders to retreat will ensure our soldiers last longer in a protracted war."

 SQI_Research_Replacements_For_Old_Weapons: "Replace Outdated Weapons"
 SQI_Research_Replacements_For_Old_Weapons_desc: "The army's mercenary origins ar shown in their substandard equipment. If we are to reform towards professionalism, our engineers must be given time to experiment with new weapon designs and procurement."

 SQI_Train_Cavalry_With_Japanese_Fighting_Methods_desc: "The mercenary cavalry that came to Shandong with Zhang Zongchang are now awaiting either their cue to leave or to fight. Some of them have had experience in the North foraging and outrunning larger patrols. These lessons would be great if applied to our battle plans."

 SQI_Improving_The_Railroad-Army_Coordination: "Improve Railroad Supply Chain"
 SQI_Improving_The_Railroad-Army_Coordination_desc: "The railroad through Shandong was essential for Zongchang during his service to Fengtian. Now his lessons can be applied to future campaigns, with additional improvements. Having some rail cars carry food, and others with spare parts will reduce breakdowns."

 SQI_A_Fanatical_But_ill-equipped_Army: "An Army of Fanatics"
 SQI_A_Fanatical_But_ill-equipped_Army_desc: "Past experience with recruits displaying more bravery than their superiors and death defying manoeuvres indicates that we should focus on training fanatic soldiers. Having to draw from a younger selection of soldiers, providing them with proper training, and given specific orders to never retreat will ensure our soldier's swift victory."

 SQI_Purchase_Imperial_Weapons_From_The_Qing: "Request Weapons From Followers"
 SQI_Purchase_Imperial_Weapons_From_The_Qing_desc: "The people of Shandong have been building personal defence weapons for years in fear of Zongchang. Now that he is gone, our administration can request these potential patriots donate their arms to the national salvation."

 SQI_Recruit_Chahar_Cavalry: "Learn From Chahar Cavalry"
 SQI_Recruit_Chahar_Cavalry_desc: "Chahar horsemen played their part in helping poor folks of northern Shandong resist Zongchang's tax collectors. It is now time to pay back the favour. Chahar Cavalrymen living in Shandong have been pardoned of any banditry they may have committed, and are implored to join the army and assist in national salvation. "

 SQI_Train_Soldiers_On_Last_Ditch_Resistance: "Fight for the Master"
 SQI_Train_Soldiers_On_Last_Ditch_Resistance_desc: "Soldiers no longer respond to warlords orders en masse. It takes a competent and proven leader, a Master, to muster bravery in these cautious times. A command centre lead by a civil and military administration can ensure objectives can be completed using all of Shandong's faculties."

 SQI_Sending_Military_Staff_For_Training: "Send Officers Back To School"
 SQI_Sending_Military_Staff_For_Training_desc: "The younger generation of soldiers lack the opportunity to attend military academies abroad, due to our lack of legitimacy. We must take an account of our options for foreign military schooling and press all our favours in that direction."

 SQI_Recruitung_Military_Experts_Outside_Shandong: "Develop Secret Weapon"
 SQI_Recruitung_Military_Experts_Outside_Shandong_desc: "Thinking outside the mould is what enabled Shandong to preserve its autonomy in past decades. As an extension, we have a series of exploratory military projects we can focus on."

 SQI_Improving_Our_Technological_Sharing: "Send Scientists Back To School"
 SQI_Improving_Our_Technological_Sharing_desc: "The younger generation of students lack the opportunity to attend military academies abroad, due to our lack of legitimacy. Our administration can spend some capital to gather teachers from Qingdao and Tianjin, and assemble a military research plan."

### Industry ###
 SQI_Turning_Our_Attention_To_Industry: "Revive Shandong's Industry"
 SQI_Turning_Our_Attention_To_Industry_desc: "While Shandong was not under the inept administration of the League of Eight, the previous few years have seen many small factories close their doors. The administration has dedicated itself to assessing the empty factory lots for potential loans to open new businesses in Shandong."

 SQI_Reopening_The_Barred_Factories: "Reopen Barred Factories"
 SQI_Reopening_The_Barred_Factories_desc: "Zhang Zongchang's attempt to play the Shandong Mining Cartel against the Luda mining company resulted in several factories in Shandong being closed when the cartel and distribution centres could not reconcile. It is time we push through reconciliation and reopen the centres for business."

 SQI_Improving_The_Qingdao_Weihaiwei_Railway: "Revive Jinan-Qingdao Railway"
 SQI_Improving_The_Qingdao_Weihaiwei_Railway_desc: "The Jinan-Qingdao Railway has been worn out through overuse and poor construction methods when tracks were laid in the 1910s. Some sort of mutually beneficial arrangement can be made with the German authorities where they supply steel for repairing the railway, and we supply the corvée labour."

 SQI_Leasing_Shandong_Resources_To_Either_Qingdao_or_Weihaiwei: "Leasing Mineral Rights"
 SQI_Leasing_Shandong_Resources_To_Either_Qingdao_or_Weihaiwei_desc: "In the intervening years since the standstill on coal, more speculators have revealed mineral deposits in Shandong. Our administration is now competent enough to handle leasing mineral rights to Chinese companies. We can predict better profit and no tricks this time."

 SQI_Getting_Japanese_Military_Advisors_To_Construct_New_Factories: "Empower the Shandong Mining Cartel"
 SQI_Getting_Japanese_Military_Advisors_To_Construct_New_Factories_desc: "The Shandong Mining Cartel was formed in 1928 with secret endorsement by Zhang Zongchang. Their goal is to organise Chinese labour to ensure foreign companies do not get a cost advantage over domestic competition.

 SQI_Attracting_Qing_Nobility_desc: "The Beijing government is ejecting otherwise fine residents for petty political issues, and their loss is our windfall. The administration has authorised we spruce up several estates around Shandong and make Qing noblemen an offer to take up residency.

### Events ###
 shandong.1.t: "1936; Turning Point in Shandong"
 shandong.1.d: "The province of Shandong has been carved up of its most valuable land by the Legation States and Germany. The port of Qingdao, once devastated by war between Japan and Germany, now serves as an important port for both the Imperial German Navy and for civilian trade by the companies that make up the Aufsichtsrat. This situation has made Jinan the perfect home for the real power in Shandong. Zhang Zongchang. Zhang came to Shandong in 1911, ostensibly to lead the Shandong Revolutionary Army, but quickly made gambling and whoring his main activity. Jinan has grown like the Dogmeat General has; filthy, profitable, and less defended than initially planned. Atop Tai Shan’s 6,600 steps are the headquarters of the Yiguandao. The mysterious and apparently holy Zhang Tianran has made it the safest and most morally upright place in Shandong. The citizens of Shandong by 1936 have been cornered between disconnected, poverty stricken roads between Jinan and Weihaiwei. Salvation lies in the nearby Jinan or atop Mount Tai."
 shandong.1.a: "I don't care, the train is late"

### Political Events###
 shandong.2.t: "Lu Zhongjie Arrives to Jinan"
 shandong.2.d: "This day brings to Zongchang another opportunity to humiliate the old man on the mountain, Zhang Tianran. In order to establish his little cult on the hill, Tianran had to expel the sister of his former master, Lu Zhongyi. The sister, Lu Zhongjie, has become a rather concise rebuttal to the numerous Yiguandao well-wishers Zongchang has had to deal with in recent months. This is why she must return to Shandong, if only as a joke. To enhance the shock value, Zongchang has brought his old mother to this welcoming ceremony, which has swelled from the intended group into a sizeable crowd. Zongchang, in an attempt to enhance the humiliation Tianran should feel, has given the elderly Lu Zhongjie a bouquet and a traditional twenty-one gun salute was fired into a nearby apartment building in celebration of Lu Zhongjie's arrival."
 shandong.2.a: "Bullets have to go somewhere"

 shandong.970.t: "Zongchang's festivities escalate through Jinan"
 shandong.970.d: "After that rouse of fun and violence, Zongchang dropped his mother off with Lu Zhongjie and has decided to celebrate a night on the town. Zongchang stops occasionally to distribute 'Minsheng' to refugees from Jiangsu. Another encounter that day were Yiguandao protesters at Zongchang's business office. Their daily empty promises have been replaced by outrage over Lu Zhongjie's return to Shandong. Before Zongchang attempted to hit them with his car, they claimed that Tianran would arrive to judge Zongchang's very soul. The only thing that soured the evening was finding out that Zongchang's opium dealer is still in hiding. This no doubt is caused by interloping Ren Ci who have foiled otherwise fun evenings in Jinan with their morality in the past. The adventure ended with a visit to Zongchang's favourite brothel, where several women joined his entourage on the way home that evening to do drugs. As the day comes to an end, one of these ladies has gone missing with some opium, Zongchang asks his officers not to go after her, for there is still plenty more ladies and capsules of opium for the night."
 shandong.970.a: "Her loss then"

 shandong.3.t: "A spy for Yingguang is captured"
 shandong.3.d: "After a night of hard drugs and soft women in Jinan, Zongchang was revelling in himself the next morning when he saw a stranger in his backyard. Alerting his wives, and then his guards, Zongchang apprehended the intruder. After Sun Dianying's own special words with the man, it was revealed that he was an ally of Qu Yingguang, and had come after a sex worker had alerted him to drugs on the property. Dianying believes that this intruder is the vanguard of a rebellion Yingguang is planning out of Qufu. A fear Dianying has stoked for several months since his income from taxation was cut off by Yingguang's militia. Commander Junnosuke Date, on the other hand, insists to the hungover Zongchang that Yingguang is planning to alert the Qing instead. Junnosuke insists that their forces be diverted to Dezhou to stop Yingguang from escaping. Barely able to recall the night before, Zongchang decides to..."
 shandong.3.a: "Block the roads, Yingguang must be leaving"
 shandong.3.b: "Send men to Yingguang's house"

 shandong.971.t: "Junnosuke Date attacks Yingguang at Dezhou"
 shandong.971.d: "Junnosuke Date's forces arrived at Dezhou to strong public distaste, stronger revulsion than usual. It was immediately apparent that the town has been turned over to the Ren Ci and Yingguang. Junnosuke sent his cavalry into Dezhou to search out Yingguang, with the looming and dangerous prospect of a possible raid into the Qing kingdom. Yingguang was found near the Haido Jinshan temple, paying respects to his ancestors. Junnosuke's soldiers seized Yingguang, and a skirmish began between his Ren Ci militiamen and the cavalry. Fortunately Junnosuke brought enough firepower to eliminate the militia and Yingguang in the process. Unfortunately, the abundance of witnesses in Dezhou required a lot more fighting to silence. At the end of the battle, the Haido Jinshan temple was in flames, and Junnosuke was retreating back towards Jinan trying his best to think up an alibi."
 shandong.971.a: "That was a Boxer temple, nobody will care"

 shandong.972.t: "Sun Dianying fails to find Yingguang at Qufu"
 shandong.972.d: "The soldiers sent to Qufu found what they wanted, but not what they needed. After threats of violence were given by Dianying, and several quarters burned, the occupants of Qufu fled as Dianying began searching for Yingguang. While there was abundant evidence that the Ren Ci had used the manor, neither Yingguang nor the Duke Yansheng were to be found. Zongchang waited several days for a response from Dianying, and received Dianying's most humble apologies and gifts from Confucian manor. These gifts did little to sate Zongchang's anger, who immediately set out with the Japanese cavalry to Dezhou, furious that Junnosuke's advice was not taken. Zongchang's arrival in Dezhou failed to find Yingguang, not even evidence of him being there. Faced with the dangerous prospect of sending a raid into the Qing kingdom on the hunch of Junnosuke Date, Zongchang decided the investigation was over, and returned to Jinan to continue his harassment campaign on the Yiguandao."
 shandong.972.a: "At least I got some gifts out of this"

 shandong.4.t: "Zongchang sends an alibi to the Qing"
 shandong.4.d: "Several books of poetry, and a commentary on the classics has proven to be very helpful to Zongchang at this moment. Letters that used to contain embarrassing misspellings and poor stroke order are now refined in a golden alibi Zongchang has sent to the Qing government. This alibi intends to answer what caused such a panic in Dezhou recently, and why this issue should not bother Puyi or Wu Peifu in the least. The letter paints the picture of a province filled with bandits and conmen. This environment, explains the letter, leads to unfounded rumours of moral decay in Shandong, which is certainly exaggerations by conmen like Zhang Tianran. Furthermore, the letter adds that Zongchang had found and eliminated a cell of KMT holdouts in Shandong, and there is no reason to be concerned about traitors to the emperor, no matter what they may claim."
 shandong.4.a: "Nothing to see here, move along"

 shandong.5.t: "Qing Magistrates Arrest Zongchang"
 shandong.5.d: "Sun Dianying was a fool. While he was burning and looting Yingguang's manor, the man himself was already halfway to Beijing. Despite Dianying's excuses and efforts to uncover the plotters in Shandong, it left Jinan vulnerable to a large contingent of Qing infantry that entered Jinan. Even worse, Zongchang had no way of knowing the Qing soldiers were there to arrest him. A written letter by Zongchang from prison to the Emperor asking him to allow family visitation has been rejected. Zongchang now has a forth Unknown, unknown when he will be released from prison for his numerous crimes. The other day, one of the many children of Zongchang approached Qu Yingguang, asking him if his father will survive his imprisonment."
 shandong.5.a: "Your daddy will be fine in prison"

 shandong.6.t: "Mount Tai Outraged at Zongchang"
 shandong.6.d: "It did not take long for the teacher Tianran to find out about Lu Zhongjie. The initial reaction being delivered in a request to return to Mount Tai for more treatment of his long-gone illness. These letters were ignored by Zongchang, wishing to further annoy the teacher on the mountain and to humiliate him by publicly reading the letters. Finally the last letter delivered today took on a much darker tone. The letter addressed the people of Jinan, and accused Zongchang of smuggling opium into China, betraying Chinese for Western gambling partners, and of trying to take Lu Zhongjie as a wife. Tianran has challenged Zongchang to come to Mount Tai to receive his eternal judgement, or else the people of Shandong will wither and die to punish their leader. Sun Dianying recommends confronting and purifying Mount Tai of its residents, while another commander, Zhang Jingyao, recommends waiting the teacher out."
 shandong.6.a: "Come, let's confront these ascetics"
 shandong.6.b: "I'll wait for his desperate letters"

 shandong.7.t: "Tianran Passes Judgement on Zongchang"
 shandong.7.d: "Zongchang's contingent arrived at the gates of the Dai Miao, already his soles tired of the 6600 steps. Dianying suggested they conceal their guns, and open fire when they are let in. As Zongchang passed under the Zhengyang Gate, he was fatally shot by a sharpshooter from atop the gate. Dianying attempted to charge the courtyard with whatever men he had, but Jingyao had fled with the soldiers guarding his rear. Dianying was also fatally shot, and the current whereabouts of Zhang Jingyao is unknown. The honoured teacher Zhang Tianran was received in Jinan with an early New Years celebration, and read his final letter to Zongchang to a cheering crowd."
 shandong.7.a: "I declare this a Red Letter Day!"

 shandong.8.t: "Zongchang Saves Jinan from Yiguandao Raid"
 shandong.8.d: "The following weeks in Jinan have shown how far Tianran's influence has spread. Members of the public have defaced Zongchang's office, and several former friends have written to Zongchang asking him to prostrate himself before the Yiguandao. In return, Zongchang has told his commanders to man the walls of Jinan, extort and search all suspected Yiguandao members they come across, and deliver anything suspicious to him. Several of the items confiscated included poison labelled as medicine, small arms, and curses against Zongchang. Today Zongchang was delivering another reading of Tianran's letter, along with a dissertation into the evils of the Yiguandao, when a mob of them entered the city. Zongchang's soldiers quickly engaged the cultists that were carrying guns, and Japanese cavalry chased the rest out. Tianran, while attempting to hide his shining head, was caught and shot by the cavalry."
 shandong.8.a: "Finally the public sees my truth"

### Focus tree related events ###
 shandong.9.t: "Yiguandao and Peasants Riot"
 shandong.9.d: "After news of Zhang Tianran's murder during the attack on Jinan, thousands of mourners have descended upon the city to search for the Honoured Teacher's remains. When rumour spread that Zongchang had Tianran along with all of the Yiguandao fighters buried dishonourably in a mass grave, panic spread across Shandong. The remaining Yiguandao across Shandong have begun to aggressively attack policemen and landlords throughout the province. Townspeople, fearing both the fanatic and the now-demonised Zongchang clique, have begun to shield themselves from the outside world. They will not respond to any governing authority, and must be dealt with."

 shandong.1000.t: "A Strike Against Nanjing"
 shandong.1000.d: "The death of Sun has thrown Eastern China into chaos. Fires, looting, and banditry will become the norm throughout the region, but at the same time, it provides a golden opportunity. The Zhili hegemony is over, a power vacuum is fast growing in China, and if we can seize our chance and take control of Nanjing, we'll be assured to play a major role in the coming struggles over China's future. Top advisors to [THIS.GetLeader] have advised him to march south towards the old capital and secure our place as one of China's big players."

 shandong.1000.b: "We should wait and see..."

 shandong.10.t: "Sending Young Officers into School"
 shandong.10.d: "Shandong lacks the proper facilities to train officers in modern warfare. This issue speaks directly to the commanders in Shandong, as they were trained in schools in the north and south. It is well known that the prestige of the school you attend is as important as the training at the school. Therefore we must attempt to send young officers-in-training abroad. Whichever school they will attend will also leave an indelible effect on their loyalty, of course."

 shandong.11.d: "It is already becoming apparent that Shandong's army is behind the times. While we have spent our efforts trying to raise the standard of our military equipment, we have not dared to venture outside what we can purchase. The Army Command has convinced [SQI.GetLeader] to put some resources into projects recently made by a Czech resident of Shandong, Hanchtedelay. Hanchtedelay has ambitions to transform several Studebaker cars that he owns into crude tanks. A second plan is to purchase Flying Pigeon bicycles from Tianjin and train a division to use them. A third plan proposed by a professor at Jinan University is to purchase climbing equipment and focus culinary efforts towards enabling soldiers to survive China's numerous mountain ranges."

 shandong.12.t: "Investigate missing shipments"
 shandong.12.d: "For the past few months, vital commerce is being disrupted along the Qingdao-Jinan railway. An ongoing police investigation has only determined that it is not the train line employees, and no other possibilities have been ruled out yet. [SQI.GetLeader] has been called in to supervise the investigation before it becomes a major scandal in Jinan. The police, ever cautious of the chinese border guards outside of Qingdao, have suggested we investigate the railway relay stations first. [SQI.GetLeader], on the other hand, is of the suspicion that the items are being stolen along the deserted stretches of countryside between Qingdao and Jinan. Which should we investigate first?"
 shandong.12.a: "Investigate the Railway"
 shandong.12.b: "Investigate the Border"

 shandong.13.t: "Evidence of Banditry on Railway?"
 shandong.13.d: "[SQI.GetLeader]'s hunch was correct. Police dispatched to survey the railroad's more deserted stretches have found suspicion constructions hidden under some brush. These constructs appear to be a cushion and luggage straps. There is no doubt that whomever has been stealing from the rail lines has been throwing their hauls off the train, where it is moved to a second location. The police chief is adamant that bandits must be responsible, and requests some backup in order probe the dens of Eastern Shandong for their hideout."
 shandong.13.a: "Yes, take these men"

 shandong.14.t: "Evidence of bribery at border stations"
 shandong.14.d: "The police were right, the border station was certainly suspicious. Upon initial inspection, the small shack that houses the border guards could barely fit five occupants. Upon inspecting the floor of the shack, however, a large empty alcove was discovered. There being no logical use for such a large empty space below the shack, the police chief has decided to arrest the attending border guards. Although there is some risk that this will anger our sellers in Qingdao, law and justice are on our side."
 shandong.14.a: "Interrogate the station guards"

 shandong.15.t: "Besieging the Bandits"
 shandong.15.d: "Following a dirt road, several soldiers have come upon an active militia encampment. Fortunately these brave men were able to alert the police chief, who has the grace of [SQI.GetLeader] to besiege the bandits on suspicion of theft. Calling [SQI.GetLeader] himself, the chief's siege has resulted in some deaths, and an offer arrives in the morning from the bandits. They request their freedom in exchange for all their goods, stolen and owned, so long as they can leave with their weapons and their lives."

 shandong.16.t: "Border guards arrested, confess to smuggling"
 shandong.16.d: "The border guards quickly break down under interrogation, proclaiming that poverty has driven them into a scheme where one of them stalls trains coming from Qingdao, while the other steals items from the carts. These guards have begged for prison over execution, and have offered all their remaining loot as collateral. [SQI.GetLeader] has ultimately decided to continue with execution, seeing as the Jinan jails are already too crowded as is."
 shandong.16.a: "Justice is fair, above all else."

 shandong.17.t: "Our Railway Is Secured"
 shandong.17.d: "When news reached the corners of Shandong that [SQI.GetLeader] had uncovered the railway thieves, many people did not believe it. They being so used to corrupt and ignorant governance coming out of Jinan, that a step in the right direction has renewed hope in the government. Traffic along the railway has also increased, proof that our actions did not disrupt the machinations in Qingdao."
 shandong.17.a: "Now we can improve the rails."

 shandong.18.t: "Bandits send Decoy, Escape to Hebei"
 shandong.18.d: "A gaurish display came out of the bandit encampment. Through binoculars, [SQI.GetLeader] saw bandits indicate they were ready to surrender, several of the bandits began entering their hold, and exiting with goods in trunks. Finally, in astonishment, several bandits exited the hold and removed their clothing. These bandits then dropped their weapons, and began to haul the trunks towards our offensive line. In shock, [SQI.GetLeader] ordered his line to hold heir fire, and let these apparently insane bandits pass. Soldiers were in such an uproar of laughter humiliating these bandits, that nobody noticed that another contingent of bandits had slipped through the woods until the whole display was over. A scramble over this ruse resulted in the death of the nude bandits, but it appears the other group has escaped Eastern Shandong."
 shandong.18.a: "We are screwed, people"

 shandong.19.t: "Bandits captured in Hebei, claim Zongchang is smuggling drugs"
 shandong.19.d: "Out of Shandong came several ragged men recently. These nameless refugees claim to be farmers, but their scars indicate either military service or banditry. These men were detained in Hebei, where they produced evidence of [SQI.GetLeader] being involved in the drug trade. This claim moved rapidly to Beijing, where our investigators have verified the evidence as genuine. Opium and other drugs are often seen as responsible for the collapse of traditional Chinese morality over the past century, and therefore a major cause of its continuous humiliation at the hands of foreign powers. As we are the national government, with a reputation to uphold, this is a very serious matter indeed. Should we dismiss the claims of these bandits, or should we ready a military intervention to restore law in Shandong? Most experts agree that [SQI.GetLeader] cannot be retired without the total subordination of the clique."

 shandong.20.d: "Word has reached the capital of scattered attempts by members of the Red Spears and Big Swords, peasant armies supporting Zhang Tianran's Yiguandao movement in Shandong, to purchase large quantities of weapons from local magistrates. The money and other supplies offered in return are a pittance, but some local authorities have defended their sales so far by pointing out that arming these religious fanatics might weaken our shared enemies. We could issue a covert order permitting further sales of weapons to [SQI.GetNameDef], or crack down on them completely."

 shandong.22.d: "The Japanese soldiers we invited have finished training our cavalry corps. Their professionalism will hopefully set an example for the rest of our army, where success in battle is less important than the pay. Some in our ranks are still wary of trusting the Japanese for military assistance, but to their credit they haven't betrayed us yet."

 shandong.24.d: "[SQI.GetLeader], governor of Shandong, has sent a formal request that we induct his young cadets into our prestigious military academies. Although we have certainly accepted Chinese students in the past, and many now serve across China, they have usually served in the army of a recognised national government. [SQI.GetLeader], a mere provincial governor, blatantly fails to meet these standards.\n\nHowever, if we accept, the payment for our services may be considerable."
 shandong.24.a: "Accept them."
 shandong.24.b: "Absolutely not."

 shandong.993.t: "Japan Agrees to Train our officers"
 shandong.993.d: "Japan has agreed to open several of their most prestigious military academies to our cadets, including the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō. Their training will be second to none, and this should go a ways toward securing us additional respect in the eyes of other Chinese - albeit only those indifferent to Japanese influence."
 shandong.993.a: "Wonderful."

Although we have certainly accepted foreign students in the past, they have usually served in the army of a recognised national government. [SQI.GetLeader], a notorious criminal and mere provincial governor, blatantly fails to meet these standards.\n\nHowever, if we accept, the payment for our services may be considerable."

 shandong.995.a: "Wonderful"

 shandong.26.t: "Shandong Requests Cadet Training"
 shandong.26.d: "[SQI.GetLeader], governor of Shandong, has sent a formal request that we send a number of Weltkrieg Veterans to assist in the training of his troops. It is certainly true that the French surrender in 1919, and the British collapse in 1925, left the international settlements with a surplus of exiled war veterans, many of whom have since taken to policing or mercenary work. Nonetheless, [SQI.GetLeader] is a mere warlord with a great deal of blood on his hands, and Zhang Zongchang's sweep through Shanghai in 1925 left him with a monstrous reputation in local circles. We could accept the deal, but there are also risks to consider."
 shandong.26.a: "Accept the deal."
 shandong.26.b: "This is too dangerous."

 shandong.27.t: "Mineral Rights in Shandong"
 shandong.27.d: "Ever since Qu Tongfeng's debacle with the Anhui Clique a decade ago, there has been a lot of caution whether or not to sell mineral rights to foreign enterprises. There have not been a lack of opportunities to profit, but the fear of appearing uncouth or traitorous has stopped any resolution as of yet. At long last Shandong is stable enough, and the offers are more attractive than ever. The options are the Japanese Luda company, who has already gained access to Weihai through negotiations. Krupp, whom already wield significant political clout in Qingdao. And finally Peabody Energy, who offer stock options unavailable to Chinese citizens."
 shandong.27.d1: "Ever since Qu Tongfeng's debacle with the Anhui Clique a decade ago, there has been a lot of caution whether or not to sell mineral rights to foreign enterprises. There have not been a lack of opportunities to profit, but the fear of appearing uncouth or traitorous has stopped any resolution as of yet. Now, we have been pressured by our benefactors to accept the offer from the Japanese Luda company."

There are numerous families in Jiangsu, Anhui and beyond that are being split apart by the League War. Thousands who could not cross the battlefield and are now stuck. The committee proposes breaking [SQI.GetLeader]'s neutrality policy with a volunteer group for the purposes of rescuing families of Shandong residents. This will definitely involve Shandong choosing a side in the conflict, and should these volunteers choose cooperation with the losing side, we can expect increased animosity from the south."

Chen's reputation far outmatches [SQI.GetLeader], and our own reputation works against us. While this should improve our odds against the League, it also means that, because of Fengtian's support, we can't just move against Anqing afterwards."
 shandong.33.a: "Alright"

 shandong.34.t: "Fengtian Refuses Intervention"
 shandong.34.d: "Fengtian has notified us that it will no longer seek to involve itself in our dispute with Anqing, citing that it would be impossible to get us to agree.

 shandong.36.d: "We have successfully struck a deal with the Anqing Clique. This means that we will have time to prepare further moves while they deal with the Kuomintang. It is important to know that this deal is not permanent and we will seek to alter it in our favour if we can."
 shandong.36.a: "A fragile peace."

 shandong.37.t: "Anqing Diplomat Approaches Us"
 shandong.37.d1: "While it seemed like Fengtian's recent proposal was not accepted by both us and Anqing, a lowly Anqing diplomat has found the courage to seek an audience with Zhang Zongchang to discuss the possibility of a peace deal without Fengtian interference. Zhang, who was in an uncharacteristically good mood, heard the diplomat out.\n\nWe currently hold territory deemed extremely critical by Chen Tiaoyuan's Anqing. The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to accept peace if we give up territory outside of Jiangsu. This might not be a bad idea, as this territory is difficult to administrate regardless and doesn't give us many benefits, except making Chen very angry. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."

The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to accept peace if we hold on only to these territories we acquired. This might not be a bad idea, as getting anything extra would most likely only result in resistance in this new territory. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."
 shandong.37.d3: "While it seemed like Fengtian's recent proposal was not accepted by both us and Anqing, a lowly Anqing diplomat has found the courage to seek an audience with Zhang Zongchang to discuss the possibility of a peace deal without Fengtian interference. Zhang, who was in an uncharacteristically good mood, heard the diplomat out.\n\nWe were unable to acquire any new territory. The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to cede all of Jiangsu in exchange for peace. This is great news, as Jiangsu is the main territory we are after. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."

The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to cede Xuhai, the western part of Jiangsu, in exchange for peace. This is great news, as this would be a great step towards further gains. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."

 shandong.40.t: "The Anqing Issue"
 shandong.40.d1: "Now that the Kuomintang have been defeated, it is no longer necessary that we bow to the wishes of Chen Tiaoyuan. Chen sees himself as better than the others for his support of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, but we all know this is just a show. We can no longer afford to be stuck only within Shandong. We must seize control of at least Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong). We will immediately send a telegram to Fengtian to make sure this is achieved."
 shandong.40.d2: "Now that the Kuomintang have been defeated, it is no longer necessary that we bow to the wishes of Chen Tiaoyuan. Chen sees himself as better than the others for his support of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, but we all know this is just a show.

We will immediately send a telegram to Fengtian to make sure this is achieved."

Chen sees himself as better than the others for his support of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, but we all know this is just a show. We control all of Jiangsu Province (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong states), but Anqing’s Chen Tiaoyuan will most definitely not accept this permanently. We will immediately send a telegram to Fengtian to make sure they do not give our territory away to him."

 shandong.100.d: "The Kenpeitai has uncovered a plot by several naval engineers on the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation who are planning on selling ship designs to Shandong. The Kenpeitai is ready to stop this deal and arrest the pair, but an alternative solution is possible. If the Kenpeitai was to alert the Kawasaki Corporation that they could legally sell ship designs to Shandong, they could arrest the traitors themselves and we can profit off a legal sale. This is a risky proposition, but considering that Shandong is too minor to become a naval rival, the damage to national security by the sale is minimal."

 shandong.101.t: "Japanese Engineers Sell Us Designs"

Shortly before the transaction was made, the Kawasaki Corporation alerted us that they have been given permission to sell naval designs to us legally. The engineers we were in contact with are now in prison. This surprising turn of events bodes poorly but is presently satisfactory."
 shandong.101.a: "That was close"

 shandong.102.t: "Japanese Engineers Arrested Before Sale"
 shandong.102.d: "The clandestine deal went sideways, and we have lost contact with the Japanese engineers. It is believed that the engineers were arrested in a major bust at the Kawasaki Corporation, where they were employed. This surprising turn of events bodes poorly and the investment we made towards the designs is lost. "

This should go a long way toward improving their practical fighting ability, if not their discipline."
 shandong.996.a: "Wonderful."

 shandong.997.t: "The Legation Cities Rejected Our Offer"
 shandong.997.d: "The Legation authorities have refused to send French and British Weltkrieg veterans to train our troops, due to concerns about how their training might be put to use. Zhang Zongchang's sweep through Shanghai in 1925 earned him quite the monstrous reputation there, which may be to blame."
 shandong.997.a: "Terrible!"

 shandong.988.d: "Several of our officers, and some of our mechanics, have had the opportunity to bear witness to the German Panzer in action. while many thought us fools for trying it, we have done it. We have created a wholly Chinese made tank! Though parts of it may have been salvaged from captured or destroyed pieces left behind in the League, it is mostly Chinese. With the knowledge of producing armoured vehicles now in our hands, we may yet give our enemies a surprise, to be sure."

 shandong.989.d: "It is a simple fact that we lack the means to produce sufficient vehicles for a truly motorised force, however, the european militaries have paved the way for us to implement a cheaper solution. Our troops must be able to reach the battlefield first, and in good shape, otherwise we will be outmatched. Thus, it is only acceptable that we incorporate the bicycle into our regiments. With this cheap piece of metal, we may yet form a fighting force never before seen in China!"

Fortunately, Qu's familiarity with military tradition in Shandong provided the needed bribes to get the majority of the armed forces to submit. Amazingly, his Rec Ci even received pledges from the anti-bandit peasant armies that control south Shandong. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Zongchang clique and those devoted to the Yiguandao until death have other plans. We must protect the townspeople in Shandong from these newly-denounced warlords."

It therefore came as a surprise when the new Governor of Shandong, Qu Yingguang, sent a copy of these witness accounts directly to the Emperor. These eyewitness accounts not only condemn Zhang Zongchang further, but point strongly towards ongoing instability in Shandong that resulted from Zhang Zongchang's regime. Qu Yingguang has used this to heavily imply that further military assistance is needed to secure Shandong for Beijing. We are inclined to assist Qu Yingguang once again, save for the numerous other very important uses of our gendarmerie that the Chief of the Army has already planned out. What are we to do?"

### 400 - 409 Natpop Flavour Events

 shandong.400.t: "Zhao Matriarch Joins Zhang Tianran"
 shandong.400.d: "In the sea of refugees that flee northeastern China, many promises are made to the Homored Master Zhang Tianran. Many peasants have entrusted Zhang with their lives possessions, others have sworn themselves to fight in the Red Spears for Shandong. On a sunny day, a woman wearing winter garb from Beijing approached Zhang Tianran. The Yiguandao guards claim she is a matriarch like Tianran's wife, Sun Suzhen, but she stands before him with two pistols on her belt. Zhao Hong Wenguo, mother of Beijing student leader Zhao Dong, is here to offer her families services to the Yiguandao. Zhao Hong Wenguo claims to do this not out of religious loyalty or financial need, but because the Yiguandao appears to her the essential resistance against Japanese aggression that threatens her home. The Honoured Master agrees, and reiterates his promise to never cooperate with the Japanese in exchange for her families financial and tactical services. Zhao Hong Wenguo also insists in leading Red Spears and Big Sword divisions as a full fledged Field marshal."
 shandong.400.a: "Her resolve leaves us no doubt of her ability."

 shandong.401.t: "Tianran publishes Provisional Etiquette"
 shandong.401.d: "Tianran has long pushed that the teachings of Buddhism and Confucius are integral aspects of Chinese society that can never be questioned. Within the inner circle of the Yiguandao, a debate rages between Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen over how to best engage the literati in Shandong. Tianran and Suzhen have both collaborated on a book entitled 'Provisional Etiquette', intended to demonstrate how the Yiguandao respects the spiritual lineage of chinese leadership. To Zhang Tianran, who was once a minor bureaucrat under Yuan Shikai, the spiritual lineage of China's dictator went from the Regent Zaifeng to Yuan Shikai, then finally to the enthroned Puyi. To Sun Suzhen however, spiritual lineage in China belonged to Sun Yat-sen, and through Sun Yat-sen's death there is no true spiritual leader of China currently. Zhang's interpretation appears to hold to his agreement to promote Puyi as Emperor within the Yiguandao, but ignores the wellspring of spiritual support for the southern idealists."
 shandong.401.a: "Zhang is right, praise Puyi"
 shandong.401.b: "Sun is right, praise Sun Yat-sen"

 shandong.402.t: "Tianran Warns Public of Maha-Kalpa"
 shandong.402.d: "Spoken often within the temples and schools, but elusive to the secular public, Zhang Tianran has decided to reveal the existence of the Maha-Kalpa prophecy a public rally. To Zhang Tianran and the Yiguandao, the history of the world is divided into three periods by three periods of peace and barbarism, represented by Three Suns. The last aeon, that of the Red Sun, ended with the Xinhai Revolution. The Confucian legend Kang Yuowei is referenced in Zhang Tianran's speech, which agreed that the third age, Datong, or Maha-Kalpa was dawning. Soon, claims Tianran, the Chinese people will be perfected racially or be destroyed by foreigners like the Japanese Emperor or the British Empire.\n\nTo the uncertain people of Shandong, the only concrete suggestion out of so much esoteric ado is that they should work harder towards national unification, and reinforces the already-prevalent feeling of existential struggle they feel."
 shandong.402.a: "Maybe we should have revealed this earlier"

 shandong.403.t: "Poor Yields in Shandong"
 shandong.403.d: "Famines have long ravaged the people of China which has caused mass death and still keeps us reliant on grain outside our control. Our overreliance on traditional farming is likely the cause, but trying to move away from it would enrage the farmers who have been using the same tried and true methods for thousands of years. We could always begin to implement new, modern farming techniques from westerners, and run the risk of alienating our supporters who look to us for traditional guidance, or we could devote a sizeable portion of our Red Spears to help the farmers and make sure we do not have a famine."
 shandong.403.a: "Secretly distribute fertiliser"

 shandong.404.t: "Buddhist Priest Juzan Declares Tianran Heresiarch"
 shandong.404.d: "Our Buddhist brethren in Hunan have decided to launch a campaign of slander against us! The teacher Juzan has declared the Yiguandao a heresy, and Tianran a Heresiarch! This denunciation is already causing ripples in the lower rungs of our organisation. Managers are reporting that several wealthy Buddhist donors have stopped appearing at the temple. Buddhist Teachers in training on Taishan have already heard the news, and their indecision has caused several to abandon the Yiguandao. To Zhang Tianran, Teacher Juzan is nothing more than fanatic sectarian, who desires to shatter the Chinese spiritual genealogy and forestall the Maha-Kalpa."
 shandong.404.a: "Send Red Spears to find and burn Juzan's pamphlets"

 shandong.405.t: "Former Honoured Teacher Lu Zhongjie Caught"
 shandong.405.d: "Zhang Tianran may well be the 18th patriarch of the Yiguandao, but the scars from Lu Zhongjie's departure remain. After Lu Zhongjie fled Shandong a second time during the Yiguandao's assault on Jinan, she was spotted infrequently by our Red Spears. After following a tip that the Teacher Juzan spoke to Lu Zhongjie when he published his defamation against us, the Red Spears snuck into Hunan. One of our most loyal minor Emperors has managed to hunt her down and bring her back to us, after all these years. Within the inner circle, a debate rages over how to handle this windfall. To Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen, keeping Lu Zhongjie alive is tempting further dissenters to venerate her as the reincarnated Guan Yin. To the Red Spears and their leader Xue Dian, Lu Zhongjie was so feeble that she poses no threat to them. Xue Dian has insisted that he put Lu Zhongjie under house arrest, and that no harm come to her."
 shandong.405.a: "Imprison but do no harm to her!"
 shandong.405.b: "Ignore Xue Dian, Lu Zhongjie dies!"

 shandong.406.t: "Red Swastika Society Deserts Yiguandao"
 shandong.406.d: "The Red Swastika Society, formerly an ally of the Yiguandao during the Zhang Zongchang regime, has finally cracked and deserted us. This news comes as a surprise to even the Honoured Teacher, whom can scarcely come up with a response to his followers. To Sun Suzhen however, this desertion vindicates her opposition to war posturing, which she claims she had always felt. Sun has taken this opportunity to chastise Zhang Tianran, saying that this was the obvious consequence of trying to balance war with charity. Outside the confines of the Yiguandao inner circle, the minor Emperors and Managers have downplayed this loss. Clearly, they say, the Red Swastika Society been bought out by the American YMCA to slander and defame the Yiguandao."
 shandong.406.a: "The American dollar is to blame"

 shandong.407.t: "Tianran Secretly Meets Tsunesaburo Makiguchi"
 shandong.407.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran makes contact with the Soka Gakkai in Japan. This Buddhist society has been subjected to government oppression for lobbying fellow Buddhists against Japanese intervention in China. Zhang Tianran's letter to Tsunesaburo Makiguchi has been released to the public in both nations, emphasising their common adherence to the Lotus Sutra. It appears that the Japanese public have taken positively to this letter. Our Japanese brethren may yet sway things in a more beneficial way for us."
 shandong.407.a: "Honourable Japanese should be revered"

 shandong.408.t: "Tianran Send Letter to Dao Cai Dao"
 shandong.408.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran has made contact with the leader of the Dao Cao Dai in Vietnam. This group has received messages from the mysterious Cao Dai, a divine Buddhist power they claim unites mankind of all races. Tianran's compassionate letter hopes to establish and formalising ties with our brethren in Vietnam. The Dao Cai Dao's current leader, Pham Cong Tac, has organised a militia not unlike the Red Spears of Shandong to defend their land from German religious absolutism. Though we have had a long rivalry and animosity between Chinese and Vietnamese, we may yet forge greater ties through our shared faith, and thus one another."
 shandong.408.a: "Honourable Yue should be revered"

 shandong.409.t: "Tianran Send Letter To Kim Kyohong"
 shandong.409.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran has made contact with the Daejonggyo in Korea. The Daejonggyo are a noble group of Goshindo who see through Japanese Imperialist lies and strive for an independent Korea. The Daejonggyo are famous for their former leader Na Cheol, whose absolute devotion to the Korean people led to his suicide in 1916 over his failure to liberate Korea and Manchuria. With this outreach, we may be able to further influence the Daejonggyo, and thus we may yet gain support from Daejonggyo nationalists."

 shandong.410.d: "The fog of confusion has lifted from the province of Shandong and one man has emerged: Qu Yingguang. Qu was responsible for alerting the magistrate to Zhang Zongchang's illegal and inexcusable crimes in Shandong, and was appointed Governor in thanks. Governor Qu Yingguang, citing the rebellions that are holding back Shandong, pleads before the Qing government to help restore order. Fears that the province may yet be lost to another upstart warlord, or lost to the KMT, abound. Surely, the Qing would not allow another province to fall away from them?"
 shandong.410.a: "Finally a governor with sense"
 shandong.410.b: "We do not trust a former republican"

 shandong.411.t: "Beijing Promises Protection to Shandong"
 shandong.411.d: "The Beijing delegation has conceded, and has sent a detachment of soldiers to seek out and arrest bandits in Shandong. The soldiers arrived to great fanfare in Jinan, and were deployed by General Qu Yingguang to the towns. It appears that most of the rebels resisting taxation have laid down their arms, and some who did resist are now safely behind bars."
 shandong.411.a: "Finally we can focus internally"

 shandong.412.t: "Beijing rejects Yingguang's pleas"
 shandong.412.d: "The Beijing delegation stands firm, and refuses to send soldiers to Shandong to help a former Republican governor. Lacking the legitimacy to order the rebels to stand down. General Qu Yingguang has decided to call their bluff instead. Some spare soldiers will be sent to intimidate rebels in Shandong, dressed in Qing blues. Let us hope the rebels do not find out the soldiers we send to break them up are not from Beijing."
 shandong.412.a: "We must protect ourselves"

 shandong.413.t: "Exiled Military Leader from Shandong Arrives"
 shandong.413.d: "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and admiral you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to the leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous province of Shandong, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. This general comes with a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."
 shandong.413.a: "We need all the help we can get"
 shandong.413.b: "Nice story, still going to say no"

 shandong.414.t: "Kong Dechang Insults Beijing's Confucian Scholars"
 shandong.414.d: "The young Kong Dechang, the symbol of the Society to Restore Benevolence, has begun making waves with the public. As the inheritor of the Qufu manor legacy, Kong Dechang has been kept abreast of the latest philosophical developments in Confucianism. In this field, Beijing illuminaries like Wu Peifu and Chen Huanzhang have made their own interpretation of the Confucian canon known. What separates Kong Dechang's first publication from others is its rejection of attempts to revive state-enforced piety. While Wu Peifu and Chen Huanzhang have decried their times as impious, Kong Dechang has stated that each individual family in China defines piety through their actions. This rejection of partisanship in the religion he helps represent has upset the intellectuals in Beijing."
 shandong.414.a: "The child is still young, Your grace"

 shandong.415.t: "Yingguang Purchases Noble Titleage for Allies"
 shandong.415.d: "The Duke Yansheng, Marquis of Extended Grace, and other titles of nobility have been purchased by Governor Yingguang during the recent economic decline in Beijing. These are merely symbolic gestures by the bureaucratic entities in Beijing that confer no responsibilities to the owner, but their intended effect remains. This allows allies of Qu Yingguang to regain some of their honour that was deprived from them during the Xinhai Revolution. The landowning nobility of Shandong now have a more legitimate stance within the clique, and can more easily exert influence over the people of Shandong."
 shandong.415.a: "Thank you, your grace"

 shandong.416.t: "Famine in Shandong, Qing Aid Needed"
 shandong.416.d: "This year's yield in Shandong is not turning out as well as predicted. Most likely due to the overuse of land for commercial opium farming during the Zongchang years. Qu Yingguang has been called in to solve the food shortage before it leads to endemic famine. Governor Yingguang's solution is to once again go into the provincial reserve and pay for food imports from Hebei, where the harvests are more plentiful. This burden will be shared with the people through additional taxation."
 shandong.416.a: "We need to save grain from now on"

 shandong.417.t: "Big Swords Defect from Yiguandao, Offer Assistance"
 shandong.417.d: "Big Sword members who had sworn loyalty to Zhang Tianran have returned to Jinan to pledge loyalty to Qu Yingguang. This is because Governor Qu has fulfilled one of their most pressing desires to stem the drug trade in Shandong. However, these Big Sword militiamen are demanding to be treated with the same respect and payment as the trained regulars, which would cause our treasury further woes. How do we respond?"
 shandong.417.a: "We need professionals, not them"
 shandong.417.b: "We need many more to save China"

 shandong.418.t: "Yellow Sands Society Attacks, Captured"
 shandong.418.d: "Out of Henan comes the upstart Yellow Sands Society, with a similar backstory as the Yiguandao. These righteous bandits have been forced from Henan by the government in Beijing, and are repeating the age-old mantra of 'Destroy the Qing Restore the Ming'. This tired phrase has apparently caused a peasant leader to declare himself Chu the Ninth, and lead a charge on Dezhou. Fortunately our guards were well equipped to handle another religious awakening, and have captured Chu the Ninth and destroyed the Yellow Sands Society."
 shandong.418.a: "When will they learn?"

 shandong.419.t: "Yellow Sands Society Returns, Defeated"
 shandong.419.d: "The Boxer Temple in Dezhou has erupted in violence, with Yellow Sands Society rearing their ugly head again. This time one 'Wang the Sixth' has launched a surprise attack on the town, only to be cut down by our guards. The Kong Dechang was consulted for advice on how to prevent further insurrection from the Yellow Sands societies. The young Kong Dechang, after giving it much thought, has suggested that the various temples the Yellow Sands that venerate the Ming be interceded with new government-appointed custodians. To the Kong Dechang, the weary people of Shandong continue to rebel because of the existential threat they feel from the political situation."
 shandong.419.a: "A brilliant idea, young lad!"

### 424 - 423 Patauto Flavour Events

 shandong.424.t: "A State Visit to Fengtian"
 shandong.424.d: "Zhang Zongchang, in a bid to gain support from Zhang Zuolin, decided to visit Shenyang. However, talks never were able to take place as The Dogmeat General as soon as he arrived in Shenyang began drinking and whoring obscenely, topping it all off by arriving 3 hours late to the meeting with Zhang Zuolin completely and utterly out of sorts due to drugs and alcohol. Mocking the Old Marshall for his illiteracy to boot! "
 shandong.424.a: "I'd rather entertain Zhang Xueliang"

 shandong.425.t: "Zhang Zongchang Releases Poetry Book"
 shandong.425.d: "Even Zhang Zhongchang is not immune to the charms and allure of poetry, and thus he has decided to publish a book containing his poetry. This comes several years after his failed Commentaries on the Thirteen Classics. To many readers, the only moral advice the commentary provided was anecdotal lessons on how Confucius approved of polygamy. While the poems might be questionable, the Dogmeat General seems to be quite pleased with himself, cutting down his daily degeneracy."
 shandong.425.a: "Even a dog enjoys a bone or two"

 shandong.426.t: "The Dogmeat General's Second Publication"
 shandong.426.d: "Zhang Zongchang has released his second Commentary on the Thirteen classics, and horribly insults Wu Peifu's writings! Describing Wu Peifu's writings as circumstantial, and in line with the Beijing style of conforming to political interests over absolute morality. The Dogmeat General writes in the Commentary that the works of Mencius tracks well with the current crisis in China, and draws a favourable comparison between the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, and the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang."
 shandong.426.a: "Thankfully Xueliang's father can't read it"

 shandong.427.t: "Sun Dogs or Rain Dogs?"
 shandong.427.d: "Zongchang, reaching new depths of depravity, has decided to take the wife of commander Sun Dianying. Enraged, General Sun has decided to blackmail Zhongchang, threatening to expose this bigamy if he does not promote General Sun. The Dogmeat General is obviously known for his lust and degeneracy, but taking the wife of a trusted subordinate would bring shame to his army. While Zongchang wants to keep this quiet, should he concede, it might weaken his standing to his subordinates."
 shandong.427.a: "Take a seat, Marshall"
 shandong.427.b: "Taxi, I'd rather walk"

 shandong.428.t: "Old King Coal and the Dogmeat General"
 shandong.428.d: "A debacle during the early 1930s has come back to haunt Zhang Zongchang's administration. In those years Zongchang imposed a 40 cent tax on exported coal as a means to profit off of coal operations from Qingdao. this tax, however, was so exorbitantly high that no mining company has ever paid it. Yet still there is mining in Eastern Shandong. A more radical solution has been concocted, which has Zhang Zongchang fund a coal miner syndicate to empower coal miners to fight their bosses. This gamble carries with it a level of agreement with KMT cells in Eastern Shandong to let them excite workers towards syndication. This kind of ideological manipulation, to Zongchang’s staff, feels as if pulled from Yan Xishan's playbook."
 shandong.428.a: "A shade of Xishans's ideas, I see?"

 shandong.429.t: "Brothel Brawl for Business"
 shandong.429.d: "Zhongchang, whether due to being drug addled, or for his own amusement, appointed two men to the same position as Chief of Security. The two men only found out about the other when they both at the same time went to take their new position. Seeking clarification on the issue, they barged into Zhongchang's room, where they found him engaged in depravity as usual. Zhongchang, amused at their confusion, ordered the two men to fight each other for the position, and whoever was on top would claim victory, though he did not rule out a power bottom. The men thus proceeded to tear into each other, much to Zhongchang's and the girl's amusement."
 shandong.429.a: "It seems it was an orgy in more ways than one"

 shandong.430.t: "The Cheapest Medicine"
 shandong.430.d: "The threat of famine has returned to Shandong due to the proliferation of the Opium trade in the province. Due to how much land is currently used for Opium production, people are beginning to tighten their belts. In previous years, petitions to the central government would be made to relive the people. To Zhang Zongchang, this option carries with it too much risk of another warlord discovering his opium plantations. As a result, the Dogmeat General has taken a fatalistic position, and commanded that his soldiers only provide to those whom they feel worthy of food aid."
 shandong.430.a: "The hardest choices require the strongest of wills"

 shandong.431.t: "Sun Dianying Builds Bandit Temples"
 shandong.431.d: "General Sun Dianying's autonomy within the military is great, so much so that his officers act as if Sun Dianying is a clique within the clique. Sun Dianying's soldiers, having looted Taishan of its Yiguandao books, have conceived of a plan to enrich themselves. As Sun Dianying was a leader once of the Temple Road Society in Henan before retreating to Shandong, his men have thought it prudent to recreate the society on Taishan. Atop Taishan, under a mandatory opium haze, Sun Dianying hasbuilt a shrine called The Ninth Heaven. Sun Dianying's soldiers have reportedly begun painting Te and Sheng characters on their faces."
 shandong.431.a: "Hard to escape faith in Shandong"

 shandong.432.t: "The Empress Has No Clothes"
 shandong.432.d: "Sun Dianying has led a group of bandits to rob the grave of Empress Dowager Cixi in Beijing, a shocking development. Under the cover of night, men lead by Sun Dianying opened Cixi's tomb, and removed much of her gold burial treasures. The apex of their debauchery was when they took the jade melon Cixi held in her sarcophagus. While her legacy has been debated between being a ruthless despot who brought about great humiliation, traditionalist still consider her to be a paragon of Chinese society. Looting her grave is a deep insult to Chinese tradition, and the Qing are deeply embarrassed. Unfortunately, Sun Dianying has returned to the frontline, surrounded by guards and safe from bounty hunters and vigilantes."
 shandong.432.a: "That belongs in a museum!"

 shandong.433.t: "The Ming Demeaned Once More"
 shandong.433.d: "Sun Dianying, in his growing lust for gold and booty, has decided to rob the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum grave in Nanjing. Sun Dianying's men again arrived in the night, climbing the tomb's walls before blasting the door open. The Ming Xiaoling Tomb belonging to the Hongwu Emperor, the first Ming. Hongwu who was a Red Turban in a White Lotus Society like the late Zhang Tianran, fuelling Sun Dianying's fury. Sun Dianying made off with treasures of the Hongwu Emperor and his wives, their value being permanently sullied by being arranged next to Cixi's jade melon. The grave has been looted and set ablaze, not since Li Zicheng did so in 1644 when he took Beijing has this happened. It really does seem that there is no honour to restore the Ming, despite what those old slogans have said. The hundreds who, in the past, promised to 'Destroy the Qing, Restore the Ming', are saddened by the desecration."
 shandong.433.a: "Is nothing sacred anymore?"

 shandong.434.t: "A New Headquarters?"
 shandong.434.d: "Our expansion has led us to occupy more and greater territory than just Shandong province. The people of Jinan ache and cry out for the soldiers to depart. While the tax house in Jinan has been burned down by angry mobs every year since his occupation, Nanjing promises a much greater security. While some hardliners wish us to remain in Jinan, as it has served as our capital in successful campaigns, others have suggested we move to Nanjing. The metropolitan people of Nanjing brace for the worst of Zongchang's crew. Bunkers built to survive the siege of Nanjing are currently being filled up with valuable objects in the hope that Zhang Zongchang will not find them."
 shandong.434.a: "Stay in Jinan"
 shandong.434.b: "Move to Nanjing"

 shandong.438.t: "Shangqing Tianguo Declared"
 shandong.438.d: "Governor Zhang Zongchang, known throughout China as the \"Dogmeat General\", is dead. Reports coming out of Jinan allege that Zongchang and his top lieutenant Sun Dianying had attempted to storm the sacred Tai Shan earlier this week, and did not survive the assault. This astounding news comes with proclamations from the new master of Tai Shan, Zhang Tianran, that he now rules Shandong and all its people.\n\nZhang Tianran is a less notable figure to newspapers, but is well known to the refugees of the Eastern China as the benevolent leader of the Yiguandao cult. To the more conservative refugees, this event symbolises something brighter in store for China."
 shandong.438.a: "This will not go well..."

 shandong.439.t: "Unrest in the South"
 shandong.439.d: "In the League of Eight Provinces there are numerous reports of spreading unrest after the sale of the newly built railway to the Germans. If we want to secure a better hold on China we should keep an eye on the events of the South East as we could gain a lot from the collapse of Chuanfang's clique."
 shandong.439.a: "We should keep an eye on this."

 shandong.440.t: "A Heavy Bullet"
 shandong.440.d: "The League Marshal Sun Chuanfang has been shot and is currently in critical condition, after weeks of riots it seems one lucky peasant got to him. What this means for the League is unknown but if chaos ensues we must be prepared to take advantage of this."
 shandong.440.a: "This bullet will change the fate of China."

 shandong.441.t: "The Old Alliance Alive"
 shandong.441.d: "When General Zhang Zongchang presented Zhang Zuolin with a carrying pole at his inauguration, it came with a deep mutual understanding. Zhang Zongchang would not lavish the Marshal with baubles or pleasantries, but would serve as the reliable tool to which Zuolin may achieve victory. This promise made years ago arrives to Zongchang this day. A carrying pole sent by Zhang Zuolin could only mean one thing. The time of great service was approaching, and Zongchang will deliver, whether his honour exists or not."
 shandong.441.a: "This pole will change the fate of China."

 shandong.445.t: "Minor Emperor Xue Dian Deserts With Lu Zhongjie"
 shandong.445.d: "After assuring Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen that Lu Zhongjie was isolated, the Minor Emperor of Shandong has betrayed the Yiguandao. After failing to arrive for daily exercises, Red Spear soldiers discovered Xue Dian missing from his quarters. Panic ensued as the Red Spears scrambled in vain to find Xue Dian. This panic magnified when the old Homored Teacher, Lu Zhongjie, could not be found as well. After Zhang Tianran arrived in a very uncharacteristic fury, he entered Xue Dian's house to ask the spirits for guidance. After several hours, Zhang Tianran emerged from Xue Dian's quarters, and stated that the Minor Emperor was called by a greater power to commit to an immediate and permanent pilgrimage. While the Red Spears soldiers are sated, the dissidents outside of Taishan have easily deduced that Xue Dian and Lu Zhongjie have escaped the cult. To the surprise of many, including Sun Suzhen, Zhang Tianran has not ordered for a manhunt. It appears as if the Honoured Master has accepted a consequence he did not predict."

However, this uneasy cease-fire was never meant to hold, and now local conflicts have arisen with Yiguandao militia and Anqing forces engaging each other.\n\nWith our expedition south into the Five Provinces in direct conflict with [ANQ.GetName]'s regional interests, many close to Zhang Tianran have voiced their opinion that the reasons we have for engaging the League also apply to [ANQ.GetName], that aside perhaps it is best we focus on Nanjing first."
 # Zongchang in charge:
 shandong.447.d2: "Up until now, [ANQ.GetLeader]'s revolt against the Nanjing regime and our own interests in the region have avoided directly confronting each other. However, this uneasy cease-fire was never meant to hold, and now local conflicts have arisen with both Shandong and Anqing forces engaging each other.\n\nWith our expedition south into the Five Provinces in direct conflict with [ANQ.GetName]'s regional interests, many generals have voiced to Zhang Zongchang that [ANQ.GetNameDef] is weak and has little backing among the military.

If we were to let this continue on with this inaction we will be viewed as weak which may very well come back to hurt us later however, a weak display may be exactly what we want if a trap is decided as the plan of action. [SQI.GetLeader] has a choice to make, he favours..."

 shandong.500.d1: "A new era is beginning for China. Little more than a strange yet influential organisation when the League War began, the forces of the Yiguandao brought about hope and redemption to the lands suffering under the corrupt and wicked when they marched upon Nanjing. Now, Zhang Tianran, the 18th patriarch of the Yiguandao, has emerged victor of the League War and rules over China's wealthy eastern provinces. The man wasted no time - in the city of Nanjing, opium was confiscated, dens raided, and criminal foreigners expelled. Aid was also distributed to the suffering and needy by Yiguandao monks, eager to earn goodwill with the populace.\n\nBut though our control has been largely secured over Eastern China, lawlessness remains the norm across too large a portion of the countryside. Uncooperative governors, KMT bandits, warlord remnants - the list of obstacles to integration is quite long. It will take some time to consolidate control over the lands we won in the struggle, but soon the Shangqing Tianguo will elevate China into a new era of righteous morality."
 shandong.500.d2: "A new era was beginning for China, or so KMT radicals and Yiguandao zealots thought as they attempted to impose their dangerous ideologies upon the people. Differentiated from the rest of China's petty rulers primarily by the sheer extent of his corruption and extravagance, the Dogmeat General, Zhang Zongchang, has emerged victor of the League War, now ruling over the country's wealthy eastern provinces. To celebrate this incredible feat, Zhang engaged in a night of drunken enjoyment, complete with a stunning amount of opium and finishing with a tour of Nanjing's fine brothels.\n\nBut though our control has been largely secured over Eastern China, lawlessness remains the norm across too large a portion of the countryside. Uncooperative governors, KMT bandits, religious fanatics - the list of obstacles to integration is quite long. It will take some time to consolidate control over the lands we won in the struggle, but soon we will be able to announce a new League of East Chinese Provinces under the rule of soon-to-be Marshal Zhang Zongchang."

Despite his unassuming means of transport, the Dogmeat General was quick to make his way to Shenyang, and demand a return to Zhang Zuolin's inner circle. Despite his recent defeat, Zhang Zongchang remains a formidable general, widely considered among the most effective in north China. Many would argue that his return presents an unmatched opportunity.\n\nHowever, Zhang was quick to assert his autonomy when he became isolated in Shandong during the Third Zhifeng War. His armies stood aside in 1928, at our moment of greatest need; a betrayal in all but name.\n\nIn truth it was Zhang Zuolin who made Zhang Zongchang; it was his armies that the Dogmeat General led to victory. Now that he depends once again on the Grand Marshal's charity, not to mention his clemency, should either be extended?"
 shandong.501.d_SZC: "Having left Jinan in flames, and Shandong in the throws of violent revolt, Zhang Zongchang has arrived in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] after escaping prison with a band of close associates. Apparently without a home in Fengtian, Zhang is now boldly demanding a place at the head of one of our own armies, and promises a series of swift victories by his hand.\n\nDespite his recent defeats, Zhang Zongchang remains a formidable general, widely considered among the most effective in north China. Many would argue that his return presents an unmatched opportunity. On the other hand, Zhang is known to be violently unpredictable, and ill reputed in most respectable circles."
