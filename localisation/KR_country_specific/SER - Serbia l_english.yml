 SER_treaty_of_wartholz_desc: "Signed by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1919, the Treaty of Wartholz is a punitive agreement that establishes Serbia’s postwar relationship with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It limits the size of the Serbian Army to 35 thousand men, establishes a free trade area between the two states, and requires Serbia to relinquish all claims upon Austrian and Bulgarian territory."

Entire towns were depopulated, the country looted, hundreds of thousands died - and the ordinary Serb believes it was their fault. After all, it was a Serb who shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand and thus sparked the conflict. Though the leaders of Serbia may hold irredentist ambitions, they will need to convince the people that this will not go the same way as last time."

There, he fell under the tutelage of his uncle Prince Pavle - a cultured and easy-going bon vivant who inducted the future King into the lifestyle of British nobility.\n\nRestored to the throne, Petar arrived to an impoverished nation and has been turned into a puppet for the politicking of Živković and Ljotić - and yet, though he may still be young, his nation sees potential in him.

 SER_konspiracija_decisions_desc: "\nKonspiracija (\"Conspiracy\") is a military secret society formed within the Serbian Army in the 1920s, under the guidance of former members of the Black Hand. Its proclaimed goal is the unification of all Serbs and the motto 'Strong Serbian Identity - Strong Serbian Nation'. Its ideological beliefs are all across the political spectrum and so do not hold it back - its members did not hesitate to assassinate King Aleksandar II in 1925 and usher in a more malleable Serbian Republic. Their influence is pervasive in public life, but its wide net of contacts will grant us access to powerful boons if we take advantage of it.\n\nThe Konspiracija and its support is Serbia's primary means of rearmament, and this category grants us access to an array of decisions to improve our military. We have two ways of paying for this rearmament - we can rely on our contacts in the military, which will boost £national_populist_texticon §YNational Populist§! popularity, or we can bypass the military and pay large costs of £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! instead.\n\nCurrent level of §YKonspiracija Control§!: [SER.GetKonspiracijaControl].

 MAC_ivan_mihajlov_leader_desc: "Ivan Mihajlov was born in 1896, to a Bulgarian speaking family in the mountains of Macedonia. A region soon ripped and torn by ethnic tensions and war. Even his life is a good glimpse into rapid-fire changes which the region had to endure. Mihajlov began his studies in a Bulgarian men's high school in Thessaloniki before it was closed by the Greek administration during the First Balkan War. Thus he briefly transferred to a Serbian one in Skopje, before finally finishing his education in Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia. Finally moving on to study law in Sofia. During the Weltkrieg, Mihajlov enlisted in the Bulgarian army, and came into personal contact with IMRO leader Todor Aleksandrov.\n\nAfter the war, Mihajlov became Aleksandrov's personal secretary. The IMRO, having accomplished its goals at last, dissolved. To consolidate their gains, Aleksandrov led Mihajlov and the right-wing faction of the organisation into the "Association Against Serbian Bandits". A paramilitary organisation tasked with eradicating Serbian resistance and paving the way for the Bulgarisation of the Western Provinces. In time, the Association transformed into the Ohrana, an intimidating Macedonian paramilitary and a far-right haven.\n\nIn 1930, injured by a Serbian Chetnik ambush, Aleksandrov retired from an active role in the organisation. His protege Mihajlov assumed his stead. He fully embraced Ohrana's alliance with the National Legions and volunteered for the Fourth Balkan War alongside hundreds of his peers. When the war ended with his home seized by the Serbs yet again, he chose to follow his mentor's footsteps. Alongside his fellow Macedonian veterans and refugees, Mihajlov infiltrated the Serbian-Bulgarian border and proclaimed the restoration of the IMRO. Intent to free Macedonia from the oppressors in Belgrade no matter how much blood is shed along the way."

The more members agree, the stronger the benefits will be."
 SER_economic_council_expansion: "Deepen Economic Ties"
 SER_economic_council_expansion_desc: "Thus far, the economic union is proving to be very beneficial for all its members, and we are in a position to improve it further by enacting new policies suggested by the Economic Council."

### Focuses ###

 SER_Moralistic_Democracy: "Pickaxe to the Future"
 SER_Moralistic_Democracy_desc: "The political ideology of the Serbian Republican Party, built upon the philosophy of Ljubomir Stojanović, calls for a reformist democracy built upon morality and the abolition of privilege, whether it be wealth, nobility or sex. Though aware of the reality of the nation they work in, the Republicans have always seen themselves as 'a pickaxe to the future' for Serbia."

 SER_smoke_filled_room: "National Council for Democracy"
 SER_smoke_filled_room_desc: "Serbian democracy may appear prosperous, but it walks a fine line between prosperity and a military coup. Who's to say that the Konspiracija will not remove us from power much like they removed King Aleksandar? The Nacionalno veće za demokratiju shall serve as a semi-secret party council to search for ways how to stem their influence."

 SER_form_republican_guard: "The Republican Guard"
 SER_form_republican_guard_desc: "To ensure the defence of the Serbian republic and revolutionary ideals, we need to establish an official national guard, made up of patriotic civilians and soldiers. This paramilitary organisation will ensure that the democratic process is protected and will be the first to fight against any coup attempt."

 SER_promote_young_officers: "Promote Young Officers"
 SER_promote_young_officers_desc: "While we cannot fully control the Serbian Army, there are still a few things we can do to whip it in line - and there are plenty of loyal and ideologically complacent lower officers who have no ties to Konspiracija and will be glad to fill up roles vacated by old generals."

 SER_republican_chetniks: "Sway Chetnik Associations"
 SER_republican_chetniks_desc: "The Chetniks, organised into paramilitary associations, have historically been no fans of republicanism or democracy - however, even they can be swayed, attracted by promises of support against the intimidating secret society in the Serbian Army, and thus at least made neutral on the whole affair."

 SER_modernize_local_governance: "Modernise Local Governance"
 SER_modernize_local_governance_desc: "Not everything needs to be decided in Belgrade - we need to hold trust in elected, respected authorities in the regions and local parishes to make decisions relevant for their people. We merely need to modernise this local administrative apparatus and clean it of harmful graft and clientelism."

 SER_combat_corruption: "Combat Public Service Corruption"
 SER_combat_corruption_desc: "Corruption in the public service acts like a friction force in government work - it takes up resources, it makes government operations slow and the government untrustworthy... not to mention that it is simply immoral. Through examination and audits, however, we can catch all of the worst offenders."

 SER_establish_suzor: "Establish SUZOR"
 SER_establish_suzor_desc: "The Central Office for the Insurance of Workers (Središnji ured za osiguranje radnika, SUZOR) was envisioned as an institution for the centralised implementation of social insurance across Serbia - and now it can finally be put into place."

 SER_workplace_democracy: "Promote Workplace Democracy"
 SER_workplace_democracy_desc: "Democracy must be a part of daily life not just in politics, but in the workplace as well - we need to endorse the cause of labour unions and foster the creation of communal, worker-owned businesses, both to rejuvenate the economy and to ensure that the common people get their share."

 SER_progressive_taxation: "Progressive Taxation"
 SER_progressive_taxation_desc: "There is no reason for a lowly worker and a businessman to be taxed the same - the former can barely live on the few dinars he keeps, while the latter still has millions in the bank even after taxes. We need to levy more taxes upon the wealthy, and so enforce a just redistribution of the wealth."

 SER_women_liberation: "Liberation of the Woman"
 SER_women_liberation_desc: "The Constitution of 1926 granted Serbian women the right to vote, but plenty of hurdles still remain before we can consider them to be truly equal with men. We are all humans with equal capabilities, and so we cannot be hamstrung by outdated traditions!"

 SER_strengthen_presidential_powers: "Strengthen Presidential Powers"
 SER_strengthen_presidential_powers_desc: "The Republican Party has historically stood in favour of stronger presidentialism, and the United States of America, with its combination of federal decentralisation and strong executive leadership, has been their inspiration for the form of government of a South Slavic state. Let us pass the legislation to empower the Serbian executive in preparation!"

 SER_class_harmony: "Harmony of the Classes"
 SER_class_harmony_desc: "There is no need for class conflict when we can successfully erase the reasons for this conflict - corruption, injustice and exploitation. In our ideal Serbia, all of these flaws shall be eradicated and a harmonious, liberal democracy created, one which shall last for generations and become a beacon of liberty in the Balkans!"

 SER_montenegro_experiment: "The Montenegrin Experiment"
 SER_montenegro_experiment_desc: "Our idea for South Slavic unity is a democratic federation, styled after the United States. To prove the potency of our political programme, we can start with our lowly Serbia - granting autonomous status for Montenegro and allowing it to prosper with a locally elected legislature. If it succeeds, we can present it to all of Europe as a success story."

 SER_socialist_coalition: "Consolidate the Popular Front"
 SER_socialist_coalition_desc: "From our position in the centre, we have chosen to throw our lot with the left. The Republicans and Socialists share several key stances - our common belief in the prosperity of the common man and in progressive reforms. Let us build a Serbia of the future, together!"

 SER_socialist_establish_suzor: "Socialist SUZOR Insurance"
 SER_socialist_establish_suzor_desc: "The Central Office for the Insurance of Workers (Središnji ured za osiguranje radnika, SUZOR) was envisioned as an institution for the centralised implementation of social insurance across Serbia - and now it can finally be put into place."

 SER_pardon_communist_revolutionaries: "Pardon Communist Revolutionaries"
 SER_pardon_communist_revolutionaries_desc: "The Communists were one of the few who waged an active armed resistance against King Aleksandar II's regime, especially in Montenegro, where Vukašin Marković's guerrillas terrorised the mountains before retreating to Albania. As suspicious as they may be, with the advice of the Socialist coalition partners, we should finally extend pardons to them."
 Popovic_stats_tt: "§RAttack Skill§!: §Y1§!\n§YDefence Skill§!: §Y1§!\n§GPlanning Skill§!: §Y1§!\n§CLogistics Skill§!: §Y1§!"

 SER_national_labor_union_council: "National Trade Union Council"
 SER_national_labor_union_council_desc: "Organised labour must have a say in governance and our socialist allies demand it. We shall establish an official council of trade union representatives which shall provide us advice on all economic legislation and defend the rights of the workers in high government."

 SER_radical_coalition: "Consolidate the Unity Government"
 SER_radical_coalition_desc: "From our position in the centre, we have chosen to throw our lot with the right. The Republicans and Radicals have joined forces to defend the republic from radicals on the left and on the right. While we will have to make a few concessions to the Radicals, it is our policy which shall prevail!"

 SER_serbian_values_coalition: "Foster Serbdom"
 SER_serbian_values_coalition_desc: "The People's Radical Party is staunchly a Serbian party, to the point where some accuse it of fostering the Greater Serbia concept, as opposed to the Yugoslavism prevalent in Serbia. Whether it is true or not, the goal of our coalition is to renew Serbian pride and prepare Serbs for the war to come!"

 SER_further_agricultural_mechanization: "Further Agricultural Mechanisation"
 SER_further_agricultural_mechanization_desc: "The peasantry is the core of the Serbian nation, and we must enrich them to enrich all of Serbia. We need to continue providing them with modern machinery and modernise land ownership in the countryside to increase yearly crop yields."

 SER_free_serbian_economy: "Free the Serbian Economy"
 SER_free_serbian_economy_desc: "Serbia will only be as prosperous as it is open to the world. We must reduce tariffs and make ourselves open to investment from foreign lands, for the good of us and the Serbian people."

 SER_National_Vanguard: "The National People's Vanguard"
 SER_National_Vanguard_desc: "We, the People's Radical Party, have always been the natural party of governance for the Serbs. Our leaders guide us not with false idols imported from the West, but with a native grown, rural democracy, and our members dedicate their lives solely to the Serbian nation. And now, it is time for us to reclaim what is ours."

 SER_attachment_to_the_land: "Attachment to the Land"
 SER_attachment_to_the_land_desc: "You can take the Serb away from his land, but you can never take his attachment to the land away from the Serb. For millennia, the Serbian people prospered in rural village communes, and we need to do everything in our power to make sure this prosperity continues into the future."

 SER_direct_the_economy: "Guide the Economic Process"
 SER_direct_the_economy_desc: "Opposed to the exploitative nature of unregulated capitalism, the Radicals have generally called for reform to support the Serbian worker and farmer in an international environment. Stojadinović's brilliant thought has developed this into a policy of economic corporatism - the integration of Serbian business into state policy and guidance of the economy."

 SER_rural_democracy: "Rural Democracy"
 SER_rural_democracy_desc: "Democracy in Serbia is homegrown, based upon a tradition of rural communalism, rather than imported from the West. We must do everything in our power to allow these democratic roots to foster, and thus imbue the entire nation with trust in their community."

 SER_unite_with_agrarians: "The Sarez"
 SER_unite_with_agrarians_desc: "The People's Radical Party and the Agrarians have worked together ever since the Agrarian Party's inception, our parties share many key tenets and a mutual focus on the peasantry. Let us waste no time and join forces at once, we are stronger together!"

 SER_state_of_national_consolidation: "The State of National Consolidation"
 SER_state_of_national_consolidation_desc: "The geopolitical situation Serbia has found itself in calls for a massive reconsideration of our internal policies. We have to collectively understand that we will only be able to achieve the Yugoslavian dream with a full mobilisation of all of Serbia's assets. A breach of democracy, but a temporary and necessary one."
 SER_new_focuses_unlocked: "New focuses will be unlocked."

 SER_organise_greenshirts: "Organise the Greenshirts"
 SER_organise_greenshirts_desc: "Though they have existed for a few years already, the Greenshirts, Milan Stojadinović's personal armed paramilitary, can only grow stronger, and we can even claim that the needs of the State of National Consolidation require an armed citizenry to pretend that everything checks out."

 SER_party_state: "Build the Party-State"
 SER_party_state_desc: "The People's Radical Party follows a fanatical approach to politics - ever since its foundation, party members swear to dedicate their entire lives to the Party, and their regional headquarters are to be their second home. Pašić doubtlessly sought a merger of the Party and the Serbian state, and we shall complete it, turning the Sarez into an all-encompassing political machine."

 SER_study_legionaries: "Study Legionary Tactics"
 SER_study_legionaries_desc: "The Legionaries in Romania are a new type of movement. They are not merely a dictatorship, they are a movement of national renewal, and push for a far more dynamic approach to politics. The art of mass politics, deeds above worse, and the political spectacle can be a powerful tool if wielded by us - and Stojadinović will be sure to adopt it for the Radicals."

 SER_three_year_plan: "Three Year Plan"
 SER_three_year_plan_desc: "While Stojadinović's original idea called for a six year plan stretching into the 1940s to develop a solid mining-industrial base in Serbia, we simply do not have the time for it. Deadlines will need to be rushed and goals reduced, all with the aim of preparing Serbia for the wars ahead."

 SER_populist_policies: "Pass Populist Policies"
 SER_populist_policies_desc: "We need to gain the trust of the people to remain in power as long as possible. Highly publicised reforms to social security and labour relations, presented as stemming from the people rather than the establishment, will go a long way in earning the trust of the majority."

 SER_mediatization_of_politics: "Mediatisation of Politics"
 SER_mediatization_of_politics_desc: "Times are changing. New technologies such as radio and television threaten to change the way how politics are conducted, forever. We can use this to our advantage. Let every Serbian home hear the President's voice on the radio, let a massive stream of information reach their eyes and ears, and indoctrinate them in who they should support!"

 SER_no_communists: "Class Unity, Not Class Warfare"
 SER_no_communists_desc: "Socialism is incompatible with the needs of Serbia, it calls for a war between classes instead of cooperation in the name of a greater good. We began the Regime of National Consolidation working with their ranks, but those who cannot assimilate into the Sarez will have to be evicted from the council."

 SER_war_against_unemployment: "Wage War Against Unemployment"
 SER_war_against_unemployment_desc: "In preparation for our national reclamation, we must make sure that every Serbian man and woman have their place in society. Everyone needs to work in the name of the state, be it at factories, at farms, or in the military."

 SER_fan_nationalist_fervor: "Fan Nationalist Fervour"
 SER_fan_nationalist_fervor_desc: "For years, our nation has been outcast and regretted their past deeds, but from here on out, it is time for us to rise!\nStojadinović, lead your Serbs! Let them all see that they're not afraid of anyone!"

 SER_the_second_pasic: "Above Pašić, Above Karađorđe!"
 SER_the_second_pasic_desc: "Without Stojadinović, there would be no new Serbia! While we still pay lip service to the SONU, our foolish "allies" have long since learned to fear our might. Under the back of a legion of armed supporters and with the proud support of an enthralled populace, our President is no lesser than Pašić, or Karađorđe, or the great dictators of the day!"

 SER_secret_police: "Court for the Protection of the State"
 SER_secret_police_desc: "The Republicans and the Socialists have chosen to break with the state instead of cooperating with the President - and so, it has become clear that they are full of traitors. In response, we shall establish a Court for the Protection of the State, a supreme unquestioned authority appointed by the President which will ensure that such betrayal will not go unpunished."

 SER_the_final_step: "The Final Step?"
 SER_the_final_step_desc: "The state and society are now at the President's fingertips, and only one thing is left to do - to decide where we shall steer the course of the Serbian ship from here on out. With a controlled, defanged opposition, and an army which has long since learned who the real chief in Belgrade is, nothing can stop us now."
 SER_the_final_step_tt: "§YThe Konspiracija§! will be curtailed and its §YPolitical Power§! loss will be §Ghalved§!."

 SER_retain_the_course_of_history: "Retain the Course of History"
 SER_retain_the_course_of_history_desc: "For decades, the People's Radical Party has fought for democracy and freedom to the Serbian people. We cannot turn away from this heritage now. Even in a Republic, we fight for the people, even in total war, we must champion the light of freedom."

 SER_pasic_cult: "The Pašic Cult"
 SER_pasic_cult_desc: "Nikola Pašić, one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in Serbian history, is a figure worthy of the greatest celebration. Without him and his revolution, there would be no modern Serbia, and we would languish under the tyrant Obrenović dynasty to this day. All of Serbia must remember that."

 SER_land_value_taxation: "Land Value Taxation"
 SER_land_value_taxation_desc: "A proposal from the West offers to ensure equity in the countryside - reform under the basis of land value taxation, levying more taxes from those who own a lot of land and a small fraction from those who own little. To prevent the rise of massive agribusiness, it will be a good start."

 SER_censor_socialist_publications: "Censor Socialist Publications"
 SER_censor_socialist_publications_desc: "Socialism, Syndicalism, Communism, no matter the name, is a plague upon the Earth, defying national struggle in favour of meagre class concerns. Before this scourge weakens the strength of the Serbian polity, we must do everything in our power to keep them silent."

 SER_tripartite_labor_relations_council: "Tripartite Council on Economic Affairs"
 SER_tripartite_labor_relations_council_desc: "To ensure that the government's policy benefits everyone, not just one specific social class, we must establish a tripartite council between the government, the business and the labourers, allowing us to hear out everyone's concerns and make the right decisions in economic affairs."

 SER_republican_coalition: "Maintain the Anti-Socialist Front"
 SER_republican_coalition_desc: "From our position in the centre, we have chosen to throw our lot with the left. The Republicans and Radicals have joined forces to defend the republic from extremes on the left and on the right. While we will have to make a few concessions to the Republicans, it is our policy which shall prevail!"

 SER_venere_revolutions: "Veneration of the Revolution"
 SER_venere_revolutions_desc: "We, the children of the First and the Second Serbian Revolutions, must never forget that it was the drive for freedom which brought us here, and that the freedom is worthy of the greatest protection. Živela Srbija, živela republika!"

 SER_women_liberation_coalition: "Liberation of the Woman"
 SER_women_liberation_coalition_desc: "The Republicans call for the liberation of the sexes, stating that women are no lesser than men when it comes to their capabilities and potential, and so the government should fight deep-rooted beliefs restraining them to traditional roles. While we cannot agree to this assessment, we can certainly make overtures in this field to satisfy our coalition."

 SER_break_up_monopolies_coalition: "Break up Monopolies"
 SER_break_up_monopolies_coalition_desc: "The need for a more just economic system is something the Radicals and Republicans agree upon, and there are many businesses and corporations which do not follow regulations or are controlled by foreign capital. They need to be broken up, key assets must be seized, and a more competitive economy established."

 SER_agrarian_coalition: "The Great Union"
 SER_agrarian_coalition_desc: "For a decade, the urbanite leftists of the Republicans and Socialists have led Serbia - but they could not remain there forever, and at last, we and the Agrarians have returned to restore normalcy. And we have a lot of work to do."

 SER_integrate_royalists: "Integrate Monarchist Parties"
 SER_integrate_royalists_desc: "Despite the victory of the Serbian Revolution, monarchists remain in the Skupština, huddled up in minor Democratic State Party and Buđenje parties - however, they still hold some seats, and they would likely be able to work with us."

 SER_farm_to_city_connections: "Expand Farm-to-City Connections"
 SER_farm_to_city_connections_desc: "A lot of production and efficiency in the countryside are lost because of lacking connections between villages and major cities. With wide-scale public works expanding the road network and repairing the most poorly maintained ones, much of this efficiency can be regained."

 SER_further_agricultural_mechanization_radical: "Further Agricultural Mechanisation"
 SER_further_agricultural_mechanization_radical_desc: "The peasantry is the core of the Serbian nation, and we must enrich them to enrich all of Serbia. We need to continue providing them with modern machinery and modernise land ownership in the countryside to increase yearly crop yields."

 SER_Victory_for_the_People: "Victory for the People"
 SER_Victory_for_the_People_desc: "Against all odds, the Socialist Workers' Party has prevailed in the election of 1936 and gained a popular mandate for sweeping changes to the Serbian political system. Though our enemies are numerous, we shall weather the storm and bring the light of socialism!"

 SER_rule_from_hotel_slavija: "Rule from Hotel Slavija"
 SER_rule_from_hotel_slavija_desc: "The Skupština, filled with reactionaries of various flavours, will undoubtedly oppose our ultimate goal of revolution. Prolonged debates in the legislature may cause our coalition members to change their minds, too. In response, we shall make decisions on major policy in the SRP party conference in advance, and only use the Skupština to enforce them."

 SER_rehabilitate_centrumasi: "Rehabilitate the Centrumaši"
 SER_rehabilitate_centrumasi_desc: "In the early 1920s, we broke with the moderate wing of the party, the Centrumaši, who went on to form the Socialist Party. Now that tensions between us have eased somewhat, let us propose a restoration of the united SRP and regain our lost members!"

 SER_sway_radical_republicans: "Sway Radical Republicans"
 SER_sway_radical_republicans_desc: "The Republican Party is divided among many ideological currents, and the radicals among them are fairly left-wing, albeit not openly socialist. Let us sway them to our ranks and further build our power share."

 SER_integrate_nationalist_rhetoric: "Integrate Nationalist Rhetoric"
 SER_integrate_nationalist_rhetoric_desc: "As internationalist as we may be, Serbia's political situation requires us to appeal to patriotic feelings. Let us spread rhetoric that we shall defend the interests of the Serbian nation and restore its lost territories, just with a socialist bent - and win over necessary support."

 SER_legacy_of_svetozar_markovic: "The Legacy of Svetozar Markovic"
 SER_legacy_of_svetozar_markovic_desc: "Called the Serbian Nikolay Dobrolyubov, Svetozar Marković was the first true socialist philosopher in the Balkans, with a programme of social change that resonated with many in his time. As some say, all of us in Serbia who are democrats or socialists learned the political ABC's from Marković. If we remind the people that we truly stand for his legacy, they will give us a second chance to prove ourselves."

 SER_practical_action_programme: "Prakticni Akcioni Program"
 SER_practical_action_programme_desc: "While our ultimate goal is an inevitable revolution, we have a programme of Practical Action which details what social reforms we will accomplish immediately upon taking power, before the critical mass for a revolution is achieved. It is about time we began implementing it."

 SER_health_insurance: "Nationwide SUZOR Coverage"
 SER_health_insurance_desc: "The Republicans and Socialists have been mulling over proposals of healthcare coverage already, but we will not be satisfied with their half-measures. We shall ensure that everyone in Serbia has a right to free and affordable healthcare!"

 SER_democratize_courts_bureaucracy: "Democratise the Courts and Bureaucracy"
 SER_democratize_courts_bureaucracy_desc: "Court and bureaucratic appointments are rife with corruption and clientelism, and they do not represent the interests of the people. Our Programme calls for the democratisation of these appointments, and so we shall make as many positions as we can electable."

 SER_renew_the_avantgarde: "Renew the Serbian Avant-Garde"
 SER_renew_the_avantgarde_desc: "Started by the Serbian Revolution, the Avant-garde in Serbia has begun to wane - many of their writers and poets are ardent socialists, however, and so we can gain a lot if we rejuvenate the movement, and ensure that it lasts for long."

 SER_consolidate_taxation: "Consolidate the Taxation System"
 SER_consolidate_taxation_desc: "Various taxations, levies and other financial burdens have been laid upon the Serbian poor, all seeking to take advantage of their situation and collect more taxation from the poor rather than the rich. We shall curb these excesses, abolish unnecessary taxes, and create one progressive income tax instead - which will yield more revenue and tax the rich more harshly."

 SER_state_appropriations: "State Appropriations"
 SER_state_appropriations_desc: "We need to dismantle monopolies and appropriate companies which violate laws and regulations - which, as we are responsible for the laws and regulations, can mean a lot of people. These industries shall be nationalised and put under much better management - one for the workers, not for exploitation."

 SER_young_guard_clique: "Foster the Young Guard Clique"
 SER_young_guard_clique_desc: "There are many junior officers within the Serbian Army who do not approve of the reaction of their superiors - and while they may not necessarily be socialists, they could work with us as long as we discreetly support them. Let us get a clique of loyal men in the Serbian Army, for when the times call for it!"

 SER_escalate_class_warfare: "Escalate the Class War"
 SER_escalate_class_warfare_desc: "We should not rest when the bourgeois, reactionaries and Codreanites still control the Serbian state from the shadows! We need to out traitors, threaten traitors, and arrest traitors, one after another! Keep the allegations sensible for now, however - when we take power, we can root out the rot completely."

 SER_Third_Revolution: "The Third Revolution"

 SER_syndicalist_example: "Follow the Syndicalist Example"
 SER_syndicalist_example_desc: "The Western Syndicalists have established a form of sustainable socialism which we will easily be able to adopt for use in the Balkans.

 SER_unified_trade_union_desc: "Divided between various trades, the workers of Serbia will be unable to defend their rights and organise.

 SER_ideological_indoctrination_desc: "A socialist society can hardly survive when there are so many people who still do not believe in its ideas.

There is so much that schools, propaganda, and arrests can achieve."

 SER_ozna: "OZNA"
 SER_ozna_desc: "The defence of the revolution requires an organised response, which the Department for People's Protection will be able to provide.

 SER_hunt_the_escapades_desc: "We couldn't catch every reactionary during the Revolution - those who escaped our grasp have crossed the border and ended up in exile, where they plot our downfall and criticise our government.

 SER_rehabilitate_officers_desc: "Not all the officers in the Konspiracija were devout republicans, some jumped ship when they realised a Royalist restoration is imminent, and should be awarded greatly.

 SER_monarchist_coalition_desc: "Not all the politicians in the Republican interregnum were traitors.

 SER_national_regeneration: "National Regeneration"

 SER_integrate_radicals: "Sway the Radical Nationalists"
 SER_integrate_radicals_desc: "The radical monarchist wing are surely our greatest enemies - however, there are those among their ranks who simply wish for a revival of Serbian culture and nationality, though with violent means.

 SER_untangle_corporatism_desc: "In their few years of rule, the Radical Peasants' Democracy created a system of clientelism and corruption, fostering connections with the Serbian elite in order to gain their favour.

 SER_women_liberation_petar: "Progress of the Sexes"
 SER_women_liberation_petar_desc: "The Republican Constitution of 1926 granted Serbian women the right to vote, and the constitutionalist Kingdom has kept it, but plenty of hurdles still remain before we can consider them to be truly equal with men. We are all humans with equal capabilities, and so we cannot be hamstrung by outdated traditions!"

 SER_radical_party_petar: "The Immortal Radical Party"
 SER_radical_party_petar_desc: "A mere coup and a dictatorship cannot kill the People's Radical Party! We have once again endured suppression and our party members defecting to the SRSD, but we have survived and shall return to our role as the natural party of government of the Serbs."

 SER_integrate_white_hand: "Pardon the White Hand"
 SER_integrate_white_hand_desc: "The White Hand may have taken over Serbia in a bloody coup, but they are still Serbian patriots.

 SER_Rural_Credit_Banks: "Rural Credit Banks"
 SER_Rural_Credit_Banks_desc: "Simply put, credit is lacking in rural areas, often concentrated in urban areas instead.

 SER_Continue_The_Mechanisation_Efforts: "Regional Tractor Stations"
 SER_Continue_The_Mechanisation_Efforts_desc: "In the modern day and age, hand tools and ploughs are being replaced by tractors and machines.

 SER_Immunization_Literacy: "Immunisations and Literacy"
 SER_Immunization_Literacy_desc: "Despite decades of rural education funding, the inhabitants of the Serbian countryside remain largely illiterate, nor are they provided with basic healthcare and livelihood.

 SER_Overhaul_Narrow_Gauge_Railways_desc: "Because of Serbia's geography, the nation has many lines using a narrow-gauge to limit expenses and traverse rough terrain with more ease. However, these lines have seen better days and were often built under lower standards and could use a general overhaul to improve their capacity and quality.

 SER_Restore_Paracin_Textile_desc: "The town of Paraćin was one of the main industrial centres of pre-Weltkrieg Serbia, owing to its strategic location on the region's crossroads, and built up a strong woolmaking and textile industry.

 SER_YUG_chromium_morava_desc: "The Jelica Mountain near Kraljevo, in Serbian Morava, hosts large deposits of chromium, but they were inaccessible with the outdated equipment of Serbian mining companies of the past.

### Intro Screen ###
 SER_country_intro_header: "The Serbian Republic"
 SER_country_intro_content: "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, was the catalyst which caused the beginning of the Weltkrieg. Though Serbian forces fought valiantly and earned the world's respect by stalling the Central Powers advance for months, by late 1915 the entirety of the country ended up occupied. Divided into Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian occupation zones, Serbia was exploited and burned, its adversaries seeking to enact revenge upon what they saw as a barbaric regime. This only emboldened resistance in the territory, however, and things on both sides of the front changed by 1918. Austria-Hungary, pressured by its German allies, finally began peace talks, while the Serbian resistance in Corfu, seeing the pitiful state of the Entente, came to the conclusion that even a bitter peace is better than annexation. King Petar abdicated and his son took the throne as Aleksandar II, who signed the punitive Treaty of Wartholz in 1919 - it restored a rump Serbia in the Austro-Hungarian occupation zone, forever tied to the Austrian sphere of influence.\n\nAn emboldened socialist movement in Belgrade, inspired by the Russian and French revolutions, and the opposition of the People's Radical Party got Aleksandar II to respond harshly. Political life was suspended, the socialist movement banned, and a Royal Dictatorship ushered in to maintain order in the defeated nation. This act only inflamed tensions in the country by the end, however, and it boiled over to revolution in 1925. The military, organised into the Konspiracija secret society, made an act of defiance against their King and orchestrated an assassination of Aleksandar II on December 3rd, which led the Royal Dictatorship to its collapse. Prime Minister Vojislav Veljković, surrendered to the opposition, which proclaimed a Serbian Republic.\n\nAfter a brief diplomatic standoff, the provisional government of Ljubomir Stojanović recognised the Treaty of Wartholz, and Vienna recognised the Republican government in turn. Today, Serbia stands as a burning symbol of democracy in the Balkans - at least on the surface. In truth, however, while the government may proclaim heartwarming goals like peace, welfare and prosperity, nothing in the Serbian government happens without the approval of the Konspiracija. This military secret society, deliberately styled after the Black Hand, seeks one thing and one thing only - the liberation of all Serbs outside of the Republic's borders. Again in the shadows, another conspiracy lurks as well - the White Hand, led by Petar Živković, which waits for a chance to overthrow the Republican interregnum and restore the underage son of Aleksandar II.\n\nAs 1936 begins, Serbia is still, nominally, a client state of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but this grip grows looser by the second, and once it finally falls, all of Serbia's enemies may tremble."

### Events ###
 serbia.1.t: "Black Monday Hits Serbia!"
 serbia.1.d: "Serbia was devastated by the Weltkrieg more than any other nation. It lost a quarter of its population and the entire nation was left plundered, half of it was annexed by Bulgaria while the rest had to accept massive concessions to the Austrian Empire. And yet, despite it all, Serbia endured, slowly rebuilding a stable, if weakened economy based around agricultural production and free trade. The reforms by King Aleksandar II's Prime Minister, Vojislav Veljković, were not undone by the Republican government, and so the stable Serbian dinar he fought for remained throughout the 1930s.\n\nThe collapse of the Berlin stock market has undone most of that work. Though Serbia is not as tied to the German economy as other countries in the region, the collapse of worldwide trade has tanked our agricultural exports and so left much of the economy in a void. A package of response measures and reforms is already being prepared, but the populace, hit straight in the pocket, no longer holds as much trust in the Republican Party. After all, they should have prevented this..."
 serbia.1.a: "This is a disaster!"

 serbia.2.t: "The Serbian Elections of 1936"
 serbia.2.d: "The term of the second President of the Serbian Republic, Dragomir Vasić, is coming to a close, and on the fifth of October, new elections will be held to the Serbian Skupština.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of 1926, the Skupština is a unicameral legislature elected by all male and female citizens of the Serbian Republic in free, universal, secret ballot for a five year term. The government structure of Serbia is semi-presidential - the President is elected by the legislature, much like the Prime Minister, but has considerable power in domestic policy and the appointment of public officials, alongside the usual duties of representation of the state in foreign affairs. While the Prime Minister is dependant on the backing of the Skupština, the President serves a predetermined five year term no matter what is taking place in the legislature. That is not to say that he is all-powerful, however, and he needs parliamentary support for pretty much all appointments and legislation.\n\nThe electoral campaign in Serbia began late last year and continues into 1936. As the world veers closer to war, and so do the Balkans, the force which wins this election may get to decide the fate of the country for ages to come."
 serbia.2.a: "May the strongest party win!"

 serbia.3.t: "The Vidovdan Speech"
 serbia.3.d: "The Day of St. Vitus, or Vidovdan in the Serbian language, is considered to be the most important date in the national identity of Serbia. It is at this day in 1389 that the medieval Kingdom of Serbia defended its independence against the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Kosovo, an event which forged the national myth of the Serbian people for centuries to come. Ever since 1918, however, the commemoration of the day has been silent and modest. It was the day when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, an act many Serbs still cannot live past, for it has brought them so much destruction and loss. During the reign of Aleksandar II, a small monument was erected in Gazimestan to honour those who fell in the battle, but the observations there remained small.\n\n1936 was different. President Dragomir Vasić himself attended the observations in Gazimestan, drawing large masses of Serbs to visit the monument for the first time. There, to thousands of his countrymen, he made a speech - and the language was shocking. For the first time since the end of the Weltkrieg, the leader of Serbia declared that what they all experienced twenty years ago was a national humiliation - it robbed Serbia of its ancestral lands and people in Niš and Macedonia, and Serbia must not rest until it finds a way to return them to Belgrade's fold. The heroes and martyrs commemorated during Vidovdan fought for a free and united Serbia, after all, and the only way to honour their memory is to overthrow the shackles holding Serbia back today.\n\nThe speech was met with applause and patriotic chants. While Vasić's political opponents may denounce this as electoral pandering, everyone can tell that this marks a sharp turn in the history of Serbia - that it will no longer abide by the Treaty of Wartholz, and forge an independent destiny instead."
 serbia.3.a: "Živela Srbija! Živela republika!"

 serbia.4.t: "Emboldened Socialist Movement"
 serbia.4.d: "The ongoing economic crisis has dealt a serious blow to the mining industries in Montenegro and manufacturing in Belgrade, and the workers there are understandably unhappy. This creates a potent radicalised mass for the radicals on the left to take advantage of and build their support with - the Socialist Workers' Party and its call of labour empowerment is attractive to the average Jovan out on the street. They compete for this niche with the Socialist Party of Serbia, however - a reformist breakaway from the SRP composed of its moderate wing, which generally serves as the mediator between the Republicans and the Socialist Workers. Though still inherently socialist, they state that the material conditions in Serbia are not fit for a revolution and that socialism can instead be achieved through the parliamentary process. To which side will this mass bend to?"
 serbia.4.a: "Workers support a worker party. It ain't rocket science."
 serbia.4.b: "Maybe the unemployed can be directed to the moderates?"

 serbia.5.t: "Offer from the Konspiracija"
 serbia.5.d: "The Konspiracija has been observing the election of 1936 from the shadows and the growth of the socialist movement in Serbia has left them concerned. There is no threat of a revolution, at least not yet, and the moderate faction of the SRP is firmly under the secret society's control, but they nevertheless present an unexpected factor in Serbian politics. And when the restoration of Greater Serbia is on the line, the thing which Konspiracija wants the most is no unwanted surprises. So, the military offers to provide its support to the Republican Party and start a secret intimidation campaign among the Socialist ranks. By pressuring some of their most vocal figures to shut their mouths and fall in line, the party will surely lose steam quickly."
 serbia.5.a: "Do it."
 serbia.5.b: "It's too risky..."

 serbia.6.t: "Greenshirts"
 serbia.6.d: "The People's Radical Party, hoping to mobilise more support for their electoral campaign, have begun to form uniformed paramilitary organisations to serve as the Party's arm in the countryside. These organisations, named the Greenshirts after their uniforms, are the idea of Milan Stojadinović, the leader of the party - and are very clearly inspired by the success of the Iron Guard next door. Though it may seem odd for a liberal, democratic party to copy the policies of a radical National Populist movement, it is also not illegal. Dragomir Vasić and the Serbian Republican Party now have to make a decision on how to respond to the Radicals' militarisation."
 serbia.6.a: "Find a way to curtail their activity"
 serbia.6.b: "Fire must be fought by fire. Our own paramilitary!"

 serbia.7.t: "Destitution in the Countryside"
 serbia.7.d: "Three fourths of the Serbian adult population are engaged in agriculture, and the absolute majority of them are subsistence farmers, only barely growing enough food to support themselves and their family. The economic crisis has thus impacted these farmers severely. Many racked up debts in the months following the stock market crash and have lost their homes as a result, while others struggle to support themselves with the little land they have. This has made agrarian issues an important talking point in the election, and several parties have been isolated as the front-runners in the valuable farmer voting bloc. The Agrarian Party, run by Milan Gavrilović and Jovan Jovanović-Pižon have traditionally represented farming interests, but have yet to escape from the opposition. The Republicans have traditionally been an urban-centred party, but many of their members have been building support blocs in the rural Užice and Montenegro regions throughout the past decade. And finally, the Socialist Workers with their programme of radical land redistribution cannot wait to take advantage of the crisis..."
 serbia.7.a: "Milan Gavrilović has always fought for the farmer."
 serbia.7.b: "The Republicans will find a solution."
 serbia.7.c: "The spectre of socialism is alluring..."

 serbia.8.t: "Republican Election Strategy"
 serbia.8.d: "Originally founded as the Republican Democratic Party, the Republicans consider themselves to be the successors to the Independent Radicals of the pre-Weltkrieg era, its left wing, republican-sympathetic faction in particular. It was founded by Ljubomir Stojanović and Jaša Prodanović in 1920 and instantly moved into opposition to Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship. Being the most vocal democratic faction in opposition to the King, it swiftly built up support and championed the Republican revolution. In the Serbian republic, it is the more left-wing of the two main establishment parties, the other being the People's Radical Party.\n\nInto the election of 1936, the Republicans go in with everything to lose - they have been in power for the past ten years, under presidents Prodanović and Vasić, and now face opposition from the left and the right. If they seek to remain in power, they need to prevent the centre from collapsing and ensure that neither the Radicals nor the Socialist Workers are able to muster a majority without them. What shall be their strategy in this election?"
 serbia.8.a: "Stay the course, remain calm, and thus maintain the voter base."
 serbia.8.b: "Attack the Radicals, weaken the right."
 serbia.8.c: "Attack the Socialists, weaken the left."

 serbia.9.t: "Radical Election Strategy"
 serbia.9.d: "The People's Radical Party is one of the oldest political parties in Serbia, founded as a liberal reformist party in 1881. It defined Serbian politics before the Weltkrieg, dominating the political scene under Prime Ministers Sava Grujić and Nikola Pašić and championing moderate reform. It had a falling out with the monarchy immediately after the war ended, however, as King Aleksandar II's personal distaste for Pašić led to his dismissal, the party moving to the opposition, and finally to the underground. It reluctantly supported the Republican Revolution of 1925 and stands as the more right-wing of the two main establishment parties in Serbia.\n\nThe Radicals, led by Milan Stojadinović, are in a comfortable position. While the left is infighting, the right is largely united, as the Radicals and Agrarians have a lot of shared ground, while minor parties like the Democratic State Party and Ljotić's royalist radicals are nothing to worry about. Should this stable powerful right be maintained, only the Radicals may be able to form a government once the election concludes. What shall be their strategy in this election?"
 serbia.9.a: "Keep calm, carry on, and build a power base."
 serbia.9.b: "Support the Agrarians, we will need their backing."
 serbia.9.c: "Go on the offensive and attack both opponents."

 serbia.10.d: "The Socialist Workers' Party was founded in 1919 as a merger of the Social Democratic Party of Serbia, Serbian trade union organisations, and Montenegrin socialists, and its ideology has since been left a syncretic mix of all ideologies to the left of the establishment. Syndicalists, Marxist socialists, social democrats and agrarian socialists all found a home in this party. It was banned by the Obznana during Aleksandar II's regime, but continued operating in the underground, supported the Republican revolution and joined parliamentary politics as the leftmost legal party in the Skupština.\n\nThe Socialist Workers' Party has to fight an uphill battle in the election. Even if they can harness enough anti-establishment rhetoric to achieve a plurality, they always have to worry about the possibility of an anti-socialist grand coalition between the Republicans and Radicals. Therefore, their goal is not just to grow their own support, but to ensure that their allies on the left can outweigh the rightists. What shall be their strategy in this election?"
 serbia.10.a: "The Vanguard Party needs more support!"
 serbia.10.b: "Send feelers for a left-wing popular front."
 serbia.10.c: "Attack the right, don't let them grow too strong."

 serbia.11.t: "The Election of 1936"
 serbia.11.d: "Almost a year of campaigning and politicking has passed, and now the final step remains. Polling stations have been established across the country and the votes are cast to determine the victor of the election. The votes have been counted with little more than a few hitches, and they reveal that the results in the new Skupština will be that..."
 serbia.11.a: "The Republicans win a majority!"

 serbia.11.j: "The Radicals lead an anti-socialist front!"

 serbia.12.t: "Unrest among the Chetniks"
 serbia.12.d: "The Serbian Chetniks recount history starting with the liberation struggle against the Ottoman Empire, where they served as auxiliary partisan forces in the Balkans to support the regular Serbian Army. After the Weltkrieg, the Treaty of Wartholz ordered all armed Chetnik associations to be dissolved, but the veterans of the partisan struggle remained and initially stood in favour of King Aleksandar II and his regime. By 1925, however, only the hardcore Royalists among their ranks chose to resist the fall of the monarchy, leaving the first few months of the Republic somewhat unstable - whereas many stood down and accepted the change in regime if it means that the dream of Greater Serbia can continue. Chetnik associations have since been reestablished and began to rearm themselves, but their loyalty to republicanism is still questioned.\n\nThe recent rise of the Socialist Workers' Party has left the "loyalist" Chetniks far more than worried, however. While they can begrudgingly tolerate a republic, a possible socialist regime is completely intolerable - and so, Chetnik voivodes such as Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin have reached out to the government, demanding something to be done - or else they will take matters to their own hands. The threat of monarchist sympathies among the Chetniks has remained ever since the Revolution, so it cannot simply be ignored - and chances are that no matter what we will do, large sections of the military will no longer trust us..."
 serbia.12.a: "Stojadinović is promising - the Chetniks back him."
 serbia.12.b: "The Konspiracija will prevent socialism."
 serbia.12.c: "They are a threat. Start pressuring the Chetniks."

 serbia.13.t: "Coup Attempt!"
 serbia.13.d: "A mere few days after the election concluded, the streets of Belgrade have begun to buzz with activity. Not only were the rumours of royalist sympathisers organising a putsch against the socialist-influenced government true, but the situation is even worse than initially believed. The White Hand, led by the former commander of the Royal Guard Petar Živković, has been playing the strings from the shadows - this military clique, loyal to the House of Karađorđević, played a pivotal role in Aleksandar's Royal Dictatorship and never quite dissolved, only moving to the underground to foster their resistance.\n\nBelgrade awoke to the sound of gunfire as a royalist brigade marched in, locking down the city and surrounding the Skupština, taking [SER.GetLeader] and the members of the legislature hostage. Petar Živković gave his two demands; ending the exile of the House of Karađorđević and the appointment of him as Prime Minister. Technically, Živković isn't demanding for anything more, but logically he will strong-arm the restoration of the monarchy within days, unceremoniously ousting the republic. Members of the legislature were able to put out a telegram request for military assistance before the phone-lines were cut, but it's unknown whether it was actually received.\n\nHere, the members of the Skupština have two options to choose from. Either they can hope that the rest of the Serbian Army is behind them, or take to the streets to rally the people into a popular guard which will resist the putsch."
 serbia.13.a: "Rally the people to resist the coup!"
 serbia.13.b: "Rely on the Army to save us!"
 SER_will_people_support_tooltip: "The result will depend on whether the royalist Chetniks have made any alliances with civilian politicians..."
 SER_will_army_support_tooltip: "The result will depend on whether the royalist Chetniks have gained influence in the military..."

 serbia.14.t: "The Fall of the Republic"
 serbia.14.d: "The Republic made one last attempted stand, and yet died with a whimper. No help came for the surrounded Skupština and all the parties eventually surrendered - except for the joint Socialist parties, whose representatives were arrested by troops commanded by Petar Živković - who has received the title of Prime Minister as well as the rank of General. The Constitution of 1926 has been suspended and is effectively meaningless, and Živković has declared that the Kingdom of Serbia is once again reborn.\n\nThe heir to the Serbian throne, Prince Petar Karađorđević, the only son of Aleksandar II, has spent his entire life in Canada, living under the tutelage of his uncle Prince Pavle. As soon as the news of the Karađorđević Restoration arrived, however, the 13 year old boy began his journey back to his homeland - and an anxious Serbia awaits him."
 serbia.14.a: "Long live the Kingdom!"

 serbia.15.t: "The Republic Endures"
 serbia.15.d: "Živković's coup collapsed within hours. The soldiers rallied to the side of the White Hand faced off against reinforcements - and fearing that the Republicans will only be able to rally more support as time passes, most of them stood down after brief skirmishes. Petar Živković and the royalist officers commanding the conspiracy have all been seized and arrested. For their conspiracy to overturn the Constitution and destroy the democratic republic, all of them received harsh prison sentences, and the White Hand conspiracy has dissolved for good. The threat of royalist resistance has finally ceased."
 serbia.15.a: "Thus unto all traitors."

 serbia.16.t: "Serbian Resistance in Niš"
 serbia.16.d: "The Nis region, which has so far remained staunchly Serbian despite two decades of Bulgarisation, is growing heated. Underground resistance by Serbian militants has spilled over into several clashes across the mountains and forests, claiming the lives of Bulgarian soldiers occupying the region. It's pretty clear that this unrest has been instigated from Belgrade - the revanchist government in charge there cannot wait to seize Niš from our hands once and for all."
 serbia.16.a: "Damn Serbs..."

 serbia.17.t: "The Return of the King"
 serbia.17.d: "The thirteen year old heir to the throne, Prince Petar Karađorđević, has arrived to Belgrade airport by plane, with a small entourage composed of diehard Royalists and his uncle Prince Pavle. Here, they were met by Petar Živković, the Serbian Army, and thousands of civilians wishing to witness their new monarch. After a brief car tour across the city, the entourage arrived to St. Michael's Cathedral, much like his grandfather and namesake had done so three decades ago, and to symbolise the end of a brief Republican interlude, a coronation ceremony was held, where the teenager was dressed in Serbian royal regalia, crowned and anointed as the new King of Serbia, Petar II.\n\nDue to his young age, a Regency will have to be established, and while Živković is sure to lead it, he will require the support of sympathetic politicians from the former Republic to remain in power, as few of them as there are. The King himself, however, does not seem to be that satisfied with the change of affairs. Though he understands the duty of kinghood bestowed upon him, the poverty and gloom of his new kingdom is a jarring change from Canada, where he's spent his entire life. Still, however, though he may reign, he does not rule, and so his opinion matters little."
 serbia.17.a: "Long live the King!"

 serbia.18.t: "The Assassination of Jaša Prodanović"
 serbia.18.d: "The first President of the Serbian Republic and one of the most venerated statesmen from the Republican Party, Jakov "Jaša" Prodanović, has been assassinated today. The sudden, despicable act took place in the politician's home in Belgrade, which several armed agents suddenly forced themselves into and executed their victim without remorse - it was reported by the politician's son Borislav, who happened to come by to visit a few hours later.\n\nElected in 1926, Prodanović consolidated the gains of the Republican Revolution and pursued vast reform in order to establish what he perceived as a compassionate, democratic nation. His career, both in political and literary affairs, preceded him for decades before the Revolution too, and he had served in ministerial positions as early as before the Weltkrieg. However, staunchly opposed to militarism and authoritarianism, he came into conflict with the Konspiracija secret society and so ultimately chose to not seek reelection - because of this, and his later support for anti-Konspiracija endeavours, rumours are abound that it was they who signed off his life.\n\nThe officers and generals in their lodges and circles understandably feel threatened - as omnipotent as their control over Serbia may feel sometimes, their network has always been fragile, and now that we have chosen to resist their influence openly, they have given us a warning. A line they have drawn in the sand, with Prodanović's blood:\n\nIf you take any step further, others will suffer the same.\n\nOr perhaps that's only what they want us to think..? The investigation into the assassination begins - and before the military kills it, we may have a once in a lifetime opportunity to cut off the sword of Damocles above us."
 serbia.18.a: "Understood."

 serbia.19.t: "Clipping the Wings of the Hawk"
 serbia.19.d: "Locked away in their lodges and secret discussion groups, the Konspiracija and the rest of the Serbian militarist lobby probably assumed that the whims of the civilian government are little to worry about. They owe their republic to the efforts of the nationalist-minded conspiracy, and they would not dare to make any more than a show of force against them. They ended up paying for their overconfidence.\n\nWith each passing day, more and more evidence of the Army's hand in the assassination of Prodanović came to light, all of which, coupled with some clever propaganda and opinion swaying here and there, turned the population against the military. The nation united itself in a cry for justice, not just for Prodanović, but also for hundreds of others who have been disappeared, executed or crippled by the iron hand of the military.\n\nThis was no longer 1903 and a revenge coup d'etat would not work. Hence, the Konspiracija accepted its defeat. One by the other, resignations came from the army and from the bureaucracy, of officers and politicians who have been revealed to be complicit in the conspiracy, and see no other option but to step away. While it might only be a temporary victory, it is the first real one achieved against the Konspiracija."

 serbia.20.t: "Fading Democracy"
 serbia.20.d1: "Whether through a calculated move or as an act of unprecedented boldness, the democratically elected government of Serbia chose to make a stand against their benefactors, openly accusing the Serbian Army and its secret cliques of having murdered the former President. The motivations behind this turn, no matter what they were, matter little today, as their results have been disastrous. Sensing that the civilian government is making the accusation from fragile grounds, the Konspiracija has retaliated, mobilising everything at their disposal.\n\nThe coalition in the Skupština has fractured as more and more deputies voice their concern with the President's "treasonous" policy. One by another, publications and newspaper articles show up blasting the government of having mishandled the investigation into Prodanović's death and searching for imaginary enemies to recuperate. Even the son of the killed President has shown his face, standing in favour of the military and its goals. The investigation has receded, and soon, the courts hastily declared that the former President was shot by a lone Royalist fanatic.\n\nNo longer can the President and his ministers walk safely in night, knowing that they might be next on the secret society's kill list. Their last chance to blunt the fangs of "the second Black Hand" have failed, and now, they can only cope in silence, hoping that they can survive and wait the military's radicalism out."
 serbia.20.d2: "Several months have passed, and little action is seen from the government or the law enforcement. Is it fear, knowing that if they poke too deep and accuse someone too powerful of having committed the murder? Or is it a secret acceptance that the Konspiracija have grown too powerful for anyone to control? The investigation has receded, and soon, the courts hastily declared that the former President was shot by a lone Royalist fanatic.\n\nNo longer can the President and his ministers walk safely in night, knowing that they might be next on the secret society's kill list. Their last chance to blunt the fangs of "the second Black Hand" have failed, and now, they can only cope in silence, hoping that they can survive and wait the military's radicalism out."

The term of the current assembly has expired and the time has come to elect a new one - which shall elect a new President and a cabinet of Ministers to govern the country for the next five years. While there are numerous parties beginning their campaigns, only two stand a chance at gaining enough seats to form a new government. Which one shall prevail?"

 serbia.22.d: "While Bulgaria has been reeling from the loss of its rightful lands across the Balkans, Macedonian refugees on our soil have been plotting their next move and getting ready to spring to action. A leading role in this movement has been assumed by Ivan Mihajlov, a Macedonian war veteran, reserve officer and law professor in Sofia, who served as an aide to the legendary leader of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, Todor Aleksandrov.\n\nToday, our law enforcement authorities report that Mihajlov and several dozens of Macedonian veterans have vanished, and rumours tell that they have secretly crossed the Serbian-Bulgarian border. And it appears that they crossed it well prepared, with weaponry and supplies to boot."

An ultranationalist, revolutionary terror group, the IMRO long fought for a Bulgarian Macedonia, with brutal pre-Weltkrieg uprisings in Ilinden and Tikveš against any power that got in the way of their so-called ‘liberation’ of the Macedonian region. Since the Weltkrieg, Bulgaria’s hegemony in the region has seen the IMRO go into a form of limbo, fading into history with their goal achieved.\n\nOur recent reclamation of Macedonia was always expected to be difficult to consolidate, but today the National Assembly has received word that Bulgarian colonel and revolutionary Ivan Mihajlov has restored the organisation, declaring an open war against Belgrade in the process. The group will no doubt get support, clandestine or otherwise, from Bulgarian elements which in turn will embolden their actions. If we do not crush them swiftly, then military officials worry that the partisans may not be beatable at all."

 serbia.24.t: "The Lull in Macedonia - Round #[?IMRO_round_system]"
 serbia.24.d: "The mountains and hills of Macedonia make the region a godsend to any would-be guerrilla revolutionary, and so, the conflict against the IMRO takes place in the form of irregular, small-scale warfare. Armed Macedonian bands, the Chetas, infiltrate the rest of Macedonia from the organisation's headquarters in the mountains, against which the Serbian Army and law enforcement responds with regular patrols and similarly small-scale organisation. Our resources in this war are limited, however. Should we defend the larger cities in the north such as Skopje? Or should we focus on the rural mountainous south?"
 serbia.24.a: "Focus on cities in the north."
 serbia.24.b: "Focus on villages in the south."

 serbia.25.t: "Victory!"

 serbia.26.t: "Defeat!"

 serbia.29.d: "The ongoing conflict in Serbia has spilled over to Bulgarian soil - combatants of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, seeking a refuge from Serbian authorities from which they will be able to plan new offensives and terrorist attacks, have landed in the Pirin region in the southwest. Since then, they have seized effective control of the region. Our authorities and any of their attempts to maintain order there have been powerless, and Mihajlov's organisation has established a 'state within a state' there - with their own army, law enforcement, and even taxation. Pirin is being drained dry to fund the IMRO's plans in Macedonia, and while their goals align with ours, it means we will have to suffer ourselves..."

 serbia.30.t: "Assassinations!"
 serbia.30.d: "Not content with merely sowing terror in the local populace of Macedonia and the Serbian people, the IMRO have moved on to targeting soldiers and officers of the country's armed forces. Throughout the past few weeks, their fanatical hitmen have been active in gunning down Serbian officers or taking them out with car bombs, with little regard for their own lives and safety. Though we have hastily increased security measures to keep our commanders safe, the IMRO's work has had the effect they wanted - the Serbian Army reels from the damage caused, even a few of our highest commanding officers have been incapacitated and will not be able to return to the front lines for some time."
 serbia.30.a: "You will pay back in blood for every life you claimed."

 serbia.31.t: "The Fall of Macedonia"
 serbia.31.d: "Days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months, and the war in Macedonia has bent more and more against Serbia's favour. Waves of soldiers are sent to maintain order in the region, and yet return in coffins. With each casualty, with each act of terror, the opinion of the populace has increasingly turned against the Serbian authorities, and as they failed to put the situation under control, the situation has turned completely uncontrollable. In the end, a temporary retreat from the region has been called, to consolidate the army's positions in the north and cut unnecessary losses.\n\nSkopje, the capital of Macedonia, is now a picturesque sight. Burning Serbian memorabilia in bonfires, triumphantly standing atop of buildings and mosques, Macedonian militants wave their red-black banner and chant the words of the "Rise the Dawn of Freedom", the hymn of the Macedonian revolutionaries. Representatives from all liberated regions of Macedonia have gathered in the capital and proudly declared Ivan Mihajlov to be the first president of the Independent State of Macedonia.\n\nAs its first act, the constituent assembly of Macedonia declared the 'restoration of immortal, historical ties between the peoples of Vardar Macedonia and Bulgaria' and sent an official diplomatic note to the government in Sofia, requesting the return of Bulgarian troops to their rightful soil. Any and all control we still have over Macedonia is slipping by the second, and unless we take a stand against the Bulgarians, we may lose it for good..."

Soldiers once used to police the countryside are forced to be diverted elsewhere, giving the IMRO room to breathe, and allowing them to enact the next stage of their plan to liberate Macedonia. In the mountains surrounding the Vardar Valley, voivodes of the IMRO have gathered to proclaim the independence of the "Independent State of Macedonia", and follow it with a call for all Macedonians to take arms and evict the hated Serbian invader from their lands once and for all.

Their armed bands and detachments have been scattered one after the other, crushed by superior Serbian arms, and order has been restored completely. Hundreds, if not thousands have perished during the conflict, and the civilian population has suffered greatly, both in reprisals and in acts of terror. Now that the flames of civil war have receded, however, some peace has returned to the region.\n\nFor the time being, Southern Serbia will remain under military occupation and reconstruction will have to take place before it is integrated back into the greater Serbian nation once again."

 serbia.39.b: "Let us hope the other side of the trenches is more welcoming..."

 serbia.40.t: "[faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] Disbands the Belgrade Pact"
 serbia.40.d.default: "Today, we’ve received an urgent message from [faction_leader.GetNameDef]. Following recent diplomatic negotiations, [faction_leader.GetAdjectiveCap] officials have moved to disband the Belgrade Pact, citing that the situation of Europe has immeasurably changed, and a small regional alliance will be unable to protect the Balkans from external threats any longer. They’ve implored us to follow their lead in seeking protection from larger powers, and have apologised for the situation."
 serbia.40.d.alliance: "Important news has reached us today - [faction_leader.GetNameDef] has officially dissolved the Belgrade Pact, having announced an alliance with [future_serbian_ally.GetNameDef]. It seems that while the Belgrade Pact was useful for containing regional threats in the Balkans, it would ultimately be unable to stand against the major powers in Western Europe by itself, hence [faction_leader.GetNameDef]'s decision to join the [future_serbian_ally.GetFactionName]. The question to be asked now is if we follow them or strike our own path instead."
 serbia.40.a: "Time to seek our own path."
 serbia.40.b: "Contact [future_serbian_ally.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and ask for an alliance."

 serbia.41.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Alliance"
 serbia.41.d: "It appears our attempts to join the [From.GetFactionName] have failed. Today, diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] gave a formal response to the Prime Minister, rejecting our attempts to join the [From.GetFactionName] outright. It appears that for now, for better or worse, we’ll remain diplomatically isolated from the major powers of Europe."
 serbia.41.a: "So much for "old friendships"."

 serbia.42.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks to Join Our Alliance"
 serbia.42.d.ROM: "Following the dissolution of the Belgrade Pact, [From.GetNameDef] has been left isolated, surrounded by many nations that have lukewarm relations with it at best. We have received a message from their embassy in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today. Left with little alternative, the government of Bucharest has requested ‘cooperation’ between our two nations in military affairs. There is a condition attached to this however. In exchange for [From.GetAdjective] entry into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we must officially renounce all claims to Bessarabia and the [From.GetAdjective] majority territories in Galicia. This is certainly a steep price for us to pay although the benefits are also significant - denying Germany one of its major oil suppliers as well as potentially gaining us a major ally in the Balkans. What should our reply be?"
 serbia.42.d.other: "Following [SER.GetNameDef] entry into the Russian Sphere, we have received a request from [From.GetNameDef], a former Belgrade Pact member. It seems as though they have weighed up their options following its dissolution and have expressed their interest in entering a military alliance with us. Should we accept, or is their membership unneeded?"
 serbia.42.a: "[SER_russia_accept_ally_text]"
 serbia.42.b: "[SER_russia_refuse_ally_text]"

 SER_russia_accept_ally_ROM: "It is time for us to put this feud behind us."
 SER_russia_refuse_ally_ROM: "Bessarabia is Russian!"

 SER_russia_accept_ally_other: "Welcome aboard!"
 SER_russia_refuse_ally_other: "No, we don't trust them."

 serbia.4201.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 serbia.4201.d: "We've received a response from [From.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] about our request for a military alliance today. After careful consideration, we have been declined entry into the [FROM.GetAdjective] sphere, stating that our foreign policy and national goals simply did not align with theirs. It appears as though we will have to look elsewhere for assistance."
 serbia.4201.a: "They are either crazy, or desire our territory. Probably both."

 serbia.43.t: "The Serbian Radical Union"
 serbia.43.d: "The People's Radical Party and the Agrarians have maintained close ties between each other ever since the latter's formation from Main Association of Serbian Agricultural Cooperatives in 1919. While the Agrarians have generally been a movement representing very specific rural concerns, their alliance with the Radicals granted them the ability to address them, while the Radicals could not say no to a reliable partner in the Skupština and outside of it - a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nWith the initiative of President Milan Stojadinović, the two parties have made a next step in their cooperation by joining into a single party - the Serbian Radical Union. The President will maintain his role as party leader in the new association, but party elections will be held in all chapters to determine the vice-chairmen and secretaries, with one of the vice positions already reserved to Milan Gavrilović, the leader of the former Agrarian Party.\n\nNicknamed "Sarez" after the abbreviation of its name, the Radical Union now wields a wide majority in the Skupština, and already some express their worries about such a powerful bloc united behind the President..."
 serbia.43.a: "A toast to our new comrades!"

 serbia.44.t: "Stojadinović's Call for Action"
 serbia.44.d: "The situation in the Balkans and across the world has not necessarily developed to Serbia's advantage.\n\nHowever, the natural mission of the Serbs still remains. There is no other nation capable of being to the South Slavs as Prussia was to the German peoples, or Piedmont was to Italians. Only once we complete this objective will the South Slavs be able to prosper in peace - as today, divided between different tribes, they are dominated by foreign powers and unable to wield the full extent of their abilities. Today, after twenty years of rest and preparation, the Serbs are once again at war, with the exact same goal in mind.\n\nI recognise the hesitation of my peers and the people of Serbia, having suffered greatly the last time this has happened. I believe that Nikola Pašić had the same hesitation in his heart when the first Austrian shells fell upon Belgrade and we were subject to the torment of their occupation. And to ensure that this does not happen again, I propose a regime of national unity, a period in which all Serbs will be able to set their differences aside and work together for a joint future. While the Skupština will remain, its composition will have to remain the same until the South Slavs are finally united, and decisions in the assembly made from here on out not by partisan differences, but by the needs of the Nation and its liberating goals.\n\nI have spoken to the Republican and Socialist leadership, and while there is obvious reservation among their ranks, I have to ensure them that I do not seek to use this as means of making myself rule alone. The Constitution will remain throughout, and I will make sure to orchestrate a summit of representatives from each of the parties where we will be able to delineate national policy..."
 serbia.44.a: "Intriguing..."

 serbia.45.t: "Conflict within the Consolidated Government"
 serbia.45.d1: "The Council for National Unification, though created with the goal of fostering national unity in the face of future conflict, is not immune to internal squabbling. Uniting several ideologies within the inter-party committees, it is bound to see those parties disagree on the road ahead.\n\nThis time, issues arose between the Radicals and Republicans, the former forced to defend their nation-consolidating policies against the latter's criticism of the possible violation of democratic principle."
 serbia.45.d2: "The Council for National Unification, though created with the goal of fostering national unity in the face of future conflict, is not immune to internal squabbling. Uniting several ideologies within the inter-party committees, it is bound to see those parties disagree on the road ahead.\n\nThis time, issues arose between the Radicals and Socialists - an understandable disagreement between the internationalist ideal of the SRP and the Radicals' vehement hatred of such nation-erasing viewpoints."
 serbia.45.d3: "The Council for National Unification, though created with the goal of fostering national unity in the face of future conflict, is not immune to internal squabbling. Uniting several ideologies within the inter-party committees, it is bound to see those parties disagree on the road ahead.\n\nThis time, issues arose between the Republicans and Socialists - the latter attacking the capitalistic and undemocratic measures of the consolidated government, and the former forced to reluctantly defend them."
 serbia.45.a: "Stop! Get some help!"

 serbia.46.t: "Petar II Placed in House Arrest"
 serbia.46.d: "After several incidents over the regency period have finally eroded the patience of Petar Živković's regency council, the teenage King has been placed under house arrest to withdrawing from public life until his eighteenth birthday. All of his public appearances and foreign attendances have been cancelled and replaced by attendances by ministers of the Royalist cabinet."
 serbia.46.a: "Good riddance!"

 serbia.48.t: "A Visit at Midnight"
 serbia.48.d: "The office of the President has received a lone visitor tonight, in between the soaking rain and thunder. No forewarning, nobody else in tow, just a lone Dragomir Vasić, excusing himself past the Presidential Guard by informing that he is here for an emergency meeting with a fellow member of the Council of National Unification. Though hesitant, the President accepted his predecessor into the office.\n\nFormer President Vasić was never known for constraining himself with proper etiquette and manners, and did not break character tonight, either. Without mincing his words, the Republican declared that he saw through Stojadinović's intentions - whenever he spoke of defending Serbia through national unity, he only sought personal power to himself and to his clique within the SRZ. Turning himself unchecked by the Skupština, he is eroding democracy, building a cult of personality around himself, and following immediately after the late King Aleksandar.\n\nVasić stopped just short of an ultimatum to the President, but nevertheless informed that the Radicals and the Republicans are now at an impasse, and the rest of the Republican party committee agrees - they are heavily discussing on the future of the SONU, and if it becomes any more clear that Stojadinović is using his emergency powers to consolidate his rule into an autocracy, then they will fully withdraw their support - preparation for war against Austria, real or fictional, will not be above their commitment to democracy."
 serbia.48.a: "What are you insinuating?! I work within the Council's constraints!"
 SER_vasic_is_not_so_pissed_tt: "You reassure Vasić that the SONU will relinquish its duties to the Skupština after the war against Austria."
 serbia.48.b: "Is this talk of treason? Treason against me?!"
 SER_vasic_is_really_pissed_tt: "Vasić loudly proclaims "we should have just shot the Radical traitors back in 1925" and leaves."
 SER_reassured_vasic: "The SONU is fully committed to democracy."

 serbia.49.t: "The Fall of SONU"
 serbia.49.d: "Before the Skupština, representing the Republican delegation, Milan Grol delivered a speech explaining that their party was no longer able to cooperate with President Milan Stojadinović and the Radical Union - all while delivering cold comments on the, as the former Prime Minister put it, "undemocratic means of centralisation" pushed forward by the President with the disguise of national security. Despite their ideological differences, the statement was supported by many of the parties in the assembly, most notably both Socialists.\n\nSwiftly, the parliamentary floor descended to arguing and complaints thrown forth by all sides. The chatter was silenced by former President Vasić, who rose from his seat and openly declared Stojadinović to be a "Codreanite pig" who does not deserve to lead the Serbian nation, as he will run all the achievements of the Revolution to the ground. After requesting that Vasić leave the session for today for his misconduct, the Speaker finally ordered it adjourned. The Council of National Unification, however, was left dead in the water."
 serbia.49.a: "Fine. Democracy is a rotting corpse anyway."

 serbia.50.t: "Importing Aviation Expertise"
 serbia.50.d: "Throughout the post-Weltkrieg period, there were two power blocs we could rely on for rearmament. The Russian state, as weak as it has been left by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, has never shied away from supporting the Serbian cause, either out of the feeling of Slavic brotherhood or because of geopolitical advantages. In the West, however, the Syndicalist states, especially France, have increasingly become a valuable trade partner ever since the Republican Revolution. After all, we have a common enemy - Austria and Germany - whom the Syndicalists would love to see destabilised by a resurgent Serbia.\n\nEither of these powers, if they are currently in the condition to support us, can help us to rebuild the Serbian air force."
 serbia.50.a: "The Russians."
 serbia.50.b: "The French syndicalists."
 serbia.50.c: "We need to be self-sufficient."

 serbia.51.t: "Rebuilding the Air Fleet"
 serbia.51.d: "Aiming to rebuild our nonexistent air fleet from scratch, we once again turn towards our foreign contractors. The mass-produced Russian air force has enough old fighter planes to go around to build an entirely new air force with, whereas our comrades in the West are less endowed in that regard. On the other hand, the French air command is willing to cooperate with Serbian manufacturers on the production of local, French-influenced fighter designs."
 serbia.51.a: "Tap the Russians."
 serbia.51.b: "Tap the French."
 serbia.51.c: "Focus on local designs."

 serbia.52.t: "Attack Aircraft Acquisition"
 serbia.52.d: "A fleet of fighter planes is of little use if we cannot use our air force to support the troops on the ground - thankfully, we have several options to choose from. The vast size of Russia means that the Russian air fleet specialises in tactical bombers, which can make long distances, strike enemy formations hundreds of kilometres away, and return safely. The French, on the other hand, rely on smaller, faster fighter-bombers, designed to strike German forces over the border, which are superior at dogfighting and can strike enemy troops far more accurately."
 serbia.52.a: "Tactical bombers will give us the long-term edge"
 serbia.52.b: "Fighter-bombers are more useful in this region"

 serbia.53.t: "Vidovdan"
 serbia.53.d: "Vidovdan represents the day to commemorate Saint Prince Lazar and the Serbian holy martyrs who gave their lives to defend the true faith during the epic Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Empire on June 28, 1389. It is regarded as a national holiday in Serbia."
 serbia.53.a: "Serbia will never forget its heroes!"

 serbia.54.t: "Construction of the Belgrade-Salonica Railway"
 serbia.54.d: "Since the end of the 4th Balkan War and our reclamation of Macedonia, Serbian and Greek contractors have been upgrading and connecting the rail lines from Belgrade to Salonica, which would allow for a continuous journey between the two nations’ heartlands. Today, the first Belgrade-Salonica train journey was undertaken, starting in Serbia and snaking south into Greece. The journey was finished by a meeting of the Serbian and Greek prime ministers, a show of political unity between the Balkan nations."
 serbia.54.a: "Serbia will never forget its allies!"

 serbia.55.t: "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy the HMS Lion"
 serbia.55.d: "[From.GetName], which is in a process of industrialisation and rearmament, has offered to buy the outdated battlecruiser HMS Lion which will become the flagship of their navy. This will surely lead to better relations with the [From.GetAdjective] government and can help them in taking on the navies of their neighbours."
 serbia.55.a: "We could profit from selling this old junk."
 serbia.55.b: "No, every ship is needed!"

 serbia.56.t: "[From.GetName] Agrees to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
 serbia.56.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sell us the HMS Lion. The ship is now on its way to our ports. With this addition, our navy can reign over the Adriatic Sea."
 serbia.56.a: "A day for celebration!"

 serbia.57.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
 serbia.57.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to sell us an old battlecruiser to serve as the flagship of our fleet. We have to search for another solution."
 serbia.57.a: "We will remember this."

 serbia.58.t: "The Final Step?"
 serbia.58.d: "Throughout the past few years, democracy in Serbia has been increasingly eroded - and today, it is unrecognisable from the militant republic it had been a mere few years ago. The Council of National Unification still stands, technically, but the parties which haven't already withdrawn from its membership have long since been turned into controlled opposition, mere puppets to pretend that Serbia is now anything but a one-man dictatorship. Political crackdowns are now commonplace and elections are suspended permanently. The Konspiracija, seen by a few as a guarantee of the Republic, now stands completely behind the President - his regime has made Serbia stronger than anyone could have expected, and it's no secret that quite a few officers in the military like his style of rule...\n\nToday, only one question is left to answer - where shall Stojadinović lead Serbia next? The masses of uniformed paramilitaries on the streets and the corporatist clique in charge will both follow the President wherever he will go. Should he merely draft a new, authoritarian constitution to maintain his regime for decades? Or should he tap into a small, long suppressed, but nevertheless existing monarchist current deep within the Radical Party? Pašić and his party never truly broke their vows to the House of Karađorđević, and now that republicanism has been completely destroyed, could anyone stop Stojadinović from inviting the heir to the throne to serve as his puppet?"
 serbia.58.a: "I am the Vođa, the new Autocrat!"
 serbia.58.b: "Send a letter to Canada, the Kingdom is reborn!"

 serbia.59.t: "Control over Populace Consolidated"
 serbia.59.d: "So much has been accomplished in such a short time. Despite their pacifist origins, the Socialists led a war against Bulgaria with no fear in their eyes, and returned victorious. Niš, Skopje, and other cities once ripped from Serbia are once again a part of the nation. And it was not merely a successful war which the regime of the left has brought. Already, important social reforms have been put into place, their first dividends trickling down to the people below - a show of generosity which the frustrated masses will not forget in a while.\n\nThe strength of the government among the people is greater than ever."
 serbia.59.a: "All in a day's work."

 serbia.60.t: "Control over Military Consolidated"
 serbia.60.d: "The Serbian military, long a hotbed for reactionaries, conservatives, monarchists and conspiracies seeking to control the civilian regime, was believed to be the greatest challenge to the newly elected SRP government. Even it has failed to stop the ongoing cause of the revolution, however - its old conservative generals are now retired in their cabins, removed from power, all while a new guard of uppity officers are running the military-like petty kings.\n\nThe strength of the government among the military is greater than ever."
 serbia.60.a: "All in a day's work."

 serbia.61.t: "Control over Parliament Consolidated"
 serbia.61.d: "The left-wing regime came to power in the form of a coalition, working together with moderate groups and parties towards a common goal. Though observers initially predicted that the Socialists and Republicans will work as a moderate force against the revolutionary SRP, this has proven to not be the case. One after another, these moderates have either been frightened into going with the SRP's policies or changed their ideological positions entirely, engulfed by a wave of revolutionary sentiment which permeates all of Serbian society today. Even the members of the Skupština who are in opposition can do little to make things change - the power of the legislature is increasingly being eroded.\n\nThe strength of the government among high politics is greater than ever."
 serbia.61.a: "All in a day's work."

 serbia.62.t: "The Revolution"
 serbia.62.d: "With the support of thousands of citizens on the street and commanding absolute loyalty from the Party, the Nation and the Army, President Trifun Kaclerović slowly dictated the final step of the Revolution to a silent, paralysed Skupština. Besieged by reactionaries seeking to extinguish democracy and restore the monarchy, he has no choice but to call a state of emergency and begin the thorough transformation of the state to ensure that the interests of the people are forever guarded. In Belgrade, Niš, Podgorica and other cities, popular militias were seizing power from local authorities and enacting justice upon all they deem enemies of the people. The army, paralysed by purges and losing out in its influence, had little power to stop the uprising, and one after the other, its leadership were being arrested for charges real or imaginary.\n\nIn the midst of the burning revolutionary flame, the Serbian Socialist Republic has been proclaimed - and the Socialist Workers' Party as its sole legal party."
 serbia.62.a: "Death to Codreanites and the bourgeoisie!"
 SER_several_generals_shot_tt: "The bloodthirsty conspirator generals will be §Rexecuted§!!"

 serbia.63.t: "Collapse of the Socialist Workers' Party"
 serbia.63.d: "The Socialist Workers' Party was elected with the promise of truly staggering reform - a path of revolutionary socialism which, at least for a while, swayed a large portion of the population. A year has passed since, however, and little has been accomplished thus far. While some achievements have indeed been put into place, the lack of action against the enemies of the workers has left a large radical wing of the party alienated.\n\nConvinced that the SRP has betrayed the cause of socialism and become a class-collaborationist party, rather than one which fights for a worker's revolution, this wing has broken away, initiating the collapse of the Party into several movements. President Trifun Kaclerović now only commands the moderates of the party in the Skupština, and although they have now merged with the moderate Socialists, they no longer command a majority in the legislature and will hardly be able to command majority support for their plans from there on out. Chances are that the voters will not be kind to the Socialists in the next election, either..."
 serbia.63.a: "But what about unity in the face of reaction?!"

 serbia.64.t: "The Kingdom's Future"
 serbia.64.d: "The October coup and the restoration of the monarchy have allowed hundreds of exiles to return to Serbia - these were hardline monarchists, loyalists of the Karađorđević dynasty, who were either expelled from the Republic or fled on their own accord. These ten years of exile have had a toll on many of them - coping with the loss of the monarchy was difficult, and the conditions of exile hardened their resolve. The rise of the Iron Guard in Romania had its effect as well - it showed to Serbian monarchists a way how the monarchy can not only survive, but be strengthened and its energy rejuvenated for the modern age.\n\nHaving returned home, these radical monarchists have joined forces with Dimitrije Ljotić - one of the few monarchists who participated in the elections in the Serbian republic, and whose far-right ideas are in close accord with the movement. To them, the restoration of the monarchy is only the beginning of the journey. The Kingdom fell for a reason, it became too passive and did not mobilise the support of the people, and abandoned its traditional roots, which insidiously eroded its stability from within. Nothing less than a complete restructuring of society will satisfy them."
 serbia.64.a: "These energetic youths have some good ideas..."

 serbia.65.t: "The Dictatorship of November 6th"
 serbia.65.d: "Having stabilised his power after the initial chaos, Petar Živković has made an official announcement to the Serbian people today. From here on out, the newly reborn Kingdom of Serbia will be run by a Regency Council, appointed from members of the newly established "Serbian Radical Peasants' Democracy", created from the former State Party of Serbian Democrats, members of the White Hand, and former Radicals who opportunistically changed their allegiances. For the duration of the Regency, it shall be the sole legal party in the country, and the Regency will manage all day to day affairs of the state.\n\nAlready, underground Republicans and Socialists have denounced this regime as a dictatorship - not that they were ever going to accept the fall of the Republic."
 serbia.65.a: "For God and Fatherland!"

 serbia.66.t: "The Serbian Radical Peasants' Democracy"
 serbia.66.d: "Formed soon after the Royalist coup to legitimise their newly established rule, the Radical Peasants' Democracy is still young and its ideology is not yet fully defined. Its members are gathered from all across the monarchist movement, from moderate politicians drawn from the former establishment, to veterans of the White Hand secret society, to radical young officers who spent their years in embittered exile. In the following years, the actions and reforms of the Regency shall define its nature, and decide the form of state which Petar II will inherit."
 serbia.66.a: "We shall tread the correct path."

 serbia.67.t: "Matters of the Regency"
 serbia.67.d1: "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, a prominent publication was released in their unofficial newspaper, "Buđenje" ("Awakening") - it is an anti-semitic, anti-Muslim and an esoteric nationalist creed, proclaiming the Dictatorship of November 6th to be a 'national revolution' which will 'purify Serbia and restore its pride'. The publication and the newspaper in general call for an authoritarian corporatist system, present the Iron Guard regime in Romania as an example, and spew vehement hatred towards syndicalism, which they describe as completely against Serbian national interest."
 serbia.67.d2: "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, the White Eagles paramilitary organisation has held a mass rally on the streets of Belgrade, proclaiming their support to the restored Serbian monarchy and calling for the 'national revival' of the Serbian nation. This rally did not pass without controversy, however. The marchers chanted anti-semitic slogans, called for the expulsion of minorities in Kosovo and Macedonia in order for those lands to be integrated into the Serbian state, and intimidated the general public. Even the military had to get involved to maintain the peace in the city before any riots broke out."
 serbia.67.d3: "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, large masses of White Eagles, ZBORniks and other radical monarchist organisations organised a mass impromptu volunteer labour action in the Serbian countryside. Hundreds of nationalist youth were sent to villages and individual farms to help the local farming communities without payment. Though the effects of the action were meagre, it was heavily propagandised in nationalist newspapers, describing it as a living example of the Zadruga ideal - communalism and a return to the agrarian nature of the Serbian people."
 serbia.67.d4: "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, a large military parade was held on the streets of Belgrade, the rejuvenated Serbian Army has chosen to showcase both its military might and its loyalty to the monarchy. Famous Serbian military marches were rehearsed and the parade was finished with a dramatic singing of the anthem of the Yugoslavian movement, "Hej, Sloveni!". The parade did not go without controversy, however, as underground resistance newspapers claim that the event was held to distract from crackdowns on socialist and republican dissenters across the country."
 serbia.67.d5: "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, the military has chosen to give hell to known underground resistance - several republican and socialist leaders, as well as defectors from the army who opposed the coup of 1936 were rooted from their hiding holes. During the Republican interregnum, the Monarchists were violently repressed, and only the sycophants and the harmless radicals were allowed to operate, aiming to discredit the movement. Now that they were in power, they could take all the revenge they wanted."
 serbia.67.d6: "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, General Petar Živković and his clique have successfully made several important contracts with the Serbian upper class - the businesses who believed themselves to be threatened by radical Republican and Socialist rhetoric, and former leaders of the NRS who chose to change sides during the Coup of 1936. The ties between the Radicals and the White Hand go far, and while they have been severed somewhat in the past, Živković has diligently worked to restore them ever since the declaration of the November 6th Dictatorship."
 serbia.67.d7: "Several scandals and internal conflicts have shaken the Radical Peasants' Democracy in the past few weeks. It appears several of the more ambitious personas in the party have spoken out against our current direction, leading to debate and open conflict over the extent of the Regency's powers and ideological bent. It appears that the lack of a defined direction in our party is shaking its integrity."
 serbia.67.a: "For King and Fatherland!"
 serbia.67.b: "Long live Serbia!"
 serbia.67.c: "Stop! Are we not allies?!"

 serbia.68.t: "Whispers in the Shadows"
 serbia.68.d: "Our King Petar II is rapidly reaching maturity, and yet the system he is about to inherit does not satisfy everyone in the Kingdom - neither in the army nor in the government. It is highly expected that either the White Hand or the radical monarchist caucus will gain control of the affairs of the state and maintain this control after the King's eighteenth birthday. For those who remember his father's Royal Dictatorship unfavourably, such a future is hard to swallow - is it not a mistake to blindly cling onto this despotic past, when it might have been the reason why the Kingdom fell in the first place?\n\nFortunately for those who were democratically aligned, King Petar II did not grow up to be an incompetent figurehead swayed easily by his Regent's ambitions. Already, he has shown a propensity for independent action opposing the wishes of his officials directly, with a political vision behind it. With this in mind, he has been approached by a slowly developing conspiracy in the shadows of the Regency, commanded by General Dušan Simović, a leading member of the Konspiracija before the October coup.\n\nIn a series of secret talks, General Simović has offered the removal of the Regency and the bestowal of all of the royal powers to him before maturity. With Živković, Ljotić and other hardliners sidelined, a provisional government will be able to spearhead the creation of a constitutional monarchy, just like the one he left in Canada years ago."
 serbia.68.a: "Give General Simović the green light."
 serbia.68.b: "Keep these talks secret, but decline."

 serbia.69.t: "Ides of March"
 serbia.69.d: "The key role in the coup was played by officers in the Serbian air force, who were completely loyal to Dušan Simović and so acted out the general's orders without question. Alongside loyal elements of the army, they seized control of communications in Belgrade and cut telegraph lines in preparation for the main event. King Petar II himself had to take initiative in the next part, a decision made despite protest by numerous conspirators due to the monarch's age and thus assumed unreliability. Nevertheless, the plot proceeded.\n\nOn the day of the coup, the King held a feast where all the leading personalities of the Regency, including the Regent, Petar Živković, and the informal leader of the radical faction of the Radical Peasants' Democracy, Dimitrije Ljotić, were required to attend. Rising up from his seat before the attendees, Petar II declared himself of age and the assumption of his full royal powers - his first act as an absolute monarch is to call for the arrest of everyone in the room. Before anyone could protest, the conspiracy activated, and armed officers stormed the hall.\n\nThe King later made a speech on the radio confirming this transfer of power to the celebration of Belgrade's citizens. Demonstrations in support of Petar II and Dušan Simović continued for several days after."
 serbia.69.a: "Long live the King!"

 serbia.70.t: "The New Government"
 serbia.70.d: "The fall of the White Hand is now all but certain - but who shall lead Serbia from here on out. Eager to assert himself and picturing a romantic vision of a peaceful, beloved constitutional monarchy in his mind, Petar II has expressed his wish to appoint a Prime Minister from the Democratic Party. They are former Republicans and moderate Radicals who reformed themselves as a constitutional monarchist party, endorsing the restoration of full democracy and the amendment of the Constitution of 1903 to fit the needs of the present day.\n\nGeneral Dušan Simović, however, is not as eager to take such a sudden lunge to the left. Picturing himself as a mentor to the young monarch, he offered a government formed by the People's Radical Party instead - this veteran political machine has survived much political upheaval over the years and a brief Regency Dictatorship certainly could not kill them either. Their politicians promise a return to the golden years of Petar II's grandfather and his namesake, and their conservative ideals will certainly make a transition from the dictatorial Regency more palatable for the monarchists who supported the coup."
 serbia.70.a: "We need to appease the former republicans"
 serbia.70.b: "A renewed Radical Party will restore Serbia's Golden Age"

 serbia.71.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 serbia.71.d: "According to the Constitution, elections to the Skupština are to be held every four years. The term of the current assembly has expired and the time has come to elect a new one - which shall propose a cabinet of Ministers to the King which will govern the country for the next four years. While there are numerous parties starting their campaigns, only two stand a chance at gaining enough seats to form a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
 serbia.71.a: "The Democratic Party forms the new government"
 serbia.71.b: "The People's Radical Party wins handily"

 serbia.72.t: "The King's Regime"
 serbia.72.d: "His Majesty the King of the Serbs, Petar II Karađorđević has finally come 18 years of age today, and in an impressive ceremony in the city of Belgrade, he has finally symbolically been granted all the powers of the throne. Regent Petar Živković, generals and officers of the White Hand, and the Cabinet of Ministers all bowed before the King as he proclaimed that he shall defend the integrity of Serbia and the Crown with all of the power that has been bestowed upon him.\n\nForeign observers mutter that little is expected to change in Belgrade after the event. The Regency may have resigned, but the influence of its years in power lingers, and the faction of the Radical Peasants' Democracy which gained control of the party in the preceding years will almost certainly form the new government. King Petar II may be a different man from his father and grandfather, but he remains only a symbol - the Royal Dictatorship, which he has little control over, will certainly continue for years if not decades."
 serbia.72.a: "This is a new page in the history of Serbdom!"
 serbia.72.b: "We, the loyal servants of Karađorđević, triumphed!"

 serbia.73.t: "The Putsch"
 serbia.73.d: "Though the Yugoslav state is fresh, already resentment with the new state of affairs begins to build up - or, rather, a search for an opportunity to accomplish plans sought for many years.\n\nThe only real ideology of the Konspiracija secret society is Serbian supremacism, and the idealistic goals of Yugoslavism and a union of the South Slavs have little place within it. The Serbian Cultural Club has been drafting ideas of a "Greater Serbia" instead, one which should be formed after the collapse of the Austrian empire and include all territories inhabited by Serbs, or territories said to be inhabited by Serbs, and perhaps a little bit more...\n\nThankfully, within the past decade, the Serbian Army has gained complete control of the government, eliminating the last barrier between this goal and reality. Within a week after the proclamation of Yugoslavia, a silent coup seized control of the state, overthrew the democratically elected government and reverted the proclamation. Milan Nedić, the elder of the powerful Nedić, has come to power as the provisional president of a greater Serbia.\n\nThough they were officially opposed to the coup and fled to the underground, both the Republicans and the Radicals saw numerous members either support or tolerate the putsch. This severely shook the reputation of both of the parties, and as the coup advances from Belgrade to consolidate the rest of the country, their leaders such as Dragomir Vasić and Milan Stojadinović find themselves unable to organise a serious response."
 serbia.73.a: "Long live Greater Serbia!"

 serbia.74.t: "Chaos in the North"
 serbia.74.d: "After the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, numerous soldiers and officers in the Imperial armies refused to switch their sides to Yugoslavia - either they were loyal to the regime in Vienna and now expressed this loyalty by separatist sympathies, or they believed that the Serbs would never give as much autonomy as the Kingdom of Illyria granted to the Slovene, Croatian and Bosniak nations.\n\nThe coup in Belgrade has massively emboldened these remnants, who now organise into mass resistance pockets and seize town after town in the chaos. The Serbian Army reports that control has been lost over much of former Illyria, and more importantly, the Prečani communities in Croatia and Bosnia are being threatened. This has pushed the Nedić putschist government to begin a full force military operation against the Croatian, Slovene and Bosniak uprisings."
 serbia.74.a: "These traitors shall be crushed!"

 serbia.75.t: "The ASOS"
 serbia.75.d: "Deputies in the Skupština who vehemently opposed the putsch and managed to escape house arrest have made their way to the south of the country, where, in Montenegro, they reformed into a shell of a parliament. Most of the deputies were Socialist Workers, Socialists and left-wing Republicans, who had the most reason to fear the new Konspiracija regime and thus resist it.\n\nThough there were some battalions and reservists which swayed to their side, the exiled Skupština initially appeared toothless, until it began forging alliances with the militant Yugoslav left. Former Pelagićevci guerrillas led by Vukašin Marković rose up one after another and they were followed by Montenegrin, Macedonian and Albanian separatists, allowing this movement to consolidate a semi-strong grip over the south of the country.\n\nIn Cetinje, it declared the formation of the Anti-Reactionary Assembly for the Liberation of Serbia, and have effectively transformed into a Third Internationale-aligned revolutionary organisation."
 serbia.75.a: "These traitors shall be crushed!"

 serpuppet.1.t: "Serbia under Bulgarian Occupation"
 serpuppet.1.d: "Following the war between Belgrade Pact and Bulgaria in order to destroy Bulgarian hegemony in the Balkans and despite the numeric superiority of our armies, Serbia has been defeated. Since that moment, Bulgarian troops entered Belgrade and secured the last pockets of resistance. The precedent government has been partially arrested, the other party having escaped.\n\nThe Bulgarian authority has put in power Živojin Perić, the leader of the State Party of Serbian Democrats. The party was already in power between 1920 and 1925 but had been overthrown by the Republican Revolution. Now it's upon to them to rebuild the country and reinstate their policies."
 serpuppet.1.a: "A new country must be built."

 serpuppet.2.t: "Beginning of the Progressive Reforms"
 serpuppet.2.d: "The party has initiated a series of new reforms to implement their ideas in the country. These reforms will impact the social situation of the country to appease the population. But at the same time they are trying to secure power in Serbia and confront the "tyranny of the majority". This concept has been repaired by Alexis de Tocqueville a French politician. He said that the democracy was a vicious circle consisting of the majority the overwhelming majority and not giving a voice to political minorities in a democracy."
 serpuppet.2.a: "We need to respect democracy and the majority principle."
 serpuppet.2.b: "We need to face off this tyranny by establishing an appointed upper house."

 serpuppet.3.t: "Second Step of the Reforms"
 serpuppet.3.d: "Following the debate about the "tyranny of the majority", the party has proposed a new reform about implementation of a minimum wage. This proposal would allow every family to have a low income necessary for primary needs. Instead of this, some members of the party propose to implement an insurance system based on Bismarck political ideas of rewarding those who work and contribute for the social security."
 serpuppet.3.a: "We need to ensure the good living of the Serbian people."
 serpuppet.3.b: "Only the one who works should be awarded."

 serpuppet.4.t: "Final Step of the Reforms"
 serpuppet.4.d: "Finally after all these debates in the party, the last proposal has emerged. Some members with the most liberal thoughts are thinking about reforming the legislature. Reforms such as the emancipation of women or more protection for workers. These ideas are in continuity with the previous proposal of minimum wage. Meanwhile, the more authoritarian members of the party are afraid of the situation that this proposal could bring to the country. They are instead proposing to take control of the legislature. The government would then control the executive and the legislative power, strengthening its power and taking finally an authoritarian path."
 serpuppet.4.a: "Serbia is a modern country with a modern thought!"
 serpuppet.4.b: "Only a strong state can preserve the government from falling down."

 serpuppet.5.t: "Progressive Reforms Take a Liberal Turn"
 serpuppet.5.d: "The reforms are now complete and after many decisions between implementing a liberal thought in Serbia or reinforcing the new government authority. The reforms have finally taken a liberal path. In promoting equality, protecting democracy and applying proposals such as a minimum wage, or legal reforms, Serbia has reached a new status as a modern nation and can now be called a model in the Balkans."
 serpuppet.5.a: "Long live Serbia!"

 serpuppet.6.t: "Progressive Reforms Take an Authoritarian Turn"
 serpuppet.6.d: "The reforms are now complete and after many decisions between implementing a liberal thought in Serbia or reinforcing the new government authority. The reforms have finally taken an authoritarian path. In facing off the dangerous tyranny of the majority with an appointed upper house, creating a welfare system based upon assurantial Bismarck ideas and finally merging executive and legislative power, the Serbian government has finally secured its power and can be recognised as a strong state in the Balkans."
 serpuppet.6.a: "Long live Serbia!"

 serpuppet.7.t: "A Meeting in the Shadows"
 serpuppet.7.d: "This morning a letter has been sent to the president office. It was a meeting proposal from a remnant of the Konspiracija, he proposed to meet only the leader of the state at 12 pm in a dark suburb of Belgrade. It's been a while since Bulgaria dominates the Serbian nation and some members of the government including Živojin Perić are beginning to consider a possibility of rebellion. Maybe this meeting could lead to a new opportunity but a dangerous one."
 serpuppet.7.a: "Meet him."
 serpuppet.7.b: "No way we betray Bulgaria, arrest him !"

 serpuppet.8.t: "Involve Members of the Government?"
 serpuppet.8.d: "Following the meeting, it turned out that the resistant was an outstanding member of the Konspiracija whose objective is to invert Bulgarian hegemony with a stab in the back. Živojin Perić and he decided then to unite Serbian resistance against the Bulgarian oppressor, putting aside all forms of ideological misunderstanding. This union will be called "Nacionalni Savet Otpora" (or National Council of Resistance). For the moment we have to gain some support for preparing insurrection against Bulgaria but each decision that we will take will either increase or decrease the stealth of the NCR or independence movement. If our stealth goes too low, we could be discovered and unleash the Bulgarian anger against the Serbian people. If we manage to keep good stealth we can gain some surprise effects against Bulgarian Army.\n\nNow, Perić know that some members of the government are turning against Bulgarian oppression. Shall we try to involve them ?"
 serpuppet.8.a: "They can't be trusted."
 serpuppet.8.b: "Perhaps we could gain some political support."

 serpuppet.9.t: "Involve Generals?"
 serpuppet.9.d: "The Serbian Army has been humiliated during the war against Bulgaria. Some of our generals do not support collaboration with the victorious. Should we involve them? This could compromise the furtivity of the NCR but at the same time could give us some officer support in case of war."
 serpuppet.9.a: "We shall remain stealth."
 serpuppet.9.b: "Perhaps we could gain some military support."

 serpuppet.10.t: "Find Military Equipment?"
 serpuppet.10.d: "Some warehouses in our country are filled in of infantry equipment from the previous war and the Weltkrieg. These guns rot in the dust while they could be useful for our rebellion. The issue is that these hangars are protected by either Bulgarian soldiers or Serbian corrupted soldiers. We could try to bribe them or infiltrate the places discreetly. There's still a chance that one of our operations fails and our stealth could be compromised. What should we do ?"
 serpuppet.10.a: "Let's not take any risk for that."
 serpuppet.10.b: "We need these guns at all costs."

 serpuppet.11.t: "Find more Men?"
 serpuppet.11.d: "Since the beginning of the century, Serbia loses a lot of men in every war where she was involved. The Weltkrieg and the Fourth Balkan War have been the most deadly. Now for our insurrection we need men to fight the Bulgarian oppressor. By chance, many Serbians appreciate the government for its reforms but see of a very bad eye the alliance with Bulgaria. This will give us many men against them."
 serpuppet.11.a: "Let's not take any risk."
 serpuppet.11.b: "We need these men for the final fight."

 serpuppet.18.t: "Hiding Guns in Churches?"
 serpuppet.18.d: "Since the creation of our movement, its furtivity is essential. In fact it's with its stealth that we will be able to declare the most surprising independence from the Bulgarians. Some of our partisans are suggesting that we should hide guns in the churches, like the little ones in the countryside. This way, the guns will be better hidden than in some warehouses of the government and when the uprising will rise, we will be able to get them back without nobody being able to bother us. However, this move poses some ethical problems and some members of the NCR are against the idea of using sacred places in our plans. What should we do?"
 serpuppet.18.a: "Do it."
 serpuppet.18.b: "Don't touch the churches."

 serpuppet.12.t: "Recruiting Mercenaries?"
 serpuppet.12.d: "Now we know how much support we got. How many guns, men and allies we have already and even what to do with these guns. However, we don't know if it will be enough to seize our independence by force even if we surprise them. Maybe it would be wise to recruit some mercenaries for the moment of the rebellion. We could pretend that we recruiting mercenaries to help with the Bulgarian war effort. It could work for a while."
 serpuppet.12.a: "It's too risky."
 serpuppet.12.b: "We need them."

 serpuppet.13.t: "Clouds are Piling Up"
 serpuppet.13.d: "The dice are rolled now, we have to wait and see what our decisions will lead to. We will prepare our insurrection against the Bulgarian oppressor. There are several possibilities: either we have been keeping our movement stealth or we didn't keep it discreet enough, in this case, the uprising can simply fail or Bulgaria can discover the conspiration and destroy us sooner than we expected."
 serpuppet.13.a: "Pray for Serbia."

 serpuppet.14.t: "Independence Succeeds"
 serpuppet.14.d: "We were able to maintain sufficient stealth throughout our conspiracy, the Bulgarians did not expect us to rebel, which gives us the advantage by surprise."
 serpuppet.14.a: "We have the high ground."

 serpuppet.15.t: "Conspiration Failed"
 serpuppet.15.d: "We couldn't be discreet enough, Bulgaria was suspicious of what we were doing, they sent troops to strategic points and arrested some members of the conspiracy. The rebellion failed, we are not powerful enough to take over the strategic points. We can no longer be independent."
 serpuppet.15.a: "It's over."

 serpuppet.16.t: "Conspiration Discovered!"
 serpuppet.16.d: "Bulgaria found out what we were doing, they preferred to prevent rather than cure, the Bulgarian armies are preparing to crush us."
 serpuppet.16.a: "Our fate is sealed."

 serpuppet.17.t: "We Managed to Declare Independence"
 serpuppet.17.d: "While Bulgaria had its back turned we managed to become independent. But not by surprise, some seemed to have informed them about it..."
 serpuppet.17.a: "To death."

 serflavor.1.t: "The Belgrade Pact"
 serflavor.1.d: "The newspapers of Bulgaria are abuzz today with news coming from Serbia - the diplomatic event which many saw as years in the making, a pact between Serbians, Romanians and Greeks, has finally been finalised, and the Belgrade Pact has thus been born. Few view this agreement naively - the Bulgarian political consensus, no matter if it leans left or right, understands that the signatories of the treaty will use it as a weapon against Bulgaria.\n\nSome were more alarmist than others. The largest daily newspaper in Sofia, "Utro", printed in large bold letters: "WAR IS COMING! SERBS MOBILISE TO SEIZE MACEDONIA!". The alarm came in reference to one of the proclaimed goals of the Congress of Belgrade, which is to "call for a new order in the Balkans", which Bulgarian conservatives could only interpret as a call to topple Greater Bulgaria. The same newspaper print also included an article by Nikola Zhekov, general in the Bulgarian Army, who asserted that Bulgaria is completely unprepared to wage a war and the only solution is to immediately plead for mediation from Germany and Austria-Hungary. To work with the Germans, who exploited us so brutally during the Weltkrieg, was considered inconceivable not too long ago, and it might still be, but as of today, anything goes...\n\nSerbian, Turkish and Greek representatives in the National Assembly stood in support of the Pact - the Romanian delegation from constituencies in Dobrudja was more reserved, however. Their equivalent future liberator is the extremist Iron Guard, after all..."
 serflavor.1.a: "We'll keep the Tricolour flying here!"

 serflavor.2.t: "The Return of the Karađorđević"
 serflavor.2.d: "Established in 1925, the Serbian Republic was radical, overtaken by left-wing agitators who inspired the Bulgarian left across the border, and increasingly militaristic - however, at least they did not have the accursed House of Karađorđević on the throne. This changed today, as in a bloody coup, the secret royalist military society White Hand has overthrown the recently elected government of Serbia and declared the restoration of the Kingdom in a half-empty Skupština. The heir of the Serbian throne and the son of Aleksandar II Karađorđević, Prince Petar, is expected to arrive to Belgrade in a couple of days.\n\nThe House of Karađorđević seized power in Serbia after the slaughter of Aleksandar I and the entire Obrenović dynasty by the Black Hand, and they held nothing but disdain for the Bulgarian peoples of Macedonia. Both Petar II and Aleksandar II endorsed Serbianisation campaigns in the region after seizing it in the Balkan Wars, humiliating the local population by forcing them to declare themselves as Serbs, and often resorting to terror. Alas, they were not overthrown during the Weltkrieg and stayed in power, though in a mere rump state - and it appears even a Republican revolution cannot keep them down for too long.\n\nThe news from Belgrade have galvanised the Bulgarian population and further sharpened conflict in the Niš region, all while dealing a blow to the republican cause in Sofia. The officer corps is resolute and takes these news with pride, however - if history has made a mistake and restored Aleksandar's child on the throne, then it shall be up to Bulgarian shoulders to rectify it."
 serflavor.2.a: "We shall avenge the occupation of Macedonia, once more!"

 serflavor.3.t: "Ljotić's Speech"
 serflavor.3.d: "The right wing of the Serbian political spectrum, beyond the People's Radical Party and the Agrarians, is mainly composed of monarchists, and among them two movements are the most notable. The State Party of Serbian Democrats was the sole legal party of Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship and lingers on as a small moderate monarchist party, concentrated in a few constituencies where they are the strongest, and as they were too insignificant to threaten the republican order, they were allowed to remain legal after the Revolution. The second is a party formed after the Revolution for a new generation of monarchists, named Buđenje ("Awakening"), and its leader, Dimitrije Ljotić, has been slowly making a name for himself.\n\nSpeaking before the Skupština, Ljotić addressed what he perceives the key issues of the Serbian republic - the death of God in a nation overtaken by lust and contempt, and the daily, endless crushing of souls by the "sledgehammer of capitalism" which the past governments have enabled with their policies. The politician's esoteric way of speaking convinced few and made him few allies in the legislature, but it was characteristic of the so-called "Mita Bogomoljac" ("Devotionalist Mita"). Even back when he was an official in King Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship and a deputy from Smederevo, Ljotić was unnerving to his peers. He declared his service to the Karađorđević to be divine providence, that the Serbian people to have a God-bestowed mission in the world, and his Orthodox faith was beyond even the fanatical.\n\nLeading a far-right extremist, nationalist royalist party, Ljotić is a minnow on the political stage and so has been allowed to remain for now - but who knows where he might end up if the circumstances change?.."
 serflavor.3.a: "We will watch him closely."

 serflavor.4.t: "Shots in the Dark"
 serflavor.4.d: "The news reports are still flying in and the story is still being pieced back together, but here is what is already known.\n\nMajor Živan Knežević, an induct into the Konspiracija secret society and an officer in the Serbian Army, was making his way home in Belgrade alongside a fellow soldier, when the two of them realised that they were being followed. Not wishing to take the risk, the two men hastened their pace, hoping to either come across civilians to use as cover or a phone booth to call the police, but neither came. Instead, the mysterious assailants opened fire, seriously wounding Knežević and killing his peer - wounded, the officer was dragged out of sight and so was the corpse besides him.\n\nIt took the police two days to be informed about the officer's disappearance, and a search across Belgrade was immediately initiated - Knežević was found, but by then, it was already too late, as he was long since dead. Police officers found his corpse in the outskirts of the city, and it was left with a message:\n\n"Thus unto all enemies of God, the King, and the White Hand!""
 serflavor.4.a: "How dare they..."

 serflavor.5.t: "Revenge"
 serflavor.5.d: "Once again, the law enforcement of the Republic has been mobilised after reports of a committed high profile murder - and this time, it took only a few hours before officers in Kragujevac were met with a horrifying sight in the poor districts of the city - several officers from the Serbian Army, relieved a few years ago because of suspicions that they belonged to the White Hand, stabbed and hanged by their feet publicly. A few children playing football around the block explained that some strange looking men hanged them there not too long ago.\n\nOnly the dimmest failed to realise who was behind these murders. Not only was Major Živan Knežević a respected member of the Serbian Cultural Club and the secret organisation behind it, but he was also the brother of Radoje Knežević, a commander in the Serbian Air Force, a leading member of the Republican Party and the Konspiracija. While the military is understandably silent about the events, and Knežević merely expressed his solemn grief at his brother's death, it's almost certain that these assassinations were made as an act of righteous revenge.\n\nAnd, again, much like everyone expected, the police closed the case a few days later, stating that 'the investigation will pause for the time being as no possible suspect has been found'."
 serflavor.5.a: "We are a stable democratic republic, please believe us!"

 serflavor.6.t: "The Fourth Balkan War"
 serflavor.6.d: "In the first two decades of the twentieth century, three Balkan Wars shook the region - two were local affairs, fought only between the Balkan states themselves, whereas the third is more commonly known as the Balkan front of the Weltkrieg. For almost two decades after its conclusion, worldwide observers expected it to be the last, too. After all, the Weltkrieg left Bulgaria a hegemon in the Balkans and its three competitors shattered, held down by oppressive peace treaties for having chosen the wrong side, and divorced from much of their core lands. Surely, in a Europe redrawn according to Germany's whim, there is no room for revanchist ambitions in the Balkans.\n\nIt is clear today, as thousands of men across the region take up arms, that those predictions were wrong. Was it the weakness of so-called "Greater Bulgaria" which was at fault? Or does the blame fall to Austria and Germany for having grown complacent towards the Balkans and not stopped the rearmament of the Balkan states? By now, the answer does not matter - only bloodshed will ensue.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that the Fourth Balkan War will escalate into a worldwide conflict, as none of the great powers treat it as a proxy war against one another just yet, there are still potential participants in the war lying in wait - and nobody knows what the result of it will be. Can Bulgaria defend its fragile hegemony over the Balkan region and make it stand the test of time? Or will the Belgrade Pact achieve the "new order in the Balkans" which it calls for?"
 serflavor.6.a: "Forward!"

 serflavor.7.t: "Zenitism"
 serflavor.7.d: "The loss in the Weltkrieg marked a fundamental change in Serbian society, and its culture was no exception. An absolute majority of Serbian males died in the war, and almost a quarter of its total population, while the few who remained had to return to burned homes, looted towns, abandoned farms and broken dreams. To cope, many turned to art to express their frustration and sorrow - and yet, the onset of Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship stymied the development of Serbian art and culture under heavy censorship. The Republican Revolution of 1925 let this pent up energy loose, and the following decade has left its mark in Serbian culture as a period of avant-garde art, literature, and cultural critique. Few movements were more exemplary of this period than Zenitism, named after the arts magazine "Zenit".\n\nFounded by Ljubomir Micić, Ivan Gol and Boško Tokin, it publishes articles on modern society, art reviews, and cultural publications. While contributors to the magazine are numerous, a common strand of anti-war, anti-nationalist and anti-capitalist thought runs through it - and, above them all, modern, "western" society. What was the reason why Serbia suffered so much, Micić and his associates ponder in the pages of Zenit? It is because Serbia, having chosen to abandon its unique Balkan spirit and communal, peaceful culture, sold its soul to a greater European civilisation and the cold, heartless machine of modern capitalism. That machine gave the modern tools of war to Serbia with which she killed itself. Some describe Zenitism as anarcho-primitivist, pointing out their scathing critique of modern technology and its lifeless lifestyle, while others see it as taking their thought too literally.\n\nAs 1936 turns, Zenit and the Serbian avant-garde continue their course, even though, as years pass and memory of Weltkrieg devastation grows duller, they become seen as unpatriotic rather than visionary."
 serflavor.7.a: "The youths are troublesome as always"

 serflavor.8.t: "Aurora Borealis Sighted"
 serflavor.8.d: "Much of Europe, including Serbia, was met with a shocking sight tonight - an aurora borealis, extending as far as the Mediterranean and colouring the sky in blood-red colour. For many, this was a beauty to behold, but the superstitious immediately took this as a sign from the God above. Clearly, with such a show, he was trying to tell the people something - though, was it a warning, a favour or a threat.\n\nThe most striking interpretation came from a Serbian preacher in the Morava countryside, who interpreted this as a sign of the first thing. It was a warning, and no ordinary warning, to the people of Europe - in his town and surrounding villages, he proclaimed that God is aware of an impending apocalypse, and one not driven by the four horsemen, but rather by the peoples of Europe themselves. In less than ten years, the rivers of the continent will run red with blood much like the sky ran red that night, a ferocious eagle, its wingspan large enough to cover Europe, will fight a storm of ice and snow from the east, and declare itself a defender of the world from a pure evil... yet its heart is just as dark as the evil it claims to fight.\n\nA fascinating tale. The panic caused among the superstitious is anything but fascinating, however."
 serflavor.8.a: "Stop looking at the sky!"

 serflavor.9.t: "The First and the Second Revolution"
 serflavor.9.d: "One of the most renown political philosophers and legal professors in the republic of Serbia, Slobodan Jovanović, has published a revision to one of his first works, "Political and Legal Discussions" ("Političke i pravne rasprave"), and its most important change was the addition of a new preface and introduction. In this preface, Jovanović made a leap forward and described the events of 1925-1926 not as "the Republican Revolution", but as "the second Serbian Revolution".\n\nThe first Serbian revolution referred to by Jovanović was the famous three-decades-long Serbian Revolution, led by Karađorđe Petrović and numerous other heroes of Serbian history, which happened concurrently with the Greek War of Independence and culminated in the recognition of the vassal Principality of Serbia. It is generally seen as the beginning of modern Serbian history and the first step in its long journey to independence. Jovanović explains his decision to name it "First" later in the text - the "Second" Serbian Revolution, of the post-Weltkrieg period, should be understood not as an independent event, but as the culmination of the ideals of Karađorđe and the first Serbian revolutionaries.\n\nFrom this initial statement, there are numerous conclusions to be made. The Serbian people live a history marked by redemptive struggle in the name of freedom and liberty, be it for their freedom from foreign oppressors, or their freedom from unjust government. The democracy which they enjoy should not be understood as a Western import, but rather as a development of unique Serbian culture and identity - and vice versa, democracy should be considered a core element of Serbian identity."
 serflavor.9.a: "The Serbian tricolour flies for freedom!"

 serflavor.10.t: "The Dinaric Race"
 serflavor.10.d: "The concept of the "Dinaric Race", created by Western racial scientists in the late 19th century as a way to classify the peoples of southeastern Europe, had been hijacked by pan-Slavic nationalists since the earliest days. As the most radical current in the Yugoslavism ideology, it describes Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Bosniaks and Macedonians as a part of a single "race", and that the differences between them arose of historical separation rather than any inherent differences.\n\nA notable early supporter of ideas which would later form Dinarism was Jovan Cvijić, Serbian geographer and geologist who used the environmental conditions of the Balkans to describe the formation of this joint South Slavic identity. Across the border from Serbia, these ideas are most prominently developed by the Croat philosopher Vladimir Dvorniković, who declares in his writings that the South Slavs need to unite for mutual interests, much like Germans and Italians in the 19th century. His views include eugenics and cultural blending to build this strong Yugoslav "race", and a comprehensive description of unitarist Yugoslavian philosophy. Dimitrije Ljotić and his political party are the closest to propagating the Dinarist line in Serbian politics."
 serflavor.10.a: "...what odd ideas."

 serflavor.11.t: "The Last Vojvoda"
 serflavor.11.d: "Not long after the beginning of the war against Bulgaria, we have received an unexpected letter from Petar Bojović, the famous commander of the Serbian Army during the Weltkrieg. Of the four Vojvodas - the highest-ranking commanders of the Serbian Army before and during the Weltkrieg, equivalent to Field Marshals - he is the last one still alive, and after over a decade of retirement, he has once again offered his services to the Serbian nation, for what he describes as "a service in the name of the Fatherland for one last time, while the body still allows it".\n\nVojvoda Bojović has accrued fame as one of the most skilled military commanders in Serbian history, leading the exiles of the Army after the occupation of Serbia, fighting side by side with the Greeks and French in the Thessaloniki Front, and defeating numerically superior Austrian and Bulgarian forces. While he is eighty years of age and has been out of practice for a long time, our commanders in the Serbian Army advise to accept his enlistment - at least out of sheer respect for the legendary figure, as he was a symbol or a mentor for many of them."

 serflavor.12.d: "Upon returning to the Serbian Army, Vojvoda Bojović brought with himself a letter, which, according to the general's instruction, was to be given directly to the teenage King, Petar II. Respecting the legendary commander's order, the Regency did as requested, and the King received it without a hitch. It read:\n\n"To His Majesty, Petar Karađorđević,\n\nHearing the news about your return, I could not be more overjoyed. Your father was a friend of mine and a true patriot, as much as some may try to say otherwise. However, I also understand that a difficult task has been placed upon your shoulders, and it will only grow greater as time passes - I sincerely hope that you will manage to bear it, and become the King which the Serbian people need. You are still young and you never saw your homeland in your life - my peers say that will make you weak, but it makes me hopeful instead. Is there a better way for the Serbs to join the brotherhood of Western nations than through a King who grew up in the West, and understands the crux of their success?\n\nAs you mature, learn, and take up your royal duties, I wish for you to remember one thing. Our soldiers go to war with the battle cry "For King and Fatherland!" ("Za kralja i otadžbinu"). A Serb will always love his Fatherland - but his love for the King has to be earned. Karađorđe made it clear that the Serbian king serves the good of his people, and to be a good King, you should do follow that advice.\n\nVojvoda Petar Bojović""
 serflavor.12.a: "I will keep that in mind..."

 serflavor.13.t: "The Entente and the Serbs"
 serflavor.13.d: "As time passes and Serbia increasingly asserts itself in the world, the question of its future in foreign affairs begins to rise. Once the South Slavs are united and Serbia truly a power to be reckoned with in the region, which foreign alliance shall it join itself with, if any? For a country with its geopolitical position, several choices are available, each one with their ups and downs. The Entente is often mentioned among these discussions - and for some, they may appear to be a natural choice. After all, it was the British and French empires that the Serbs fought side by side with during the Weltkrieg, and their third-power status means that Serbia would be able to more easily stay away of the greatest wars of Europe while not being completely vulnerable.\n\nThese ideas are being squashed by the President, however. Though he has seldom hidden his hatred for the British Empire before, Dragomir Vasić has now made it even more clear to his cabinet and his peers in the Republican-led coalition. Speaking to Nikola Milovanović, the President did not mince his words:\n\n"There shall be no alliance between Serbia and the British Empire. Not only that, but in a liberated Yugoslavia, I will do everything in my power to establish a department which will study and nurture hatred of the British! I have already told this to Grol, but if I could, I would wage all the little nations in the world to a war against them."\n\nEven in their dismantled, exiled state in Canada, the British monarchy symbolised the worst aspects of colonialism and exploitation to Vasić, and he was not going to let it slide."
 serflavor.13.a: "Mr President, you are overreacting..."

 serflavor.14.t: "President Vasić's Last Speech"
 serflavor.14.d: "Having served for two entire terms, Dragomir Vasić has been the head of state of the Serbian Republic for much of its existence, his political thought and policies defining the nation's path since the Republican Revolution. The two term limit has finally caught up to him, however, and upon the conclusion of this year's election, the outgoing President has made his way before the newly elected Skupština to give one last speech to the parliamentarians.\n\nThe President's speech could be divided into two parts. In the first, he congratulated his fellow Serbs for their dedication to the values of the Republic, and the sacrifices they have made in war and peace alike. It was a difficult task to lead Serbia when he has personally experienced the horrors of war and knew what he would resign his fellow Serbs to. After this recognition came a warning, however. The Balkans and all of Europe remain infested with tyrants. Absolutists, Syndicalists and extreme nationalists continue to oppress their own people and will surely seek to put out the light of liberty in Serbia in the years that follow. To counter that, Vasić gave Serbia his advice - to stand their guard no matter how overwhelming the odds may be, and find a coalition of like-minded nations with whom they may protect democracy together. As the first Serbian Revolution, led by Karađorđe, has proven, the Serbian people value their freedom above all else and Vasić expressed hope that they will continue to do so for centuries to come.\n\nIt is believed that after leaving office, the President will return to literary and educational work - he was a prolific writer before, and the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade has already expressed interest in giving him a position in their professor ranks."
 serflavor.14.a: "So long, Čiča Dragiša!"

 serflavor.15.t: "Prince Paul's Visit"
 serflavor.15.d: "The Kingdom of Serbia has received a prestigious visitor today - Prince Pavle, the cousin of the late King Aleksandar II and thus uncle of the reigning monarch, Petar II. The Prince arrived from Canada by plane, met by a humble delegation from Petar Živković's regency council which brought him to the restored Royal Palace, where he met his nephew and the Regent. There, he was briefed on the achievements made by the Royalists ever since the beginning of the Regime of November 6th - the destruction of republicanism and a restoration of Serbian national pride cited immediately.\n\nPavle did not seem to pay much attention to the description of the political situation, and soon requested to speak to his nephew in private. The generally careless and inattentive Prince turned serious for a second and explained his concerns - could Petar not see that Živković, Ljotić and their men were merely trying to restore what his father had once built? A dictatorial regime, with a King at the top, which will merely turn the populace more furious and force them to turn to the same violent means as retaliation. It was this failure to understand the people which led to Petar's father's death.\n\nNow, Pavle asserted that he didn't have a perfect solution - in fact, the Prince stated that if he somehow became the Regent himself, he would do a far, far worse job than Živković - however, he instead raised a question to Petar: what will he do when he assumes full powers? The Regency will not last forever, after all. Will he meekly accept the authoritarian order or will he try to accomplish something new?"
 serflavor.15.a: "The Regency knows this country better than I ever could."
 serflavor.15.b: "We both saw the system in Canada. It works... and perhaps it can work here, too."

 serflavor.16.t: "Visiting Uncle Carol"
 serflavor.16.d: "Though still under the close supervision of the Regency, King Petar II has nonetheless been deemed mature enough to join official state delegations to foreign nations - the first of them being Serbia's neighbour and close ally, Romania. For the young monarch, this was not merely a state visit, either, but a family reunion as well - through his mother Maria, Petar II was the nephew of Carol II of Romania. The assassination of Aleksandar II had thus shaken the Romanian royal family as well, especially once his wife and Carol's sister fled to her homeland.\n\nThe young King's motorcade in Bucharest was greeted by jubilant crowds. Under orders, his vehicle stopped by an assembly of Serbian monarchists exiled in Romania ever since the Republican Era - many of whom had formed close ties with the Iron Guard during the following years, seeing Codreanu's salvationist ideology as the best way to restore Serbia's strength, and so hailed their monarch with a Legionary salute. After official diplomatic ceremonies, Petar was invited to the Royal Palace, where he shook hands with "Uncle Carol" and met his cousin, Crown Prince Mihai. The two members of the next generation of Balkan royalty quickly found common ground and left a positive impression on each other, to the point where Petar even offered Mihai to visit Serbia next time."
 serflavor.16.a: "The start of a beneficial friendship?"

 serflavor.17.t: "Lapčević's Speech"
 serflavor.17.d: "Though Serbia looms closer and closer to war, not all in the republic are eager for it. Today, on the podium before the Skupština, a speech has been made by Dragomir Lapčević, representative from the Socialist Party of Serbia. An elderly veteran of socialist politics in Serbia, Lapčević was one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party of Serbia to which both Socialist and Socialist Workers claim primogeniture, and a critic of the legendary Dimitrije Tucović. Even before the Weltkrieg, Lapčević earned fame as a vehement opponent of war and Serbian militarism, and today he spoke with the same purpose behind him.\n\nIn his speech, the politician vividly detailed the loss which the Serbian nation suffered the last time when they instigated a foolish war - an entire generation dead or wounded, and the few who remain have been forced to pick up the pieces. If they had sworn in 1918 to never suffer such travesty again, then it seems that their leaders have completely forgotten these losses. Not only that, Lapčević states, but the President and his government have lied to the entire nation about their motives, and to the world as well. They claim to fight for the liberation of the Serbs, but in fact, they are controlled by an ultranationalist, Codreanite clique in the military, which will subvert democracy if it means sending thousands of Serbs to the meatgrinder in Macedonia.\n\nThe speech and its content, if it spreads across the public, is bound to galvanise the population and raise doubt so close to the war against Bulgaria. And yet, is it right to suppress the voice of an opponent and thus, ultimately, prove his point right?"
 serflavor.17.a: "I hate what he says, but defend his right to say it."
 serflavor.17.b: "Censor the official publications."

 serflavor.18.t: "Constitutional Project Discussions"
 serflavor.18.d: "Under the order of Petar Živković, the Regency government of the Kingdom of Serbia has formed a committee for the drafting of a new Constitution, one which shall be implemented as soon as King Petar II reaches maturity. As it will certainly define the future of the state for years, if not decades, it is a matter of utmost national importance, and as such important monarchist politicians and leading legal scholars alike have been invited to voice their opinions. There are a handful of red lines, however. The consensus among the handpicked delegates from the Radical Peasants' Democracy is that the Constitution must guarantee a strong regime, with a lot of reserve powers for the King and the curtailment of what they describe as "mob rule".\n\nThe teenage King, Petar II, has been invited to attend constitutional project discussions as well - and while he is by no means a professional in matters of constitutional law, he does have a vision of his own, inherited from a long time spent in Canada. Though it is unlikely that anyone will listen to him, he has an urge to intervene in the legal discussions and offer more democratic solutions..."
 serflavor.18.a: "What the Regency offers must be the right path."
 serflavor.18.b: "Petar II intervenes in the discussions despite his inexperience."

 serflavor.19.t: "The King's First Radio Address"
 serflavor.19.d: "Though our King by the Grace of God, Petar II, has reigned in Serbia for years now, and he is rapidly maturing, the average Serb is unfamiliar with him. Petar II has stayed in relative isolation ever since his arrival to Belgrade, tutored by his regents and kept mostly out of the public eye. This cannot stay forever, however, and to facilitate the monarch's connection with his future subjects, he has been recruited to make his first radio address to the Serbian people.\n\nA relatively simple address in a similar style to the State of the Union addresses across the Atlantic, it is expected to simply inform the listeners on the news from the government and their goals for the following year - though, to avoid it sounding completely robotic to the public, the script allows some leeway for the speaker. Of course, the main theme of the address has to be kept - but perhaps there is room for a few criticisms towards the regime in between the meaningless appeals to patriotism?"
 serflavor.19.a: "The King sticks to the script."
 serflavor.19.b: "The King sprinkles opinions of his own."

 serflavor.20.t: "Conflict within the Skupština"
 serflavor.20.d: "While President Milan Stojadinović and the Radicals under him have managed to form a coalition of the entire right, such a vast "great" union comes with its own issues and internal conflicts. One of the most glaring to have begun recently is one between the President and the chairman of the extremist Buđenje political party, Dimitrije Ljotić. Frequently, these two men have been seen conflicting with one another in the halls of the Skupština, their controlling personalities unable to live with one another much like two scorpions could not live in one bottle.\n\nIn speeches before the fellow parliamentarians as well as to the public, Ljotić began speaking out increasingly harsh towards his fellow coalition members, claiming that they have lost the support of the divine and that the sickness of one of the ministers of the cabinet was God's judgment for the heretical and un-Serbian policies enacted by the incumbent government. Needless to say, Buđenje has been kicked out of the coalition after a mere month of participation, but the experience has soured the people's opinion of the government."
 serflavor.20.a: "How is that man not in a psychiatric ward?!"

 serflavor.21.t: "The Defence of Belgrade"
 serflavor.21.d: "Today marks the 25th anniversary of the defence of the city of Belgrade - on October 7th, 1915, Austro-Hungarian and German forces crossed the Sava and Belgrade rivers to engage the undermanned defenders of the city. Despite inferior numbers, equipment, and supplies, the overrun Serbian forces were not outdone and put up the best challenge to the attacking forces as they could.\n\nThe high point of Serbian heroism during the battle came from the Second Battalion of the 10th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Major Dragutin Gavrilović. Alongside with the Belgrade Gendarmerie and local volunteers, they were the first line of defence against the advancing enemy forces and marched to battle with the grim knowledge that they will fall one by one for Belgrade and the Fatherland. In a final act of defiance, Major Gavrilović gave a rousing speech where he announced to his men that their regiment has been erased from the records of the Army, hence there is little for them to do except go forward to glory, for King and Country.\n\nThe valiant defence of the Serbian defenders did not prove to be enough and the White City fell, but under the orders of Field Marshal August von Mackensen, a monument was erected in Austrian-occupied Belgrade, which still says "Here Rest Serbian Heroes" and which is the centre of the procession today. Soldiers of the army salute the humble monument and widows of the defenders of Belgrade place flowers before it.\n\nSome would say that their sacrifice was in vain, as Serbia was ultimately subjugated and had to spend almost two decades languishing under Austrian and Bulgarian domination. Others are more apologetic - after all, Serbia has managed to rise from those ashes since, and does that not make up for it?"
 serflavor.21.a: "They fought until their last dying breath."

 serflavor.22.t: "The Second Toplica Uprising"
 serflavor.22.d: "Sparked by years of festering resentment towards Bulgaria rule, the destitution of many Serbian farmers during the post-Black Monday economic crisis, and finally the further inflaming of Serbo-Bulgarian tensions because of Operation Nishava, an uprising has broken out in the Toplica region. While this uprising is far from the first in the territory Bulgaria annexed from Serbia during the Weltkrieg, it has surpassed others in size and ferocity. Over two thousand armed insurgents were reported occupying several towns by the Bulgarian military.\n\nThe response of the Bulgarian Army was characteristically brutal. Regiments of the Ohrana, the successors to the chetas of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation organised into self-defence groups, were the first to respond, using acts of terror and intimidation to quell resistance in the region, often with significant civilian casualties. Once the Bulgarian Army joined the response efforts, the Chetniks were driven to the mountains, the town of Prokuplje was burned down after a prolonged firefight, and reprisals against the population began.\n\nThe members of the Belgrade Pact condemned the atrocities almost immediately - especially Serbia, which declared that it will defend the interests and safety of its Serbian inhabitants by any means necessary. Bulgarian officials rebutted the claims, and accused the government in Belgrade of sponsoring the resistance in turn. Whether it was true or not, Serbia now had a justification to attack - and as both countries mass units on their border, it seems they are ready to use it."
 serflavor.22.a: "That's the moment we have been waiting for!"
 serflavor.22.b: "They shouldn't have gotten carried away..."

 serflavor.23.t: "The Rise of the Conspiracy"
 serflavor.23.d: "Though Serbia owes its republican democracy to the Konspiracija and the other secret conspirators within the Serbian Army, it appears that their influence over the country has grown greater than anyone could have anticipated. A cabinet which is not approved by the militarists has little chance of surviving for more than a few months, more and more resources are being diverted strictly to army matters, and nationalist fanaticism grows more and more powerful in public society.\n\nSome even suspect a possible coup, or worse - after all, how could one possibly trust an organisation inspired by the Black Hand itself?"
 serflavor.23.a: "No good..."

 serflavor.24.t: "The Man with a Hundred Faces"
 serflavor.24.d: "They thought he was dead - certainly, assassinating reactionaries across the world under the aegis of Britain's R.E.D. had to have come back to bite him one day, he must have vanished years ago for a good reason... And yet, the legendary assassin from the Black Hand, Mustafa Golubić, made his presence known to our government today, arriving to Belgrade with no fanfare and introducing himself to our officials. After the end of the Weltkrieg, Golubić fled Serbia after threatening to kill Aleksandar II, ended up in Vienna, joined Britain's secret service and spent the following decade adventuring across the world, furthering the cause of Syndicalism the only way he knew how, via the bullet.\n\nHearing Serbia's turn to the world revolution, Golubić arrived to give his humble congratulations. Though requested to stay in Serbia and train its secret services, the assassin declined, stating that he cannot stay in a single country with his skills - however, he can aid his Serbian peers in organising an assassination. Where shall we put his services in, however?.."

 serflavor.25.t: "String of Disappearances"
 serflavor.25.d: "Within a short period of time, several officials in our ministry of defence and the army have either vanished or turned up dead - assassinated, by an unknown assailant, whether a private individual or a foreign government hostile to ours. Only one testimony has given us any sort of lead - and it claims that they witnessed Mustafa Golubić, a legendary assassin who vanished during the Interwar period and was presumed dead. It has since been dismissed as extremely unlikely."
 serflavor.25.a: "The man with a hundred faces..."

 serflavor.26.t: "The Legacy of Stefan Dušan"
 serflavor.26.d: "The impossible has happened. After a victorious campaign against the Ottoman army, Serbian soldiers march across the streets of Constantinople, admiring the historic buildings and establishing administration for a long military occupation. So little time has passed since the time when Serbia was a minnow in the Balkans, much less the world - now, it reigns over the City of the World's Desire.\n\nFor the Serbian people, Constantinople is not merely a city, it is a symbol. It was supposed to be the crown jewel of Stefan Dušan, the first Tsar of the Serbs, who expanded the medieval Serbian principality to its largest extent, with the dream of crafting a new Roman Empire with the Serbs at its head. Alas, as he mounted a crusade against the Turks, he died prematurely, leading to the collapse of his Empire and the beginning of the end for the Balkans.\n\nFrom there, everyone knows how history went. Though Serbs and the other Slavs fought bravely, resisted, bit back in the fields of Kosovo and elsewhere, they were subjugated one after another, and centuries of despised Turkish yoke followed. Today, the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia have achieved what Tsar Dušan could not, and the Ottoman Empire has been forced to its knees.\n\nAs a symbolic act, King Petar II has been invited to attend the occupation of Constantinople for a brief ceremony - where, inside the Hagia Sophia, he was crowned in the style of the first Tsar as the historical sources tell us, and granted the title of "Tsar of the Serbs". It may have little weight now, in a world where the Roman Empire has long since fallen and imperial dreams no longer matter, but it shall forever act as a sign that the Serbs will never be subjugated again."
 serflavor.26.a: "Centuries of Turkish yoke, avenged at last!"

 serflavor.27.t: "The Royal Compound"
 serflavor.27.d: "In 1924, King Aleksandar II began the construction of a new Royal Palace in the prestigious Dedinje neighbourhood in Belgrade. It was supposed to be a compound of several palaces, buildings, a garden and a chapel, constructed in Serbo-Byzantine style and adorned with the King's vast collection of art. The Revolution of 1925 interrupted the construction works and left them unfinished, however, and the Republican regime ceased the construction. The Thatched House, where King Aleksandar II used to reside and oversee the construction, was returned to the public and parts of the unfinished Palace were turned into a museum.\n\nToday, the Regency considers continuing the construction, although a decade of neglect will make it costly, which got moderates from the former Radical Party to offer another solution. During the Republican period. the traitors built a palace for their Presidents in the heart of Belgrade, a simple and functionalistic building which pales in comparison to European royal palaces, but possibly good enough for the Royal Family regardless. In addition, such a move would show the Republicans that a fall of the monarchy is now a distant dream."
 serflavor.27.a: "The Royal Palace shall be completed!"
 serflavor.27.b: "We shall turn the Presidential Palace into the King's home!"

 serflavor.28.t: "Legacy of the Southern Colonisation Decree"
 serflavor.28.d: "In 1919, King Aleksandar II signed the Decree on the Colonisation of the Southern Provinces into law, as one of the key features of postwar land reform in the Kingdom of Serbia. This decree ordered the abolition of serfdom and sharecropping in Kosovo, the expropriation of estates formerly held by Albanian and Turkish landowners, and the settlement of Serbian war veterans in these vacant holdings. This marked a period of ethnic settlement in Kosovo, expulsion of thousands of Albanians, and ensuing conflict.\n\nTo the Serbs, Kosovo holds sentimental value as the location of the legendary Battle of Kosovo in the 14th century, and the official line of the Serbian government was that the Albanians were recent settlers, brought by the Ottoman Turks, and thus integration of Kosovo into Serbia was seen as a righting of a historical wrong. Finally, thousands of war veterans were on the streets of Serbia, they had been promised land during the Weltkrieg, and Aleksandar's Royal Dictatorship was anxious to satisfy their demands to avoid rebellion. The colonisation of Kosovo was deemed to be a failure, however. Kosovo remained staunchly Albanian and the population was left inflamed, and many of the colonists returned home or emigrated to the West after failing to make a living.\n\nThe colonisation was disrupted by the Republican Revolution, although some settlement continued for a few years before the Decree was finally abolished in 1931. Still, the scars of its legacy are as clear as day in Kosovo, and it will take a long time for the region to heal."
 serflavor.28.a: "The Albanians are still resisting?"
 serflavor.28.b: "The Decree was a mistake, but Kosovo should be ours."

 serflavor.29.t: "SKK Agitation"
 serflavor.29.d: "Seeking to expand itself into all sections of Serbian political society, the Serbian Cultural Club is recruiting new members, reaching out through personal contacts to numerous members of the Skupština and party officials in order to attract them into club meetings and discipline them closer to the Club's patriotic, irredentist line.\n\nEver since it was founded in the early '30s, as a civilian arm of the Konspiracija and its plotting in Serbian life, it has sought to integrate politicians, intellectuals and artists from the entire ideological spectrum - and their official ideological line of a strong Serbian identity in a strong Serbian nation can appeal to bleeding-heart socialists and aggressive nationalists alike."

 serflavor.29.b: "Try to obstruct their actions"

 serflavor.30.t: "Konspiracija Requests a Minister's Removal"
 serflavor.30.d: "Our cabinet has been approached by General Borivoje Mirković, one of the leading members of the Konspiracija organisation in the military, and he has come bearing troubling news. The Army has issues with the presence of one of the lesser ministers in our cabinet - as General Mirković informed us, that minister has been actively agitating against the remilitarisation of Serbia and the "beneficial relationship" which the Serbian Army has established with the civilian government ever since 1926.\n\nIn fact, the General also came to us with an immediate replacement - a loyal colonel in the Serbian Army who is more than qualified to fulfil the duties of the ministry, and will not be anywhere as problematic. It falls to [GetSecondInCommand] and the rest of the cabinet to decide on whether they will follow through with the demand."

 serflavor.31.t: "Bojović Retires"
 serflavor.31.d: "The "Last Vojvoda", Petar Bojović, has officially handed his resignation from military command to the chief of staff of the Serbian Army today - stating that he has fulfilled his final duty to the Serbian state. Almost eighty years old, he no longer sees himself capable to continue much further - and while his peers are impressed by his skill and acumen like always, the Vojvoda asserted in his letter that he should not be overestimated. A long time has passed since the Weltkrieg, and the wars of the modern-day are completely different from what he has grown up under - this difference in technology, tactics, and geopolitics is something he believes he will never fully overcome.\n\nBojović has entrusted the new generation of Serbs to do better than him - they are a persistent people, and will surely find their way in the wars of today as long as they put their heart to it. He will retire to a humble home in Belgrade instead."

 serflavor.35.t: "Royalist Coup In Serbia!"
 serflavor.35.d: "Shocking news from Belgrade: almost 11 years after its foundation, the Republic of Serbia is no more! According to reports, a coup was launched by rightist Chetnik paramilitaries angered by the entrance of socialists into the government, sponsored by the royalist circle known as the 'White Hand'.\n\nPetar Živković, the coup’s mastermind and the White Hand’s leader, has implemented martial law and is expected to soon invite the royal family from their exile in Canada. While the young heir Petar is believed to have liberal sympathies, his youth will require a regent from a group of monarchists radicalised against democracy: and so it seems that the days of the Royal Dictatorship of Alexander II have returned."

 serflavor.36.t: "The Return of the King"
 serflavor.36.d: "The foreign office of Serbia has received a new and unexpected message from Canada - it comes from the heir and current claimant of the Kingdom of Serbia, Petar Karađorđević. Taken from his home in Belgrade when he was merely two years old, the Crown Prince was tutored by Prince Pavle in Canada, where he ingratiated himself with the British nobility and lived a life far removed from his homeland. Now that he has matured, however, a patriotic call to return to his homeland has pushed him to ask whether he has a chance to return.\n\nThe Crown Prince has sworn that upon returning home, he will renounce his claim to the Serbian throne and live the rest of his life as a private citizen in Belgrade. In addition, he swears to avoid political affairs, and will not back any monarchist organisations in Serbia seeking to achieve his restoration. Even then, however, the heir's presence in Serbia would certainly mobilise local royalist agitators - so is it worth it to grant Petar the right to return?"
 serflavor.36.a: "He can return as a private citizen."
 serflavor.36.b: "No, the Republic will never allow him to return."

 serflavor.37.t: "The Fifth Balkan War"
 serflavor.37.d: "The Serbian armies gather on the border with the Austro-Hungarian Empire - unlike twenty years ago, they are not mobilised for defence against the invaders from the north, but are gearing up for an attack, intent to crack the Habsburg empire in a sudden blow and bring forth its demise. Though the regime in Belgrade may shine with confidence, spewing propaganda about the liberation of their brethren beyond the Drina River, the mood on the ground is considerably less optimistic. There is a common theme across letters written home by Serb soldiers gearing up for the war - does the Belgrade Pact really stand a chance in this war?\n\nTwenty years ago, Serbia stood against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and in spite of all the bravery which Serb soldiers showed during the campaign, their country was ripped apart, battered and burned. Today, their enemies are even stronger, while their allies are even weaker - so is there really a reason to be so confident about their victory?\n\nThe war begins regardless, however, and for the politicians in Belgrade, there seems to be no option but to strike now. Those who wish to liberate their fellow South Slavs fear that if Austria is left alone for any longer, it will rebuild and rejuvenate, becoming impossible to ever challenge again. Those who believe in the cause of Yugoslavism fear that if their flame is not rekindled, or, god forbid, Serbia loses the war again, then the dream of South Slavic unity will become history. Serbs and Croats will be separated forever, and the last hope of Yugoslav brotherhood will fade.\n\nUnless the Pact pulls off an unlikely victory."
 serflavor.37.a: "We shall make our last chance count."

 serflavor.38.t: "Montenegrin Federalist Gains in Local Elections"
 serflavor.38.d: "Several months prior to the parliamentary elections in the Serbian Republic, local elections for mayors and district councils have been held in Montenegro - and the Montenegrin Federalist Party (Crnogorska federalistička stranka, CFS) has acquired an impressive victory. A majority of the mayors, district councils and other notable elected positions in Montenegro are now held by their members. In addition, the CFS also plans to contest the Montenegrin seats in the parliamentary elections, and both of its leaders, Sekula Drljević and Novica Radović, are standing for the Skupština.\n\nThe CFS is the moderated successor to the Montenegrin Greens, a guerrilla movement loyal to the House of Petrović-Njegoš which operated in Montenegro during the 1920s. When the unification of Serbia and Montenegro into a puppet kingdom under the Karađorđevićs was proclaimed by the Central Powers, these guerrillas organised in the mountainous region and remained active until the Republican Revolution. While radical members of the movement continued the struggle, as they could hardly expect the restoration of the House of Petrović-Njegoš even in a Montenegrin federal unit inside Serbia, moderates and Montenegrin politicians led by Drljević and Radović sought to negotiate. President Jaša Prodanović granted them amnesty and signed several concessions for the Montenegrins into law, such as increased local autonomy and recognition of the Montenegrin language.\n\nNow that 1936 rolls around, the CFS remains a powerful force in Montenegro, and their deputies in the Skupština may prove crucial in swinging the election, depending on who they choose to work with."

 serflavor.38.c: "They negotiate with the Socialists for federalisation."

 serflavor.39.t: "Who Will Be the Serbian Savinkov?"
 serflavor.39.d: "The impact of Boris Savinkov's rise to power, pronouncing a new ideological foundation for the future of Russia and possibly all of Europe, could not be understated. Especially not in Serbia, a country with deep historical and cultural ties with the East Slavic hegemon. A new political treatise with a rather inflammatory name - "Who Will Be the Serbian Savinkov?" - is making rounds across Serbia, and its author is Velibor Jonić.\n\nJonić is a veteran of the Republican Revolution, a politics and history professor who became a member of the Republican Party after the Weltkrieg - he left after the Revolution, however, and temporarily withdrew from politics. A vehement nationalist with authoritarian tendencies, he saw the Revolution as a "national rebirth" from a dynasty that failed the Serbs, and the liberal democracy established afterwards did not satisfy his dreams.\n\nIn "Who Will Be the Serbian Savinkov?", Jonić seeks to draw the parallel between the Russian Republic before Savinkov and Serbia, both Slavic states "of similar spiritual composition" which were allured by the illusions of liberal democracy after defeat in the war. Russia was hijacked by a dictator following a new ideological creed, which Jonić describes as "national revolutionary" - clearly radical and one against the status quo, but an idea which seeks to bring the country back towards where it truly needs to focus, that is, revanchism.\n\nThe question in the treatise's title is rhetorical, Jonić does not provide an answer - however, he writes that he will not only expect the Serbian Revolution to be hijacked, but will also welcome this "end of the opiate of Serbian people"."

 yugmechanics.6.t: "New Yugoslavia Mechanics"
 yugmechanics.6.d: "As we have successfully formed Yugoslavia and unified the South Slavs, we have unlocked a new focus tree branch as well as a new set of mechanics which shall define gameplay from here on out. Formed of numerous conflicting nationalities, Yugoslavia inevitably has to juggle all of their interests, and appease as many as possible to maintain order, or else fall to disarray. How this may be achieved and what actions you shall be required to do as you lead the South Slavs in a new era of history is explained in the Decisions tab."

 yugoslavia.2.t1: "Formation of the Democratic Party"
 yugoslavia.2.t2: "Formation of the Republican-Democratic Party"
 yugoslavia.2.d1: "The formation of Yugoslavia has prompted a major change in the political spectrum. The liberals in the Serbian Democratic Party have taken the advantage to show their commitment to Yugoslavism by proclaiming the formation of the first "Yugoslav" political party in history - the Yugoslav Democratic Party. Aiming to dismantle the forming ethno-political wedges across the country, it declares that it will stand only for the interests of all of Yugoslavia, rather than any specific ethnic group. The Democratic Party, the Croat-Serb Coalition and the Yugoslav Democratic Party in Slovenia were the main building blocks of this alliance.\n\nIt is likely to struggle with direction in the future - should it endorse an Integral form of Yugoslavism, aiming to erase the differences between the South Slavs until only a Yugoslav nation-state is left, or a Federal one. The impending leadership elections in the Democratic Party will likely define its future."

The Republican Party, the Croat-Serb Coalition and the Yugoslav Democratic Party in Slovenia were the main building blocks of this alliance.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, the RDS has been declared illegal almost immediately upon inception, and this struggle against authoritarianism will likely determine its future - for the time being, however, it remains a minor force in the underground democrat scene."
 yugoslavia.2.a: "Long live Yugoslavia!"

 yugoslavia.3.t: "Radicalisation of the Radicals"
 yugoslavia.3.d1: "The formation of Yugoslavia has pushed the Radicals even further to the right. Now, isolated even more by the massive transformation of the political scene, they have begun to embrace Serbian supremacist rhetoric and the remnants of the dying Monarchist movement. Those in Serbia who did not wish for the formation of Yugoslavia, believing it to be the dilution of an ethnic Serbian state, now find a home within the NRS. As the Republicans have turned increasingly Yugoslavist, they aim to consolidate the old Serbian population in their competitor's absence.\n\nNew party leadership elections are expected to take place in a month's time, and they will decide the future goals and ideology of the party."

 yugoslavia.4.t: "The Fate of the Konspiracija"
 yugoslavia.4.d: "The contacts which we have in the military have revealed to us that the Konspiracija secret society has dissolved. Its leading commanders such as Dušan Simović, the Nedić brothers, and Borivoje Mirković have parted their ways, considering their primary goal to be complete. The same news, although more openly, came from the Serbian Cultural Club - this nonpartisan intellectual organisation has declared the changing of their primary objectives, now seeking to campaign for the interests of the Serbs within a united Yugoslavia.\n\nThis is not to say that their legacy will be gone. The effect of the Serbian republican period, marked by cooperation and then conflict with the Serbian military, will linger on for a long time, and the strength of the Konspiracija upon the foundation of Yugoslavia will determine this impact."
 yugoslavia.4.a: "Not a good page of our history..."

 yugoslavia.5.t: "Republican-Democrat Leadership Elections"
 yugoslavia.5.d: "Composed from numerous factions united across Yugoslavia, the Republican-Democrats understandably have many strong political figures among them who wish to lead the party in the following years - so, to ease the tensions and form a united party line, leadership elections for the RDS are being held. The party chapters across the country are expected to send delegates to Kraljevo, where the party national conference is being held and where the new leader of the Republican-Democrats will be decided.\n\nMilan Grol is the leading contender - Dragomir Vasić's Prime Minister and a leading politician in the former Serbian Republican Party in his own right, he is expected to lead the party in a moderate, federalist direction. Srđan Budisavljević, a Prečani Serb and one of the leaders of the Croat-Serb Coalition in Illyria, challenges his candidacy, however. For long, the Prečani have been the strongest advocates of integral Yugoslavism promoting a more aggressive unification of the South Slavs and the centralisation of Yugoslavia - and should Budisavljević take over the party and win the next elections, he will surely seek to implement this goal. Finally, some delegates turn to Albert Kramer, a Slovene politician who is seen as an acceptable compromise for many factions in the party.\n\nThe ballots are counted and the next leader of the Republican-Democrats is..."

 yugoslavia.5.b: "Srđan Budisavljević!"
 yugoslavia.5.c: "Albert Kramer!"

 yugoslavia.6.t: "Formation of the ORJUNA"
 yugoslavia.6.d: "Not long after the formation of Yugoslavia, its most radical nationalist element began to organise in support of the new state, and with the backing of regional officials in Dalmatia and Lika, the Yugoslav Progressive Nationalist Youth, later renamed to the Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists (ORJUNA), has been founded in Split.\n\nThough open to members from all across Yugoslavia, it is generally dominated by Dalmatian Croats, and supports a radical unitarian Yugoslavian idea. It sympathises with National Populism and operates a paramilitary wing, the Action Groups, which unite hundreds of war veterans and young radicals with the goal of keeping Yugoslavia alive and destroying any separatists, via any means necessary. Already, they have gained a penchant for violence and terror - raiding and bombing separatist newspaper offices, violently beating up socialists and Croatian nationalists on the streets, so on and so forth.\n\nThe formation of the ORJUNA has prompted Croatian nationalists to organise as well, spiking tensions across the Habsburg half of Yugoslavia."
 yugoslavia.6.a: "Not good..."

 yugoslavia.7.t: "Yugoslavian-Syndicalist Special Relationship"
 yugoslavia.7.d: "Much like us, Serbia had a revolution in the 1920s - a democratic one, which overthrew the autocratic monarchy and established a free republic. Though they did not adopt syndicalism, they established a free, liberal and socially-oriented society, which the Internationale quickly made ties with. As Serbia's goals aligned with ours, the Internationale supported it with arms and technical expertise - and it seems that our support has been helpful, as the Serbian republic has established a Yugoslavian federation after wars against Bulgaria and Austria.\n\nNow, the Yugoslavs reach out to us, asking to integrate into the Internationale's system in Europe. Not as a member of the alliance, but rather as an aligned, neutral state, which will maintain close friendly ties with our regime and receive trade advantages. Yugoslavia is not socialist by any means, but they are economically and socially progressive, so perhaps there's no harm in the agreement?"
 yugoslavia.7.a: "Let us continue our friendship"
 yugoslavia.7.b: "Sounds like the bourgeoisie trying to escape our wrath..."

 yugoslavia.8.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts!"
 yugoslavia.8.d: "The Internationale has agreed to our proposal, and Yugoslavia is now an aligned state of the global Syndicalist alliance. A victory of our diplomacy!"
 yugoslavia.8.a: "Huzzah"

 yugoslavia.9.t: "[FROM.GetName] Declines!"
 yugoslavia.9.d: "The Internationale has declined our proposal, to them, ideological warfare is more important than allies in the Balkans, as it seems."
 yugoslavia.9.a: "Unfortunate"

 yugoslavia.10.t: "Radicalisation of the Party of Rights"
 yugoslavia.10.d: "The Croatian Party of Rights had initially dissolved after the foundation of Yugoslavia, but has gathered once again, this time with the stated purpose of defending the "Croatian state right". The new Belgrade order has deeply affected the Croatian nationalist party. It has allied itself with the Croatian Peasants' Party in order to form the Croatian National Representation, a joint political force, but over time it has increasingly been overtaken by radicalism.\n\nNew cadres in the party, recruited throughout the period, show the tendency for increasingly radical rhetoric - discreetly or even openly endorsing a terrorist campaign against the Yugoslav state in order to evict the Serbs and establish an Independent State of Croatia. This Croatian state should encompass the maximum extent of Croatian claims, including Bosnia and Syrmia, and purified of ethnic minorities.\n\nSuch rhetoric continues spreading among our Croatian population, raising tensions further."
 yugoslavia.10.a: "That doesn't sound good"

 yugoslavia.11.t: "The Vukovar Congress"
 yugoslavia.11.d: "The Socialist Workers' Party was unique in that it kept contacts with its peers across the border long before the formation of Yugoslavia. The SRP and its counterpart in Illyria with the same name cooperated on joint policy and future plans, and now that the South Slavs have been reunited, it is only natural that a congress will be held in Vukovar to unite all of the socialist factions into a single, united fist. Even the Socialists have been invited, even though they once broke from the orthodox SRP after the Centrumaši split.\n\nStill, it is not guaranteed that the party will unify. Two decades of separation have left their impact - the ideological line of the Illyrian and Serbian socialists has diverged, the former more in line with Western syndicalism and the latter seeking to tread a uniquely South Slavic path."
 yugoslavia.11.a: "Let us await the results"

 yugoslavia.12.t: "Integration of Bulgaria?"
 yugoslavia.12.d: "Our socialist brethren in Yugoslavia have finally proposed us our final step towards the unification of all South Slavs - the official integration of Bulgaria as a new People's Republic inside the Yugoslav federation. We may not have another chance to create this hegemon of southern Europe, so should we take this chance?"
 yugoslavia.12.a: "We shall unite with our Serbian brothers"
 yugoslavia.12.b: "Independent foreign policy has served us well"

 yugoslavia.13.t: "Integration of Bulgaria"
 yugoslavia.13.d: "A summit of [SER.GetLeader] and [BUL.GetLeader], alongside their respective Ministers of Foreign Affairs and other diplomats, has approved the agreement, and from here on out, Bulgaria is the newest People's Republic inside Yugoslavia. The Bulgarian Army, its highest command as well as the rank and file will be integrated into the Yugoslav Army, and additional representatives to the National Assembly will be elected to represent the new Bulgarian constituents. The integration of such a large country has not gone without issues, of course, and it is expected that Bulgaria will severely tip the already delicate balance inside Yugoslavia, but the future appears bright for the federation of the South Slavs."
 yugoslavia.13.a: "A new page in the history of the Balkans!"

 yugoslavia.14.t: "Bulgaria Refuses"
 yugoslavia.14.d: "The government of Bulgaria has refused our proposal, stating that independent foreign policy has served both of our states well this far and it will make sense to keep it. When the entire world inevitably becomes engulfed in revolution and nationalist barriers are overthrown, we will unite, but it will come in the future."
 yugoslavia.14.a: "Alas"

 yugoslavia.15.t: "Birth of the Croatian Revolutionary Organisation"
 yugoslavia.15.d: "The radicalisation of the right-wing of the Croatian Party of Rights ever since the formation of Yugoslavia, and the inability of the government in Belgrade to stabilise the state in time, has finally concluded in the birth of something worrying. No longer appeased by any sort of reconciliation talks or federalist promises, these radicals have organised around the underground magazine "Insurgent" ("Ustaša"), in which they proclaimed their break with any form of Yugoslavia - as the very first publication of the magazine states, "only the dagger, revolver, rifle and bomb will herald the resurrection of the Independent State of Croatia". This publication also announced the formation of the Croatian Revolutionary Organisation, which has taken the mantle of this proclamation.\n\nThe name of the magazine was swiftly adopted by the organisation as a shorthand. It unites the radical new generation of Croatian politicians, former soldiers and officers in the Austro-Hungarian army who refused to integrate into the Yugoslav armed forces, and those who suffered in the Austro-Hungarian-Belgrade Pact war. Some suspect that they may even be aided by remnants of the IMRO, the Croatian insurgents trained in exile in the art of assassination and sabotage. Already, several bombings of loyalist newspaper offices and shootings in Croatian streets have been attributed to the organisation, and peace in Croatia appears to be increasingly fragile."

 yugoslavia.16.t5: "Conflicts with Sufi Orders"
 yugoslavia.16.t6: "Yugoslav Germans Protest Discrimination"
 yugoslavia.16.d1: "A series of bombings and violent assaults has broken out across the country. Serbian nationalists and Yugoslav integralist paramilitaries have struck, attacking a well known ethnic separatist magazine. Their offices have been bombed and one of their editors was assaulted on the street, beaten to the inch of their life for speaking out against the integrity of the state. The news shook his ethnic community, and while calls for separatism have died down somewhat, the stability of Yugoslavia takes another blow."
 yugoslavia.16.d2: "Centuries of life in separate empires has left Yugoslavia in deep wealth disparity. It is no secret that the northern provinces - Croatia and Slovenia specifically - are far more developed and prosperous than the backwards South. This reality has sparked an angry argument between Croatian and Serbian deputies in the National Assembly - the Serbs call for greater redistribution of wealth from the North, levying taxes on Croatian and Slovene businesses to fund development in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, while the Croats despise the prospect, their deputies declaring that they have no obligation to carry the economy of the entire union on their shoulders. The government's ministers are requested to intervene and make a decision on the debate."
 yugoslavia.16.d3: "Though Serbo-Croatian is enforced as the official language of Yugoslavia, trying to enforce it has been met with issues. Not only are there regions where literacy remains minimal - the mountains of Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro, for example - but the difference in script is a more difficult hurdle to pass than anticipated. Bureaucrats and officials proficient in Latin and Cyrillic are rare, the Austro-Hungarian policy of Latinisation during the First Weltkrieg has left many Serbs sceptical towards Latin alphabet usage, while many Croats and Slovenes arrogantly refuse to accept Cyrillic as an equal to their Western script. Something has to be done about the disparity, and swiftly."
 yugoslavia.16.d4: "A circle of philosophers associated with Integral Yugoslavist thought have published a proclamation calling for the centralisation of the state and the erasure of what they describe as "tribes of one Yugoslav nation" through determined re-education. Others supporters of Integralism have endorsed the publication, all while criticising Croatian and Slovene separatists. Some of them even appealed to a mystical "Dinaric race", a racial group encompassing the Yugoslavs superior to other European races, and the need to unify all South Slavs under this racial structure. Though these theories have gained limited traction across the country, they endorse our government and so can be put to good use."
 yugoslavia.16.d5: "Much like in the rest of the Islamic world, Sufi lodges are prolific among the Balkan Muslims, disseminating their spiritual teachings in informal gatherings, learning circles, and other venues, be it private and public. Though never banned or discouraged by the Austro-Hungarian government, they were supervised and put under the jurisdiction of mainstream religious clerics, a practice which has continued under Yugoslav administration. After the conquest of Bosnia, the government in Belgrade reestablished the Islamic Religious Community (Islamska Vjerska Zajednica - IVZ), a centralised institution controlled by an appointed chief cleric and a four-member council, with jurisdiction over Muslim religious affairs.\n\nMainstream Muslim clerics have no love for the alternate interpretations of Islam that the Sufi offer, however, and so have begun using this institution to enforce Sharia law for the entire Muslim community in Yugoslavia. An intra-religious conflict is brewing in Bosnia, and the government is forced to take a side."
 yugoslavia.16.d6: "Alongside millions of their fellow Slavs, Yugoslavia also inherited over half a million Germans from the former lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Concentrated in Slovenia, Croatia and especially Vojvodina, where they are one of the largest ethnic groups in a highly diverse region, they are the descendants of immigrants and colonists who arrived over centuries of Habsburg rule. Now fallen under rule from Belgrade, these Germans lost their privileges and status, and are more often than not treated as a potential fifth column. Estates of German landowners were seized and distributed, the Swabian German Kulturbund faces legal issues ever since inception, as government officials see an organised German minority as a threat to the state.\n\nFrustrated by this discrimination, a collection of German intellectuals have made a petition demanding change. They state that they are loyal citizens of Yugoslavia and should be treated as ones, not as a traitor recruitment centre."

 yugoslavia.17.t: "The End of the Vukovar Congress"
 yugoslavia.17.d1: "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia - and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have finally concluded in a comprehensive agreement. From here on out, a vast popular front shall be built from Serbian and Illyrian socialists, the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia, which shall continue the role of the Serbian SRP as the only legal party and guiding force of the socialist state.\n\nSyndicalists, national socialists, anarchists, and social democrats who changed sides have all been absorbed into this hegemon of a party, which has already begun to establish itself across all the regions of Yugoslavia and subsume the instruments of the state."
 yugoslavia.17.d2: "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia - and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have finally concluded in a mostly comprehensive agreement. From here on out, a vast popular front shall be built from Serbian and Illyrian socialists, the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia, which shall continue the role of the Serbian SRP as the only legal party and guiding force of the socialist state.\n\nNot everyone has agreed with this merger, however. Citing the dedication of Serbian socialists towards a purported "Serbian" socialism, French-inspired socialists and trade unionists in Croatia have broken to form a left-wing opposition to the ruling party, the Syndicalist Party. Immediately, as an example of "leftist deviation", these Syndicalists have been purged from political posts and workplaces and thus driven underground."
 yugoslavia.17.d3: "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia - and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have ended in complete failure. Both the Serbian and the Illyrian side of the Congress continuously criticised the leadership of the SRP for their inability to take advantage of their victory in the Serbian elections of 1936, a moment which should have been a final victory for the party and yet resulted in compromise and failure.\n\nIn the end, the socialist movements of Yugoslavia dissolved, the social democrats leaving the congress to continue their separate work as the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, and Croatian socialists concentrating around the Syndicalist Party as the main challenge to the Serbian SRP in the revolutionary socialist niche."
 yugoslavia.17.d4: "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia - and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have finally concluded in partial agreement. The moderate Socialists left the Congress very quickly, disappointed by its revolutionary direction, and continued their work as the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, while the rest of the Congress drafted a comprehensive unification of the entire radical socialist left into the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia. Though the party continues to face several issues, such as the question of whether the inevitable socialist revolution will maintain Yugoslavia or dissolve it into ethnic states due to it being an artificial creation, for now, the socialist united front stands."
 yugoslavia.17.a: "So be it"

 yugoslavia.18.t: "New Leadership for the Vanguard Party"
 yugoslavia.18.d: "After the Vukovar Congress, the newly integrated Illyrian socialists have raised the question of leadership. Trifun Kaclerović, elected as President of Serbia in 1936, has led Yugoslavia thus far, but a Slovene and Croat bloc in the Party has challenged this, stating that while his soft guiding hand has been effective thus far, him staying in power means the perpetuation of Serbian dominance. Should a united Yugoslavia not stray away from that, if it wishes to present itself as a nation for all Yugoslavs?\n\nA coalition of the Bosnian and Croat deputies have proposed Milan Gorkić - Bosnian socialist ideologue of Czech birth who was active in Habsburg-ruled Illyria before the War of Liberation. Gorkić proposes that the national question is just as important for socialist Yugoslavia as the class question. A socialist state must not be an oppressor of peoples, and must represent them - the SRPJ, in his vision, should be reorganised, establishing sub-parties for every major ethnic group, while the country itself must be turned more federal.\n\nThe Serbian faction of the Party, seeking a compromise, has proposed Moša Pijade, well known Serbian socialist writer and ideologue of Sephardic Jewish origin, who has been a key actor in proliferating socialist ideology in the Serbian republic and drafting the ideological tenets of the Serbian SRP. If elected, Pijade calls for an even stricter adherence to socialist doctrine, uniting Yugoslavia above ethnic lines and sweeping the party of "leftist errors". Finally, some can still agree to retain Trifun Kaclerović - after all, even the Croats, Slovenes and Bosniaks can respect him..."
 yugoslavia.18.a: "President Kaclerović has led us well so far."
 yugoslavia.18.b: "Moša Pijade will make the party truly doctrinaire!"
 yugoslavia.18.c: "Milan Gorkić will establish peace between Yugoslavs!"

 yugoslavia.19.t: "Inter-Party Criticism"
 yugoslavia.19.d: "Several years have passed, and yet Yugoslavia still appears on the brink of ethnic conflict. Increasingly, large sections of the SRPJ have grown frustrated with the government of Milan Gorkić. They have increasingly begun to criticise the party leader as a right-wing deviationist whose policies have proved a failure, and a fairly capable coalition has organised around former member of the Croatian SRP, Josip Broz.\n\nBroz has too denounced Gorkić as a rightist deviationist, claiming that his focus on the national question is clearly born out of his hidden nationalist sympathies. Instead, Yugoslavia should seek to integrate all of the nationalities scattered across the Balkans into one federal, "Yugoslav" state - otherwise, it may not survive the following decades. Broz's critics have a lot of ammunition against him, however, as his dedication to socialism is not very doctrinaire, and it is suspected that if he prevails over Gorkić, he will compromise on socialist ideals such as the market economy if pragmatically necessary.\n\nAn extraordinary congress of the Party has been called in Sarajevo, and by the end of the assembly, one side in the party will surely have purged the other."
 yugoslavia.19.a: "Gorkić survives votes of no confidence and consolidates control."
 yugoslavia.19.b: "Gorkić has betrayed the Party and shall be removed!"

 SER_petar_ii: "Petar II"
 SER_petar_ii_leader_desc: "The first and only child of Aleksandar II Karađorđević, the last King of Serbia before the "republican" interregnum, Petar II was only two years old when he was taken from the overrun Royal Palace and handed over to the hands of Petar Živković. The young heir to the throne was moved out of the country and ended up in Canada, where the loyalists of the Karađorđević dynasty gave him to Prince Pavle, first cousin of Aleksandar II and a friend of the British royal family. While the White Hand continued the fight in the fallen Kingdom, the Prince was given the task of raising his nephew.\n\nThus, Petar grew up in the relatively liberal environment of Canada. He spent his childhood attending balls, speaking in English, and caring little about the impoverished Balkan state he still claimed the throne of. Though his guardian taught him little in the way of statecraft, the Westminster system he witnessed imprinted deep upon him. Once the time came for the young King to return home, he brought this British thinking with him.\n\nPersonality-wise, Petar is impulsive, naive and a hopeless idealist. His imagination of the political situation rarely coincides with reality. Though his kingdom may pale in comparison to his childhood home, he nevertheless sees the well-being of his subjects as his duty, even at the expense of political capital. This makes the young King easy to play with for those with actual political acumen. Thus, even if Petar may have good ideas in his mind, he has always been a tool for those who hold real power, and likely always will be."

 SER_milan_grol_leader_desc: "Born in 1876, Milan Grol received a multi-disciplinary education studying philosophy, literature, theatre and arts. After a stint in Paris, he returned to Serbia in 1902 as a teacher and a writer, frequently lambasting King Alexander I and the Obrenovic dynasty in the press. Around this time, he began to affiliate with the left, joining the Independent Radical Party. His career in theatre came to an end with the start of the Weltkrieg. He moved to Geneva during the conflict and began to rededicate his life towards his political writings and activism.\n\nThe end of the war would see Serbia occupied and humiliated. Grol returned to his homeland to see a devastated nation, and soon helped found the Serbian Republican party. Victory in the 1931 elections saw Grol assume the post of Prime Minister under Dragisa Vasic. As a consequence, he was seen as the natural successor to Vasic, and went on to win the Presidency. Carrying legacy of Ljubomir Stojanovic on his shoulders, Milan Grol and his party are now empowered to bring about the reforms they’ve dreamed of over the land."

 SER_trifun_kaclerovic: "Trifun Kaclerović"
 SER_trifun_kaclerovic_leader_desc: "The "old man of the socialists", Trifun "Triša" Kaclerović was born in 1879 in the Serbian countryside and became involved in the socialist movement during his student years. In the leadup to the May Coup of 1903, he and his fellow students organised a protest against the increasingly absolute Aleksandar I Obrenović. He remained in opposition even after the king's assassination and the rise of the Karađorđevićs. Now a leading member of the Social Democratic Party, Kaclerović spent the years leading up to World War I fighting for labour rights, representing the workers in the Skupština and demanding rights for socialists.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg saw the socialist movement split. Some, radicalised by the Russian and French Revolutions, turned to violence. Others shunned themselves from the ideology entirely, or clung onto reformism even in the tense atmosphere of postwar Serbia. Kaclerović led his faction of the Social Democrats to the nascent Socialist Workers' Party, and commanded it for the following decades. A grand hegemon of the left, the SRP unites everyone from social democrats to open Syndicalists. Kaclerović stands at the top of it all - all of them can respect this elderly, collected founder of modern Serbian socialism."

 SER_zivko_topalovic: "Živko Topalović"

 SER_dragomir_vasic: "Dragomir Vasić"
 SER_dragomir_vasic_leader_desc: "Dragomir "Dragiša" Vasić is the second President of the Serbian Republic, elected with the initiative of the Republican Party in 1931. Born in Morava in 1885, Vasić unfortunately happened to belong to the generation of Serbian men and women sent to die in the trenches of the Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg. It was there, during the Second Balkan War, that Vasić the revolutionary began to develop - and Vasić the writer. His first real attempt, a short story titled "Pačko", depicts a Serbian soldier in the Battle of Bregalnica. Pitying a felled Bulgarian officer, he tries to give him a proper burial in no man's land, only to be shot by the enemy while erecting a wooden cross. This revolutionary fervour slowly lead to disillusion with the Karađorđević dynasty - especially after the Salonika Trial, as one of the members of the Black Hand executed was his cousin Ljubomir Vulović.\n\nAfter the war, Vasić returned to Serbia along the remaining exiles, pursued a legal career, and founded the newspaper "Progress". However, it was soon shut down and his lawyer's licence suspended by the Royal Dictatorship for defending communists. In reaction, he joined the Republican Party and became a member of its main board, a crucial member of the underground organisation - not only thanks to his literary skill, but also his numerous contacts within the Serbian Army. When the Revolution came, Vasić joined it, was elected to the Skupština, and accepted his role as the Ambassador to the Commune of France. While visiting Paris and seeing its achievements did not convert him to a Syndicalist, it nevertheless fascinated him.\n\nThe Konspiracija, suspicious of President Jaša Prodanović's anti-militarist stance, forced him out of power in 1931. Discreetly inviting Vasić to succeed him in the next election, they expected him to be easier to control thanks to his past in the Black Hand. Reluctantly, Vasić agreed, and stands today as a leader torn between his progressive outlook and his debt to the conspirators. To him, the fight against Bulgaria is not just a matter of irredentism - it is a matter of liberty. Time and time again the Serbs have proven to be its beacon in the Balkans while the Bulgarians dabble in dim absolutism. But can Serbia really claim to be a harbinger of liberty in this state?"

 SER_milan_stojadinovic: "Milan Stojadinović"
 SER_milan_stojadinovic_leader_desc: "Named after King Milan of Serbia, Milan Stojadinović was born to the family of a rural judge in Šumadija, and followed the same course as many in the Serbian intellectual class. A childhood friend of Živko Topalović, he sympathised with socialism in his youth, before pursuing national liberation over class struggle. Ending up in the People's Radical Party instead. Stojadinović spent the time before the Weltkrieg outside of Serbia, studying in Western universities and representing the Ministry of Finance abroad, and returned to his homeland just in time to serve in the Balkan Wars.\n\nThe Serbian exiles in Corfu, including Stojadinović, needed bureaucrats - men who would make sure that as few of their thinned ranks starve and wither away. Stojadinović, as a clerk in the Ministry of Finance, distinguished himself as a capable economist and negotiator, helping stabilise the Serbian dinar, raise funding for the remnants of the Army, and ensure distribution of the scarce resources. The Prime Minister and leader of the Radicals, Nikola Pašić, recognised his efforts, and Stojadinović became his protege. When Pašić was dismissed after the end of the war on Aleksandar II's orders, Stojadinović resigned as well. He returned to a modest and calm life as a banker and university professor.\n\nThe tide of the Republican Revolution caught Stojadinović as well, many saw him as a republican sympathiser. When Aca Stanojević invited him to the refounded Radical Party, he accepted. Years pass, the old generation of Radicals pass away, and the calm, collected and intelligent economist Stojadinović was the natural fit to lead them. The dilemma of unifying the South Slavs is on his mind, but so are the lessons passed down to him by his mentor: "When it comes to the grand design which God has for the Serbian nation, there can be no compromise or half-measures". Freedom is strong, but collective, absolute power can be stronger."

 SER_petar_zivkovic: "Petar Živković"
 SER_petar_zivkovic_leader_desc: "To his enemies, he is known as a deadly intricate webweaver, a nefarious puppetmaster who held Aleksandar II hostage and crafted the infamous Royal Dictatorship following the Weltkrieg. To his followers, he is known as the most loyal a monarchist could possibly be, a soldier who has stood by the House of Karađorđević as long as he lived. Petar Živković was born in 1879 and followed the prestigious career of military service. He rose to become a member of the Royal Guard, a position in which he played a crucial role during the events in 1903, as he was the guard who opened the entrance to the Royal Court and allowed the Black Hand to extinguish the House of Obrenović. Živković soon became disillusioned with the Black Hand, however, believing that their leader Apis was plotting to overthrow the Karađorđevićs as well. Following the advice of Crown Prince Aleksandar, Petar created the White Hand - a rival to the Black Hand, dedicated to the protection of the ruling dynasty.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, Živković disposed of his Black Hand rivals at last, sentencing Apis and his comrades to death in the Thessaloniki Process. Though Serbia lost the war, his power only continued to grow. It was his advice that Aleksandar followed when proclaiming the Obznana and declaring the Royal Dictatorship. Some even rumoured that he held the King's dirty secrets, forcing the monarch to dance to his will. Unfortunately, as powerful as he was, he could not predict, nor prevent, the Revolution. In the midst of the monarchy's collapse, he made sure to secure the two-year-old heir, Petar II, and place him in the hands of Prince Pavle in Canada. The White Hand transformed into a secret society, taking revenge on the Republican officers, sowing terror and plotting their return to power. Always more accustomed to court politics than terrorism, Živković despised this change, instead spending his time in exile coordinating his underlings. Waiting for the moment to return - until, someday, he can finally right the wrongs of the last decade."
