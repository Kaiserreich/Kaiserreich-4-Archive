 hawaii.2.a: "We shall weather this storm."

 hawaii.3.t: "Dealing with the General Strike"
 hawaii.3.d: "Before the Emergency Meeting can be called to decide the fate of Hawaii, the strike must be dealt with. James Dole has three possibilities before him.

 hawaii.5.t: "The March onto Honolulu"
 hawaii.5.d: "The strikers have marched onto Honolulu and have presented their demands. This can be put off no longer, we can either agree to some of their demands or send in the police and national guard to end it once and for all."

 hawaii.6.t: "The Hilo Massacre"

 hawaii.8.t: "The Battle of Honolulu"

 hawaii.8.b: "The Strikers."

 hawaii.9.t: "The Hawaiian Revolution"

 hawaii.12.t: "The Declaration of a Kingdom"

Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, the last Hawaiian prince and heir to the throne, died in 1922 without issue. The House of Nobles thus chose Lydia Lili'uokalani, of the House of Kawananakoa, to become the new Queen of Hawaii.

### Monarchy Path ###

 hawaii.17.t: "The Royal Hawaiian Tour"
 hawaii.17.d: "The Royal Family of Hawaii, despite being present and politically active for centuries, have yet to attract the respect of other monarchies around the world. This oversight obviously being due to the imperial yoke of America, only now corrected. The House of Kawānanakoa now prepares to reintroduce Hawaii to the world, in particular to the Yamoto and the Hohenzollerns. They may even pass by Brazil, as news of their royal family reviving brings us much comfort in our returned glory."
 hawaii.17.a: "Bon Voyage."

 hawaii.18.t: "Hawaiian Royalty visits Rio de Janeiro"
 hawaii.18.d: "The Hawaiian royal family has come to Rio de Janeiro in order to meet with the Brazilian royal family. They spent their day touring the sites of Rio de Janeiro and as well as private meetings with the political leaders of the country. The relations between the Empire of Brazil and the Kingdom of Hawaii have improved because of this visit."
 hawaii.18.a: "Aloha from Brazil."

 hawaii.19.t: "Hawaiian Royalty visits Tokyo"
 hawaii.19.d: "The Hawaiian royal family has come to Tokyo in order to meet with the Japanese royal family and other notable dignitaries. They spent their day touring the sites of Tokyo and as well as private meetings with the political leaders of the country. The relations between the Empire of Japan and the Kingdom of Hawaii have improved because of this visit."
 hawaii.19.a: "Aloha from Japan."

 hawaii.20.t: "Hawaiian Royalty visits Ottawa"
 hawaii.20.d: "The Hawaiian royal family has come to Ottawa in order to meet with the British royal family and other notable dignitaries. They spent their day touring the sites of Ottawa and as well as private meetings with the political leaders of the country.

 hawaii.20.a: "Aloha from Canada."

 hawaii.21.t: "Hawaiian Royalty visits Berlin"
 hawaii.21.d: "The Hawaiian royal family has come to Berlin in order to meet with the German royal family and other notable dignitaries. They spent their day touring the sites of Berlin and as well as private meetings with the political leaders of the country. The relations between the German Empire and the Kingdom of Hawaii have improved because of this visit."
 hawaii.21.a: "Aloha from Germany."

 hawaii.22.t: "Hawaiian Renaissance"
 hawaii.22.d: "The first Hawaiian renaissance occurred during the reign of Kamehameha V in the mid-1800s. It brought a revival of Hawaiian culture as well as spurring on construction projects including renovating Iolani Palace. However the Americans would come and overthrow the monarchy and much of the energy from this moment died then.\n\nHowever, now that the monarchy has been restored to the throne, [HAW.getleader] is pushing for a renewal of the same ideals that occurred during the first renaissance. For the first time in decades there is a revival and interest in all aspects of Hawaiian culture from the native language, traditional arts, hula, music and more. Similar to the first renaissance, the new renaissance has brought about energy into renovating buildings and improving the various buildings throughout the country."
 hawaii.22.a: "A new day for Hawaii."

 hawaii.23.t: "Hawaiian Orders"
 hawaii.23.d: "In the past there were a number of orders that the Kingdom of Hawaii had established such as the Royal Order of Kamehameha, The Royal Order of Kalakaua, Royal Order of Kapi'olani Sash, The Royal Order of the Crown of Hawaii, and the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania. Now that the Monarchy has been restored again, these orders and the other medals the Kingdom gives out can resume having the proper prestige that they deserve."
 hawaii.23.a: "Shiny."

 hawaii.24.t: "Samoa and other Polynesian monarchies"
 hawaii.24.d: "While the Monarchy of Hawaii is the largest of the islands, there are others in the pacific with their own monarchies, notably Samoa. To that end [HAW.getleader] has been presented with a proposal to revive the ideas of the Kalākaua who wished to create a Polynesian Confederation. This would support the rights of the various islands outside of the Hawaiian chain and their monarchies and work to form bonds of friendship between the various kings and queens."
 hawaii.24.a: "Give support to the Monarchies."

 hawaii.25.t: "Church of Hawaii"
 hawaii.25.d: "In the old kingdom of Hawaii, the monarchy converted to the Anglican church and established the church of Hawaii, part of the Anglican communion, as the state religion of the Kingdom. When the monarchy was overthrown, the church of Hawaii was disestablished and made part of the American Episcopalian church and it lost its bishopric. Now that Hawaii is independent, the Church of Hawaii is gaining influence again and even had its stolen bishopric returned to it. The question though is should the Church be given state support again or should that be a personal matter for the royal family?"
 hawaii.25.a: "It shall be given state support."
 hawaii.25.b: "The monarchy shall not pick sides in matters of faith."

 hawaii.26.t: "Aloha Festivals"
 hawaii.26.d: "[HAW.GetLeader] has created a new festival called the Aloha Festival in order to promote Hawaiian culture, heritage and tourism.

 hawaii.27.c: "Republican Party."
 hawaii.27.e: "Hui Aloha Aina."

### Republic Path ###

 hawaii.31.t: "Introducing Miss Dolcinea"
 hawaii.31.d: "The competition with the United Fruit Company has entered into the mass media era with UFC's introduction of Miss Chiquita, a new mascots designed by Dik Browne. In response to this and in order to reach the young customers that UFC is targeting, James Dole has created a Mascot for Dole Fruit. Dolecinea, a Spanish woman who serves as a vehicle for Dole to criticise UFC's treatment of Latin Americans, as well as distract from their own hold in Hawaii. Ads are beginning to show up in children's' media of Dolecinea's adventures, enticing customers to buy "cruelty free" pineapples over bananas."
 hawaii.31.a: "This'll help with sales."

 hawaii.32.t: "Status of Japanese Hawaiians"
 hawaii.32.d: "There are approximately 150 thousand Japanese immigrants living in Hawaii today, a third of the total population, most of whom are first or second generation American citizens. The collapse of Federal authority on the islands has precipitated a new eminent influence from the Japanese Empire, which complicates future classification of Japanese residents. More liberal elements of the Hawaiian Republic wish to officially enfranchise Japanese residents as full citizens. The military elements, still attached to their exclusively white origins, have stated their position against Japanese citizenship. Thirdly the Japanese Empire itself has surprised us by asserting in telegrams that Japanese residents are still legally Japanese citizens. How do we respond?"
 hawaii.32.a: "The Japanese here are citizens."
 hawaii.32.b: "The Japanese here are merely resident aliens."

 hawaii.33.t: "Dealing with the Hawaiian Militias"
 hawaii.33.d: "The militias that have kept Hawaii free from invaders are in need of fresh blood. They traditionally only recruit white Hawaiians and only have access to military surplus weapons. While the weapon situation is easy to remedy, the recruitment is still stifled. Governor Dole has come to the militias to propose that they face the political realities of the territory and drop their racial requirement. The militia leaders continue to refuse the advice, and the Governor has come to consider an alternative solution. Fire the leaders of the militias and appoint yes-men. This would reflect negatively on the status of white Hawaiians in general however."
 hawaii.33.a: "Give up on reforms."
 hawaii.33.b: "Replace the militia leaders."

 hawaii.34.t: "Presidential Elections of [GetYear]"
 hawaii.34.d: "It is time for another general election. The winner of the election will determine which party's leader shall be elected President. Who shall the people of the Republic of Hawaii vote for?"
 hawaii.34.a: "National Liberal Party."
 hawaii.34.b: "Republican Party."
 hawaii.34.c: "Hui Aloha Aina."

### Commune ###

 hawaii.62.t: "Radical art in Honolulu"
 hawaii.62.d: "The Honolulu Museum of Art is a testament to the growing wealth and prestige of the Island under American rule. However, its use as a centre for art creation and promotion has been stifled by its overreliance on formalistic mainlander art. There exists no promotion of native art, nor any of the revolutionary art that other Communards across the world have created. We must rectify this with what little funds are available. We have cleared space for a new wing of the Honolulu Art Museum dedicated to..."
 hawaii.62.a: "Modern Art."
 hawaii.62.b: "Native Hawaiian Art."

 hawaii.63.t: "Integrating American Communards"
 hawaii.63.d: "The Commune of Hawaii itself has origins in the planning halls of California between Longshoremen and Unionists for Dole Fruit. This important tie to mainland United States has allowed for us to import bureaucrats and labour organisers to Hawaii in order to better achieve socialism. However, these last few months have shown some disunity between the longtime resident organisers and the newer arrivals. The new ministers are less than knowledgeable about agriculture and shipbuilding, and use their wages to import increasingly expensive goods from the mainland. This issue would be ignorable, if not for a growing resentment in the more egalitarian society we all are building. Several men and women have anonymously met to ask for "cosy desk jobs" as a reward for their months of patience in the new Commune. How do we respond?"
 hawaii.63.a: "No! You knew what you signed up for."
 hawaii.63.b: "Fine! Take a seat."

 hawaii.64.t: "General Election of [GetYear]"
 hawaii.64.d: "It is time for another general election to decide the makeup of the People's council of Hawaii. The party or faction with the most seats shall have their leader be elected as General Secretary. Who shall the people vote for?"
 hawaii.64.a: "Revolutionary Party of Hawaii."
 hawaii.64.b: "Hawaiian Federation of Labor."
 hawaii.64.c: "Socialist Party of Hawaii."
 hawaii.64.e: "Progressive Party."

### Buying ships ###

 hawaii.78.t: "Hawaii seeks to buy a light cruiser"
 hawaii.78.d: "An envoy from [HAW.GetNameDef] has sought to by a light Cruiser from us. Doing so would help our economy a little bit though we would have to give up a dockyard to build the ship. Should we take them up on their offer?"
 hawaii.78.a: "Sell them a Ship."
 hawaii.78.b: "Refuse their offer."

 hawaii.88.t: "Light Cruiser arrives in Pearl Harbor"
 hawaii.88.d: "Today the Light Cruiser that we bought has arrived in Pearl Harbor. With that we have a new ship for the Hawaiian fleet."
 hawaii.88.a: "Another ship for our fleet."

 hawaii.89.t: "Hawaii seeks to buy a Destroyer"
 hawaii.89.d: "An envoy from [HAW.GetNameDef] has sought to by a Destroyer from us. Doing so would help our economy a little bit though we would have to give up a dockyard to build the ship. Should we take them up on their offer?"
 hawaii.89.a: "Sell them a Ship."
 hawaii.89.b: "Refuse their offer."

 hawaii.99.t: "Destroyer arrives in Pearl Harbor"
 hawaii.99.d: "Today the Destroyer that we bought has arrived in Pearl Harbor. With that we have a new ship for the Hawaiian fleet."
 hawaii.99.a: "Another ship for our fleet."

### Foreign Events ###

 hawaii.101.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] wishes to join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 hawaii.101.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap], have sent an ambassador to meet with our government in order to bring [From.GetNameDefCap] into the [Root.GetFactionName]. Should we accept the Hawaiians' offer?"
 hawaii.101.a: "Of course they may join!"
 hawaii.101.b: "We do not need Hawaii."

 hawaii.102.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] refuses"
 hawaii.102.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join the [From.GetFactionName]. Perhaps we are not good enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
 hawaii.102.a: "Drat."

 hawaii.111.t: "Peace with [JAP.GetNameDef]?"
 hawaii.111.d: "Hawaii has been lost to the Japanese war machine, and six months have passed without any inroads into recovering the islands. Perhaps it would be better to cut our losses and seek peace with [JAP.GetNameDef] - surely tiny Hawaii isn't worth the costs of this war?"
 hawaii.111.a: "Yes, let us end this."
 hawaii.111.b: "We will not abandon our allies!"

 hawaii.112.t: "Peace with [FROM.GetNameDef]?"
 hawaii.112.d: "Even though Hawaii is now firmly under our control, their allies in the [FROM.GetFactionName] have yet to concede defeat... until now. We have received a missive from the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador, offering to end this war in exchange for recognising our control over Hawaii. With neither side able to effectively contest the other, this seems like an acceptable offer."
 hawaii.112.a: "We are victorious once again."
 hawaii.112.b: "There will be no peace with Western imperialists!"

 hawaii.113.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 hawaii.113.d.JAP: "Despite our hopes that [FROM.GetNameDef] and the [FROM.GetFactionName] would see the futility of trying to protect Hawaii against our mighty navy, it seems that they are yet to realise this. Already the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has stated their resolve to see Hawaii protected against \"Japanese aggression\"."
 hawaii.113.d.other: "Despite our generous offer, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has categorically refused any notion of peace with our alliance, denigrating our offer as \"bowing down to Western imperialism\". [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has vowed to continue this war until we are ready for peace on \"their terms\" - whatever those may be."
 hawaii.113.a: "The war continues..."

 hawaii.114.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Reunion"
 hawaii.114.d.in_faction: "As the smoke clouds and crackles of gunfire above continental American have died down, many Hawaiians have questioned whether it is time to see ourselves return. Today, [FROM.GetLeader], the leader of [FROM.GetNameDef], has made a radio broadcast across America addressing the outcome of the bloody civil war, along with requesting that Hawaii abandon her alliance with the [ROOT.GetFactionName] and rejoin the republic as a state, instead of a territory. At the same time, a small group of delegates have arrived in Honolulu to await a reply."
 hawaii.114.d.default: "As the smoke clouds and crackles of gunfire above continental America have died down, many Hawaiians have questioned whether it is time to see ourselves return. Today, [FROM.GetLeader], the leader of [FROM.GetNameDef], has made a radio broadcast across America addressing the outcome of the bloody civil war, along with requesting that Hawaii rejoin the republic as a state, instead of a territory. At the same time, a small group of delegates have arrived in Honolulu to await a reply."
 hawaii.114.a: "Tell [faction_leader.GetNameDef] that we wish to rejoin."
 hawaii.114.b: "Ask [faction_leader.GetNameDef] to intervene."
 hawaii.114.c: "We have no choice."
 hawaii.114.d: "Absolutely not!"

 hawaii.115.t: "Hawaii wishes to Rejoin [america.GetNameDef]"
 hawaii.115.d: "After the recent radio broadcast made by [america.GetLeader] demanding the reunion of [FROM.GetNameDef] with [america.GetNameDef], [FROM.GetLeader] has informed [ROOT.GetLeader] that Hawaii intends to return to the protection of the continental United States. However, he also wishes to seek approval from us before contacting the delegates that have just arrived in Honolulu.\n\nAllowing them to rejoin will put us on speaking, if not friendly terms with [america.GetNameDef], but we would also give up a crucial staging ground for countering Japanese aggression in the Pacific."
 hawaii.115.a: "By all means."
 hawaii.115.b: "Absolutely not!"

 hawaii.116.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Reunion with America"
 hawaii.116.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has listened to the arguments of our diplomat in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] present our arguments for rejoining continental America. After excusing our diplomats for a short period, summoned them again, and to great surprise and relief, agreed to allow us to rejoin continental America. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] wishes the best for our country."
 hawaii.116.a: "Excellent!"

 hawaii.117.t: "Hawaii Rejoins America"
 hawaii.117.d: "Today, a small garrison of American troops has landed in Pearl Harbour, marching through Oahu into the city centre of Honolulu. At noon, the [HAW.GetAdjective] flag on top of the Iolani Palace was lowered, and [america.GetNameDef]’s flag was raised. [HAW.GetLeader] then gave a speech, asking Hawaiians to celebrate the reunion between Hawaii and continental America."
 hawaii.117.a: "Excellent!"

 hawaii.118.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declines Reunion with America"
 hawaii.118.d: "After consulting his advisors, [FROM.GetLeader] has declined our request of reuniting with continental America, citing political instability as the prime reason. As one of the many American possessions whose control had been lost during the American Civil War, the reunion of Hawaii with America will undoubtedly bring much needed legitimacy to the owner of the White House, rendering Hawaii as only a political tool and not seen with true equality within the legislature or the administration.\n\nWhile we may respect their decision and refuse a reunion, a notable portion of the Hawaiian population would undoubtedly prefer being under the same umbrella as the whole of America. We could secretly inform the delegates from America and organise a reunion all under [FROM.GetLeader]'s nose before they can react."
 hawaii.118.a: "Defy them!"
 hawaii.118.b: "We must respect their decision."

 hawaii.119.t: "Hawaii Defies Us!"
 hawaii.119.d: "Despite us presenting the possibility of Hawaii being used as a political tool for the victor of the American civil war, our informants have passed on reports that [HAW.GetLeader] has opted to organise their reunion in secret. The reports that have made their way back seem to be solid with little room for interpretation. We can either use all means possible to ensure they remain within our influence, including starting a war with their masters, or simply let the Pacific islands return to continental America."
 hawaii.119.a: "How dare they!"
 hawaii.119.b: "Hawaii isn't worth a war."

 hawaii.120.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] Threatens Us"
 hawaii.120.d: "A furious telegraph has arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] demanding that Hawaii’s return to continental America be stopped, under threat of war with [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]. Clearly, they underestimated the sentiment of the Hawaiians, yet wanted to retain whatever little influence they have upon the islands. We can hold our ground and refuse, potentially starting another brutal war after the recent conclusion of the American Civil War, or stand down and let them keep Hawaii."
 hawaii.120.a: "Then war it is."
 hawaii.120.b: "This isn't worth shedding blood over."

 hawaii.121.t: "Hawaii Requests Intervention"
 hawaii.121.d: "An encrypted message has been sent by [HAW.GetLeader] to us, informing us of the [america.GetName]'s formal demands to see Hawaii returned and reintegrated. Implied in the demands are possibilities that military action will be taken to ensure their return. Thus, [HAW.GetLeader] has requested us to provide military support and back their desire for independence."
 hawaii.121.a: "We protect our allies!"
 hawaii.121.b: "They are on their own."

 hawaii.122.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Intervenes"
 hawaii.122.d: "Honolulu has given us a reply. They declined the reunion offer, but before our delegates could ask them to reconsider lest we use arms to ensure the reunion goes through. At this threat, [HAW.GetLeader] replies that the alliance Hawaii has joined, [HAW.GetFactionName] would support them were they attacked. The delegates were then quickly sent on a flight back to continental America. We are left with two options, going to war for Hawaii, or backing down."
 hawaii.122.a: "Then war it is."
 hawaii.122.b: "Hawaii isn't worth a war."

 hawaii.123.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Intervene"
 hawaii.123.d: "We have received a reply from [FROM.GetLeader], who has informed us that they will not back us in the case of an American invasion. We maintain a small military, definitely unable to stand up to the might of American industry. However, we still do have a fighting chance, and we could not surrender or go down without a fight. What shall our next step be?"
 hawaii.123.a: "We have no choice now..."
 hawaii.123.b: "We will not give up our independence!"

 hawaii.124.t: "Hawaii Rejects Reunion"
 hawaii.124.d: "Just now, our delegates in Honolulu have been told that Hawaii will not rejoin America. However, [FROM.GetLeader] has not elaborated on the reasons for declining the reunion and promptly sent our delegates away, showing little room for further negotiations. Needless to say, the only options we are left with are declaring a state of war with [FROM.GetNameDef] or backing down."
 hawaii.124.a: "War it is, then."
 hawaii.124.b: "Hawaii isn't worth a war."

 hawaii.125.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands the Return of Hawaii"
 hawaii.125.d.puppet_same_faction: "Hawaii has established an independent government during the American civil war and entered a defensive alliance to prevent the clouds of war from reaching the shores of the Pacific paradise. Earlier today, we received a message from [FROM.GetNameDef], informing us that they would like to see the peaceful return of Hawaii. Hawaii never belonged to us, and allowing them to return to the control of continental US would protect us from war between us and America, but at the same time, we should honour our alliance. What shall we do?"
 hawaii.125.d.puppet: "Hawaii has established an independent government during the American civil war, protected by us, to prevent the clouds of war from reaching the shores of the Pacific paradise. Earlier today, we received a message from [FROM.GetNameDef], informing us that they would like to see the peaceful return of Hawaii. Hawaii never belonged to us, and allowing them to return to the control of continental US would protect us from war between us and America, but at the same time, we should defend our protectorate. What shall we do?"
 hawaii.125.d.annexed_same_faction: "We annexed Hawaii during the American civil war, and now America has come asking for their return, as the crown jewel of American possessions lost as they sorted their ideological differences out. The strategic importance of Hawaii in the Pacific, especially as a staging ground in the Pacific should we want to exert our influence, makes it a difficult decision, however, the potential of war between us and [america.GetNameDef] is not a small threat. What shall we do?"

 hawaii.125.c: "Hawaii isn't worth fighting over."

 hawaii.126.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Hawaii"
 hawaii.126.d: "We have received great news. [FROM.GetNameDef] has informed us that they would not want to jeopardise the precious peace we share currently, and has agreed to allow Hawaii to peacefully rejoin America."
 hawaii.126.a: "Excellent."

 hawaii.127.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s Betrayal"
 hawaii.127.d: "We have received news of an extraordinary betrayal! [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to promise us of military intervention in case of a invasion. Without the backing of a military force, we are likely to be quickly overwhelmed by the American industry, however, we can also attempt to defend ourselves for as long as possible."

 hawaii.128.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 hawaii.128.d: "Honolulu, after receiving the news that we would not back them in case of an American invasion, has announced they will leave [Root.GetFactionName] and proudly stand alone against their invaders. This was followed by them denouncing us for cowardly self-preservation and having our diplomats dismissed rudely, despite best efforts to convince them to remain within the [Root.GetFactionName], however, their rage is understandable and we could only honour their decision."
 hawaii.128.a: "That could have gone better..."

 hawaii.129.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses To Return Hawaii"
 hawaii.129.d: "As negotiations reached an impasse, our delegates messaged back to [america.GetCapital] with much disappointment and hesitation, that [FROM.GetNameDef] will not allow Hawaii to rejoin us. Our delegates wanted to convince them otherwise, however they have been dismissed and sent back to continental United States. As such, we have two options remaining, we can declare war to force the return of Hawaii, or we can back down and wait for another time."
 hawaii.129.a: "War it is, then."
 hawaii.129.b: "We cannot fight them."

 HAW_delos_carleton_emmons: "Delos Carleton Emmons"
 HAW_delos_carleton_emmons_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L January 17, 1889, in Huntington, West Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Delos Carleton Emmons graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1909 as a second lieutenant. He was assigned as the CO of the Company B of the 30th Infantry Regiment, and would follow the 30th until July 1916, where he was promoted to first lieutenant and joined the Signal Corps to become an aviator. He became a Captain by July 1917, a Major in June 1918 and a Colonel in August 1918. He'd transfer to the US Army Air Service in 1920, and in 1921 he completed the Air Service Course at Harvard University. He'd hold several influential posts in the US Army Air Service during the twenties, and would graduate from the Air Corps Tactical School and the Command and General Staff School before 1930. He was assigned to Hawaii in March 1934 as the CO of the 18th Composite Wing and he has held that post until the outbreak of the American Civil War. With the local tensions high, and seeing the writing on the wall, Delos decided to join the revolt against the Federal Government which helped proclaim an independent Hawaii. This has granted him the promotion to Brigadier General, but it is uncertain if he's actually prepared for the job.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- He is known to have made racist displays against Japanese-Americans in the island, citing the possibility of a Japanese attack on the island."

 HAW_robert_charlwood_richardson_jr: "Robert Charlwood Richardson Jr."
 HAW_robert_charlwood_richardson_jr_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L October 27, 1882, in Charleston, South Carolina\n§YMilitary Career:§L Robert Charlwood Richardson Jr. graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1904, and was a member of the 14th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippine War guerrilla insurrections, where he personally fought against hostile Moros tribesmen. During one skirmish against the tribesmen, he was wounded in combat, for which he was awarded the Purple heart and the Silver Star. He'd continue to fight with his regiment until October 1905, where he returned to San Francisco. He led the 14th Cavalry during the 1906 earthquake as a part of the government response to the disaster. In October 1906, he rejoined West Point as an Assistant Instructor in Foreign Languages until 1911, where he rejoined the 14th Cavalry for a second tour in the Philippines. He'd return again to the US in 1914, and served as Assistant Professor of English in West Point until 1917, where he was sent to France as an observer for the dying Entente. His observations in France were quite valuable for the US Military Academy, and once the defeat of France became imminent, he was recalled back to the US. He was ascended to Captain in 1920, and after signing up for a third tour in the Philippines, he became a Major. He was later sent to the Republic of Italy as a military attaché during the conflicts that shaped the region and would return as a lieutenant colonel in 1928, where he'd rejoin his beloved 13th Cavalry once more at Fort Riley in Kansas. He'd be rotated as commanding officer throughout many regions of the United States, until he promoted and assigned to Hawaii in early 1936. While he's one of the most experienced members of the staff, his loyalty to Hawaii itself isn't really solid as there seems to have been a struck of luck for Richardson to be spared the chaos that now ravages the mainland when he actually has no connections to the island."

 HAW_joseph_taggart_mcnarney: "Joseph Taggart McNarney"
 HAW_joseph_taggart_mcnarney_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L August 28, 1893, in Emporium, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Joseph Taggart McNarney graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1915, having attended lessons with great officers like Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower. McNarney served with the 21st Infantry Regiment at Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and with the 37th Infantry Regiment at Yuma, Arizona. He became one of the first lieutenants to begin flight training when he signed up to the Signal Corps Aviation School in 1916, from where he'd graduate a year later as a Junior Military Aviator. He was promoted to Captain in May 1917 and posted in New Mexico. He'd later take charge of the flying school at Gerstner Field, in Luisiana. He'd move in late 1920 to Langley Field, where he became a student of the Air Service Field Officers School and remained in Langley as an instructor. He'd graduate with honours from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1926, and he completed the Army War College course in 1930. He succeeded Major Spaatz in the 7th Bomb group after Spaatz promotion. McNarney then became an instructor at the Army War College in Washington, serving from August 1933 to March 1935, where he was redeployed as an attaché to Canada. With the outbreak of the Civil War, McNarney decided that it was best to leave to a place where his particular skills were in short supply, and the Hawaiian staff was more than happy to welcome him from Canada."

 HAW_james_otto_richardson: "James Otto Richardson"
 HAW_james_otto_richardson_admiral_desc: "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 18, 1878 in Paris, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L James Otto Richardson entered the United States Naval Academy in 1898 and graduated fifth in a class of eighty-five in 1902. His first duty assignments were in the Asiatic Squadron, where he took part in the Philippine campaign and, after 1905, in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1907 to 1909, Lieutenant Richardson commanded the torpedo boats Tingey and Stockton and the Third Division, Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla. He was a member of the first class of the Navy's Post Graduate Engineering School in 1909– to 1911 and served as an engineer on the battleship USS Delaware and on the staff of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In 1914, Richardson was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was attached to the Department of the Navy's Bureau of Steam Engineering, where he worked to assure the Navy's fuel supply. In 1917 to 1919, Commander Richardson was navigator and executive officer of the battleship USS Nevada. Following a tour at the Naval Academy, he was given command of the gunboat USS Asheville in 1922 and took her out to Asiatic waters, where he also had command of the South China Patrol. Captain Richardson was Assistant to the Chief, Bureau of Ordnance, in 1924 to 1927. In the late 1920s, he commanded a destroyer division and returned to the US for service with the Bureau of Navigation. In January 1931, Captain Richardson placed the new scouting cruiser USS Augusta in commission and commanded her for more than two years. After a tour as a Naval War College student in 1933–1934, he was Budget Officer at the Navy Department, receiving promotion to rear admiral while he was in that position in December 1934. His duties as a flag officer included command of a Scouting Fleet cruiser division, service as aide and Chief of Staff, and a tour as Commander Destroyers, Scouting Fleet. In the end of 1935 he became chief of the Bureau of Navigation.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Protested against redeployment of a portion of the Scouting Fleet forward to Pearl Harbor and has bad relations with the U.S. government because of that."

Since then, he has performed remarkably well in the officer courses, and the outbreak of the Civil War has made the lack of capable officers in Hawaii a dire issue, prompting a premature promotion for Hajiro to the status of General. While he is a capable officer, he's been granted too much power and responsibility for a man of his experience, and it's uncertain if he'll be able to keep up...\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Holds a deep grudge against Emmons due to Emmons discrimination of Japanese-American Citizens."
