 SPA_memories_of_the_republic: "Memories of the Republic"
 SPA_memories_of_the_republic_desc: "On August 11th, 1932, the Second Spanish Republic came to an end, but the Republic lives on in the hearts of many Spaniards. While many malcontents harbour Carlist or Socialist sentiments, many political moderates even, especially among military officers, wish to see the end of the incumbent Spanish monarchy."
 SPA_black_monday: "Effects of Black Monday"

 SPA_SPR_SWF_civil_war_fervor_desc: "The Spanish Civil War is a conflict caused by deep economic and societal problems, the slow decline of Spain as a world power during the last 2 centuries, and the failure to keep up with the rest of the world in terms of progress.\nWhat the root causes of those problems are is what Spaniards disagree on, however, and the violence has been escalating for years culminating in this war of extremes against each other, resulting in an almost religious devotion to \"Cleanse Spain of all the problems that ail it\"... by any means necessary."

### Focuses ###
 SPA_strengthen_kingdom: "Strengthen the Kingdom"
 SPA_strengthen_kingdom_desc: "The Kingdom of Spain is in dire straits, and many believe our nation will soon descend into civil war. We must consolidate our position and endeavour to thwart impending disaster."
 SPA_focus_diplomacy: "Focus on Diplomacy"
 SPA_focus_diplomacy_desc: "We must convene meetings with both the Carlists and the CNT-FAI. With our crisis seemingly unresolvable, perhaps we can at least prevent complete collapse."
 SPA_talks_with_SWF: "Meet with the CNT-FAI"
 SPA_talks_with_SWF_desc: "We should meet with the CNT-FAI, Spain's leading socialist organisation. By establishing a dialogue and engaging their demands, we can hopefully dissuade them from open rebellion."
 SPA_meet_with_xavier: "Meet with Javier"
 SPA_meet_with_xavier_desc: "Javier, Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, seemingly desires nothing less than the throne itself. Through discussion and perhaps even concession, we hope to persuade him to abandon his claim, or at least refrain from insurrection."
 SPA_plea_for_peace: "Plea For Peace"
 SPA_plea_for_peace_desc: "Spain is rife with unrest, and with civil war seemingly inevitable, the people should hear directly from their king. Hopefully, King Alphonso's personal plea for peace can persuade at least a few Spaniards to abandon violence."
 SPA_focus_economy: "Focus on the Economy"
 SPA_focus_economy_desc: "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should implement comprehensive economic reform."
 SPA_construction_focus: "New Construction"
 SPA_construction_focus_desc: "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construction of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
 SPA_civ_production: "New Factories"
 SPA_civ_production_desc: "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
 SPA_new_jobs: "Jobs for the People"
 SPA_new_jobs_desc: "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
 SPA_focus_military: "Focus on the Military"
 SPA_focus_military_desc: "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
 SPA_mil_production: "Increase Arms Production"
 SPA_mil_production_desc: "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
 SPA_mil_planning: "Review Our Leadership"
 SPA_mil_planning_desc: "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
 SPA_fortify_madrid: "Fortify Madrid"
 SPA_fortify_madrid_desc: "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
 SPA_rally_kingdom: "Rally the Kingdom"
 SPA_rally_kingdom_desc: "Despite our efforts to preserve peace, civil war has broken out in Spain. Now is the time to rally those loyal to the king, to eliminate our remaining divisions and ensure our nation does not fall to radicals."

 SPA_no_civil_war: "Civil War Averted!"
 SPA_no_civil_war_desc: "We have succeeded! The danger is past, and our government has received a mandate from the people which even the Carlists and the anarcho-syndicalists cannot ignore. They might try to rise again, but they know not enough of the people will follow to make a difference. Things are still dire in Spain, but at least we can be assured we have a position of strength from which to work."
 SPA_victor_civil_war: "Victory in the Civil War!"
 SPA_victor_civil_war_desc: "We fought hard, and in the end the battle was won by tradition and by the king. Spain is whole, and ours once again!"
 SPA_consolidate_spain: "Consolidate Spain"
 SPA_consolidate_spain_desc: "Now is the time to look across the country and see what must be done to pull it together, and to heal the rifts which have formed since the end of the Second Republic."
 SPA_replace_alfonso: "Restore the Monarchy"
 SPA_replace_alfonso_desc: "Our King Alfonso is in a coma, and it seems there is no returning for him. A regent is not enough - we must decide who is to lead Spain in the years to come."
 SPA_arrest_leaders: "Arrest the Malcontents"
 SPA_arrest_leaders_desc: "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
 SPA_new_constitution: "A New Constitution"
 SPA_new_constitution_desc: "Until the CNT-FAI and the Carlists are allowed to be a peaceable part of our government, Spain will never know true unity. We must look to having regular elections, and allow these radicals to run in them. We must not fear what they could do. Rather we must embrace them, and perhaps make peace as much their goal as ours."
 SPA_unity_at_last: "Unity at Last"
 SPA_unity_at_last_desc: "We have finally bridged the divisions which have torn apart our nation, at least for now. It is time to move forward as a renewed Spain, and for the world to know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."

 SPA_rebuild_industry: "Rebuild Industry"
 SPA_rebuild_industry_desc: "Our industrial sector has been heavily damaged by war and a horrid economy - it is time to pull the people together to rebuild and move forward."
 SPA_railroads_1: "Expand the National Railroads"
 SPA_railroads_1_desc: "Before true industry can be started, we need a better transportation network which crosses from one side of Spain to the next. This will be a national undertaking which will require our full effort."
 SPA_new_industry: "Embrace New Methods"
 SPA_new_industry_desc: "The world of industry and technology has been advancing without us, and we must look outside of Spain to these new methods. Embracing them is the only hope we will ever have of catching up."
 SPA_expand_industry_1: "Expand Our Industry"
 SPA_expand_industry_1_desc: "We must focus on expanding our civilian industry, to increase Spain's trade potential and our place as a powerhouse in Europe."
 SPA_expand_mines_1: "Expand New Mines"
 SPA_expand_mines_1_desc: "There are resources yet untapped in Spain, mines that new technology allow us to finally access. We must take advantage of them."
 SPA_expand_industry_2: "Expand Our Industry Further"
 SPA_expand_industry_2_desc: "We must continue our focus on expanding our civilian industry, to increase Spain's trade potential and our place as a powerhouse in Europe."

 SPA_recover_black_monday: "Recovery from Black Monday"
 SPA_recover_black_monday_desc: "It has been a long road, and Spain was perhaps harder hit than some. We have weathered the storm, however, and it is time to come out of the other end of it stronger than ever."

 SPA_university: "Centro de Estudios Universitarios"
 SPA_university_desc: "Established in 1933 by the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, the Centro de Estudios Universitarios is a foundation for the development of education. It controlled and supported only a few universities like the Universidad de Deusto, but now it will gain control over the entire educational structure of our country."
 SPA_radio_focus: "Central Spanish Broadcast"
 SPA_radio_focus_desc: "Radio is the way of the future - we must centre it here in Madrid, and find a way to turn it to our advantage."
 SPA_electronics_focus: "Focus on Electronics"
 SPA_electronics_focus_desc: "Electronics and computers are how we will compete - we must learn ways to keep our information secure, while simultaneously discovering what our enemies plan. We will never gain an advantage if we do not know our enemies are coming."
 SPA_united_minds: "Uniting Minds of Spain"
 SPA_united_minds_desc: "We have allowed our differences to impede us for too long. It is time to bring fine Spanish minds together in our universities, and to give them free rein in aiding or great leap forward into the modern era."

 SPA_rebuild_command: "Rebuild Our National Command"
 SPA_rebuild_command_desc: "Our command structures have been devastated. Now is the time to rebuild them anew, to cast aside old and outdated ways of thinking and to embrace the new."
 SPA_standing_army: "A Standing Army"
 SPA_standing_army_desc: "We must focus on our army's strength and quality, instead of focusing on expanding into areas we cannot truly afford."
 SPA_mobile_army: "A Mobile Army"
 SPA_mobile_army_desc: "The ways of footsoldiers and horses will soon be a thing of the past, if they are not already. The cost of equipping our forces with vehicles will be high, but it is necessary."
 SPA_new_equipment: "Update the Army's Equipment"
 SPA_new_equipment_desc: "We must focus on modernising our army's equipment, much of which dates back to the Weltkrieg. This will not do."
 SPA_motor_focus: "Spanish Motorworks"
 SPA_motor_focus_desc: "We must get our soldiers off their feet, and focus on giving them the kind of mobility which will give us an advantage."
 SPA_artillery_focus: "Artillery Focus"
 SPA_artillery_focus_desc: "Firepower - this is what we most desperately need. The ability to knock down an enemy's fortifications, and to bombard them into senselessness should they dare cross the Pyrenees."
 SPA_tank_focus: "The Spanish Panzer Corps"
 SPA_tank_focus_desc: "Heavy armour - it provides both speed and firepower, and it is our clear path to victory in the wars to come."
 SPA_army_innovation: "Army Innovation"
 SPA_army_innovation_desc: "Above all else, we must ensure our army has the finest minds behind it to plan our offence and defence. Without them, all the fine equipment in the world will do us nothing."

 SPA_air_academy: "Academia Básica del Aire"
 SPA_air_academy_desc: "After the end of a war, it has been proposed to create of a new Air Force Academy where our glorious air forces can be trained and new aeronautical doctrines researched. This will require a low cost for us and should give great advantages to our air forces."
 SPA_air_factory: "Iberavia Aircraft Factory"
 SPA_air_factory_desc: "Before the start of the war, there were plans for opening a new aircraft industry near Madrid, but the bad economic situation and the war prevented any investments. Now that we have achieved our glorious victory, we finally have the opportunity to finance and support it."
 SPA_expand_airforce: "Expand the Air Force"
 SPA_expand_airforce_desc: "We must focus on researching new types of aircraft, to keep our air force from lagging behind nations who have been at it for far longer. If we cannot have strength of numbers, we will have quality."
 SPA_air_focus: "Rule the Skies"
 SPA_air_focus_desc: "It is a basic fact that we cannot be both a naval power and an air force power - so we have chosen to rule the skies, and to gear our industry towards producing the kind of air power which will make superiority over the skies something we can achieve."

 SPA_naval_academy: "Academia Naval Española"
 SPA_naval_academy_desc: "There are several naval academies in operation throughout Spain, but all of them adhere to long-outdated methods. We must bring them together, and provide them the resources to ensure new doctrines can be embraced which will give us the kind of naval experience we so desperately need."
 SPA_shipyards: "The Barcelona Shipyards"
 SPA_shipyards_desc: "Upgrading the ageing shipbuilding facilities in Barcelona is our most promising path to building a truly powerful Spanish fleet."

 SPA_navy_focus: "Rule the Seas"
 SPA_navy_focus_desc: "It is a basic fact that we cannot be both a naval power and an air force power - so we have chosen to rule the seas, and to gear our industry towards producing the kind of naval power which will make superiority over the seas something we can achieve."

 SPA_place_in_the_world: "Our Place in the World"
 SPA_place_in_the_world_desc: "With all the troubles which have afflicted the kingdom, we have come to be treated as a second-class country within Europe - a nation to be ignored, or even one which might be seen as an easy target. Now that we have reasserted our position, it is time to restore our contact with the rest of the world, and to let them know our strength has returned."
 SPA_join_germany: "Join the Reichspakt"
 SPA_join_germany_desc: "Our place lies at Germany's side - let us join the Reichspakt, so that the syndicalists will find themselves surrounded."
 SPA_join_entente: "Join the Entente"

 SPA_isolation: "We Stand Alone"
 SPA_isolation_desc: "Truly, Spain has no interest in joining in the larger conflicts of the world. We have seen enough troubles. For now, we rebuild and look to our own defence."
 SPA_guard_border: "Guard the Borders"
 SPA_guard_border_desc: "The many paths over the Pyrenees are our only weakness. We must fortify the border, to ensure no-one pushes into Spanish territory while we can yet defend it."
 SPA_bourbon_throne: "Claim the Bourbon Throne"
 SPA_bourbon_throne_desc: "King Jaime I is, by rights, the senior legitimate male heir of the House of Capet and thus heir to the French throne. Indeed, there are many Frenchmen who consider him the de jure King of France. It is time to see that claim enforced and see all of France and Spain united under a single banner once again."

### Events ###

### Domestic ###

 sprd.1.t: "The Kingdom of Spain"
 sprd.1.d: "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. After this, separatist movements in both the Basque country and Catalonia arose, and both the Church and a radical worker's movement, the CNT, are interfering in her internal politics. Spain's populace has become deeply divided.\n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded.\n\nAs a result of the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, accepting the will of his people, went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right.\n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
 sprd.1.a: "Let us prevail."

 sprd.2.t: "Black Monday hits Spain"
 sprd.2.d: "The Spanish economy has been tied to Germany since the end of the Weltkrieg. Since France and Britain's defeat, a good portion of our economy has been centred around exporting materials and goods to the German markets. As such, we can expect a flood of layoffs and closings. Our political foes will undoubtedly use this to their advantage."
 sprd.2.a: "We did not need this!"

 sprd.3.t: "Breakdown of our Society"
 sprd.3.d: "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics have been driving the Spanish people into a frenzy, and the sustained economic crisis following Black Monday has poured gasoline onto the embers. Several political groups have called for open protest against our reign."
 sprd.3.a: "This is not going to end well."

 sprd.4.d: "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 86. He died a natural death, so his passing should have put an end to the problem of Carlist succession, as the current King, Alfonso XIII, is now the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the head of the Carlist community in Spain, Duke Javier de Borbón-Parma, was designated instead by the Duke as his rightful heir."

 sprd.7.t: "Italian Federation agrees to join Javier's Bloc"
 sprd.7.d: "The Italian Federation has agreed to Javier's proposed Mediterranean Economic Bloc. While this will help the recovery of our economy, it helps the areas that Javier holds sway over the most."

 sprd.8.t: "Javier's Ambitions to the Throne"
 sprd.8.d: "Following his recent diplomatic successes abroad, Carlist leader Javier has given another speech. He uses his successes to claim himself more suited to run this country than King Alfonso."

 sprd.16.a: "Find the rat and establish a secret police!"
 sprd.16.b: "We knew this would happen."

 sprd.17.t: "Disbanding the CNT-FAI"
 sprd.17.d: "Our police and military have moved to disband and arrest as many CNT-FAI members as possible. However, we have found almost none. They appear to have fled or gone into hiding"

 sprd.27.t.juan: "What to do with the King?"
 sprd.27.d.juan: "The war is over and the King is still in a coma. Should we officially announce that Juan III is the new king, or should he remain in the background?"
 sprd.27.t.jaime: "Restoring the Monarchy"
 sprd.27.d.jaime: "After the assassination of Juan, a void was left in the terms of a Royal Regent. Now Juan's older brother Jaime has returned from abroad and is requesting his rightful place as the heir to our Kingdom."
 sprd.27.a: "Name him as Alfonso's successor."
 sprd.27.b: "No, the time of the kingdom is over."

 sprd.34.d: "Despite violence held during the election and immediate protests which have sprung up throughout Spain as the results are announced, it's clear: the Acción Popular remains in power, and the kingdom remains whole. The entire nation is breathing a sigh of relief, and despite obvious attempts by Carlists and CNT-FAI supporters to stir up trouble, everyone knows that the election was fair. They will not have the support for the uprising they crave, not now and perhaps not ever."
 sprd.34.a: "Freedom has won the day."

 sprd.35.t: "The CNT-FAI are Victorious!"
 sprd.35.d: "Though some question the veracity of the vote, there can be no question to most that the election was fair... and the CNT-FAI have eked out a narrow victory at the polls. The royal advisors suggest that the results of the election need not be abided by. Indeed, should the government be turned over to the anarcho-syndicalists, it's very likely the royal family will be immediately deposed if not outright endangered."
 sprd.35.a: "No, we will abide by the result."
 sprd.35.b: "Invalidate the election!"

 sprd.36.t: "The Carlists are Victorious!"
 sprd.36.d: "Though some question the veracity of the vote, there can be no question to most that the election was fair... and the Carlists have eked out a narrow victory over the anarcho-syndicalists and our own Acción Popular. The royal advisors give word that Javier is already on his way to the palace, and if the regent wishes to invalidate the election results he must move quickly. There is, after all, no telling whether Javier will keep his word and show mercy to the royal family."
 sprd.36.a: "No, we will abide by the result."
 sprd.36.b: "Invalidate the election!"

State power has broken down, civil Guard garrisons have been massacred, private plantations and factories have been collectivised by armed workers, and the clergy have been forcibly driven out. This new revolutionary government is in open warfare with the government.\n\nCarlists in the armed forces have united with the remnants of the Requêtes to seize control of Northern Spain! Carlist political organisations are taking over state authorities, the rural clergy are mobilising the masses, and the pretender has flown in to Burgos to proclaim the beginning of a Second Reconquista to reclaim Spain for a truly Catholic Dynasty.\n\nSpain is headed for a brutal civil war..."

### SPA ###

 sprc.101.t: "Civil War in Spain!"
 sprc.101.d: "The legitimate Spanish Kingdom under Alfonso XIII is under severe threat from anarchists and fanatics! While many are saying that this provides further proof of the terminal weakness of the House of Bourbon, a secure Spain is an important part of our defensive plans. It could be wise to help the Government put an end to these threats."

 sprc.120.d: "The Spanish Civil War is finally over, and it seems that [SPA.GetNameDef] has emerged triumphant. Much of the countryside lies in ruins, and order has not completely been restored, but the [SPA.GetAdjective] government announced that the anarchist and syndicalist threats had finally been dealt with and would be unlikely to rise again anytime soon. This is a triumph for King Alfonso XIII, though the king is unlikely to know of it, having fallen into a coma shortly before the civil war broke out."
 sprc.120.a: "Hail to the king!"

 sprc.122.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Terror"
 sprc.122.d: "During ongoing civil war some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress civilian population suspicious of helping our mortal enemies. Such policies, even if looks drastic, are necessary in these dark times."

When the French government fell to the Germans, Andorra appealed to the Spanish for protection which was granted, officially signed into law in 1919.\n\nThey now lie within our control and it may be worth integrating them into our nation - we surely can't leave them alone given their links to the old French and Spanish governments."
 sprc.255.a: "They shall be part of Spain!"

 sprc.256.t: "Peace With Andorra"
 sprc.256.d: "The Principality of Andorra joined the war against us in support of France, but after their defeat Andorra had no ties with the new Commune and aligned itself with Spain, officially signing a protection treaty in 1919.\n\nHowever, that treaty didn't annul their declaration of war against us, and in fact, nor has any treaty since. Several diplomats have been working to resolve this strange circumstance and now we have a peace deal ready to be signed, it is but a formality of course."

 sprc.311.t: "Crown Prince Assassinated"

 sprc.400.t: "The Spanish Civil War"
 sprc.400.d: "Ever since the defeat of Napoleon, Spain has been plagued by violence, dissent and turmoil. No amount of pleading, deal-making and appeasement has managed to do more than paper over the cracks as tensions bubbled. Finally they boiled over, the Spanish kingdom has been ripped apart by a three-sided civil war between numerous factions - the loyalists of the Madrid government, the supporters of the pretender Javier and finally the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI. There are already numerous reports of volunteers and equipment being shipped to Spain from all over the world to support one faction or another.\n\nSpain will be torn to shreds as a battlefield for the ideological forces of the wider world..."

 sprc.500.d: "With the full collapse of the Alfonsist Kingdom of Spain in the Spanish Mainland, some parts of their government and army had hoped that they could escape to the Spanish colonies in North Africa, and establish a government-in-exile like the one in Algiers. Regardless of how unlikely such a project would have been to succeed, considering the vast differences between the Spanish and French colonial empires, they never got a chance to even try. The colonial administration of Spanish Africa decided to preempt any attempts of turning their small territories into a machine with the sole purpose to reconquer Spain, by appealing to the Carlist government still holding out against the Red Menace. We were just informed that the colonies have chosen to recognise our government as the sole legitimate government of Spain, and fully submit to us."

 sprc.503.d.not_mrt: "With the CNT-FAI revolution in Spain and their gaining control over the African colonies of Spain, they have a foothold here.

 sprc.508.b: "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

 SPA_gil_robles: "José Maria Gil-Robles Quiñones"
 SPA_gil_robles_leader_desc: "José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed monarchist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."

 SPA_alfonso_de_borbon_leader_desc: "Alphonso XIII of Bourbon, king from the moment of his birth in 1886, was, to popular contempt, restored to the throne of Spain in 1932. His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."

 SPA_juan_de_borbon: "Juan de Borbón"
 SPA_juan_de_borbon_regnal: "Juan III"
 SPA_juan_de_borbon_leader_desc: "Juan of Bourbon inherited a Spain divided, a Spain on the brink of the abyss. As the son and successor to the widely despised Alphonso, his reign will forever be marred by the spectre of his father, but it is Juan, not Alphonso, who must lead Spain into a better future."

 SPA_jaime_de_borbon_regnal: "Jaime I"
 SPA_jaime_de_borbon_leader_desc: "Jaime of Bourbon, second son of King Alphonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has been crowned King of Spain. While not lacking in mental faculties, his reputation as an invalid precedes him. This unlikely King, however, must lead Spain into its uncertain future."
