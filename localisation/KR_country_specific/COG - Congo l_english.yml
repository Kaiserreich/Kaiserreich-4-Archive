 cog.1.t: "Portuguese Demands"
 cog.1.d: "[POR.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a demand to submit to their rule and to reinstate the Mwene wa Kongo - the Kingdom of Kongo - with which they have prior arrangements of overlordship and submission. Should we do this, our young state becomes a pawn on the great board of the European powers once more. Yet, if we refuse, it's almost certain they will issue a declaration of war."
 cog.1.a: "Our survival in these trying times is more important than our pride."
 cog.1.b: "We will meet them in battle!"

 cog.2.t: "A Congolese Approval"
 cog.2.d: "Kinshasa has accepted our offer and submitted, bringing peace to the Manikongo's lands. In return for the restoration of the Manikongo to his rightful throne, we will allow a large degree of autonomy. Now, however, Portugal can finally claim ownership of the Congo."
 cog.2.a: "Welcome back!"

 cog.3.t: "A Congolese Refusal"
 cog.3.d: "Kinshasa has refused our offer of protection and guarantee of stability, leaving us with no other choice but to press the issue with the use of military force."
 cog.3.a: "An unwise decision."
