##Ideas
 HAI_precarious_governance: "Precarious Governance"
 HAI_precarious_governance_desc: "The Haitian government lies on a thread - the position of [Root.GetLeader] hangs in the balance. Beset by opposing forces, one must solidify their grasp of the nation as soon as possible as the political situation in Haiti becomes increasingly unstable."
 HAI_crippling_illiteracy: "Crippling Illiteracy"
 HAI_crippling_illiteracy_desc: "We can't deny the elephant in the room; much of Haiti remains brutally illiterate, with schools heavily underfunded and most children being sent off to work at a young age. Higher education is typically resolved for French-speaking Haitians, and few resources exist for the average Haitian - those who speak Creole. While Haiti lags behind the rest of the world already, if illiteracy is not resolved, Haiti will continue to fall behind the rest of her neighbours."

 HAI_foreign_control_dynamic_modifier: "£pol_idea Foreign Political and Economic Control"
 HAI_foreign_control: "Foreign Political and Economic Control"
 HAI_foreign_control_desc: "Despite the American withdrawal from their occupation of our island, Haiti continues to find herself placed firmly in the American economic sphere. Split between German and American economic interests, our people find themselves continuously exploited, and unless something significant happens to either power, we will continue to be subject to their hold.\n§W-----------------§!\n§WAmerican Economic Influence:§!

 HAI_foreign_control_dummy: "$HAI_foreign_control$"
 HAI_foreign_control_dummy_desc: "Despite the American withdrawal from their occupation of our island, Haiti continues to find herself placed firmly in the American economic sphere.

 HAI_border_clashes_dynamic_modifier: "£pol_idea Dominican Border Clashes"
 HAI_border_clashes_idea: "Dominican Border Clashes"
 HAI_border_clashes_idea_desc: "Since the withdrawal of US troops, the Dominicans have begun to build up their forces on our border and grow even more aggressive in their actions. Despite our desire to hit back, Dominican bribes have neutered our army. We must clean up corruption and modernise our army at least a little bit to be able to defend our borders.\n§W-----------------\n$MODIFIER_ARMY_ORG_FACTOR$: [?HAIborderclashesORG|+=%1]\n$MODIFIER_STABILITY_FACTOR$: [?HAIborderclashesST|+=%]\n$MODIFIER_WAR_SUPPORT_FACTOR$: [?HAIborderclashesWS|+=%]§!"

 HAI_black_monday: "Black Monday"
 HAI_black_monday_desc: "Our fledging economy suffered a severe setback when the German economy collapsed with Black Monday. Rates of poverty continue to increase as more and more of our nation find themselves out of work. With its vibrations travelling far across the Atlantic and paralysing our already struggling economy, only time will tell whether or not Haiti's economy will ever recover to its former state."
 HAI_young_democracy: "A Young Democracy"
 HAI_young_democracy_desc: "For the first time in years, democracy has finally returned to the nation of Haiti. The road to democracy will not be easy, and there will be many obstacles to prevent our government from expressing the ideas of liberty, fraternity, and equality. A bold new course for our country but one that will undoubtedly be a beacon of freedom in the Caribbean!"
 HAI_state_economic_reforms: "State Economic Reforms"
 HAI_state_economic_reforms_desc: "Taking inspiration from other economies worldwide, the state has decided to directly intervene in the Haitian economy to prevent its collapse. With an ever expanded role, the government will aid the Haitian people in rebuilding their collapsed economy into one greater than the likes of which any Haitian has ever experienced. Through state-mandated projects and construction, Haiti will be rebuilt into a stronger nation - one to inspire the rest of the Caribbean."
 HAI_social_economic_reforms: "Socioeconomic Reforms"
 HAI_social_economic_reforms_desc: "The average Haitian citizen suffered greatly in the wake of the economic collapse. Together we will be stronger and overcome what has hit us - the greatest financial disaster in Haitian history. As even our nation's motto emphasises fraternity, the government will take steps to ensure that social and economic reforms are administered to help alleviate the burden of their fellow Haitian brothers and sisters in these turbulent times."
 HAI_institutionalized_guarde: "Expanded Garde d'Haiti"
 HAI_institutionalized_guarde_desc: "Haiti will need law and order as subversive elements from abroad and inside plan to destroy our nation in the coming days. By strengthening the Garde d'Haiti and expanding its roles, we can ensure that our country will be safe in these times. Haitian citizens can sleep well with the Garde's security, knowing that dangerous individuals will have no place in our society."
 HAI_civil_war: "Civil War!"
 HAI_civil_war_desc: "The events following the election have led to widespread chaos across the island. Many are joining the ranks of Lescot and Calixte as the struggle for the soul of Haiti begins. Both sides will be eager to make moves to increase their momentum and hold over the island, but only time will tell who will be successful... £war_support_texticon [?HAI_momentum]."
 HAI_citizens_army: "A Citizen Army"
 HAI_citizens_army_desc: "The army will be expanded to protect our nation from domestic threats and foreign threats, and incorporate more Haitian citizens. The Haitian military will be made up of loyal and diligent citizens to expand the army's role to protect and serve the Haitian nation."
 HAI_the_old_constitution: "Continued the Old Constitution"
 HAI_the_old_constitution_desc: "The Constitution will be restored to ensure the continued stability of the regime. Under these decrees, we will ensure that power is centred in the right hands and not in the hands of an unruly mob. This will ensure the strengthening of the Mulatto class, giving control to those who will use it best. Nonetheless, despite the re-establishment of the constitution, the lingering American and foreign grasp on our nation remains a constant reminder of our country's lack of complete independence."
 HAI_expanded_University_haiti: "Expanded Université d'État d'Haïti"
 HAI_expanded_University_haiti_desc: "The Université d'État d'Haïti is one of Haiti's most premier academic institutions. Dating back to the 1820s, the university's merger of various facilities has led to an expansion of the university. The school of medicine and law will be modernised to incorporate western studies - to ensure a future of bright Haitians. Haitian students will now have access to modern facilities for research and learning, greatly expanding our nation's academic prowess."
 HAI_importing_haitian_rubber: "Importing Haitian Rubber"

 HAI_liberal_haiti: "A Liberal Haiti"

##Focus Tree
 haiti_focus: "Haiti Focus Tree"
 HAI_secure_support: "Secure Council Support"
 HAI_secure_support_desc: "We should primarily seek to win over members of the Council of State, and where possible the National Assembly. Funding can be shifted to fund 'gifts' and economic concessions for legislators in order to win them to our side."
 HAI_new_commander: "A New Commander of the Garde d'Haiti"
 HAI_new_commander_desc: "President Calixte has continued to serve as Commander of the Garde, much to the chagrin of even his allies in the Chamber of Deputies. In order to reach an effective political settlement, a new Commander must be appointed, but who should assume the position?"
 HAI_new_justice_minister: "A New Minister of Justice"
 HAI_new_justice_minister_desc: "The failure of the political balancing act which grew out of Calixte's coup is inevitable. Thanks to a quirk of the Haitian constitution, however, the end of Calixte's executive authority may not be. In the event that no candidate is elected president, upon the end of the incumbent President's term, a council of certain ministers, chosen by the outgoing president shall be endowed with executive authority, and these ministers may concurrently hold elected office..."
 HAI_black_monday_hits_haiti: "Black Monday Hits Haiti"
 HAI_black_monday_hits_haiti_desc: "The German stock market has been routed and with it, the world has slipped almost universally into recession. For Haiti, already suffering acutely from the economic turmoil in the United States, this is particularly worrying."
 HAI_german_loan: "Secure a German Loan"
 HAI_german_loan_desc: "The United States has not been forthcoming with promised economic assistance and has continued to use our debts to American financiers to affect our politics. Despite its own problems, we should instead look to Germany to keep our government financially solvent."
 HAI_american_loan: "Secure an American Loan"
 HAI_american_loan_desc: "We cannot forget the malign ways in which European nations once exercised their financial leverage over us. We should seek American assistance in order to keep our government afloat."
 HAI_civil_relief_programs: "Civil Relief Programmes"
 HAI_civil_relief_programs_desc: "With funding secured, we can at last attempt to address the depression directly rather than simply relying on market cycles to bring about recovery."
 HAI_decrease_mil_spending: "Decrease Military Spending"
 HAI_decrease_mil_spending_desc: "Without foreign support, we have no option but to scale back military spending. We must simply live with the consequences for our security and both popular and elite support."
 HAI_german_investments: "Entice German Investments"
 HAI_german_investments_desc: "The German Empire hopes to see its largest companies gain a foothold in Haiti rather than operating through local intermediaries. We should offer full access to German companies in exchange for hiring commitments."
 HAI_begin_recovery: "Begin the Recovery"
 HAI_begin_recovery_desc: "With the government balance sheet stabilised and new sources of stimulus secured, we can loosen self-imposed financial controls."

 HAI_lescot: "Lescot Victorious"
 HAI_lescot_desc: "Calixte has been ousted from power and Elie Lescot, a representative of the old order, has assumed the presidency."
 HAI_conservative: "A Conservative Haiti"
 HAI_conservative_desc: "While Elie Lescot's conservative leanings have always been clear, the continued dominance of conservatives within what was once the political opposition to President Calixte was far from certain. Nevertheless, the old order, though perhaps with a different character, has prevailed."
 HAI_old_constitution: "Continue the Old Constitution"
 HAI_old_constitution_desc: "The Constitution of 1932 is grounded in a strong political tradition. While its idiosyncrasies receive criticism, particularly the fairly ambiguous status of the Council of State and the Senate, the document should be amended, not replaced."
 HAI_reconvene_senate: "Reconvene the Senate"
 HAI_reconvene_senate_desc: "Under President Dartiguenave, the upper house of the national legislature, the Senate, was replaced by a temporary body for a period of one year - a mechanism enshrined in Haitian law for decades. Dartiguenave's decree, however, has been extended ever since. At long last, the time has come to restore the Senate."
 HAI_continue_council: "Continue the Council of State"
 HAI_continue_council_desc: "Under President Dartiguenave, the upper house of the national legislature, the Senate, was replaced by a temporary body for a period of one year - a mechanism enshrined in Haitian law for decades. Dartiguenave's decree, however, has been extended ever since. Rather than restore the Senate, the body should be eliminated from the constitution and the present Council of State enshrined in it."
 HAI_define_executive: "Define Executive Authority"
 HAI_define_executive_desc: "The constitution's vague definition of some of the powers of the executive allowed Calixte to bring the country to the precipice. In coordination with both chambers of the Assembly, we must draw up a series of amendments precisely defining the place of each body and restricting elected officials from concurrently holding appointed positions."
 HAI_reactionary_republic: "A Reactionary Republic"
 HAI_reactionary_republic_desc: "While many of the nation's foremost citizens express scepticism with our government's embrace of moderate reform, we must allay their concerns."
 HAI_question_of_guarde: "The Question of the Garde d'Haiti"
 HAI_question_of_guarde_desc: "The army has long been a source of national pride, Haiti was born from righteous struggle after all. It has also, however, long been a thorn in the side of civilian administrations. Indeed, we are only able to reverse the damage done by the Garde under Calixte's leadership. Going forward, we must ensure that the Garde is entirely under civilian supervision and reduce its societal standing."
 HAI_liberal: "A Liberal Haiti"
 HAI_liberal_desc: "Owing to his disagreements with other holdovers from the Borno days and more conservative nationalists, President Lescot has shepherded liberal nationalists to political ascendency while assuring his continued political dominance."
 HAI_attract_business: "Attract Big Business"
 HAI_attract_business_desc: "The largest companies have consolidated their dominance and increasingly established networks of subsidiaries the world over. While they may not be 'Haitian' in origin, we should actively court the entry of the world's largest corporations into Haiti. By positioning ourselves as a staunch ally of such companies, we will surely benefit."
 HAI_cash_crops: "A Haitian HASCO"
 HAI_cash_crops_desc: "Duties on luxury agricultural products sustain the state budget. The state must forge ahead and open new lands for their cultivation."
 HAI_cash_mining: "Expand Cash Mining"
 HAI_cash_mining_desc: "The mineral wealth of our nation remains almost entirely unsurveyed. To stimulate the development of the mining sector, landowners should be granted complete legal control over subterranean resources and provided with financial incentives to survey the resources beneath their plots."
 HAI_building_infrastructure: "Building an Infrastructure"
 HAI_building_infrastructure_desc: "Beyond the cities, for the transportation of goods and personnel, businesses must rely on a series of locally maintained dirt paths alone, often making use of pack animals. Let us take up the torch of infrastructural development again, expanding Borno's rail network into the most isolated parts of the country."
 HAI_housing_projects: "New Housing Projects"
 HAI_housing_projects_desc: "Informal settlements dominate the cities. New architectural developments, luckily, may at last allow us to address this issue. The state should construct standardised high-density apartment buildings over such settlements and lease units back to former squatters."
 HAI_agrarian_economy: "An Agrarian Economy"
 HAI_agrarian_economy_desc: "To begin to assess how to further our national development without compromising the primarily agrarian structure of the economy, we must tread carefully. A new commission of business leaders should be established to advise our government on how to accomplish such."
 HAI_modernize_farming: "Modernise Farming Practices"
 HAI_modernize_farming_desc: "Agricultural mechanisation has precipitated the explosive growth of farm productivity in the leading nations of the world. We ought to put government funding towards the acquisition and distribution of modern farm equipment."
 HAI_begin_electrification: "Begin Electrification"
 HAI_begin_electrification_desc: "Haiti has lagged decades behind much of the rest of the world in bringing electricity to the masses. Outside of the wealthier parts of Port-Au-Prince, electricity is the exclusive domain of the state. We must at last address this issue."
 HAI_begin_tourism: "Begin Tourism"
 HAI_begin_tourism_desc: "Haiti's natural beauty would surely appeal to the burgeoning travel industry if we only promoted our country as a potential destination."
 HAI_subsidize_farmers: "Subsidise Farmers"
 HAI_subsidize_farmers_desc: "Rich nations have ramped up agricultural subsidies, flooding peripheral markets with goods. While we cannot offer our farmers such a generous largesse, we can underwrite certain farm expenses."
 HAI_expand_lumber: "Expand the Lumber Industry"
 HAI_expand_lumber_desc: "Under the American occupation, lumber exports grew substantially. New forestry methods enabling the creation of vast tree plantations, however, were never put into practice. A bit of state capital is just what the lumber industry needs to transform itself into a lucrative beacon of modernity."
 HAI_rural_housing: "Rural Housing Projects"
 HAI_rural_housing_desc: "Many in the countryside live in squalor, jeopardising their work productivity. With state support for new housing developments in the countryside, agricultural production will surely grow greatly."
 HAI_revitalized_economy: "A Revitalised Economy"
 HAI_revitalized_economy_desc: "The economic depression which began in 1925 and reached new lows in 1936 is at an end. Our coffers overflow with the fruits of economic prosperity. We can put this money to use, expanding, rather than cutting back on, our most successful economic initiatives."
 HAI_new_constitution: "A New Constitution"
 HAI_new_constitution_desc: "The constitution of 1932, though steeped in tradition, represents all that is wrong with Haitian democracy and shows just how far Haiti has strayed from the ideals of its founders. An entirely new document must be drawn up mandating a more thoroughly democratic political system and reducing the power of the executive."
 HAI_parliamentary: "A Parliamentary System"
 HAI_parliamentary_desc: "In order to preclude abuse of power, the office of the presidency should be made mostly ceremonial while most executive power is transferred to the Speaker of the National Assembly. The transition, of course, shall be gradual, with President Lescot given time to campaign for the Assembly and the role of Speaker."
 HAI_presidential: "A Presidential Republic"
 HAI_presidential_desc: "The executive has proven effective in addressing national emergencies. In order to preclude abuse of the office, the President and his cabinet should be made accountable before the legislature short of impeachment and the speaker of the National Assembly invested with limited executive authority."
 HAI_dissolve_guarde: "Dissolve the Garde d'Haiti"
 HAI_dissolve_guarde_desc: "The army has threatened administration after administration. While a strong border force must be maintained, the army itself, the Garde, simply must be dissolved. Let us strike the iron while it's hot and eliminate the army while it is weak."
 HAI_democratic_legislature: "A Democratic Legislature"
 HAI_democratic_legislature_desc: "While Haiti was perhaps the first nation to formally establish universal suffrage, the realities of Haitian democracy has seen access to the ballot box severely restricted. With structural concerns sorted, we should invest in new electoral oversight mechanisms to ensure that every Haitian is aware of and able to exercise their right to vote."
 HAI_liberal_republic: "Devolution"
 HAI_liberal_republic_desc: "To ensure that the nation is never again dominated by a core of urban elites, we must lessen the distance between the halls of power and the common people. To accomplish this, municipalities and departments should be given greater administrative responsibilities and empowered to form their own directly elected governing councils."
 HAI_civil_war_idea: "Civil War!"
 HAI_civil_war_idea_desc: "Social order has collapsed in Haiti due to political turmoil. The fate of Haiti shall be decided by force of arms."
 HAI_mobilize_people: "Mobilise the People"
 HAI_mobilize_people_desc: "Most of the Garde has remained loyal to Calixte. As a result, we must invest considerably into the organisation of a new fighting force from among the common people by way of conscription as needed."
 HAI_mobilize_guard: "Mobilise the Garde"
 HAI_mobilize_guard_desc: "The rank and file of the Haitian Garde remain loyal to Calixte personally. As our ranks remain largely intact in much of the country, it will require only minimal effort to organise an effective fighting force."
 HAI_capture_north: "Capture the North"
 HAI_capture_north_desc: "With our forces consolidated, we should secure our power base in the north of the country."
 HAI_organise_forces: "Organise our Forces"
 HAI_organise_forces_desc: "The hastily assembled nature of our forces and command structure necessitate quick reform. We can apply experience gained from the American occupation and their civil war to develop a more effective force structure and win the hearts of our men."
 HAI_prepare_push_south: "Prepare the Push South"
 HAI_prepare_push_south_desc: "With the North of the country consolidated, we must draw up plans and prepare the men for the great thrust southwards."
 HAI_prince_liberated: "Port-Au-Prince Liberated!"
 HAI_prince_liberated_desc: "In a great symbolic victory, the capital has fallen to our forces. We must invest the necessary resources to consolidate control over the city."
 HAI_american_help: "Seek American Help"
 HAI_american_help_desc: "The United States is keen to see Calixte defeated. Now that we have the upper hand in the struggle for Haiti, the Americans should be willing to assist us."
 HAI_les_cayes: "Les Cayes is Ours"
 HAI_les_cayes_desc: "Les Cayes, once firmly under the control of Calixte's forces, has fallen. We should work to cement our control."
 HAI_german_help: "Seek German Help"
 HAI_german_help_desc: "The German Empire seeks a foothold in Haiti for its forces and businesses. We should be able to extract significant military aid from them in exchange for promises of concessions upon the war's conclusion."
 HAI_push_les_cayes: "Push on to Les Cayes"
 HAI_push_les_cayes_desc: "Les Cayes remains in a state of near-anarchy but is within striking distance of the main body of our forces. We should prepare an offensive to capture the city."
 HAI_seize_american_weapons: "Seize American Weapons"
 HAI_seize_american_weapons_desc: "Though it beat a hasty retreat from Haiti in the face of its own internal issues, the United States remains hostile to our government. We should take control of any remaining American materiel despite its inevitable objections."
 HAI_aftermath_of_collapse: "Aftermath of the Collapse"
 HAI_aftermath_of_collapse_desc: "The return of American forces to the continental United States has left not only equipment but also physical infrastructure behind in Haiti. We should catalogue and make use of disused American facilities."
 HAI_les_cayes_cache: "Seize the Les Cayes Cache"
 HAI_les_cayes_cache_desc: "Les Cayes is home to a large Garde depot and ammunition storehouse, bringing the facility back online would be a boon for our forces."
 HAI_saint_marc: "North to Saint-Marc"
 HAI_saint_marc_desc: "The port at Saint-Marc supplies much of the country with foreign products. We must capture the port city and ensure its functioning."
 HAI_final_offensive: "The Final Offensive"
 HAI_final_offensive_desc: "Most of Haiti is ours. We must organise the men for the final thrust to the North against Lescot's forces."
 HAI_cap_haitien: "Cap-Haitien is Ours!"
 HAI_cap_haitien_desc: "Cap-Haitien, once firmly under the control of Lescot's forces, has fallen. We should work to cement our control."
 HAI_calixte: "Calixte Reelected!"
 HAI_calixte_desc: "Démosthenes Pétrus Calixte has secured another term as President of Haiti despite the continued misgivings of much of the established political class."
 HAI_equality: "An Equal Haiti"
 HAI_equality_desc: "The path forward for broad democratic reform lays open at last. While reform could potentially complicate policymaking in the near term, it shall secure Haiti's future."
 HAI_democracy: "A Democratic Constitution"
 HAI_democracy_desc: "In a nation as stratified as Haiti, the basic law of the land must strive to provide access to the political process to the historically underrepresented. Let us draft a new constitution entirely from scratch."
 HAI_peoples_assembly: "A People's Assembly"
 HAI_peoples_assembly_desc: "The structure of the national assembly has historically favoured the political centre of Haiti - Port-Au-Prince, particularly its most famously wealthy burrows. Our new assembly, with deputies representing districts rather than a department at large and reservations for rural regions, will certainly bring much-needed change. With preparations made, let us immediately hold elections for the new body."
 HAI_no_foreigners: "A Haitian Government"
 HAI_no_foreigners_desc: "To prevent a return to the time of foreign domination, members of the assembly should be prohibited from having any financial relationship with foreign citizens."
 HAI_lib_friends: "Court the Parti Populaire Progressiste"
 HAI_lib_friends_desc: "While owing to their opposition to Calixte's methods and the political power of the Garde, Haiti's liberals have come into conflict with President Calixte, but they share many of the president's political goals. We should extend the olive branch and bring them into government, offering key ministerial positions."
 HAI_social_democracy: "A Social Democracy"
 HAI_social_democracy_desc: "Free from the corruption of the mixed-race elite, President Calixte has restored democracy to Haiti. The new social democratic government will immediately work to ensure economic and social equality for the people of Haiti who have long suffered from injustice."
 HAI_diminish_guarde: "Diminish the Garde d'Haiti"
 HAI_diminish_guarde_desc: "The Haitian army has long been the vanguard of black political power in the face of mulatto political domination. The politicisation of the army, however, could serve to derail Haitian democracy. With Haiti on the path to freedom at last, the independence of the Garde must be curtailed with thorough civilian oversight and the establishment of clear rules governing political appointments to the Garde."
 HAI_workers_rights: "Expand Worker's Rights"
 HAI_workers_rights_desc: "Haiti has long oscillated between domination by foreign interests and protectionism. We should instead harness the foreign for the benefit of the people of Haiti. Before any concerted economic programme is put forward, a comprehensive charter of workers rights should be enacted."
 HAI_strong_haiti: "A Strong Haiti"
 HAI_strong_haiti_desc: "True democracy is still Haiti's destiny. Yet recent events have demonstrated the need for the Garde to maintain its leading role in politics. We must shepherd our great nation into a brighter future."
 HAI_state_economy: "The State Economy"
 HAI_state_economy_desc: "For the Haitian economy to survive, it must be the state that will dictate the course of the economy. Only under the state will the means of production be properly controlled and will protect business interests in Haiti."
 HAI_calixte_state: "Calixte's State"
 HAI_calixte_state_desc: "The civil war that threatened to break our nation apart was crushed by our indomitable resolve. The rebels have been destroyed, and Haiti's enemies are either dead or away in cowardly exile. It is time to heal the wounds of the civil war and unlock our true potential. Under Calixte, we will rebuild Haiti into the powerhouse she is meant to be and find our place in the sun!"
 HAI_subservient_assembly: "A Subservient Assembly"
 HAI_subservient_assembly_desc: "While we agree that democratic values are essential, democracy can be dangerous in these unstable times. We have witnessed even the fall of the North American giant, and clearly, democracy could not save them there. With our new leader Calixte in charge, we will keep a watchful eye on the Assembly - this is how Haiti's new democracy will operate."
 HAI_institutionalize_guarde: "Expand the Garde d'Haiti"
 HAI_institutionalize_guarde_desc: "The army has long served as the bulwark of the people against domination by the political elite. It should naturally be given a direct role in civilian government if our nation is not to again find itself at the mercy of millionaires, planters, and captains of industry."
 HAI_haitian_caesar: "The Haitian Caesar"
 HAI_haitian_caesar_desc: "Like the great Caeser who led Rome to glory after securing it from his rivals, so has Calixte marched in Port-au-Prince in similar triumph! Saving Haiti in her hour of need, Calixte has indeed restored order, law, peace, and democracy to our nation. Under the leadership of a Haitian Caeser, the possibilities for us are endless, and our country will march forward with him like Caeser's legions to glory!"
 HAI_prosperous_haiti: "A Prosperous Haiti"
 HAI_prosperous_haiti_desc: "We can't deny that Haiti's economy lags behind compared to the rest of the western hemisphere. However, with the new industrial and financial reforms pushed by Calixte, our country will surely catch up. With the state helping struggling businesses and industry, our reforms will transform Haiti into a prosperous nation."
 HAI_state_plantations: "The Kaffeemark"
 HAI_state_plantations_desc: "Since their reorganisation under state control, the many large sugar plantations across the country have begun to pay dividends. More funding should be earmarked for the expansion of the most profitable such sites."
 HAI_technical_assistance: "Negotiate with HAPAG"
 HAI_technical_assistance_desc: "Our country will need expertise from overseas to help us modernise. As part of Calixte's ambitious plan to modernise the nation, we will hire advisors, technicians, and engineers from the German shipping company HAPAG to help build up our country as a truly modern state. They will aid in the construction and development of our cities and our infrastructure so that Haiti will be one of the most developed nations in the Caribbean."
 HAI_education_reform: "Begin Education Reform"
 HAI_education_reform_desc: "Our country lags behind much of the Caribbean when it comes to literacy; despite the Caribbean being very much underdeveloped in education, Haiti's illiteracy rates are particularly abysmal. Under the leadership of Calixte, however, this will change. To start off our education reform, we will begin enforcing compulsory education to ensure our children will become a generation of Haitian intellectuals."
 HAI_education_spending: "Increase Education Spending"
 HAI_education_spending_desc: "Our initial education reforms have been successful! We have received word that day and day, more Haitian children are attending school, but still, this is not enough. Our schools are heavily underfunded, and our government has proposed that we begin injecting money into them to ensure that our children have the best facilities possible."
 HAI_expand_welfare_state: "Expand the Welfare State"
 HAI_expand_welfare_state_desc: "Black Monday severely crippled our nation, putting more people out of work and onto the streets than ever before. Despite our slight economic recovery, it will take more than just the free market to help those who are struggling. The government will ensure that those who are desperate will have their needs care for - in these stressful times, the government must be looking out for their people."
 HAI_begin_industrialization: "Begin Industrialisation"
 HAI_begin_industrialization_desc: "With the assistance of our technical advisors and our growing financial reform, our next project in fully developing our nation is the start of industrialising Haiti. While we are indeed a tiny nation, we have the resources and space to begin industrialisation. Thanks to Calixte, Haiti will soon be the Caribbean's most premier economy."
 HAI_business_subsidies: "Local Business Subsidies"
 HAI_business_subsidies_desc: "Black Monday hit many local businesses hard; without the protection of their government - many companies were forced into bankruptcy. Now that our economy is slowly recovering, it is time to re-invest in our civilian economy. To encourage the growth of businesses, the government will grant them subsidies as an investment and help companies get back on their feet."
 HAI_state_work: "State Work Programmes"
 HAI_state_work_desc: "With the worst of Black Monday over, many Haitians still remain unemployed. This provides the Haitian government with a free workforce, and we can use this manpower to build government projects such as government housing, infrastructure, and schools. Not only will we be able to develop our economy, but this also gives plenty of Haitians the ability to work once again."
 HAI_infrastructure_expansion: "Infrastructure Expansions"
 HAI_infrastructure_expansion_desc: "As part of our state work programmes, we will take steps to build infrastructure in Haiti - most of our network consists of poorly paved roads, and in some areas roads are simply non-existent. The political turmoil of the last years has also degraded what little we had, making it difficult for our people to use them as our nation's economy rises again. We will undertake an modernisation programme to build up Haiti's infrastructure while also providing jobs for Haitians."
 HAI_seize_american_assets: "Seize American Assets"
 HAI_seize_american_assets_desc: "The United States has clearly positioned itself against us and our future. Ever since their unlawful occupation of the islands, Haiti has been exploited repeatedly by our giant of a neighbour. As a result, the operations of American companies in Haiti and any assets must be taken over by the state to better serve the Haitian people. No longer shall we bound to the chains of the Yanks - their industries are rightfully ours!"
 HAI_electrification_program: "Begin Electrification Programme"
 HAI_electrification_program_desc: "Haiti has lagged decades behind much of the rest of the world in bringing electricity to the masses. Outside of the wealthier parts of Port-Au-Prince, electricity is the exclusive domain of the state. We must at last address this issue."
 HAI_housing_program: "New Housing Programme"
 HAI_housing_program_desc: "Thanks to Black Monday and the years of political turmoil, many Haitians are out of their homes. We deeply care for the plight of our fellow Haitians, and thus we will take steps to resolve this. With aid from the government, we will begin a rigorous project to build up government housing. This way, we can provide Haitian citizens who are less fortunate with cheap accommodations and so that they can finally have a roof over their heads."
 HAI_financial_control: "Assert Financial Control"
 HAI_financial_control_desc: "Our economy has long been tied to that of the United States, and it would not be out of place to say that Haiti was indeed an American puppet. This made us incredibly weak and reliant on American goods, but not anymore. With the American giant involved in their own civil war, we can finally assert ourselves financially. Our nation will finally unlock our economic potential; no longer will we be reliant on others!"
 HAI_mining_sector: "Grow Mining Sector"
 HAI_mining_sector_desc: "Our nation's natural wealth remains mostly unsurveyed and unexploited. A state mining company should be established to finally survey what lies beneath our nation and put our natural resources fully to work."
 HAI_subsidize_foreign_business: "Subsidise Foreign Business"
 HAI_subsidize_foreign_business_desc: "While we have developed our internal economy, Haiti has many resources that other nations would be interested in investing in. To further encourage investment in Haiti, we will provide subsidies to businesses. This will make other countries more eager to invest in our future, helping us finally rid ourselves of our financial problems."
 HAI_new_economy: "The New Economy"
 HAI_new_economy_desc: "When Black Monday hit Haiti, observers believed that this would spell a decades-long doom for us and that we would never recover to a pre-depression level economy. Calixte's government has proven them wrong, and now Haiti stands more robust than ever; our economy is finally booming. The worst days of the depression might be mentioned in our history books, but our nation will now experience a new economy, a new era of prosperity and wealth for all Haitians!"

 HAI_natfrance_ties_desc: "While relations between France and Haiti have been strained in the past given the fact that Haiti was indeed once a part of the French colonial empire, as we grow closer to the Entente we should re-establish our ties with the French state. We will strengthen our ties with the French people through our shared interests and values."

 HAI_entice_german_investments_desc: "Haiti contains resources that Germany is interested in, such as sugar and coffee. In addition to these industries, the Germans are also interested in developing our tourism industry.

 HAI_subsidize_german_business: "Subsidise German Businesses"
 HAI_subsidize_german_business_desc: "The German Empire has few investments in the Caribbean, but now that our cooperation is increasing, we should seek to change this.

 HAI_attract_german_immigration: "Attract German Immigration"
 HAI_attract_german_immigration_desc: "Starting in the mid-1800s, Germans began arriving in Haiti due to our nation's limited competition and openness to free trade.

To that end, Haiti will help Germany accomplish their place in the sun while also transforming our state into a modern Caribbean nation."
 HAI_mission_to_france: "Mission to the Commune"

While the new socialist America has promised to protect Haiti without interfering in our affairs, they have requested that we grant them a naval base to ensure security in the Caribbean. This will strengthen ties between our nations, but it will also encourage cooperation in maritime affairs and give us much-needed protection."

We should instead empower such officers, granting them sole discretion over many key areas of strategic importance."
 HAI_nco_training: "New NCO Training"
 HAI_nco_training_desc: "The conflict at the border has provided the men with critical combat experience. Proposals to loosen restrictions on-field promotions for the rank and file have proliferated among Garde command and should be carried out.

 hai.1.t: "Haitian Independence Day"
 hai.1.d: "President Calixte and the elite of the Garde d'Haiti paraded through Port-au-Prince to celebrate Haitian Independence Day, a day which seems ironic to many considering Haiti's political situation. Haiti was occupied by the United States starting in 1919, and while the occupation officially ended in 1933, American restrictions are still severe.\n\nFollowing President Calixte's coup of former President Louis Borno in 1933, the Haitian-American relationship has become even more strained. With the establishment puppet Borno no longer around to do the bidding of American banks, they have struggled to get President Calixte to follow the agreements made by previous Haitian governments regarding Haiti's finances. As with anything in Haiti, race plays a major role. Calixte is loved by the poorer black population, including its most proud institution, the army. The mixed-race political elite detests Calixte and wishes to regain control of the political apparatus.\n\nWith the Haitian general elections on the horizon in April, Calixte will struggle to secure the support of the National Assembly to earn re-election, and struggle harder to secure support in the Council of State for ratification. Calixte has been presented with 3 options by his cabinet and clique of advisors. First, attempt to use proscribed methods to gain the support of Deputies and Councillors. Second, run a popular campaign and give up the title of Commander of the Garde d'Haiti as a gesture of good faith. Third, the most radical option, is to do anything within his power to prevent the ratification of a Lescot victory and appoint himself to his own cabinet, thereby continuing to rule by de facto authority even after his term has elapsed.\n\nOpposition leader Elie Lescot, who is supported by a broad coalition including the nationalist Sténio Vincent and liberal Jean Price-Mars, has made it clear that if Calixte loses legitimately and refuses to hand over power, he will resort to violence to protect democracy in Haiti."
 hai.1.a: "Libète, Egalite, Fratènite"

 hai.2.t: "Black Monday Hits Haiti"
 hai.2.d: "Disaster! Following the collapse of the German economy, German businesses and American financial institutions have sent shockwaves through Haiti. With unemployment already rampant in Haiti, this crisis is bound to exacerbate this issue. All the reforms that President Calixte has passed in the past few years are for nought."
 hai.2.a: "Mein Gott!"

 hai.3.t: "Lescot Denounces Presidential Overreach"
 hai.3.d: "As President Calixte leaned hard on members of the Council of State and the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition Elie Lescot denounced President Calixte in a speech to the National Assembly. While it may strengthen the resolve of opposition Deputies, Lescot has never liked Calixte and his speech will change few minds."
 hai.3.a: "He doesn't matter."

 hai.4.t: "Centrist Councillor Speaks out"
 hai.4.d: "In a harsh critique of President Calixte's electoral campaign, a centrist councillor has denounced Calixte as being undemocratic and borderline dictatorial. He claims that the practices made by the Calixte regime will bring an end to Haiti's democracy."
 hai.4.a: "Silence him."
 hai.4.b: "Let him go."

 hai.5.t: "A Proposal from Casséus"
 hai.5.d: "As the election intensifies, we can dash away any hopes of a landslide victory. The election will most likely be bitterly contested and close. In order to increase our chances of winning, we may consider some "other methods" such as using the names of the deceased on ballots. This is only for the security of Haiti, as Calixte only has good intentions for our beloved nation."
 hai.5.a: "It must be done for the preservation of Haitian democracy and order."
 hai.5.b: "So this is how democracy dies...with thunderous applause."

 hai.6.t: "Scandal on Campaign"
 hai.6.d: "Somehow while on the campaign trail, it was revealed that several members of the Garde d' Haiti had taken bribes from the Dominican Republic. Some claim that the bribes go as high as President Calixte himself. While the Garde's loyalty to Haiti is beyond doubt, this may be difficult to overcome politically."
 hai.6.a: "Acknowledge that it is an issue that must be investigated."
 hai.6.b: "Deny these crimes!"

 hai.7.t: "Assemblyman Announces Support for Calixte"
 hai.7.d: "It would appear that our efforts have bore fruit. Thanks to Calixte's charisma on the election trail and some "motivations," a number of assemblymen from the various departments have declared their support for Calixte."
 hai.7.a: "One step closer to victory!"

 hai.8.t: "Price-Mars Remains Sceptical"
 hai.8.d: "The prominent doctor and politician Jean Price-Mars has spoken about his doubts toward President Calixte's regime. While Price-Mars has agreed with the President's left-leaning views, he has repeatedly denounced the President's authoritarian tendencies."
 hai.8.a: "Sit down with him privately."
 hai.8.b: "Call him out in the press!"

 hai.9.t: "Jean Price-Mars Endorses Calixte"
 hai.9.d: "It appears that Calixte's arguments and discourse have swung Price-Mars' favour. With the progressive cause behind us, we shall be victorious!"
 hai.9.a: "Excellent!"

 hai.10.t: "Jean Price-Mars Rebukes Calixte"
 hai.10.d: "Price-Mars has denounced Calixte as a despot, claiming that Calixte's tactics and policies will only spell for democracy in Haiti. Given the doctor's popularity among the educated and his own support base, this is a serious setback for the Calixte movement."
 hai.10.a: "What a fool."

 hai.11.t: "Calixte Sworn In as Minister of Justice"
 hai.11.d: "With it clear that President Calixte will not win reelection in the National Assembly, his advisors have devised a scheme through which he will stall ratification and continue to govern as de facto president through the cabinet. As the Haitian constitution is not clear what happens if no president is selected by June 10, it is widely accepted that the former president's cabinet would continue to rule the nation. With President Calixte now also a member of his own cabinet, he can continue to govern even after his term has expired."
 hai.11.a: "Whoever thought of that is a genius!"

 hai.12.t: "National Assembly Protests"
 hai.12.d: "Declaring our campaign as one that is fraudulent and full of corruption, members of the National Assembly have protested against us. They have pledged to do everything in their power to block Calixte from gaining the presidency. Our hold throughout the nation is quite secure, and these fools will soon learn that they will be on the wrong side of Haitian history."
 hai.12.a: "Who cares?"

 hai.13.t: "Councillors Caught Colluding with Lescot"
 hai.13.d: "We have received news that some of the councillors are outright colluding with Elie Lescot. While we do have a fair amount of support on our side, this gives Lescot's side an advantage. While we can just let them be, to solidify our chances of victory we can ask the Garde to persuade them otherwise."
 hai.13.a: "Arrest them, and issue pardons for their votes."
 hai.13.b: "Let them go."

 hai.14.t: "A New Commander of the Garde d'Haiti"
 hai.14.d: "The time has come to appoint a new commander for the illustrious and elite Garde d'Haiti. The institutionalists in the National Assembly support Alfred Auguste Nemours, while many in President Calixte's inner circle support Paul Magloire, a young officer loyal to Calixte personally and politically."
 hai.14.a: "Choose Nemours."
 hai.14.b: "Magloire has always been loyal."

 hai.15.t: "The American Collapse"
 hai.15.d: "The unthinkable has happened. For years, while the United States was plagued with economic disorder and instability, its constant presence in the Caribbean made Haiti a virtual puppet. For years, the Haitian people suffered - the United States Marines brought nothing but misery to our nation. The US-backed projects did nothing but bring the corvee system to Haiti, making Haiti into a slave state yet again. No more. The colossus of the New World has broken out into an all-out civil war and has fallen on her knees. There is no doubt they will be unable to rule over us like the imperialists they are. Once again, Haiti's chains are broken."
 hai.15.a: "My God."

 hai.16.t: "The Aftermath of the Monte Cristi Affair"
 hai.16.d: "After the Dominican Army slaughtered thousands of Haitian citizens in the border town of Monte Cristi tensions have risen massively between the Dominicans and our government."
 hai.16.a: "We must be ready."

 hai.17.t: "Reports of Bribery"
 hai.17.d: "While [HAI.GetLeader] has tried hard to crack down on Dominican excursions over the border, his efforts continue to be remanded by his field commanders. A junior officer has reported that the Dominicans have bribed these commanders to stay quiet and refuse to crack down on the Dominican soldiers."
 hai.17.a: "We must crack down on the Dominicans!"
 hai.17.b: "We cannot afford to catch these traitors."

 hai.18.t: "Haiti Arrests Officials"
 hai.18.d: "Reports from our border agents indicated that the officers we bribed have been arrested. While this has not helped them solve the underlying problem of corruption in their ranks."
 hai.18.a: "We must continue to undermine them."

 hai.19.t: "Haitian Officers Successfully Bribed"
 hai.19.d: "Our spies across the border and informants in our own army units reported that in the last few weeks Dominican officials have issued another round of bribes to our officers in the field. Coinciding with reports from the same units that there has been no activity from the Dominican side of the border, we can assume that these officers are not to be trusted."
 hai.19.a: "Tensions build..."

 hai.20.t: "1940 Haitian Elections"
 hai.20.d1: "In perhaps what has been Haiti's largest ever and most extraordinary election, Haitians from all corners of the island voted at polling booths today - eager to partake in the country's seemingly democratic vote. Tensions are running high, and at the end of the day, thousands gathered at the country's capital at Port-au-Prince to hear the election results. Competing this year is none other than current President Calixte, leader of the Progressives Jean Price-Mars, and Sténio Vincent's Nationalists. A bitter and ideologically contested election, the results are in, and the winner is..."

A bitter and ideologically contested election, the results are in, and the winner is..."
 hai.20.d3: "General Lavaud promised new elections, and now he has delivered! Following the seizure of power by the military, new elections have been called to finally return democracy to Haiti. Haitians from all corners of the island voted at polling booths today - eager to partake in the country's seemingly democratic vote. Tensions are running high, and at the end of the day, thousands gathered at the country's capital at Port-au-Prince to hear the election results. The candidates among the candidates are Sténio Vincent, leader of the Nationalists, Paul Magloire, now the leader of Calixte's old party, as well as Jean Price-Mars, the leader of the Progressive Party."

The candidates among the candidates are Sténio Vincent, leader of the Nationalists, Paul Magloire, now the leader of Calixte's old party, Jean Price-Mars, the leader of the Progressive Party, and Max Hudicourt, the leader of the Socialist Party."

 hai.20.b: "Elie Lescot's Liberals win re-election!"
 hai.20.c: "Jean Price-Mars' Progressives are victorious!"
 hai.20.d: "Sténio Vincent's Nationalists claim victory!"
 hai.20.e: "Max Hudicourt will reassure our socialist allies!"
 hai.20.f: "Paul Magloire is the man for the job!"

 hai.21.t: "The End of the 2nd American Civil War"
 hai.21.d: "The dust has settled and [361.owner.GetNameDef] has arisen from the ashes. How will they transform their nation and Haiti?"
 hai.21.a: "The Americans return."
 hai.21.b: "A change of ownership."

 hai.22.t: "Haiti Wants to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 hai.22.d: "With the breakout of war in America, The small Caribbean nation of Haiti has suddenly found itself free and independent, but alone in the world. As tensions across the globe heat up, the Haitian government has not been blind to the dangers of their new position, and after building a series of new economic ties with our economic sphere, have now petitioned us for membership in the [Root.GetFactionName].\n\nOur foreign office has discussed this proposal at length - while Haiti isn't exactly known as a powerhouse on the world stage, their strategic position in the centre of the Caribbean Sea would help us conduct operations across the whole region, which includes some sizeable mineral reserves and the ever-important Panama Canal. Furthermore, some more optimistic minds believe that Haiti may be able to sustain some rubber plantations, if given some capital to develop them. Perhaps we should take Port-au-Prince up on their offer?"
 hai.22.d.GER: "The American Civil War has proven to be a significant blow to the Monroe Doctrine, and the smaller nations of the Americas have now found themselves without protection in the power vacuum. The island nation of Haiti has approached us, as one of the few regional powers in the Americas with naval reach, to petition to join our alliance. Although they cannot provide much in the way of arms or men, given the circumstances it may be worth expanding our reach in the Caribbean to bolster our exist hold in the area. A closer look at the current situation might be worth investigating as the Foreign ministry weighs its options."

 hai.22.a: "Of course!"
 hai.22.b: "We have no need of them."

 hai.23.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Us Membership in the [From.GetFactionName]"
 hai.23.d: "For whatever reason, [From.GetNameDefCap] has decided that they cannot accept us into their faction. Apparently, our proud nation is little more than a liability to the so-called giants of the world stage."
 hai.23.a: "Damn them!"

 hai.24.t: "Inquiring with [?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDef] On Rubber Cultivation"
 hai.24.d: "As the 2nd Weltkrieg drags on, it has become clear that rubber will be a vital resource. As access to Africa and Asia are far from guaranteed, we have proposed to [?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDef] that we begin to develop rubber in Haiti."
 hai.24.a: "Let's hope they are on board!"

 hai.25.t: "Haiti Proposes a Rubber Development Programme"
 hai.25.d: "As the 2nd Weltkrieg has dragged on, it has become clear that rubber will be a vital resource. As access to Africa and Asia are far from guaranteed, Haiti has proposed to us that they begin to develop rubber cultivation. This could not only allow us to have easier access to this precious resource, but also enable us to make a tremendous profit in the process."
 hai.25.a: "This is a great way to get Haiti back on its feet!"
 hai.25.b: "A great idea to benefit us both!"

 hai.26.t: "[?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] Agrees!"
 hai.26.d: "[?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our proposal and is excited to get production started. In fact, they are so excited to get production started, they have agreed to let us take all of the profit and put ownership entirely in the hands of the Haitian government and Haitian corporations."
 hai.26.a: "Fantastic news!"

 hai.27.t: "[?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] Agrees!"
 hai.27.d: "[?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our proposal and is excited to get production started. However, they have stipulated that some [?HAI.faction_leader.GetAdjective] companies take a portion of the ownership of the plantations to ensure that they are properly run. While we are confident we could run them ourselves and the loss in profit is not great, it does allow for a foreign company to take on some of the liability."
 hai.27.a: "As expected."

 hai.28.t: "Haiti Asks For Further Investment in Rubber Cultivation"
 hai.28.d: "While their progress is steady, the Haitian government has asked for further investment. Their processing facilities and cultivation efforts could use some extra help. If we do provide extra resources, it is likely to speed up the return on our investment."
 hai.28.a: "They shall have it."

 hai.29.t: "[?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to our Request for Further Investment"

 hai.29.a: "Great!"

 hai.30.t: "[?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDefCap] Denies our Request for Further Investment"
 hai.30.d: "Unfortunately, [?FROM.faction_leader.GetNameDef] has come to disagree with our conclusion that our young rubber plantations need new investments. According to them, capital is in high demand and in short supply at the moment, and the investments already given should be more than enough to develop perfectly reasonable rubber cultivation. We'll just need to manage with what we have."
 hai.30.a: "Damn..."

 hai.52.t: "Chaos in the Government"
 hai.52.d: "Following the government's collapse to Dominican demands, both the army and National Assembly are up in arms over the failure of [HAI.GetLeader] to hold them accountable. In order to prevent complete collapse, General Franck Lavaud and a clique of army officers have seized control of the government and arrested [HAI.GetLeader]. While democracy is temporarily suspended, General Lavaud promises that elections will be held on the normal term in 1940 to elect a new government."
 hai.52.a: "We cannot afford to look weak."

 hai.53.t: "Radicalisation Increases"
 hai.53.d: "The political response to our backing down over the Monte Cristi affair has not been positive. Both Sténio Vincent's Nationalists and Jacques Roumain's Syndicalists have begun to gain popularity."

 hai_civ.4.t: "President Calixte Declares victory!"
 hai_civ.4.d: "Following the vote from the National Assembly, President Calixte has declared victory. While some may claim our tactics in the election were less than honourable, that is simply the price of allowing President Calixte to continue his work and improve Haiti."

 hai_civ.5.t: "Lescot Gathers Support"
 hai_civ.5.d: "Following the National Assembly's declaration, opposition leader Elie Lescot has begun to gather supporters in the north, some of which are rumoured to be armed. While war is not yet inevitable, it appears Lescot is not taking this lying down."

 hai_civ.19.d: "While Lescot may win the election and support of the National Assembly, we can still hold on to power if we were able to block ratification in the council of state.

 hai_cal.4.a: "A parade is in order!"

 hai_cal.5.t: "Choosing a New Benefactor"
 hai_cal.5.d: "As the United States is embroiled in turmoil and their presence has become more and more chaotic over the past few months, many in our government have suggested that we turn to a new great power to both help us secure our debt and protect us from other powers."
 hai_cal.5.a: "Germany has supported us in our struggle, there is no question!"
 hai_cal.5.a_spd: "With the SPD in power, bowing to German influence is the only option."
 hai_cal.5.b: "We are socialists, we must align with the Internationale!"

 hai_cal.50.t: "Haiti Aligns With Us"
 hai_cal.50.d: "After so much upheaval, the nation of Haiti appears ready to fully enter the international arena on our side. The government in Port-au-Prince has released a rapid-fire series declarations regarding a number of international issues aligned with our own positions. Haitian diplomats have also sent out feelers conspiciously meant to gauge our willingness to enter into a military alliance with the country. It seems the country is likely to formally broach the subject of alliance on some future day, perhaps tomorrow or perhaps years from now, but someday."
 hai_cal.50.a: "Splendid."

 hai_cal.6.t: "Opening of the German Base in Cap-Haitien"
 hai_cal.6.d: "As part of our agreement with the German government in exchange for debt relief and economic investment, we have leased Germany some land in the port city of Cap-Haitien to build a naval base. As Germany attempts to project power in the Caribbean, we may now be the central staging area for further German expansion in the region."
 hai_cal.6.a: "This is the best trade deal in the history of trade deals!"

 hai_cal.60.t: "Haiti Grants Docking Rights"
 hai_cal.60.d: "The 'i's has been dotted and 't's crossed. Following a series of back-and-forth discussions initiated by the Haitians themselves, a new agreement with the small island nation has been signed. Buried amidst the platitudes and legal boilerplate, Haiti has agreed to host our warships."
 hai_cal.60.a: "Diplomacy's bounty."

 hai_cal.7.t: "Paul Magloire Resigns in Protest"
 hai_cal.7.d: "A principal lieutenant of President Calixte Paul Magloire resigned in protest yesterday after Calixte refused to write a new democratic constitution. A general who was perceived as having leftist sympathies, Magloire may soon attempt to travel to France and support the small leftist movements in Haiti from exile."
 hai_cal.7.a: "No matter."

 hai_cal.8.t: "Replacing Calixte as Commander of the Garde d'Haiti"
 hai_cal.8.d: "Now that President Calixte has pledged to hand over some power to a democratic government, many are beginning to call for him to step down from his position as Commander of the Garde d'Haiti."
 hai_cal.8.a: "General Magloire will make an excellent replacement."

 hai_cal.9.t: "Proposing the Haitian World Exposition"
 hai_cal.9.d_1: "As Haiti rebuilds itself from the destruction of the civil war, some Haitians are proposing that we show the world that we are not the backwater that many believe. As a demonstration of the modernity of black culture, the exposition will show the urban beauty of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's desire for international cooperation, as well as Haiti's unique culture and historical monuments.\n\nThe proposal calls for a gateway arch, a new convention centre, and a massive infrastructure improvement to cater to the foreigners that will arrive. All in all, it is an extremely ambitious project, but one that will hopefully yield tremendous economic, diplomatic, and political results for Haiti."
 hai_cal.9.d_2: "As Haiti transitions to its new government, some Haitians are proposing that we show the world that we are not the backwater that many believe. As a demonstration of the modernity of black culture, the exposition will show the urban beauty of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's desire for international cooperation, as well as Haiti's unique culture and historical monuments.\n\nThe proposal calls for a gateway arch, a new convention centre, and a massive infrastructure improvement to cater to the foreigners that will arrive. All in all, it is an extremely ambitious project, but one that will hopefully yield tremendous economic, diplomatic, and political results for Haiti."
 hai_cal.9.a: "A worthy endeavour!"

 hai_cal.10.t: "The Rising Costs of the Haitian World Exposition"
 hai_cal.10.d: "While construction on the arch and convention centre are proceeding on schedule, the cost of labour and material is far above budget. As it is far too late to cancel the project or scale back, we have no choice but to allocate more funds."
 hai_cal.10.a: "It will be worth it in the end...right?"

 hai_cal.11.t: "The Opening of the Haitian World Exposition"
 hai_cal.11.d1: "The Haitian World Exposition opened today with massive crowds greeting the foreign dignitaries and marvels that awaited them. The Arch and convention centre were completed on time, though well over budget, as representatives from the Commune of France, the Papal States, Argentina, Cuba, Guatemala, the Socialist Republic of Italy, Mexico, Venezuela, and the West Indies Federation were all in attendance.\n\nA telegram from French Chairman [FRA.GetLeader] was read aloud along with a parade by a small company of Communard soldiers. Many of the dignitaries gave glowing reviews of both their accommodations and the opening ceremonies."
 hai_cal.11.d2: "The Haitian World Exposition opened today with massive crowds greeting the foreign dignitaries and marvels that awaited them. The Arch and convention centre were completed on time, though well over budget, as representatives from the German Empire, the Papal States, Argentina, Cuba, Guatemala, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, Mexico, Venezuela, and the West Indies Federation were all in attendance.\n\nA telegram from German Kaiser [GER.GetLeader] was read aloud along with a parade by a small company of German soldiers. Many of the dignitaries gave glowing reviews of both their accommodations and the opening ceremonies."
 hai_cal.11.a: "A fantastic start!"

 hai_cal.12.t: "The World Exposition a Success!"
 hai_cal.12.d: "Following the closing ceremonies, President Calixte received word from his foreign office that messages of congratulations have been arriving all day congratulating Haiti on its tremendous accomplishment. It is clear that we have changed the worlds' view of our nation."
 hai_cal.12.a: "A remarkable event!"

 hai_cal.13.t: "The World Exposition a Failure!"
 hai_cal.13.d: "Following the closing ceremonies, President Calixte received word from his foreign office that while a few messages of congratulations had come in, the exposition had mostly fallen flat. After the initial excitement about the expo had worn off, most of the dignitaries found themselves bored and unimpressed. Despite all the money put into the event, there seems to be little to show for it."
 hai_cal.13.a: "Get me the organiser of this charade on the line!"

 hai_cal.14.t: "President Calixte Visits a Cockfighting Ring"
 hai_cal.14.d: "As cockfighting is an extremely common sport in Haiti and throughout the Caribbean, it was only a matter of time before President Calixte made his way to a public match. Claiming that he was a fan of the sport while a child and teenager, the President appeared to enjoy watching the two cocks attack each other. He did not take part in any betting, but did seem to know what to do and when, much to the approval of the locals in attendance."
 hai_cal.14.a: "Always fun to see a couple cocks going at it!"

 hai_les.1.t: "The Question of the Haitian Upper House"
 hai_les.1.d: "In the constitution written in the late 1910s by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave, the document outlined a Senate which would serve as an upper house to the National Assembly. However, the Americans preferred to use the Council of State, a much smaller body and one they could more easily control. They insisted that upon withdrawal, they would reinstate the Senate. However, when former President Borno was elected in 1932, he refused to reinstate the Senate, and instead also preferred to deal with the Council of State.\n\nWe now have the option of continuing to use the Council of State, or resurrect the Senate."
 hai_les.1.a: "Continue the Council of State."
 hai_les.1.b: "Reconvene the Senate."

 hai_les.2.t: "The Question of the Constitution"
 hai_les.2.d: "The Haitian Constitution has been through so many changes and revisions some completely question its authority. However, many also argue that it has withstood numerous tests, including the recent election and strife between President Lescot and former President Calixte. President Lescot must now decide whether to write a new constitution, or continue with the old version."
 hai_les.2.a: "Write a new constitution!"
 hai_les.2.b: "Keep the old constitution"

 hai_les.3.t: "President Lescot Addresses the National Assembly"
 hai_les.3.d: "President Lescot addressed the National Assembly yesterday to update them on the writing of the new Constitution. Many of Lescot's advisors now question whether we should adopt a parliamentary government, much like the ones developed and used in Europe and in Canada. Others advocate for the presidential republic that we have had for decades."
 hai_les.3.a: "Lescot will continue the authorities of the Calixte presidency."
 hai_les.3.b: "Lescot pledges to devolve further authority to the legislature."

 hai_les.4.t: "Should we invite Jean Price-Mars into the Government?"
 hai_les.4.d: "Following the speech by President Lescot, some in our government have proposed inviting Jean Price-Mars, leader of the Progressive Party into the government. A liberal at heart, yet wary of authoritarians, we may be able to convince him that we mean well and gain his powerful voice for our government."
 hai_les.4.a: "He would be a worthy partner"
 hai_les.4.b: "Never!"

 hai_les.5.t: "Victory!"
 hai_les.5.d: "President Lescot has led us to victory in the civil war! The last of Calixte's militias escape to the hills to fight a desperate guerilla campaign, and the traitor Calixte himself has surrendered. President Lescot has decided to merely put him under house arrest, as it is clear his political power has been sapped."
 hai_les.5.a: "A parade is in order!"

 hai_les.6.t: "Lescot Opens the New Legislature"
 hai_les.6.d: "Following the general elections, President Lescot opened the new legislative session with a speech to the National Assembly. He praised the democratic spirit of the Haitian people, and decried the reactionary populism of former President Calixte."
 hai_les.6.a: "An excellent speech!"

 hai_les.7.t: "Choosing a New Benefactor"
 hai_les.7.d: "As the United States is embroiled in turmoil and their presence has become more and more chaotic over the past few months, many in our government have suggested that we turn to a new great power to both help us secure our debt and protect us from other powers."
 hai_les.7.a: "Germany has supported us in our struggle, there is no question!"
 hai_les.7.b: "The Entente nations are our natural allies!"

 hai_les.8.t: "The Question of the Garde"
 hai_les.8.d: "Long an institution of black leadership and abused by the former dictator Calixte, the current leadership of the Garde d'Haiti has been a pain to deal with for far too long. Many also claim that it is an outlet for black social mobility and without it, they would turn to revolution. At least while as a member of the Garde they can be watched and controlled. As a result, many claim that we should keep the Garde as is so as not to upset its leadership structure."
 hai_les.8.a: "The Garde needs a change of leadership."
 hai_les.8.b: "Keep the Garde as is."

 hai_les.9.t: "Vincent's Proposal"
 hai_les.9.d: "Leader of the Nationalist Party Sténio Vincent met with President Lescot today at the Presidential Palace. In the meeting, Vincent strongly denounced the presence of the syndicalist Parti Socialiste Populaire. He named them as un-Haitian, traitors, and spies for the 3rd Internationale. He officially asked President Lescot to not only denounce their activities, but actively ban them from organising and meeting."
 hai_les.9.a: "He is right, they are too dangerous to be left alive!"
 hai_les.9.b: "That would only strengthen them."

 hai_les.10.t: "Whispers of Rebellion"
 hai_les.10.d: "President Lescot is not popular among the largely black populace. However, he remains secure through his brutal network of police chiefs, known as section chiefs which alert the Minister of the Interior Georges Léger to any rumblings of rebellion within army garrisons, through maroons in the wilderness, or any general discontent on large farms. Léger has reported to us that there is some chatter in the army over whether Lescot is truly the man for the coming war against the Dominicans, or whether former President Calixte's lieutenant Paul Magloire would be more suited for the job. While this may sound dangerous, these are low-level officials, and Léger has made it clear that there is no wider discussion of a coup plot."
 hai_les.10.a: "We must be wary."

 hai_les.11.t: "Issues with High Command Reform"
 hai_les.11.d: "With President Lescot's announcement that the high command of the Garde d'Haiti would be completely reformed, many of the lower-level black officers have had issues with this development. While they aren't numerous enough to make a serious challenge, it could still hamper the efficiency of the reforms. We can ask the section chiefs to crack down at individual army units, or we can organise around them, knowing they are discontent."
 hai_les.11.a: "Crack down."
 hai_les.11.b: "Let them be."

 HAI_jacques_roumain: "Jacques Roumain"
 HAI_jacques_roumain_leader_desc: "Jacques Roumain, prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noirist writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like-minded ideologues, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noirist once-allies in the process, the movement he created propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."

 HAI_max_hudincourt: "Max Hudicourt"

 HAI_demosthenes_calixte: "Démosthènes Calixte"
 HAI_demosthenes_calixte_leader_desc: "Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte is a black, United States-trained, Haitian commander, and the President of Haiti since 1933. Calixte and his clique took power in a context of Dominican provocations on the border, that then-President Louis Borno was not able to deal with by allowing military buildup. The departure of the last brigade of American marines allowed Demosthènes Calixte, in his role of Commander of the Garde d'Haiti, to depose the President and take power. However, despite his reformist views, Calixte was forced to oblige American demands, represented in Haiti by High-Commissioner Russell. Calixte has promised to respect the imposed financial constraints and some of the limits in trade and foreign policy. While some of his planned reforms, such as the desired army buildup plan, or the cessation of the much-hated civil conscription were able to go through, most of his other promises were stopped in Parliament. The sweeping constitutional reforms that aimed to elect the President by popular suffrage or to abolish the Council of State were constantly blocked, mostly because of the decisive influence of American money and political pressure.\n\nCalixte thus rules in an authoritarian manner, using decrees and leveraging his powerful position as both President and the Commander of the Garde to stay in place. But now, President Calixte is between a rock and a hard place. He hasn't abandoned his dreams of reforming Haiti into a democratic state free of foreign influence, but he first has to deal with the continued influence of the Americans, the corruption of many officials, and the doubtful fidelity of the political factions that aligned with him. As Calixte loses more and more control, rumours of a palace coup grow noisier. But the authority of the Commander is still strong and no person can say what his future might look like."

 HAI_paul_magloire: "Paul Magloire"

 HAI_jean_price_mars: "Jean Price-Mars"
 HAI_jean_price_mars_leader_desc: "A Haitian doctor, teacher, politician, diplomat, writer, and ethnographer, Jean Price-Mars served as secretary of the Haitian legation in Washington D.C. and as chargé d'affaires in Paris during the Weltkrieg. Taking his surname from his mulatto father and the mulatto writer Hannibal Price, Price heard stories of Haitian folklore from the earliest days of youth - giving him the respect of Haitian traditions. Price-Mars is a champion of Négritude, the belief in a shared "black" consciousness among the African diaspora, and a prominent advocate of voodoo as a complete religion.\n\nHis political ideology stems heavily from the resistance of Haitian peasants towards the American occupation, and he heavily despises the Haitian elite for their seeming ineptitude to provide for the masses. Inspired by the novel "Madame Bovary," Price-Mars coined the term "collective bovarysme" to criticise Haitian elites of mixed white ancestry whom Price-Mars blames for holding unfair economic and economic positions in the country. A critic of Haiti's crippling illiteracy, Price-Mars believes that universal education will lead to an advancement of society. Fully embracing Haiti's history of slavery, Price-Mars believes the Haitian slaves were the true source of Haiti's traditions and history. He admired the slaves' culture and religion as a base of resistance towards the European colonisers - the foundation of a Haitian nation that he seeks to emulate. "

 HAI_elie_lescot: "Elie Lescot"
 HAI_elie_lescot_leader_desc: "President Elie Lescot was originally a pharmacist in Port-de-Paix, in the north of the country. A representative of the interests of the mulatto elite, he entered politics before the Weltkrieg and then took on several posts in the governments of Louis Borno and Demosthènes Calixte. He however never relinquished his independence, and made alliances only out of pure interest. Comforted by his favourable standing among the Americans and the Germans, Lescot was able to take power following the fall of President Calixte. Lescot now plans to bring liberal and democratic reforms to Haiti, and to dismantle the socialist-inspired policies of Calixte. The issue of constitutional reform is one that is still to be answered for the new government. As Lescot's attachment to democracy is debatable, it is unsure how much say the President plans to give to democratic institutions."

 HAI_stenio_vincent: "Sténio Vincent"
 HAI_stenio_vincent_leader_desc: "Sténio Vincent is an old character of Haitian politics. Already active before the Weltkrieg, he was briefly the mayor of Port-au-Prince from 1907 to 1909, and was a member of Dartiguenave's government from 1916 to 1917. A member of the Conservative Party, he first supported the American occupation before radically turning against it in the 1920s. From then on, Vincent was constantly a leading figure of the opposition as the head of the Nationalistes, opposing both Louis Borno and Démosthènes Calixte for their collaboration with the American occupiers. The victory of President Vincent in the 1940 elections came as a surprise to many of the elite, but well-informed observers have known for long his popularity among the popular strata of the capital. His platform, revolving mostly around the end of American occupation and national independence, appeals to the Haitian masses who hope to one day see their country free of foreign influence."

 HAI_john_russell: "John Russell"
 HAI_john_russell_leader_desc: "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, with him still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."

 HAI_franck_lavaud: "Franck Lavaud"
 HAI_franck_lavaud_leader_desc: "Born in the west of Haiti, Franck Lavaud graduated among the top of the Military Academy and rose rapidly through the ranks of the Haitian army. Reaching the post of Chief of Staff of the Garde under Elie Lescot's presidency, he was then appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Haitian army. The commander always stayed far from politics, and is dedicated above everything else to the good of his country. This is what motivated him to move against President Lescot after his failure dealing with the Dominican Republic. The weakness of the president would have led to the weakness of Haiti, which Lavaud can't accept. \n\nLavaud announced already that he doesn't mean to rule for long, as he is not a politician. His main goal is to organise elections and ensure the peaceful continuity of the Haitian state. \n\nIn much the same way and despite his apolitical position, Lavaud grew to despise the factionalism riddling Haitian politics and regularly leading the country to international humiliation. The general, supported by the armed forces and a large part of the population, thus intends to suspend political life until the stability and strength of Haiti can be restored."
