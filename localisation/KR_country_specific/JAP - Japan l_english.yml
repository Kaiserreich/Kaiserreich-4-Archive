 National_Total_Mobilisation_Ordinance_2_desc: "The National Total Mobilisation Ordinance is designed to provide the Government a means to control and mobilise all the resources and manpower available. During wartime, we will have full control over labour supply, production of goods, financial interactions, industrial and labour organisations, as well as prices and the press. It has now been augmented by a compulsory military training. Originally added in 1925 by the Tanaka regime as a way to subdue growing anti-militarist influence, it discontinued with the Constitutional Restoration of 1926. It was time to reverse that decision."
 National_Service_Draft_Ordinance: "The National Service Draft Ordinance"
 National_Service_Draft_Ordinance_desc: "The National Service Draft Ordinance is a supplement to the earlier National Total Mobilisation Ordinance, particularly its Article 4, which had enabled the Government to mobilise the labour force.

 JAP_chuou_start: "A Political Blueprint"
 JAP_chuou_start_desc: "After our assumption of power we are expected to draw out a national political plan reflecting our militarist ideology. In the following weeks, the supreme military council will be meeting to discuss such a document."
 JAP_chuou_fund: "Fund Adjustment Ordinance"
 JAP_chuou_fund_desc: "The Fund Adjustment Ordinance is the first of a series of 'National Defence Ordinances' decrees by the Centralist regime. The state-owned Bank of Japan is now empowered with the regulation of capital investments, the establishment of companies, and the subscription or underwriting of securities. This will allow the Government to control and allocate funds to war industries."
 JAP_chuou_mob: "National Total Mobilisation Ordinance"
 JAP_chuou_mob_desc: "The National Total Mobilisation Ordinance is designed to provide the Government a means to control and mobilise all the resources and manpower available in the Empire. During wartime, we will have full control over the labour supply, production of goods, financial institutions, industrial and labour organisations, as well as prices and the press."
 JAP_chuou_cons: "Military Training Curriculum"
 JAP_chuou_cons_desc: "Military training was first introduced into the compulsory physical education curriculum in 1925 by the Tanaka regime as a way to subdue growing anti-militarist influence and discontent among students. It was discontinued with the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but it is time to reverse that decision."
 JAP_chuou_draft: "National Service Draft Ordinance"
 JAP_chuou_draft_desc: "The National Service Draft Ordinance is new act which enables the Government to mobilise the labour force even in peace time, and additionally, it removes several barriers that delay such mobilisations. This new Ordinance will improve both our peace- and wartime output."
 JAP_chuou_last: "One Corporate State"
 JAP_chuou_last_desc: "The time has finally come to transform Japan into a unified and strong corporate state, where every individual does his part for the good of the Emperor and the Kokutai."

### Focuses - Political - Imperial ###
 JAP_ishinha: "The Shōwa Restoration"
 JAP_ishinha_desc: "After being left out of key governmental and administrative positions in the new Japanese government, the Restoration faction of the army is disgruntled, and is planning another coup. If they are to gain the support of the Emperor, they are likely to succeed."
 JAP_yokuseiha: "Yokuseiha Faction"
 JAP_yokuseiha_desc: "The Yokuseiha faction is comprised of ex-parliament members with restorationist tendencies. They resist the dictatorial plans set by Konoe for the Taisei Yokusankai and prefer a decentralised approach to restoration."
 JAP_yokuseiha_POL: "Separation of Powers"
 JAP_yokuseiha_POL_desc: "While supporting imperial restoration, the Yokuseiha members also see a problem with absolute power. Partly to prevent corruption, and partly to secure their power, they arrange a decentralised system for the Taisei Yokusankai."
 JAP_yokuseiha_ECO: "A Free Market"
 JAP_yokuseiha_ECO_desc: "Keeping in line with their decentralised approach, the Yokuseiha propose an economic plan consisting of minimal state intervention in the economy. While this would allow groups like the Zaibatsu to gain more power, this policy will also endear the regime to them."
 JAP_yokuseiha_AGR: "Colonial Investments"
 JAP_yokuseiha_AGR_desc: "In response to the agricultural crisis Japan faces, the Yokuseiha faction proposes a programme of settlement incentives in Japanese mainland colonies in China and elsewhere. By increasing agricultural input from abroad, the homeland economy could shift its focus to other sectors and supply logistics would be improved."
 JAP_kodoha: "Kōdōha Faction"
 JAP_kodoha_desc: "The Kōdōha faction is made up of restorationist army generals and officers who wish to bring Japan back to its folkish roots and create a strong imperial power at the head of the state."
 JAP_kodoha_POL: "Imperial Power"
 JAP_kodoha_POL_desc: "The Kōdōha faction resists Konoe's efforts in creating a separate dictatorial power from the imperial court and instead wish to transfer ultimate power to the emperor in a form of absolutism where the Taisei Yokusankai is a subject of the emperor."
 JAP_kodoha_ECO: "Nationalisation"
 JAP_kodoha_ECO_desc: "The Kōdōha faction's economic plan involves nationalisation of the economy for a dedicated empire-oriented production. By establishing an institution for government control such nationalisation can begin."
 JAP_kodoha_AGR: "Intensify Land Use"
 JAP_kodoha_AGR_desc: "The revolutionary part of the Kōdōha faction believe that we can make more out of the land we have. By adjusting agriculture and production techniques, and throwing away the traditional land designations, we will improve the density of our industry."
 JAP_kakushinha: "Kakushinha Faction"
 JAP_kakushinha_desc: "The Kakushinha, or reform faction, is led by Prince Konoe and is mainly comprised of intellectuals and politicians. They aim for a reconstruction of the Japanese political system with an absolute Taisei Yokusankai at the core of Japanese society."
 JAP_kakushinha_POL: "A New System"
 JAP_kakushinha_POL_desc: "The political plan of the Kakushinha faction was to create a single centralised political body which will combine the executive, legislative and administrative powers of the Japanese empire. Despite heavy resistance, the reformists' domination of the first convention allowed them to pull through with the reforms."
 JAP_kakushinha_ECO: "Bureaucratic Regulation"
 JAP_kakushinha_ECO_desc: "The Kakushinha faction's economic policy involves creating a bureaucratic system to regulate the economy as part of the Taisei Yokusankai."
 JAP_kakushinha_AGR: "Bureaucratic Agrarianism"
 JAP_kakushinha_AGR_desc: "The Kakushinha faction's solution to Japan's crumbling agricultural system is to create another bureaucratic institution to regulate land ownership in the empire."

### Focuses - Economic - Base ###
 JAP_tech_team: "National R&D Institutes"
 JAP_tech_team_desc: "By funding National Research and Development Institutes, we can make it easier for independent research teams to work together, improving our research output, and allowing us to better direct national research priorities."
 JAP_small_rail: "Narrow-gauge Railways"
 JAP_small_rail_desc: "Our narrow-gauge railways had their advantages during construction, but now they hold back our burgeoning industry. The future waits for no-one, least of all Japan."
 JAP_rapid_industrialisation: "Rapid Arms Expansion"
 JAP_rapid_industrialisation_desc: "While our economy is growing, and we avoided much of the fallout of Black Monday, our arms productions still isn't what it has the potential to be. By building factories designed specifically for such purposes, we will be able to greatly expand our arms production."
 JAP_need_oil: "Prioritise Military Oil"
 JAP_need_oil_desc: "With the country at war, oil is more vital than ever. While it is useful for many civilian purposes, it is vital for our armed forces. As such, we must prioritise oil for military uses first and foremost."
 JAP_land_reform_focus: "Land Reform"
 JAP_land_reform_focus_desc: "Land use is highly inefficient in Japan. Nearly all the factions agree that something must be done, though what exactly prompts much disagreement. Nevertheless, if we are to realise our full economic might, we must solve this issue."

### Focuses - Economic - Zaibatsu ###
 JAP_ZAI_ECO: "Support the Zaibatsu"
 JAP_ZAI_ECO_desc: "Over the past several decades the Zaibatsu have increased their political and economic power to a staggering degree. It would be in our best interest to cooperate with them."
 JAP_ZAI_FAC: "Zaibatsu Factory Construction"
 JAP_ZAI_FAC_desc: "Some Zaibatsu have requested for the state to aid them in building factories throughout the home islands. This would create many jobs and help resolve the economic crisis."
 JAP_ZAI_TRAIN: "Zaibatsu Central Railroad"
 JAP_ZAI_TRAIN_desc: "The Central Railroad Plan, a series of new and modernised train lines in the home islands, has been at the forefront of our continued push towards an efficient and productive society. However it has been delayed for years now, lacking both funding and expertise. Luckily however, the Zaibatsu are able to provide both and so, with their backing, the project can finally be completed."
 JAP_ZAI_RAW: "Zaibatsu Resource Projects"
 JAP_ZAI_RAW_desc: "Various Zaibatsu have approached us with raw resource prospects requesting us to fund them. Our funding should give access to much needed rare resources."
 JAP_ZAI_SCI: "Zaibatsu Technological Research"
 JAP_ZAI_SCI_desc: "State funds would go a long way to ensuring that skilled Zaibatsu scientists have everything they need to push Japan forward into the future and should give the government greater control over research priorities."

### Focuses - Economic - Nationalisation ###
 JAP_NAT_ECO: "Nationalisation Policy"
 JAP_NAT_ECO_desc: "For too long, the Zaibatsu and foreign imperialists have deceived and exploited our people for their personal profit. Let us take control of the economy and nationalise the industry for the good of all of Japan!"
 JAP_NAT_ZAI: "Nationalise The Zaibatsu"
 JAP_NAT_ZAI_desc: "Since the Meiji Restoration and subsequent westernisation the Zaibatsu have been the heart of economic and industrial activity within Japan. They hold great influence over domestic and foreign policy. The Imperial Army has always opposed the Zaibatsu's influence and worked toward their liquidation. Now that they effectively control the country, the Army can nationalise all major Zaibatsu and destroy their influence."
 JAP_NAT_AIR: "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
 JAP_NAT_AIR_desc: "The aircraft industry is a vital part of national defence and is thus too important to be left in private hands. All military aircraft manufacturers must be nationalised and reformed into arsenals or merged into military controlled factories."
 JAP_NAT_IND: "Nationalise Heavy Industry"
 JAP_NAT_IND_desc: "After the breakup and nationalisation of the Zaibatsu, we control most of the heavy industry in the country - but not all. Some companies are below Zaibatsu level in prominence but still major firms. To achieve total state control, it will be necessary to nationalise them."

### Focuses - Economic - Bureaucratic ###
 JAP_BUR_ECO_1: "Bureaucratic Economy"
 JAP_BUR_ECO_1_desc: "The government decided to reform the economy to be regulated by a bureaucratic structure. It is designed to limit the Zaibatsu's power and increase benefits for the state."
 JAP_BUR_CAR_1: "Integration of Foreign Motor Companies"
 JAP_BUR_CAR_1_desc: "The Japanese auto market has always been dominated by American car makers, causing a deep trade deficit. When the Second American Civil War broke out many American companies and knock-down plants in Japan lost contact with their parent companies, giving MITI bureaucrats a prime opportunity to assimilate those factories. Even when the Second American Civil War ends, it will be decades before they will be able to compete again."
 JAP_BUR_CAR_2: "Regulating the Automotive Industry"
 JAP_BUR_CAR_2_desc: "Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Japanese domestic automotive production was too small to compete globally. To remedy this and enable domestic firms to compete with much bigger Western counterparts, we can force a merger of our many small automotive firms into a few big businesses."
 JAP_BUR_RESOURCES: "Reorganise Resource Extraction"
 JAP_BUR_RESOURCES_desc: "With tensions rising all over the world, it is vital for our resource extraction to happen effectively and quickly. To achieve this, firms involved in resource extraction will be subjected to greater bureaucratic supervision and forced to undergo a structural reorganisation under the government's guidance."
 JAP_BUR_TRAIN: "The Shinkansen Proposal"
 JAP_BUR_TRAIN_desc: "It is time to enact the Shinkansen proposal: create a connect set of high speed railways then combine them with new steam and electric locomotives. These lines would be able to carry passengers and freight at speeds never seen before."

### Focuses - Economic - Colonisation ###
 JAP_INT_KOREA: "Chōsen Autonomy"
 JAP_INT_KOREA_desc: "While unpalatable for conservative elements in Japanese society, negotiations with Korean leaders have proven fruitful and allowed us to return towards a policy of greater cultural autonomy, as practiced under Hara Takashi. With such policies in place, many believe that Koreans will be satisfied and accept their role as imperial subjects - whether they will ultimately be proven right is another matter."
 JAP_COL_START: "Colonial Incentives"
 JAP_COL_START_desc: "In order to save our dying agrarian sector and further expand our economy we sorely need to invest in colonial projects. The Empire is Japan's future."
 JAP_COL_KOREA: "Chōsen Integration"
 JAP_COL_KOREA_desc: "The closest colony to the Home Islands, Chōsen has long been the aim of economic and cultural assimilation efforts. These are not complete however, and as imperial subjects, Koreans too must perform their obligations to the empire. With the expansion of additional funding, Japanese settlement, and conscription to the Korean populace, it will be possible to fully integrate Chōsen."
 JAP_COL_TAIWAN: "Taiwan Integration"
 JAP_COL_TAIWAN_desc: "Taiwan, the richest and most prosperous colony in the Empire, promises limitless bounty to those that settle there. Long our model colony, it is time to put the final funding in to fully integrate Taiwan into our Empire."
 JAP_COL_PORT: "Kwantung Integration"
 JAP_COL_PORT_desc: "Although the Kwantung Leased Territory was only officially granted to Japan for a period of 99 years, the city of Dairen and its surroundings make an excellent destination for Japanese settlers. The Government has every reason to provide further incentives, increasing emigration."
 JAP_colonise_hawaii: "Hawaiian Integration"
 JAP_colonise_hawaii_desc: "Japanese-Hawaiians make up a large portion of the population of that island chain, and as a result Japanese is already a common language in schools and homes. It should be a relatively smooth transition to ensure that the upper classes are Japanese too and thereby turn the place into proper prefectures."

### Focuses - Military - Base ###
 JAP_MIL_start: "Jakuniku Kyōshoku"
 JAP_MIL_start_desc: "Jakuniku Kyōshoku or 'Survival of the Fittest' is a fundamental understanding in our military philosophy; the Western imperialists have greatly expanded their air forces and navies and if we do not do the same we will surely fall victim to their forces."
 JAP_MIL_army_start: "Army Direction"
 JAP_MIL_army_start_desc: "After years of bickering, it is time to make a choice as to the Imperial Army's direction. Strategic planners from Imperial General Headquarters present four promising options.\n\n§YChoosing which army theorem we want to implement will greatly affect the content of our focus tree.§!"
 JAP_MIL_naval_start: "Results of Second Maru Keikaku"

### Focuses - Military - Army Selection ###
 JAP_MIL_AIR: "Air-Land Supremacy"
 JAP_MIL_AIR_desc: "Our army needs to be like a tsunami: it must crush our enemies with an unstoppable advance, and we will obtain this result by achieving cooperation between the army and the air force. If this reform will prove itself successful, we will be able to rain hell on our enemies."
 JAP_MIL_WILL: "Supremacy of Will"
 JAP_MIL_WILL_desc: "The Japanese people must seek to embody \"Yamato-Damashii\", the \"Spirit of Old Japan\", as wars are won by tenacity and the willingness of the Japanese soldier to die for the Emperor and Kokutai. In 1905 the Imperial Army lost nearly one hundred thousand soldiers to the Russians in Manchuria, and yet claimed victory nonetheless. Once again his Imperial Majesty calls upon Japan's noble sons to fight!"
 JAP_MIL_MASS: "Numerical Supremacy"
 JAP_MIL_MASS_desc: "The Weltkrieg clearly showed us one thing: numbers win wars. Although our industrial capacity can’t match that of Germany, we can create cheaper equipment in order to match their numbers. Its quality might not be excellent, but in the end, having cheap equipment is better than having no equipment at all."
 JAP_MIL_TECH: "Supremacy of Mind"
 JAP_MIL_TECH_desc: "Traditionally our military has focused on winning wars through numbers or sheer determination; in reality Japan's greatest victories have come through being more advanced than her opponents. Nowadays however we cannot rely on buying western equipment first, so if we wish to retain our advantage over our enemies we mush embrace technological supremacy to win the wars of tomorrow."

 JAP_army_mob_title_air: "Aerial Exterminating Actions"
 JAP_army_mob_description_air: "The ‘Aerial Exterminating Action’, in which enemy aircraft are located and destroyed before they can even strike, will be formalised as a part of IJAAS doctrine. With the opposition burning in their own airfields, or ruined shortly after take off, our own supporting aircraft will have free reign of the air."

 JAP_army_mob_title_will: "Aggressive Attack Formations"
 JAP_army_mob_description_will: "To ensure victory we must have our soldiers press forward, past our enemies defences into the heart of their operations. Achieving such a feat will rout the enemy in quick order and bring victory! Tennō Heika Banzai!"

 JAP_army_mob_title_mass: "Mobility Enhancements"
 JAP_army_mob_description_mass: "What we need now is speed, something faster than normal leg infantry. The high command is pushing for us to invest in trucks transporting troops. However, our industrial capacity is still limited, so in some cases we will need to improvise and adopt other methods. One method could be using bicycles, that will temporarily replace trucks until we will be able to fully mechanise our army."

 JAP_army_mob_title_tech: "Advanced Motorised Designs"
 JAP_army_mob_description_tech: "Speed is crucial to winning modern battles, whether that comes in the form of redeployments or exploiting breakthroughs. We must foster the expansion of motorised IJA units in order to bring such advances to Japan."

 JAP_army_mob_title_default: "Mobility Advances"
 JAP_army_mob_description_default: "The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements."

 JAP_army_tank_title_air: "Rapid Armour Deployment"
 JAP_army_tank_description_air: "Our infantrymen, despite being the most skilled in the world, are still without protection against machine guns. In order to solve that, we shall allocate more funds for the research and development of a new weapon: armoured vehicles called tanks. These steel monsters are capable of having high defensive and offensive capabilities, and they will help our infantry forces rule the Asian ground."

 JAP_army_tank_title_will: "Armoured Spearhead"
 JAP_army_tank_description_will: "By including armour and motorised infantry in our breakthrough forces we gain the ability to deal devastating damage in our assaults. We have become an unstoppable force and there is no immovable object."

 JAP_army_tank_title_mass: "Mass Armour Assault"
 JAP_army_tank_description_mass: "Tanks are massive beasts made out of steel that can crush everything they will face, but they have a problem, a massive one: they are incredibly expensive to produce. If we want to be able to use them, we will need to cut corners wherever possible, otherwise we won’t be able to produce enough of them to win any war. This might affect their reliability, but we need numbers."

 JAP_army_tank_title_tech: "Breakthrough Tank Designs"
 JAP_army_tank_description_tech: "While some would argue that given our likely enemies and the terrain of Asia and the Pacific, tanks are a costly white elephant, the reality is that these new vehicles have the potential to transform warfare, and we must ride the crest of this wave."

 JAP_army_tank_title_default: "Tank Advances"
 JAP_army_tank_description_default: "Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plough through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths."

 JAP_army_sup_title_air: "Forward Air Control"
 JAP_army_sup_description_air: "Radio will play an important role in our reform plan: by achieving instant communication, our land forces will be able to tell the air force where to focus their bombing efforts. In this way, our enemies won’t stand a chance to the combined might of the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Army Air Service. "

 JAP_army_sup_title_will: "Endurance"
 JAP_army_sup_description_will: "Imperial soldiers must be prepared to fight everywhere to secure the peace and prosperity of the Japanese Empire; we shall require that every soldier must be prepared to fight and win in every condition they may find themselves in."

 JAP_army_sup_title_mass: "Expanded Support Services"
 JAP_army_sup_description_mass: "Numbers are the key to victory, and that means also preserving them. We will need the help of the Nippon Sekijūjisha, the Japanese Red Cross Society, which has helped the Imperial Japanese Army both in the Russo-Japanese war and in the Weltkrieg in assisting wounded soldiers. Due to how huge the number of soldiers in the field is, they require more equipment than we currently have, even if that means using second-hand materials to provide them with what they need."

 JAP_army_sup_title_tech: "IJA Engineer Corps"
 JAP_army_sup_description_tech: "Given the varied terrain we will be fighting in, combined with the often lacking infrastructure in Asia, the creation of a specialised engineer corps would be a great boon to our armed forces. We will put funds towards just such a unit."

 JAP_army_sup_title_default: "Support Equipment Advances"
 JAP_army_sup_description_default: "Despite the increasing possibilities of aerial and naval warfare, ground combat is still key in tomorrow's wars. With preparation, we can avoid reliving the hell of the trenches."

 JAP_army_specop_title_air: "Teishin Shūdan"
 JAP_army_specop_description_air: "Like a Katana shattering a diamond in thousands of pieces, our special forces, the elite of the Japanese Infantry, can destroy every enemy it will face. They’ll be modernised alongside the rest of the army by receiving improved weaponry and improved training, and they will be able to strike not only from the land and from the sea, but also from the sky."

 JAP_army_specop_title_will: "High Altitude Training"
 JAP_army_specop_description_will: "Elite soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army will train high in the mountains across our mighty Empire, giving them the ability to fight better across hostile and perilous terrain and thus ensuring their victory wherever we may fight."

 JAP_army_specop_title_mass: "Specialised Infantry Forces"
 JAP_army_specop_description_mass: "The Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai, or Rikusentai for short, are infantry units of the Imperial Japanese Navy specialised in naval landings. Considering we will have to fight in China, which has a massive coastline, in the Insulindian archipelago and in the Pacific islands, we will need to expand their recruitment base and improve their training facilities if we want to maintain the naval supremacy we currently have in East Asia."

 JAP_army_specop_title_tech: "Prioritise Reliability"
 JAP_army_specop_description_tech: "While history often remembers the armies which win the most sudden or surprising victories, it is the army with the ability to win continually which ultimately triumphs. The IJA must focus on reliability in order to be capable of triumphing over any foe."

 JAP_army_specop_title_default: "Special Units Advances"
 JAP_army_specop_description_default: "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_air: "Land Battle"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_air: "If we want to continue to rule the Asian ground, we need to modernise our way of thinking: we will mostly fight in places with low infrastructure, so we need to found a way where our army will be able to defend itself better while also fighting in a place with low supplies."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_will: "Limitless Greatness"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_will: "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors, tenacity of will and stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack by enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying even numerically and technologically superior forces."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_mass: "Grand Assaults"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_mass: "In East Asia, there are two things nobody has besides us: automatic weapons and good infrastructure. Thus, we have decided that grand assaults will be enough to win land battles, but we will need to pay attention to not have our army being in situations when they will be short on supplies, otherwise we might find ourselves in difficult situations."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_tech: "Theoretical Land Doctrine"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_tech: "While strategy has traditionally focused on the study of past conflicts, we should always remember that these examples were so important because they were novel. We must remind our commanders that they are not trying to redo the past, but tread new paths."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_default: "Land Doctrine Advances"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_default: "The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_air: "Air Battle"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_air: "Unlike land warfare, air warfare is almost entirely a novelty – and that means we need to build our air doctrines from zero, and solve the problem about how we can fly with night or rain. If we achieve this, however, we will make sure our air force are never going to give our army up, and never going to let it down."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_will: "Samurai of the Skies"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_will: "Japanese fighter pilot training is one of the most difficult in the world, but it is that way for a very good reason. Our planes are fast, our ground crews skilled, and our commanders smart, but nothing is more important than the courage and talent of the individual pilots."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_mass: "Subordination to the Infantry"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_mass: "Wars are won on the ground, not in the air, and as such we must totally subordinate the IJAAS to our ground units. Infantry officers in the field will take priority in directing air support, and will no longer be shackled to the slow-moving whims of higher command."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_tech: "Air Extension Initiative"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_tech: "The lands we must patrol are vast, likely far from any airfields. Rather than looking at any specific air tactics, we must instead focus on ensuring that our planes can actually reach anywhere they are needed, to assist our operations whenever necessary."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_default: "Air Doctrine Advances"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_default: "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the air force is capable of dealing damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."

 JAP_army_inf_title_air: "Camouflaged Uniforms"
 JAP_army_inf_description_air: "On the western front of the Weltkrieg, the French taught everyone an important lesson: you need camouflage uniforms, otherwise the enemy is going to spot you easily. By allocating more funds to research and development of new types of infantry guns and uniforms, enemy bombers will have more difficulty spotting our land forces."

 JAP_army_inf_title_will: "Gaman"
 JAP_army_inf_description_will: "Our forces often display \"Gaman\" or \"fortitude and endurance in the face of adversity\" in the face of overwhelming odds. Where defeat seems like the only option, they refuse to surrender or back down and will snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The Imperial Japanese Army is a force of will, of the people, of the state, and of the Emperor."

 JAP_army_inf_title_mass: "Rifle Production Standards"
 JAP_army_inf_description_mass: "The islands of Japan suffers significantly from a lack of important war materials causing a severe shortage of almost every type of equipment for our men. It has been proposed by some that perhaps using subpar materials in unimportant aspects of weapon design will allow our manufacturing industry to meet our demand."

 JAP_army_inf_title_tech: "State-of-the-Art Equipment"
 JAP_army_inf_description_tech: "When Japan modernised herself, she quickly learned that having better equipment than her enemies was a major ace in combat. Now that we are a modern nation ourselves, we must preserve our weaponry advantage at all costs to retain this edge in combat."

 JAP_army_inf_title_default: "Infantry Equipment Advances"
 JAP_army_inf_description_default: "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on a post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."

 JAP_army_big_title_air: "Multicoloured Shell Tracers"
 JAP_army_big_description_air: "Coloured shell tracers will be a key point in reforming our army: by differentiating different types of shells with different colours, our air force will be able to execute support manoeuvres, be it ground support or air superiority, which will help turn our army into an unstoppable force that can’t be matched by anything on Earth."

 JAP_army_big_title_will: "Heavy Blow"
 JAP_army_big_description_will: "While there is great glory to be had in dying for the Emperor, there is an even greater glory in winning for the Emperor. With overwhelming firepower, enemy positions can be turned to dust."

 JAP_army_big_title_mass: "Artillery Production Standards"
 JAP_army_big_description_mass: "Just like our rifles, our artillery needs to be produced en masse, and the Osaka Army Arsenal, the oldest arsenal in Japan, approached us with a new design that will help us to streamline its production. This design, however, has some flaws with the reloading system, but as long as we can mass produce it, it will be fine."

 JAP_army_big_title_tech: "Unparalleled Artillery"
 JAP_army_big_description_tech: "Artillery is one of the great deciders of combat, with the side able to hit their targets with the greatest range and accuracy being almost unstoppable. We will use this advantage to keep our enemies hiding in their holes, as our gunners tune their range."

 JAP_army_big_title_default: "Artillery Advances"
 JAP_army_big_description_default: "Artillery is deeply important to our army. It enables us to bombard the enemy from afar, whilst keeping our soldiers supported in battle."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_air: "Chokkyō Units"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_air: "Currently, our air force is small and inexperienced, and we need to do something about this, considering the key role it has in our reform plan. We need to have more and better fighters, and better training facilities for our pilots, so our army will annihilate every enemy it will face."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_will: "Air Superiority Fighters"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_will: "Controlling the air means controlling the world! We must keep our fighters up to date to maintain our air superiority."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_mass: "Fighter Production Act"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_mass: "Currently, more than one designer produces our fighters causing a wide variety of models of the same type of plane. By issuing an act that forces all the manufacturers to standardise their planes based on an uniform design, we will make sure the production will be streamlined, and our fighters will be ready to be mass produced. It’s said that this design is unreliable, but those voices will quickly go away after some testing."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_tech: "Progressive Aircraft Designs"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_tech: "As the field of aerial combat evolves, it is obvious to many that fighters designed for different combat notions are not fit for the purpose. We will therefore begin creating aircraft which have adapted and evolved for changing tactics."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_default: "Fighter Advances"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_default: "The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_air: "Fire Bombing Doctrine"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_air: "Our bombers will need to destroy the enemy’s supply lines, and the high command came up with an interesting idea: considering that most cities and infrastructures in Asia are made out of wood, using fire bombs for our bombers would be extremely effective. Some may consider it inhuman or excessive, but we will do what needs to be done to destroy both the western imperialists and the syndicalists."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_will: "Strike Terror"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_will: "Japanese air power should be feared, and few are as feared as our bomber pilots. With the most modern planes at our disposal, no nation or army can withstand us."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_mass: "Bomber Production Act"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_mass: "Just like our fighters, our bombers vary wildly in their designs. We will issue an act similar to what we did to our fighter aircraft forcing a standardisation of designs. There may also be reliability issues, but surely our enemies won’t notice, especially when they see thousands of bombers over their heads ready to drop bombs."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_tech: "Next Generation Bomber Aircraft"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_tech: "Current bomber aircraft are outdated and slow, but proponents of aerial bombardment argue that designing new bombers could finally allow them to achieve their dream of beating an enemy without ever sending ground forces against them."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_default: "Bomber Advances"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_default: "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Weltkrieg fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."

### Focuses - Military - Naval ###
 JAP_MIL_ISLAND_DEFENSE: "Protecting the Home Islands"
 JAP_MIL_ISLAND_DEFENSE_desc: "Right now, vast stretches of water controlled by our mighty navy are protecting our Home Islands. In these endless plains, each island represents a strategic target and we should make fortresses from each of them. Protecting our Pacific holdings will allow our unbeatable navy to operate on long distances."
 JAP_MIL_MARINES: "Pacific Amphibious Operations"
 JAP_MIL_MARINES_desc: "The Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai, our marines, are some of the most well-trained, hardened and loyal troops in the world. German, Dutch, Chinese and anyone else who dares to stand in their way will without a doubt end up rotting on their beaches. But in the upcoming war, loyalty and training will be pointless without proper equipment."
 JAP_MIL_ISLAND_BASES: "Unsinkable Carriers"
 JAP_MIL_ISLAND_BASES_desc: "While carriers are mighty machines and weapons, they take long to build and just a moment to sink. The same can't be said about island airfields, which can operate even bigger planes than our carriers."

### Focuses - Military - Naval - Decisive Battle ###
 JAP_MIL_NAV_DECISIVE: "Start Third Maru Keikaku"
 JAP_MIL_NAV_DECISIVE_desc: "As we can't fight a prolonged war with the enemy, our only option is to continue with current naval build-up and focus on an ultimate victory in a decisive battle."
 JAP_MIL_SUPER_SHIPS: "Technological Supremacy"
 JAP_MIL_SUPER_SHIPS_desc: "Our dockyards and our industry have limited capacity compared to our rivals in Europe and North America, but our designers and engineers are superior in every way to them. One ship of ours will be worth a dozen of their ships."
 JAP_MIL_LONG_DONG: "Long Lance Torpedo"
 JAP_MIL_LONG_DONG_desc: "Torpedoes, while small, are extremely deadly weapons able to sink even the mightiest battleship, as the pathetic Russian navy learnt during the Battle of Tsushima. However, ships are much larger than 30 years ago, and so we should work to enlarge our torpedoes."
 JAP_MIL_CV_PLANES: "Carrier Aviation Breakthroughs"
 JAP_MIL_CV_PLANES_desc: "Without planes our carriers are just metal boxes which can float. We must ensure that our carriers will always be equipped with only the best planes and pilots."
 JAP_MIL_BIG_SHIPS: "Cruiser Mastery"
 JAP_MIL_BIG_SHIPS_desc: "Each cruiser can take on many roles in a naval engagement. Finding enemy fleets but also preventing enemy scouts from find ours. Protect our supply routes same as harassing enemy ones. We can also modify them to very specific roles for hunting submarines, protecting our ships from enemy planes or even carrying large torpedo weaponry; the possibilities are nearly endless."
 JAP_MIL_VERY_BIG_SHIPS: "Leviathans of the Pacific"
 JAP_MIL_VERY_BIG_SHIPS_desc: "What sailors of old have often called sea monsters will soon pale before the leviathans which we are going build. May we name the first one after our great God and Emperor: the Okami!"

### Focuses - Military - Naval - Doctrinal Change ###
 JAP_MIL_NAV_NOT_SO_DECISIVE: "Restart Doctrinal Debate"
 JAP_MIL_NAV_NOT_SO_DECISIVE_desc: "Seen already two decades ago, it is foolish to think that the next war will be won by decisive battle. Rather the next war will be won by resources, industry and attrition. We must change our thinking or it will kill us."
 JAP_MIL_NAV_HIT_N_RUN: "Hit and Run"
 JAP_MIL_NAV_HIT_N_RUN_desc: "Maybe we won't be able to outproduce our enemy but that doesn't we can't win. The Pacific and South East Asia are hostile places where logistics are the difference between victory or defeat. By hitting enemy convoys we can weather him slowly down, where even the mightiest industry won't be able compensate for the losses."
 JAP_MIL_NAV_OPEN_SEA: "Open Seas"
 JAP_MIL_NAV_OPEN_SEA_desc: "Our industry is exponentially growing to match our western rivals, but like all growing things it needs food to do so. In this case that means natural resources, which are scarce on the Home Islands. If we want to keep our industry running our priority should be protect shipping routes from enemy raiders."
 JAP_MIL_MOAR_SHIPS: "Mass Production"
 JAP_MIL_MOAR_SHIPS_desc: "Our current fleet is not designed up to our new doctrinal changes. It just doesn't have sufficient numbers of smaller vessels required for the new tasks. There is only one option to solve this situation; a massive build-up of unified, simplified and especially modular designs."
 JAP_MIL_MOAR_PLANES: "Modular Aircraft"
 JAP_MIL_MOAR_PLANES_desc: "The modular design applied to our ships was a great success, and our engineers are ready to also apply it on our aircraft."
 JAP_MIL_SAMSUNG_DOCKYARDS: "Korean Dockyards"
 JAP_MIL_SAMSUNG_DOCKYARDS_desc: "Dockyards on the Home Islands are already running at maximum capacity using all skilled workforce available. Although the Korean dockyards are hardly as good as our Japanese dockyards, we will nevertheless need their hands to protect our homeland."
 JAP_MIL_DEFINITELY_NOT_LIBERTY: "'Prosperity' Ships"
 JAP_MIL_DEFINITELY_NOT_LIBERTY_desc: "We are already building our ships by using certain serial build modules, but now our demand for cargo ships is higher than even before. Our bright engineers propose to build whole ships from modules which will be manufactured on a factory line."
 JAP_MIL_MANTESU_SHIP: "Co-prosperity Naval Development Plan"
 JAP_MIL_MANTESU_SHIP_desc: "The dockyard capacity of most of our allies is just laughable. While their workers will never match up to the Japanese spirit, we must support their naval capacity build-up as each and every ship will be needed in the next war."
 JAP_MIL_NAVAL_RESEARCH: "Naval Engineering Assistance"
 JAP_MIL_NAVAL_RESEARCH_desc: "The target of the Naval Engineering Assistance program is simple; allow our allies build something more than mere cargo ships."
 JAP_MIL_UNIFIED_PRODUCTION: "Unified Production"
 JAP_MIL_UNIFIED_PRODUCTION_desc: "Now that our allies' naval production is up and running, we can use their new capacity to build a fleet big enough to protect the entire sphere."

### Focuses - Military - Air ###

 JAP_MIL_FIGHTER_FOCUS: "Fighter Focus"
 JAP_MIL_FIGHTER_FOCUS_desc: "Controlling the air means controlling the world! We must keep our fighters up to date to maintain our air superiority."
 JAP_MIL_BOMBER_FOCUS: "Bomber Focus"
 JAP_MIL_BOMBER_FOCUS_desc: "Japanese air power should be feared, and few are as feared as our bomber pilots. With the most modern planes at our disposal, no nation or army can withstand us."
 JAP_MIL_NAVBOM_FOCUS: "Naval Bombers"
 JAP_MIL_NAVBOM_FOCUS_desc: "Some of the staff of the IJNAS claim that the upcoming battles of the sea will not be won on the waves, but in the clouds. We should listen to them, as ships are much more expensive than planes after all."
 JAP_MIL_air_zero: "Lightweight Fighter Designs"
 JAP_MIL_air_zero_desc: "Japanese fighter pilots know that agility is key to victory is the skies, and by making sure that is a design focus, we will improve our planes."
 JAP_MIL_air_par: "Paratroopers"
 JAP_MIL_air_par_desc: "Rikusentai are like so many cherry blossoms floating on air. The risks paratroops face are severe, as they drift to the ground in full view of the enemy, but thorough training and an unwavering spirit will make these soldiers unstoppable."
 JAP_MIL_air_idea: "Samurai of the Skies"
 JAP_MIL_air_idea_desc: "Japanese fighter pilot training is some of the most difficult in the world, but it is that way for a very good reason. Our planes are fast, our ground crews skilled, and our commanders smart, but nothing is more important than the courage and talent of the individual pilots."
 JAP_MIL_KAMIKAZE: "The Divine Wind"
 JAP_MIL_KAMIKAZE_desc: "As the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors states, 'Duty is as heavy as a mountain, death is lighter than a feather'. The purity of youth will usher in the Divine Wind."

### Focuses - Nanshin-ron ###
 JAP_go_south: "Nanshin-ron"
 JAP_go_south_desc: "For all its strengths, Japan has a key strategic disadvantage in its dependency on foreign oil. In the pursuit of self-reliance and security against ever-encroaching Western imperialism, surely it would be both wise and just to acquire these resources for ourselves, and in so-doing widen our sphere of security?"
 JAP_pacific_islands: "Extend The Pacific Security Zone"
 JAP_pacific_islands_desc: "With America in chaos, we can ill afford to ignore the opportunity presented. Proposals for creating a Pacific Security Zone that would extend our reach and protection to their far-flung Pacific possessions have come forward and are under serious consideration."
 JAP_hawaii: "Pressure Hawaii"
 JAP_hawaii_desc: "Now that the American position in the pacific is weakened, we can make our move to annex the unrecognised nation of "Hawaii" and secure an impenetrable cordon around our empire in the Pacific Ocean."
 JAP_demand_indonesia: "Target: East Indies"
 JAP_demand_indonesia_desc: "For centuries the islands of the East Indies have toiled for their Dutch colonial rulers, its vast resources lining European pockets. This practice must end. We shall liberate these assets for the Co-Prosperity Sphere, where they rightfully belong!"
 JAP_philippines: "Bring the Philippines into the Fold!"
 JAP_philippines_desc: "Now that the Americans are gone, we can send our gunboats to secure the archipelago for the Co-Prosperity Sphere and bring stability to the islands. Of course, the Filipinos might not see it that way."
 JAP_claim_colonies: "Create the South Seas Territory"
 JAP_claim_colonies_desc: "Every single island in the Pacific not held by us could act as a staging point to invade our Home Islands. The German Empire has no right to any of these islands and so they are ours for the rightful taking. First will formalise our claims to the area with the South Seas Territory. We can then use those claims to bring them into our empire, be that with diplomacy or the might of the Japanese Imperial Navy."
 JAP_ultimatum: "Issue Colonial Ultimatum"
 JAP_ultimatum_desc: "We must use this opportunity to claim our rightful role as the sole great power in Asia and in the Pacific: we must demand all [GER.GetAdjective] South-East Asian and Pacific possessions, as well as their Chinese concessions. If they don't meet our demands, then it shall be war!"
 JAP_indochina_question: "Target: Indochina"
 JAP_indochina_question_desc: "An independent Indochina does not align with our strategic plans for the region. We must make a move to secure it as soon as possible."
 JAP_target_siam: "Bring Siam into the Fold!"
 JAP_target_siam_desc: "We'd held out hopes that the Siamese would prove amenable to an alliance, but seeing as that isn't the case we must exert force to bring them in line."

### Focuses - Seishin-ron ###
 JAP_go_west: "Seishin-ron"
 JAP_go_west_desc: "With Russia not a threat across the Amur River and the Americans embroiled in a civil war, the time has come to fulfil our destiny. China is weak, corrupt and divided and must be lead into the modern age under the guidance of Japan. If the Chinese don't agree, then we shall simply have to teach them a harsh lesson about defiance."
 JAP_mantetsu_projects: "Mantetsu Projects"
 JAP_mantetsu_projects_desc: "Mantetsu manages the railways of Manchuria and Korea on our behalf, and is deeply involved with the economy of North-West China as a result. As we expand our influence into the interior and the coast of our Chinese proxy, they are sure to propose increasingly ambitious projects to develop the region."
 JAP_support_allies: "Support Warlord Allies"
 JAP_support_allies_desc: "Many of China's warlords are lining up to bow down and receive Japanese power to back them up like the Old Marshal did. We should oblige them and ensure they are well-equipped to be our proxies in China."
 JAP_sow_chaos: "Divide and Conquer"
 JAP_sow_chaos_desc: "In all things Chinese, 'divide and conquer' should be our philosophy. While many warlords may wish for our support, we should ensure a good balance of forces on all sides by manipulating the odds in favour of any and all factions, to keep China divided and ripe for the taking when the time comes."
 JAP_national_mobilisation_law: "National Mobilisation Law"

 JAP_three_alls: "Burn to Ash Strategy"
 JAP_three_alls_desc: "The Burn to Ash Strategy will be as brutal as it will be effective; those that take up arms against us in resistance shall be killed without mercy, professional soldier or otherwise. We shall supplement this with careful use of blockhouses to hinder the path of guerrillas as well as concentrating civilians in fortified areas to hamper recruitment. This combination will be our road to victory in China."
 JAP_ichigo: "Operation Ichi-gou"
 JAP_ichigo_desc: "A series of decisive battles has been planned called Operation Ichi-gou, intended to link up our various armies and crush the Chinese once and for all. We are staking a great deal on this, and if we should prove to be unsuccessful, our stability is sure to suffer as the war will seem un-winnable to the public. But we have every faith in our generals to bring victory at last. Forward Japanese soldiers! Tennō Heika Banzai!"
 JAP_respect_fengtian: "The Fruits of Loyalty"
 JAP_respect_fengtian_desc: "The government of Zhang Zuolin has been our main ally in China for many years, and supporting him in his quest to unify China has been our goal and the reason for this war. It is therefore imperative that we turn over all land we have taken that he claims as a core part of China."
 JAP_plant_cherry_blossoms: "Plant Sakura Trees"
 JAP_plant_cherry_blossoms_desc: "The blood that we have shed in China has been costly and our gains hard-won. We aren't about to let some jumped-up warlord with ideas about his rights or Chinese nationalism take them from us. Our key claims in China will remain under our control and open to settlement by Japanese people, which we shall symbolise by planting cherry trees."

 JAP_tokyo_conference: "Host the Tokyo Conference"
 JAP_tokyo_conference_desc: "Pan-Asian thought is genuinely supported by a large segment of the political classes and is a useful tool regardless. By hosting a major conference in Tokyo and inviting diplomats from all over Asia we can encourage cooperation between Asiatics to stand against Western Imperialism."
 JAP_invite_alliance_members: "Formalise Military Alliances"

 JAP_osaka_conference_desc: "In Osaka, one of our major industrial cities and a historic trade hub, we have decided to set up a commission drawn from all over Asia. Its duties are mainly concerning the economic ties between members of the Greater East-Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. By putting resources into this, we can promote autarky and economic self-confidence amongst Asians, and extend our influence over them further."

### Events ###

 japdom.1.t: "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
 japdom.1.d: "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920s were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change, as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages.\n\nAfter leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment have fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."
 japdom.1.a: "Gaman shiyou."

 japdom.2.t: "Dissolution of the Diet"
 japdom.2.d: "The four-year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called for a general election to happen as soon as possible."
 japdom.2.a: "Very well."

 japdom.3.t: "General Election 1936"
 japdom.3.d: "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyūkai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party).\n\nThe Rikken Seiyūkai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyūkai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyūkai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
 japdom.3.a: "The Seiyūkai have defended their absolute majority!"
 japdom.3.b: "The Seiyūkai have lost their absolute majority!"

 japdom.4.t: "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
 japdom.4.d: "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rōdō-Nōmintō (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 76, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
 japdom.4.a: "This will be bad..."

 japdom.5.t: "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
 japdom.5.d: "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirōkei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party, at the expense of the moderate Shaminkei, (Social Democratic Clique) but also from outside the party, notably from the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sōdōmei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon, an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirōkei accused the Sōdōmei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sōdōmei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirōkei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirōkei's members were expelled from both the Sōdōmei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."
 japdom.5.a: "An interesting development."

 japdom.6.t: "The May 15th Incident"
 japdom.6.d: "The Prime Minister has been assassinated! Radical officers connected to the Nichirōkei broke into his official residence and shot Prime Minister Inukai. They claim they did so to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admiralty Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court martial and a deep investigation into radical activities within the Navy."
 japdom.6.a: "Appoint Suzuki Kisaburō to replace Inukai."

 japdom.7.t: "Restorationists and Centralists"
 japdom.7.d: "The 'Ishinha', restoration faction is a political ideology promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered to be the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor, and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them are the 'Chūshinha', the central faction, who are close to the central military leadership who support cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics."
 japdom.7.a: "This will be trouble..."

 japdom.8.t: "The Security Debate"
 japdom.8.d: "The debate in the Imperial Diet has steadily increased the last few months, and is now reaching a terrifying level. Many members fear for their lives, and so, progress isn't just a matter of political power or personal pride, but of survival. There is a growing consensus that the current security laws aren't enough to protect democracy and that more are needed. The May 15th Incident must not be allowed to happen again."
 japdom.8.a: "A comprehensive law, an act, must be made!"

 japdom.9.t: "The National Security Act"
 japdom.9.d: "The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kantō anarchist uprising in September 1923, and a syndicalist assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburō now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition, even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyūkai and Adachi Kenzō of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."
 japdom.9.a: "We must defend our Democracy by any means necessary; the Act is forced through."
 japdom.9.b: "Public opinion and the opposition defeat the Act."

 japdom.10.t: "The Trial of the May 15th Incident"
 japdom.10.d: "The court martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began last month. Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."
 japdom.10.a: "This country is going crazy..."

 japdom.11.t: "The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburō"
 japdom.11.d: "The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichirō were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. When Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation', shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound has proven fatal."
 japdom.11.a: "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

 japdom.12.t: "Government under Fire"
 japdom.12.d: "Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has created a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who had backed the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's back-down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's inability to produce any measures against syndicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet."
 japdom.12.a: "Suzuki's days are numbered..."

 japdom.13.t: "Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburō"
 japdom.13.d: "Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet and, with lukewarm support, former Home Minister Mizuno Rentarō was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultraconservative chairman Baron Hiranuma released a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system."
 japdom.13.a: "Call emergency convention!"

 japdom.14.t: "The Election of Mizuno Rentarō"
 japdom.14.dead: "The death of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyūkai and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejirō (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyū Hontō during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, though he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, and appointed current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentarō instead."
 japdom.14.notdead: "The resignation of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyūkai and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejirō (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyū Hontō during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, though he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, and appointed current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentarō instead."
 japdom.14.a: "Finally, some stability in politics."

 japdom.15.t: "Japan's Longest Winter"
 japdom.15.d: "The Japanese government has found itself effectively paralysed. The downfall of two successive Seiyūkai Prime Ministers has severely weakened the power of the new Prime Minister, and Hiranuma's open scheme to destroy the parliamentary system has only worsened the political turmoil. Extremist groups are growing by the day, and the military is getting more and more frustrated. Several high-ranking officers within the Army have hatched a plot to overthrow the civilian administration and 'rescue' the Empire. The plotters have approached Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro for his support..."
 japdom.15.a: "The future of Japan lies in his choice."

 japdom.16.t: "Japan's Longest Day"
 japdom.16.d: "After ten years of political disgrace, the army has taken power again, this time by a coup d'état. Ultraconservative politician Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been enacted across all of the Greater Japanese Empire."
 japdom.16.a: "Banzai!"

 japdom.17.t: "Failed Coup Attempt"
 japdom.17.d: "Even through the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters interpreted this as a signal of permission, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested."
 japdom.17.a: "Democracy has prevailed!"

 japdom.18.t: "The Power Struggle"
 japdom.18.d: "Restorationist officers were the main participants of the coup that overthrew the elected government, for they saw the parliamentary system as a plutocratic capitalist institution. Under the successive government however, the Centralists took the leading role in the new regime and the Restorationists were marginalised from the leadership. The Restorationist leadership has concluded that they were deceived. A new power struggle has begun."
 japdom.18.a: "Will this ever end?"

 japdom.19.t: "The Ishinha Counter-Coup"
 japdom.19.d: "Earlier today, Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. In the afternoon, the emperor himself addressed the soldiers announcing his official support of their revolution."
 japdom.19.a: "The coup is successful!"

 japdom.20.t: "Restorationist Coup Attempt!"
 japdom.20.d: "Earlier today Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. After the emperor explicitly denounced the putschists the navy mobilised marine divisions to rescue the palace, and by the evening the coup was crushed."
 japdom.20.a: "Thank god for the navy!"

 japdom.21.t: "The Centralists Win!"
 japdom.21.d: "The Restorationist coup has been defeated. Branded traitors, the Restorationists are being purged all over the country. There are calls for the Army to assume a greater role in government to help root out both the traitors and the syndicalists."
 japdom.21.a: "Army Minister Hayashi will assume the premiership."
 japdom.21.b: "There is no need for this right now."

 japdom.22.t: "The Government of National Unity"
 japdom.22.d: "Nakajima Chikuhei from the Rikken Seiyūkai and Adachi Kenzō from the Minseito, both supporters of the National Security Act, have issued a joint statement, urging both the mainstream parties to form a multi-party 'Government of National Unity' to protect the Kokutai (national polity) from the syndicalist threat."
 japdom.22.a: "We need a strong government."
 japdom.22.b: "We don't need your nonsense; an election is what we need!"

 japdom.23.t: "On the Basic Principles of National Defence"
 japdom.23.d: "After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kōdō Kokubō Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line."
 japdom.23.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.24.t: "On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure"
 japdom.24.d: "'On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure' is a 156 page pamphlet produced by the Ministry of Education to establish an official description of the 'Kokutai', or national structure (It can also can be translated as 'national essence', 'national polity', etc). The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'."
 japdom.24.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.25.t: "The New System Movement"
 japdom.25.d: "To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undō) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimarō, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai)."
 japdom.25.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.26.t: "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
 japdom.26.d: "The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level, a direct link between politics and the people will be established. By having every important interest group represented at its core, it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policies. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society.\n\nThree main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kōdōha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kōdō', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association).\n\nThe latter two object to the Kakushinha's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition."
 japdom.26.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.27.t: "Konoe Fumimarō Secures Support"
 japdom.27.d: "After a fifteen-day-long convention, Prince Konoe has successfully advanced his agenda and secured support in the Taisei Yokusankai."
 japdom.27.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.28.t: "Araki Sadao Secures Support"
 japdom.28.d: "After a fifteen-day-long convention, General Araki has successfully advanced his agenda and secured support in the Taisei Yokusankai."
 japdom.28.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.29.t: "Kuhara Fusanosuke Secures Support"
 japdom.29.d: "After a fifteen-day-long convention, Restorationist politician Kuhara Fusanosuke has successfully advanced his agenda and secured support in the Taisei Yokusankai."
 japdom.29.a: "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.31.t: "General Election"
 japdom.31.d: "Democracy has survived the fateful winter and election reform securing its place has been passed. However, with the failure of the National Unity government the government lacks the power and mandate to rule effectively. The solution is clear however: trust in its election reforms and take the issue to the people; the Government has called an election to confirm its electoral mandate and regain the political initiative!"
 japdom.31.a: "Elect Rikken Seiyūkai (Conservatives)."
 japdom.31.b: "Elect Minseito (Liberals)."
 japdom.31.c: "Maintain the ruling coalition."

 japdom.32.t: "A Party Divided"
 japdom.32.d: "During the Rikken Seiyūkai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council.\n\nLast month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted to complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Dōmei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Dōmei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyūkai."
 japdom.32.a: "It is time to find our own path."

 japdom.33.t: "Formation of the Kokumin Dōmei"
 japdom.33.d: "After accepting Adachi Kenzō and his clique from the Minseito into the Kakushin Dōmei, Nakajima reorganised the party and renamed it the Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance)."
 japdom.33.a: "It is time to find our own path."

 japdom.34.t: "The National Unity Government Breaks Up"
 japdom.34.d: "Though originally formed to give parliamentary politics a strong face to present to both the Army and the people, from the start, it was clear that the main benefactors of the National Unity Government were to be the anti-mainstream Adachi and Nakajima factions of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai respectively. Over the past years, tensions within the two parties have steadily reached a breaking point. The coalition has shattered, Adachi and Kuhara leaving their parties to form the new Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance), while the conservative factions of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai have reasserted control."
 japdom.34.a: "It is time to find our own path"

 japdom.35.t: "The Cabinet Planning Board"
 japdom.35.d: "With the Black Monday recession, general economic and political turmoil threatening the Japanese export markets in the Pacific, the Government has begun to review its economic policies. We mainly export raw silk and other consumer goods- our industrial goods are still inadequate compared with most western nations. Various measures to remedy the situation have been suggested and a Cabinet Planning Board (Kikakuin) has been established to study and plan future economic policy."
 japdom.35.a: "Good."

 japdom.36.t: "Zaibatsu Corruption Scandal"
 japdom.36.d: "As we feared, today several high-ranking government officials with links to the Zaibatsu have been accused of corruption. This is not the first time such accusations have been made and we fear it will not be the last. While some say it is good they were caught, it nevertheless represents another blow to our government given our close support of the Zaibatsu.\n\nThe trial will start in a few days but given the vast amount of wealth these officials will be able to mobilise it will no doubt be a long and painful road to justice, if we ever even get there... "
 japdom.36.a: "A shameful display!"

 japdom.45.t: "The Popular Front Incident"
 japdom.45.d: "446 left-wing academics, intellectuals, and politicians (including two incumbent Diet members) were arrested and indicted under the National Security Act today. All were accused of organising a 'popular front' and threatening the Kokutai."
 japdom.45.a: "Well that's that sorted right?"

 japdom.46.t: "The Second Popular Front Incident"
 japdom.46.d: "Additional arrests of intellectuals were made today, when 38 left-wing professors arrested on charges of organising a 'popular front'."
 japdom.46.a: "How many of these Reds are there?!"

 japdom.47.t: "The Keihin Workers' Group Incident"
 japdom.47.d: "An underground syndicalist group operating in the Keihin (Tokyo-Yokohama) region has been uncovered and arrested."
 japdom.47.a: "That's good, right?"

 japdom.48.t: "The Planning Board Incident"
 japdom.48.d: "Seventeen members of the Cabinet Planning Board were arrested and indicted of organising a 'popular front' within the government today."
 japdom.48.a: "This is getting out of hand!"

 japdom.49.t: "The Research Department Incident"
 japdom.49.d: "Twenty-nine bureaucrats from the Research Department (Chōsabu) of the South Manchurian Railway were arrested and indicted today of organising an underground syndicalist movement within the Railway."
 japdom.49.a: "This is getting out of hand!"

 japdom.50.t: "The Yokohama Incident"
 japdom.50.d: "Sixty writers and journalists are under arrest on charges of attempting to form an underground syndicalist party. However, it has been revealed that most of their confessions were produced under torture."
 japdom.50.a: "This is getting bad!"

 japdom.51.t: "Tokkō Officers Accused of Torture"
 japdom.51.d: "The Tokkō, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokkō is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death. When the National Security Act was passed, the Tokkō rapidly expanded its size and operation, and their regard for the safety of accused criminals declined even further. Today a major newspaper has reported that a man died while in custody, and has accused the Tokkō of torturing the victim to death."
 japdom.51.a: "Oh no..."

 japdom.52.t: "The Repeal of the National Security Act"
 japdom.52.d: "The increasing excesses and abuses of the National Security Act has forced politicians to reconsider its worth. The Act served its purpose and saved a lot of lives from terrorism, but maybe it has outlived its usefulness."
 japdom.52.a: "Repeal the act."

 japdom.53.t: "The Great Drought of 1939"
 japdom.53.d: "The country is in the middle of the worst drought it has seen this century. Water supplies are critically low and crops are dying of thirst. In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However, the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being."
 japdom.53.a: "At least no one is starving yet..."

 japdom.54.t: "1940 General Election"
 japdom.54.d: "The time has come for a new general election. With the main and opposition parties now running, the choices are more varied than they have been since the late 19th century. After the elections are complete, His Majesty the Emperor will ask the new Prime Minister to form his cabinet."
 japdom.54.a: "Elect Rikken Seiyūkai (Conservatives)."
 japdom.54.b: "Elect Minseito (Liberals)."
 japdom.54.c: "Elect Kokumin Dōmei (Nationalists)."
 japdom.54.e: "Elect Shakai Taishuto (Socialists)."

 japdom.55.t: "General Elections of 1944"

 japdom.56.t: "The Emperor Has Been Shot!"
 japdom.56.d: "His Imperial Majesty Hirohito has been shot by a radical Syndicalist who was infuriated by the military takeover of the nation. His Majesty is in critical condition and the doctors are not sure if he will live..."
 japdom.56.a: "Hirohito makes a miraculous recovery!"
 japdom.56.b: "His Majesty is dead, Prince Chichibu will become regent."

 japdom.57.t: "A Second Meiji Restoration?"
 japdom.57.d: "It has been three years since Prince Chichibu became regent for his nephew Akihito, but now many in the radical Restorationist clique, which the regent supports, have now told the regent they would help him in overthrowing his nephew and becoming Emperor himself."
 japdom.57.a: "All hail Emperor Yasuhito!"
 japdom.57.b: "That would be wrong. He is the true emperor."

 japdom.58.t: "Hayashi Senjuro is Dead!"
 japdom.58.d.pataut: "A sad day has come to pass - Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō has been found passed away at his home. A man who played both the Centralist and Restorationist factions to rise to prominence as the leader of the new military regime, his Premiership has seen great change in all aspects of Japanese life, no doubt cementing him as one the most influential - and perhaps infamous - figures in our nation's modern history.\n\nThe only real choice for Hayashi's successor, General Nagata Tetsuzan, seems to confirm the path Japan is going along. Known as the main theorist of the Army's Centralist faction, Nagata has worked behind the scenes since the 30s to gain the support of businessmen and politicians alike for transforming Japan into the National Defence State dreamed of by his squad of total-war advocates. It seems the Army regime is here to stay."
 japdom.58.d.defaul: "A sad day has come to pass - the retired General Hayashi Senjūrō has been found passed away at his home. A man who played both the Centralist and Restorationist factions throughout his ultimately disappointing political career, his association with the Army radicals worried many at times, yet it all seems to have been nothing in the end."
 japdom.58.a: "Appoint Nagata Tetsuzan."
 japdom.58.b: "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

 japdom.60.t: "The Drought Takes its Toll"
 japdom.60.d: "With the nation's rural areas already struggling after the lost decade, the drought has served to further impoverish farmers and bankrupt light industries built around agricultural produce. The drought's effects seem likely to continue for some time."
 japdom.60.a: "Shō ga nai."

 japdom.61.t: "The Fengtian-Korea-Japan Provisions Proposal"
 japdom.61.d_pervasive: "After studying the nature of the ongoing drought, the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, and Home Affairs, have concluded that there is little more that can be done to stem the impact of the drought beyond the measures that have already been taken. However, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has come forward with a proposition in which Fengtian could be coerced into exporting millet and rice to Korea, with Korea then providing its own rice to feed Japan. Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, our political and economic stranglehold over the country should be enough to prevent any dissent."
 japdom.61.d_normal: "After studying the nature of the ongoing drought, the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, and Home Affairs, have concluded that there is little more that can be done to stem the impact of the drought beyond the measures that have already been taken. However, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has come forward with a proposition in which Fengtian could be asked to export its millet and rice to Korea, with Korea then providing its own rice to feed Japan. Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, surely the Fengtian Government should be willing to assist their benefactor in its time of need."
 japdom.61.a: "They will have no choice."
 japdom.61.b: "Send the request."
 japdom.61.c: "We will endure."

 japdom.62.t: "Fengtian Refuses Our Proposal"
 japdom.62.t.cutoff: "Fengtian Cuts Off Aid"
 japdom.62.d: "In an act of unprecedented impertinence, the Fengtian Government has refused our proposal to ameliorate the impact of the drought. Surely this act of gross and unacceptable disrespect will be met with sound retribution!"
 japdom.62.d.cutoff: "In an act of unprecedented impertinence, the Fengtian Government has decided to cut off shipments of food, and we are once again left to deal with the drought on our own. Surely this act of gross and unacceptable disrespect will be met with sound retribution!"
 japdom.62.a: "Punish this impertinence!"
 japdom.62.b: "Shō ga nai."

 japdom.63.t: "The Drought Ends"
 japdom.63.d: "After many months of suffering, the drought has finally ended and the country begins its recovery."
 japdom.63.a: "Finally!"

 japdom.64.t: "Fengtian Agrees to Provide Food"
 japdom.64.d: "The Fengtian Government has agreed to provide food, and the major negative effects of the drought should subside soon."
 japdom.64.a: "Good news!"

 japdom.65.t: "The Emperor and Democracy"
 japdom.65.d: "The government is weak, and in a desperate move has asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance and fortunately has supported the government. His words carry great weight, and may be enough to keep the government afloat. Do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
 japdom.65.a: "Let us agree with the Emperor."
 japdom.65.b: "He is out of line!"

 japdom.72.t: "The Emperor and Democracy"
 japdom.72.d: "The government is weak, and in a desperate move has asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance but he has refused to support the government. His words carry great weight, and this lack of support may be a fatal blow. Without intervention the government will surely fall; do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
 japdom.72.a: "Lets us agree with the Emperor."
 japdom.72.b: "He is out of line!"

 japdom.66.t: "Political Resistance"
 japdom.66.d: "Though people say they are willing to lay down their life for the emperor, putting that to the test has been less successful than we would have liked. There has been political resistance to our mass mobilisation campaign, and while it is pushing ahead as planned, it has weakened our political position."
 japdom.66.a: "I see."

 japdom.67.t: "Decreasing Quality"
 japdom.67.d: "Our third phase of mobilisation is under way, but already we are discovering that these new recruits aren't up to standard. However, it is too late to turn back. All we can do is hope combat trains them well."
 japdom.67.a: "I understand."

 japdom.68.t: "Command Disagreements"
 japdom.68.d: "Nagata and Obata have had an argument. Each has called the other a fool, and now they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army is without leadership."
 japdom.68.a: "I hope you are right."

 japdom.69.t: "Another Disagreement"
 japdom.69.d: "Nagata and Obata have had another argument. They nearly came to blows with one another, and now, once again, they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army is without leadership. We must be careful with the political situation to avoid things like this."
 japdom.69.a: "I hope you are right."

 japdom.70.t: "Yet More Fighting"
 japdom.70.d: "Nagata and Obata have had yet another argument. This time they declared each other to be the greatest threat Japan has ever faced, and once more they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army is without leadership. Fortunately, those close to them say they are nearly reaching a compromise, so hopefully this will be the last argument they have."
 japdom.70.a: "I hope you are right."

 japdom.74.t: "Switching Rail Gauge"
 japdom.74.d: "It has taken tremendous effort, but finally the switch is under way. While it is nowhere near complete, the worst is behind us, and we are already beginning to see the negative effects of our old, narrow, rail gauge diminishing."
 japdom.74.a: "Hurrah!"

 japdom.75.t: "Land Reform Complete"
 japdom.75.bad: "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions; sadly we will not be the last either. Our efforts have been a waste of time, nothing less than a complete disaster! We have been unable to even make a dent in the issue; it will surely plague our economy for years to come..."
 japdom.75.okay: "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions. We may be the last, however; while we haven't revolutionised land use, we have fixed many issues, enough that inefficient land use will no longer plague our economy."
 japdom.75.good: "Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, but where others failed we have succeeded! We have not only fixed many of the underlying issues but gone above and beyond: we have purchased and redistributed tens of thousands of hectares of land to landless or tenant farmers and are already beginning to see the benefits of our work!"
 japdom.75.great: "It's a miracle! Land reform has been an ongoing political issue and we are not the first government to try and implement solutions, but where others failed we have done what many thought was impossible! We have completed what is being internationally recognised as one of the largest land redistribution programs in history. 2.3 million hectares of land have been distributed to farmers during the project and landlordism, as Japan knew it, no longer exists."
 japdom.75.a: "How could this have happened..."
 japdom.75.b: "I'll take it!"
 japdom.75.c: "Banzai!"
 japdom.75.d: "Banzai Banzai Banzai!"

 japdom.235.t: "Our Further Endeavours in Atomic Research"
 japdom.235.d: "With our nation's leading scientists toiling away in Tokyo and now Fukushima, and the heavy water trickling in from our facilities in Konan, we are well under way of creating an infrastructure capable of harnessing the power of the atom. The next step would be the construction of an experimental reactor.\n\nHousing this operation at the main RIKEN facilities in Tokyo might seem like the obvious choice, but some voices have argued that our new facility in Fukushima would do better in hiding this operation from our enemies abroad. In either case, utmost secrecy is vital."
 japdom.235.a: "Get Fukushima ready to house the facility."
 japdom.235.b: "Tokyo is the ideal location for it."

 japdom.236.t: "Army Leadership Protests Naval Bias"
 japdom.236.d: "Our recent investiture in policies benefiting the Navy have angered the leadership of our land forces. Some of the more prominent figures have expressed their disapproval in a private meeting earlier today."
 japdom.236.a: "Tell them they'll have to wait and see."

 japdom.237.t: "Navy Leadership Protests Army Bias"
 japdom.237.d: "Our recent investiture in policies benefiting the Army have angered the leadership of our sea fleet. Some of the more prominent figures have expressed their disapproval in a private meeting earlier today."
 japdom.237.a: "Tell them they'll have to wait and see."

 japdom.241.t: "Fate of the Imperial Family"
 japdom.241.d: "With the finalisation of the last branches of the new governmental system, the future of the Japanese Imperial Family must be discussed. While many members of the Imperial Family undoubtedly bear responsibility for prosecuting the war against us, true justice would likely leave several dead or imprisoned for life, and us with an impossible public-order problem on our hands. Our diplomats and even most generals insist that we must instead use a lighter hand. We cannot leave the monarchy intact, but there may be some options still."
 japdom.241.a: "Leave them be, but powerless. They will no longer be aristocracy."
 japdom.241.b: "Exile them from Japan."

 japdom.242.t: "Black Monday Reaches the Shores"
 japdom.242.d: "Eventually, as expected, the domino effect of the economic failure in the German Empire has reached our Empire. While we are not as affected as our neighbours in the region, due to our quite grand economic isolation from the German markets, we still were touched by it. The Zaibatsu and our banks will have a hard time for a few months."
 japdom.242.a: "That was to be expected."

 japdom.243.t: "Disagreements Within Army Leadership"
 japdom.243.d: "The ongoing factional rivalry within the ranks of the IJA has found a new front: the military strategic debate between the two rising stars, Major General Nagata Tetsuzan (of the Centralist Faction) and Major General Obata Toshishiro (of the Restorationist Faction).\n\nGeneral Nagata believes the Japanese economy is inadequate to sustain any kind of total warfare, and thus, building up an army capable of total war should be our top objective. He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.\n\nGeneral Obata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion; due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capacity through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.\n\nBoth agree a centralised command structure is a good idea, and that raw manpower tactics are a poor strategy; we can never hope to compete with Russian or Chinese manpower. We may now choose how to proceed."
 japdom.243.a: "I will choose wisely."

 japdom.301.t: "A Question of Dedication"
 japdom.301.d: "While our decision to follow technological supremacy and quality over quantity makes perfect tactical sense, there are still some of our admirals who are saying we are not dedicated enough to this concept and are calling for further improvements of our quality standards. However, their opponents are arguing that this will lead to decreased output of our already limited production capacity."
 japdom.301.a: "We must pursue ultimate quality in our ships."
 japdom.301.b: "We can't hamper our naval production any more."

 japdom.302.t: "A Question of Dedication"
 japdom.302.d: "While our decision to abandon technological supremacy and quality over quantity makes perfect tactical sense, there are still some of our admirals who are saying we are not dedicated enough to this concept and are calling for further simplification of our existing designs. However, their opponents are arguing that this will lead to further decreases in the quality of our ships."
 japdom.302.a: "We must cut corners wherever it is possible."
 japdom.302.b: "We mustn't hamper the quality of our ships any more."

 japdom.303.t: "Direction of Plane Development"
 japdom.303.d: "Our great engineers have prepared plans for new generation of carrier planes. While it can take time to develop all of them, we could dedicate our resources to at least one type and prepare it for duty, much sooner."
 japdom.303.a: "Fighter planes are key!"
 japdom.303.b: "Dive bombers are vital!"
 japdom.303.c: "Torpedo bombers are crucial!"

 japdom.304.t: "New Naval Prototype Flying!"
 japdom.304.d: "After many sleepless months, our engineers and workers were able to build and even fly with one of the new prototype carrier planes; what great news!"
 japdom.304.a: "Great news!"

 japfor.1.t: "Mantetsu Declares Record Earnings"
 japfor.1.d: "Japan has had a presence in Manchuria ever since the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War, and in the years since our hold over the region has greatly strengthened. The negotiations at Shanghai in 1928 forced the world to recognise our right to a 'free hand in Manchuria', opening boundless opportunity to our citizens under the Kwantung Army's watchful eye.\n\nOur control is not absolute however, and Zhang Zuolin's' Fengtian Government is not always cooperative. It is fortunate for him that our desire to safeguard a profitable peace in Manchuria remains paramount, alongside our hope that his government will one day act as a vehicle for our greater Chinese ambitions. For these reasons, the heart of our efforts in Manchuria is the South Manchuria Railway Company, or "Mantetsu" for short, which has become responsible for developing and exploiting vast swathes of the Manchurian economy, propelling the region to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soy bean supply.\n\nToday, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."
 japfor.1.a: "Manchuria is truly a cornucopia of opportunity!"

 japfor.3.t: "Japan Offers Troop Training"
 japfor.3.d: "A delegation has arrived from [From.GetNameDef] today offering training for our forces, to bring us 'to the necessary level'. It's a difficult offer to refuse..."
 japfor.3.a: "By all means!"
 japfor.3.b: "Refuse them."

 japfor.4.t: "Japan Provides Arms Facilities"
 japfor.4.d: "The Japanese, obviously in an attempt to sweet-talk us, have provided us with a year's access to top-of-the-line manufacturing facilities for armaments. While we're not certain of their intentions, it's unwise to look a gift horse in the mouth..."
 japfor.4.a: "How generous!"
 japfor.4.b: "Turn them down."

 japfor.5.t: "Japan Supports Our Offensives"
 japfor.5.d: "The Japanese have approached with a tempting offer of supplies, bombardment, and ammunition in aid of our offensive operations for the next 100 days. Should we accept?"
 japfor.5.a: "Of course!"
 japfor.5.b: "Never!"

 japfor.6.t: "Japan Provides Fighter Designs"
 japfor.6.d: "The Japanese military has allowed several designs for fighters more advanced than our own to fall into our lap, with detailed instructions on how to build them efficiently. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
 japfor.6.a: "Whatever we need, we get from Japan."

 japfor.7.t: "Japan Supports Our Independence"
 japfor.7.d: "Japanese advisors have turned up today, bringing gifts and support in our struggle against the Chinese. We are grateful for their gesture, but do we really want to accept Japanese aid so readily?"
 japfor.7.a: "We will take what we can get."
 japfor.7.b: "Refuse them."

 japfor.8.t: "Abdurresid Ibrahim Arrives In [Root.GetNameDef]"
 japfor.8.d: "An imam by the name of Abdurresid Ibrahim has today arrived in [Root.GetNameDef], as a representative of the Japanese government. He speaks very highly of their support for our cause and opposition to Chinese tyranny, as well as a desire to see all Asians unified under one anti-imperialist banner. We are honoured to receive one so learned."
 japfor.8.a: "Be welcome, teacher."

 japfor.9.t: "Help from the Japanese?"
 japfor.9.d: "An envoy from Japan arrived today, appearing in secret and offering high quality arms made according to our specifications. Why the Japanese would wish to secretly offer such assistance to [Root.GetNameDef] he would not say, nor would he elaborate on whether there were any strings attached to this 'gift'. Perhaps the Japanese are playing some game in the region, taking advantage of our conflict with [CHN.GetNameDef]? Should we be wary?"
 japfor.9.a: "We'll take their help."
 japfor.9.b: "No, we don't want any part of this."

 japfor.10.t: "A Mysterious Benefactor..."
 japfor.10.d: "Just as it seemed our funds were running low, it seems some mysterious benefactors have seen fit to extend us fresh lines of credit. We're not complaining."
 japfor.10.a: "Never look a gift horse in the mouth."

 japfor.21.t: "The Tokyo Conference"
 japfor.21.d: "The Japanese have sent an invitation to their 'Pan-Asian Conference' in Tokyo. Their stated aim is to promote cooperation between Asiatic nations against Western Imperialism, which is an outwardly noble aim. However, some have urged us to ignore it, claiming that this is merely a ploy to woo us into signing over our independence to the Japanese Empire, whose quest for domination of Asia is just beginning."
 japfor.21.a: "Pack my best suit."
 japfor.21.b: "Let's stay home this year."

 japfor.22.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Attends Tokyo Conference"
 japfor.22.d: "Representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have arrived in Tokyo and discussions are well under way!"
 japfor.22.a: "Welcome!"

 japfor.23.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] refused Attendance"
 japfor.23.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have refused to attend the Tokyo Conference we held at great expense, providing only evasive and shaky justifications when questioned about their reasons."
 japfor.23.a: "A loss of face."

 japfor.24.t: "Joint Condemnation of Western Imperialism"
 japfor.24.d: "The summit in Tokyo today saw its first major motion come forward, a fairly uncontroversial one that aims to have all members sign a condemnation of Western colonialist exploitation of Asiatic peoples, and urges the repudiation of unequal treaties. We expect it to have major support, and to lead into the other major business."
 japfor.24.a: "On the dotted line, if you would"
 japfor.24.b: "Take no chances, 'encourage' them to sign"

 japfor.25.t: "Tokyo: Condemning Western Imperialism"
 japfor.25.d: "Our delegates in Japan are apparently being asked to put their names to a fairly standard declaration. It condemns 'anti-Asian racism', 'the exploitation of oppressed peoples by European powers', and 'the institutions of Unequal Treaties, through which mechanism the populations of Asia are deliberately kept disenfranchised within their own lands'. Should we join [JAP.GetNameDef] in this initiative?"
 japfor.25.a: "Of course!"
 japfor.25.b: "We'd rather not (drop out of the conference)"

 japfor.26.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Drops Out"
 japfor.26.d: "It would seem that the [From.GetAdjective] dignitaries became uncomfortable with our proposals at the Tokyo Conference, and have elected to drop out of further talks."
 japfor.26.a: "Shame!"

 japfor.27.t: "Tokyo: Resolution on Trade"
 japfor.27.d: "... therefore the attendees of this conference agree that, in order to promote pan-Asian cooperation and brotherhood, treaties concerning trade should be set up and brought to the top of the national agenda in each nation with a view towards establishing a common Asian customs area and protecting the economies of Asiatic peoples from the predatory Western economic principles which are..."
 japfor.27.a: "Perfect, they must agree..."
 japfor.27.b: "...but maybe we can soften the terms"

 japfor.28.t: "Tokyo: Concerning Pan-Asian Trade"
 japfor.28.d: "... therefore the attendees of this conference agree that, in order to promote pan-Asian cooperation and brotherhood, treaties concerning trade should be set up and brought to the top of the national agenda in each nation with a view towards establishing a common Asian customs area and protecting the economies of Asiatic peoples from the predatory Western economic principles which are..."
 japfor.28.a: "Sounds good to me."
 japfor.28.b: "How absurd (drop out of the conference)"

 japfor.29.t: "Tokyo: Calls for Deeper Economic Ties"
 japfor.29.d: "Asia must succeed! We are preparing a package of memoranda for the Tokyo Conference, calling for deepening economic integration between our economy and those of the attendees. Favourable trade terms, privileges for Japanese companies, currency exchange mechanisms and much more are all part of the broader plan. In its current form, however, some of the attendees may be put off by the package and drop out. We could lessen the terms, giving them a better deal and making them more likely to agree, but at the cost of economic integration more difficult in the long-term."
 japfor.29.a: "Present it to the conference."
 japfor.29.b: "Lessen the terms of the agreement"

 japfor.30.t: "Tokyo: Japan Calls for Deeper Economic Ties"
 japfor.30.d: "Or should that be 'Tokyo Calls For Economic Integration'? Either way, proposals have been brought before the conference detailing Japan's desire for deeper economic ties that go beyond the simple trade policies we agreed to. This could be a big step, but it could also be of greater benefit to the [From.GetAdjective] economy than our own in the long term."
 japfor.30.a: "Agreed!"
 japfor.30.b: "No! (drop out of the conference)"

 japfor.31.t: "Final Resolution: A Military Alliance?"
 japfor.31.d: "Ostensibly for anti-colonial purposes, the time is now ripe to bring the remaining conference attendees on board with a full military alliance to oppose our rivals. Far better to let the blows fall on them, after all!"
 japfor.31.a: "If you wish for peace, then prepare for war."
 japfor.31.b: "Heavily pressure the attendees to sign."

 japfor.32.t: "Tokyo: Calls For Military Action"
 japfor.32.d: "The Tokyo Conference today erupted into controversy when the Japanese unveiled their true gambit: having won economic agreement with their project from us, they have now turned this into promotion of a grand military alliance against Germany and other 'Western imperialist powers'. This would, of course, see them play a leading role. Are we really content with this idea?"
 japfor.32.a: "Together for all Asians!"
 japfor.32.b: "They are surely mad!"

 japfor.33.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Aligns With Japan!"
 japfor.33.d: "It would seem the statesmen of [From.GetNameDef] have agreed that their path to prosperity and strength comes from cooperation with the pre-eminent power of Asia, [JAP.GetNameDef]. We shall be making arrangements to bring them into the formal military alliance that underpins the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 japfor.33.a: "Great!"

 japfor.34.t: "A Japanese Alliance?"
 japfor.34.d: "A communication from Japan arrived today, indicating that as part of their policy of supporting the self-determination of non-Han cultures within what is nominally Chinese territory they are willing to endorse a full military alliance with us. Should we accept?"
 japfor.34.a: "Of course!"
 japfor.34.b: "Of course!"

 japfor.340.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted"
 japfor.340.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom of our offer and accepted a place in our alliance."
 japfor.340.a: "Excellent."

 japfor.341.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 japfor.341.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has spurned our offer of alliance."
 japfor.341.a: "A foolish choice."

 japfor.342.t: "Joining the Japanese Sphere"
 japfor.342.d: "Having indicated our interest in officially joining the Japanese military alliance at the Tokyo Conference, the Japanese have now arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] and extended their offer in person."
 japfor.342.a: "It's about time!"
 japfor.342.b: "We've reconsidered..."

 japfor.41.t: "Japanese Ultimatum"
 japfor.41.d: "For months already, the Japanese have expressed their aggressive ambitions towards our colonial lands as part of their expansionist policies. Today, the Japanese ambassador has presented us an ultimatum: They demand that we surrender all our territory in South-East Asia and the Pacific, or else we will face the full might of the Imperial Japanese Military..."
 japfor.41.a: "Don't even bother answering."
 japfor.41.b: "Agree to their demands."

 japfor.42.t: "Our Ultimatum Was Ignored!"
 japfor.42.d: "We did not receive any answer to our ultimatum from [From.GetNameDef]. We must mobilise for war and secure our place as the sole great power in East Asia!"
 japfor.42.a: "Declare war!"
 japfor.42.b: "Back down, we can't risk a war."

 japfor.43.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts our Conditions"
 japfor.43.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our conditions. This is not so surprising after all: they wouldn't dare face the might of the Emperor's armies!"
 japfor.43.a: "Great!"

 japfor.45.t: "The Japanese Envoy"
 japfor.45.d: "A Japanese diplomat arrived today, seeking a meeting with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss their offer: [From.GetNameDef] will send military aid and advisors to [PRF.GetNameDef], and in exchange we will join the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not the military alliance part of it, at least not yet, but rather the group of nations which have pooled their economic strengths under the aegis of Japanese protection. It would benefit the [Root.GetAdjective] economy, to be certain, but there are those who worry the Japanese are merely looking for influence to eventually turn us into a colony."
 japfor.45.a: "We accept their offer."
 japfor.45.b: "We must politely decline."

 japfor.46.t: "The Indians Accept!"
 japfor.46.d: "Our generous offer to the Indians was met with warm praise and acceptance. Envoys from [From.GetNameDef] applauded Japanese magnanimity and astute work in bringing our great nations closer together. We have invited them to set up a permanent embassy in Tokyo."
 japfor.46.a: "Splendid!"

 japfor.47.t: "The Indians Decline Our Offer!"
 japfor.47.d: "In a display of poor judgement, the diplomats in [From.GetNameDef] have declined our magnanimous offer of friendship and alliance. Japanese newspapers reacted with caricatures of scared lapdogs, mocking them for not being willing to take the steps necessary to rid the subcontinent from colonialism."
 japfor.47.a: "Shame on them!"

 japfor.54.t: "Tsingtau is Ours!"
 japfor.54.d: "The German military harbour in East Asia has fallen to our armies. Instead of their naval ensign, now the Japanese flag flies proudly in the city. German shopkeepers watch our regiments parade through the streets with stony expression."
 japfor.54.b: "A great victory!"

 japfor.55.t: "Japan Threatens Us!"
 japfor.55.d: "A large Japanese task force has sailed into the islands, and is threatening to attack us if we do not bow to their demand of full surrender!"
 japfor.55.a: "Resist them and call for help!"
 japfor.55.b: "Surrender is our only option."

 japfor.56.t: "The Philippines Begs for Help!"
 japfor.56.d: "Japan is pounding at the door of Philippines, and they have come to us begging for assistance. Should we respond?"
 japfor.56.a: "Offer our protection."
 japfor.56.b: "We cannot stretch ourselves so far."

 japfor.57.t: "The Philippines Has [philippines_backer.GetAdjective] Backing"
 japfor.57.d: "The Filipinos are resisting our demands, and [philippines_backer.GetNameDef] is backing their claim to independence."
 japfor.57.a: "We will destroy them, regardless."
 japfor.57.b: "Back down, we can return later."

 japfor.5701.t: "The Japanese Back Down"
 japfor.5701.d: "Apparently the Japanese were unwilling to test our mettle. They have backed down from their threats, at least for now."
 japfor.5701.a: "That's a relief."

 japfor.58.t: "The Philippines Resist!"
 japfor.58.d: "The Philippines are resisting our demands, without any foreign backers to come to their rescue. We should make them pay for this in blood."
 japfor.58.a: "We will destroy them."

 japfor.59.t: "The Filipinos Surrender!"
 japfor.59.d: "Seeing the might of our forces, the Philippines had no chance but to submit before the brave sons of the empire!"
 japfor.59.a: "Puppet them!"
 japfor.59.b: "Annex them!"

 japfor.62.t: "Japan Threatens Us!"
 japfor.62.d: "A large Japanese task force has sailed into the islands and is threatening to attack us if we do not bow to their demand of full surrender!"
 japfor.62.a: "Resist them and call for help!"
 japfor.62.b: "Surrender is our only option."

 japfor.63.t: "Hawaii Surrenders!"
 japfor.63.d: "Good for them, they didn't stand a chance anyway."
 japfor.63.a: "Puppet them!"
 japfor.63.b: "Annex them!"

 japfor.64.t: "Hawaii Begs for Help"
 japfor.64.d: "Japan is pounding at the door of Hawaii and they have come to us begging for assistance. Should we respond?"
 japfor.64.a: "Offer our protection."
 japfor.64.b: "They left us, remember?"

 japfor.65.t: "Hawaii Has American Backing"
 japfor.65.d: "Hawaii is resisting our demands and [From.GetNameDef] are backing their claim to independence."
 japfor.65.a: "We will destroy them anyway."
 japfor.65.b: "Back down, we can return later."

 japfor.66.t: "Hawaii Resists!"
 japfor.66.d: "Hawaii is resisting our demands, and without any interest from the American mainland in defending them. We should make them pay for this in blood."

 japfor.90.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Targets the Legations"
 japfor.90.d: "News from Shanghai in the last few days has taken on an increasingly worried tone as the threat of war seemed to loom over the bund. [FROM.GetNameDef]'s stance towards the settlement is seemingly a reversal of their position a mere 10 years ago, as they now condemn the Legation's existence as symbol of 'blatant Western imperialism' while reports indicate that the Imperial Japanese Navy is being prepared to take the mandate's capital. All of these signs seem to confirm that Japan is preparing for war. But with the international situation tense, [LEC.GetNameDef] far from our nation, and a powerful navy backing Japanese actions, many within our government believe aiding the cities to be a lost cause. Powerful voices within society and especially the business community, however, have pleaded with the government to stand by its foreign commitments and halt Japanese aggression."
 japfor.90.a: "Retreat - we cannot afford to fight Japan."
 japfor.90.b: "We will defend our interests!"

 japfor.91.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the Legation Cities"
 japfor.91.d: "It seems the Japanese threat to our existence have not gone unnoticed by [FROM.GetNameDef]. But rather than stand by their commitments to defend us, they have remained suspiciously silent. In fact, [FROM.GetNameDef] now seem to be scrambling to abandon Shanghai with as many of their assets possible, simultaneously denying responsibility for our defence. In the face of blatant foreign aggression, our protectors have abandoned us."
 japfor.91.a: "Oh no..."

 japfor.92.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Guarantees the Legation Cities"
 japfor.92.d: "A shocking statement has come from [FROM.GetNameDef]. Supposedly concerned by 'aggressive actions' towards [LEC.GetNameDef], the [FROM.GetAdjective] foreign minister has decried our recent moves and stated that his nation's commitments towards Shanghai will not be ignored. In sheer defiance of reason, [FROM.GetNameDef] is willing to fight to defend [LEC.GetNameDef]."
 japfor.92.a: "They shall have their war."

 japfor.112.t: "Report From the Far East"
 japfor.112.d: "Our secret service reports that Japan plans to invade Russia in order to gain control over Siberia. Russia is hardly our ally and Japan has been threatening us for years, so despite this being a flagrant violation of international law, it might be best to not take action here."
 japfor.112.a: "Hm? What secret service report? I heard nothing about a war..."
 japfor.112.b: "Just sent them a strongly worded letter, they'll ignore it for sure."

 japfor.113.t: "A Strongly Worded Letter From Germany"
 japfor.113.d: "We have just received a strongly worded letter from Germany reminding us of how illegal what we are about to do is, how this could lead to loss of life and how Germany would be very displeased if we went to war with Russia."
 japfor.113.a: "It's almost like they want us to go to war."

 japfor.114.t: "Operation Kuma"
 japfor.114.d: "Our troops are decisively positioned along the borders of our allies with Russia, and stand ready to invade. We should begin by bringing the Russian Pacific coast under our control, while simultaneously pushing toward Yakutsk and Novosibirsk."
 japfor.114.a: "Onwards!"

 japfor.176.t: "Japanese Demands"
 japfor.176.d: "The Japanese consulate came to us this morning with a simple demand - hand over the East Indies or face the consequences. There is no way for us to face their fleets on our own, what can we possibly do?"
 japfor.176.a: "Beg the Kaiser to help us!"
 japfor.176.b: "Comply with their demands!"
 japfor.176.c: "Ignore the demands! We can take them on!"

 japfor.177.t: "The Netherlands Beg for Help!"
 japfor.177.d: "Last week the Japanese have demanded Holland to give them the East Indies. The Dutch have come begging to us to protect them from the Japanese aggression. Should the Japanese get what they want they would be dangerously close to our holdings in Malaya and Papua new Guinea. What should we do?"
 japfor.177.a: "We stand with our Dutch brethren!"
 japfor.177.b: "We can't afford to antagonise the Japanese."

 japfor.178.t: "Germany Backs the Netherlands!"

 japfor.178.b: "Back down for now."

 japfor.179.t: "The Japanese Back Down!"
 japfor.179.d: "After facing the threat of war with the German Empire the cowardly Japanese backed down with their demands. This is a glorious victory for all of the Reichspakt!"
 japfor.179.a: "Hurrah!"

 japfor.180.t: "The Germans Refuse!"
 japfor.180.d: "Despite our desperate calls for help the Germans have refused to protect us from Japan. We now stand alone against the might of the Japanese empire. What should we do?"
 japfor.180.a: "We must surrender."
 japfor.180.b: "We must fight!"

 japfor.181.t: "The Dutch Fold!"
 japfor.181.d: "The pitiful Dutch have folded in the face of our glorious armies and surrendered to our demands! Insulindia is now under our full control, and the transfer of the colonial regime has started."
 japfor.181.a: "Banzai!"

 japfor.182.t: "The Dutch Resist!"
 japfor.182.d: "The insolent Dutch have refused our demands, and are now preparing to face our mighty armies alone! We must send forth our navies and put them back in their place!"
 japfor.182.a: "They won't be saying much after this...!"
 japfor.182.b: "Actually, going to war wasn't our intention..."

 japfor.183.t: "The Japanese Back Down!"
 japfor.183.d: "A miracle has happened! The Japanese, startled by our adamant refusal have decided to withdraw their demands and leave us alone! This is cause for celebration!"
 japfor.183.a: "Hurrah!"

 japfor.184.t: "The Fall of Insulindia"
 japfor.184.d: "The Japanese occupy the majority of our colonies in the East Indies and our colonial garrison is defeated. We can't hope to win against the Japanese navy and victory seems impossible. Some in our diplomatic corps have suggested we draft a peace treaty and surrender to the Japanese."
 japfor.184.a: "We cannot win..."
 japfor.184.b: "Victory is within our reach!"

 japfor.185.t: "The Dutch Beg for Peace!"
 japfor.185.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Dutch come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of their colonial possessions in Insulindia in return. How should we respond?"
 japfor.185.a: "Very good! A great victory!"
 japfor.185.b: "No peace until we march in Amsterdam!"

 japfor.186.t: "The Japanese Refuse!"
 japfor.186.d: "The Japanese refused to sign a peace treaty and have made it clear their goal is total victory! We are doomed!"
 japfor.186.a: "Damn it!"

 japfor.187.t: "Japanese Victory"
 japfor.187.d: "The Japanese defeated our colonial garrison and now occupy both our and the Dutch colonies. While we can potentially fight them off, doing so would be very costly and would require diversion of war assets. We can offer them some land in return for peace."
 japfor.187.a: "Draft a peace treaty."
 japfor.187.b: "We can fight them off."

 japfor.188.t: "The Germans Beg for Peace!"
 japfor.188.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Germans come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of the Dutch colonial possessions in Insulindia and some of their own in return. How should we respond?"
 japfor.188.a: "Very good! A great victory!"
 japfor.188.b: "We can accept only total surrender!"

 japfor.189.t: "The Japanese Refuse!"
 japfor.189.d: "The Japanese refused to sign a peace treaty and have made it clear their goal is total victory!"
 japfor.189.a: "Damn it!"

 japfor.190.t: "The Japanese Demands"
 japfor.190.d: "We have received a message from the Japanese demanding our full surrender to their armed forces and transfer of administration of our territories to their military high command. We've received reports their navy is being deployed to our shores. There is no way we can fight them off on our own, what should we do?"

 japfor.191.t: "Insulindia Begs for Help!"
 japfor.191.d: "Last week the Japanese have demanded Insulindia to fully capitulate to them in formal annexation. The Insulindians have come begging to us to protect them from the Japanese aggression. Should the Japanese get what they want they would be dangerously close to our holdings in Malaya and Papua new Guinea. What should we do?"

 japfor.192.t: "Germany backs Insulindia"
 japfor.192.d: "The cowardly Insulindians have run to the Germans for protection and they are now part of their alliance. This insolence cannot go unpunished!"

 japfor.195.t: "The Insulindians fold!"
 japfor.195.d: "The pitiful Insulindians have folded in the face of our glorious armies and surrendered to our demands! Insulindia is now under our full control, and the transfer of the local administration has begun."

 japfor.196.t: "The Insulindians Resist!"
 japfor.196.d: "The insolent Insulindians have refused our demands, and are now preparing to face our mighty armies alone! We must send forth our navies and put them back in their place!"
 japfor.196.a: "Destroy them!"

 japfor.199.t: "Japanese Victory"
 japfor.199.d: "The Japanese defeated both our colonial garrison and the Insulindian armies and now occupy our lands. While we can potentially fight them off, doing so would be very costly and would require diversion of war assets. We can offer them some land in return for peace."

 japfor.200.t: "The Germans Beg for Peace!"
 japfor.200.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Germans come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of Insulindia and some of their own colonies in return. How should we respond?"

 japfor.202.t: "The Fengtian Silver Crisis"
 japfor.202.d: "When the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, two of the largest in our country, requested payment on their loans in quick succession, Fengtian's Central Bank defaulted due to a sudden and supposedly inexplicably insufficient silver reserve. Whether this was merely gross incompetence and mismanagement, or something more sinister, is unclear, but there is little doubt that the Fengtian Government finds itself in a dire economic situation and has requested our help.\n\nWhile our influence will ensure that both Mitsui and the Bank of Japan are paid what they are due before anything else, a failing Fengtian Government would severely upset their claims to legitimacy and our claims to benevolence. We have the option of bailing them out."
 japfor.202.a: "We have no choice."
 japfor.202.b: "This is of their own making."

 japfor.203.t: "Fengtian Blames Us for the Silver Crisis!"
 japfor.203.d: "Fengtian has loudly denounced our government, citing what they say is a deliberate plot to destabilise their government through the eruption of their recent Silver Crisis, citing the incidental requests from both the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank for repayment on loans backed by Fengtian's silver reserve. With the reserve apparently containing far less than the Fengtian government claimed, its economy has spiralled out of control as the government loses credibility by the hour, and it seems likely that this crass and foolish attempt to deflect blame is mostly a reaction to their internal political situation.\n\nAll the same, we can deny these ridiculous assertions, but can we also let this grave insolence go unpunished?"
 japfor.203.a: "False accusations!"
 japfor.203.b: "Punish this insolence!"

 japfor.204.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Expels our Military Mission"
 japfor.204.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving them twenty four hours to leave the country, taking with them all equipment and other property. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity. Fengtian's ambassador has also spent the last several hours attempting to convince the Foreign Ministry, in private, that this was merely a necessity of internal politics, and that no ill-will is intended toward Japan.\n\nWhile this may, or may not, be the case, there is little question as to whether this reduces our influence over Fengtian. Who is to say what the Chinese will do next?"
 japfor.204.d_mantetsu: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving its officers twenty four hours to leave the country. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity.\n\nFortunately, our control over Fengtian via Mantetsu is extensive, and we can almost certainly force their government to reverse its decision. This may force the more patriotic and militaristic elements of the government to independently declare war, and the consequences of such a situation should also be considered."
 japfor.204.a: "Declare war."
 japfor.204.b: "Force Fengtian to reconsider."
 japfor.204.c: "Punish Fengtian."
 japfor.204.e: "Do nothing."

 japfor.205.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Expels our Military Mission"
 japfor.205.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving its officers twenty four hours to leave the country. This not only severely threatens to upset our control over the Fengtian Government, but also potentially exposes Korea and thereby Japan to attack. This is thoroughly unacceptable, both to our generals, and to the Japanese sense of honour. Surely such an act of ungrateful insubordination must be met with an appropriate response?"
 japfor.205.a: "Send an Ultimatum."
 japfor.205.b: "Do nothing."

 japfor.206.t: "Fengtian Denounces Us!"
 japfor.206.d: "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as "Anshan Iron and Steel", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. Now that the company wants to expand, it has apparently begun digging without a permit, destroying farmland in the process, and triggering protests by the native Chinese. These protests escalated into violence, and lead to some regrettable actions by our local garrison and the loss of life on the protesters' side.\n\nThe Fengtian Government has released a long-winded and not at all atypical denouncement of our actions. How should we respond?"
 japfor.206.a: "Punish this insolence!"
 japfor.206.b: "Denounce Fengtian."
 japfor.206.c: "Stay silent."

 japfor.213.t: "We Are Beaten"
 japfor.213.d: "Despite our great armies and the courage of our men, Japanese troops are now bearing down on the Russian heartland. Perhaps it is time to do the unthinkable, and offer them peace."
 japfor.213.a: "Send them an offer."
 japfor.213.b: "We shall never surrender!"

 japfor.214.t: "Russia Offers Peace"
 japfor.214.d: "Russia has offered us Siberia in return for peace, it is a generous offer indeed, do we accept?"
 japfor.214.a: "Enough of this war. We accept!"
 japfor.214.b: "Nothing but total victory!"

 japfor.215.t: "The Philippines Have Accepted Our Offer"
 japfor.215.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join us, they wisely saw that resistance would be futile and instead opted to become our ally."
 japfor.215.a: "That is good to hear."

 japfor.216.t: "The Philippines Have Joined the Entente"
 japfor.216.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join the Entente; they have snubbed out offer of friendship. This must not go unpunished, but the Entente is strong, so we must bid our time."
 japfor.216.a: "Soon, soon."

 japfor.217.t: "The Philippines Have Joined the Reichspakt"
 japfor.217.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join the Reichspakt; they have snubbed out offer of friendship. This must not go unpunished, but the Reichspakt is strong, so we must bid our time."
 japfor.217.a: "Soon, soon."

 japfor.218.t: "Hawaii Has Accepted Our Offer"
 japfor.218.d: "Hawaii has chosen to join us, they wisely saw that resistance would be futile and instead opted to become our ally."
 japfor.218.a: "That is good to hear."

 japfor.225.t: "United States in disarray"
 japfor.225.d: "The civil war has erupted in the United States, tearing apart the last shreds of unity in the Union. This presents us with a chance to remove the American presence from the central Pacific by occupying the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop us at this point."
 japfor.225.a: "Seize Guam... and claim even more!"
 japfor.225.b: "Seize Guam."
 japfor.225.c: "Best to leave it, I think."

 japfor.226.t: "Japan Seizes Guam"
 japfor.226.d: "With America in turmoil, Japan has moved onto the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop Japan at this point."
 japfor.226.a: "Too bad."

 japfor.227.t: "Japan Seizes Motor Companies"
 japfor.227.d: "With the nation in turmoil, Japan has seized control of several American motor companies operating there. The civil war has caused many of the companies to lose contact with their parent companies and they have been struggling to get parts for their assembly lines. This is made it rather easy for the Japanese to seize control of them under the pretence of 'assistance'. While this is clearly an illegal act, we are in no position to do anything more than send a strongly worded letter to them."
 japfor.227.a: "Strongly worded indeed!"

 japfor.230.t: "Japan Asks for Peace"
 japfor.230.d: "After getting pushed out of Dalian, Pyongyang and Seoul, and with their army routed, the cowardly Japanese nation has contacted us asking for peace. All they are capable of now is attempting to blockade the whole east coast with their navy - not an easy task. Seeing their limited potential for success, Japanese public opinion, pushed on by the failures of the army, is pressing the government to sign a peace, and bring what remains of their army back home. Considering our naval inferiority, it would be wise for us to accept Japan’s terms."
 japfor.230.a: "Let those Wō keep their pathetic Home Islands."
 japfor.230.b: "We will only accept unconditional surrender, Iaponia delenda est."

 japfor.231.t.peace: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Peace"
 japfor.231.d.peace: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our peace offer. While we have accepted are humiliating terms for our nation, at least we won’t suffer total defeat. This will allow us to save our army from total annihilation, and this is our only way to prevent more of the youth of the nation being sent to the butcher. Also this means that, if in the future an enemy nation will attempt to attack Japan, we will be able to more effectively defend ourselves and our coasts."
 japfor.231.t.no_peace: "Peace Talks Rejected"
 japfor.231.d.no_peace: "Apparently, China hates us so much that they aren't willing to negotiate with us. Despite suffering major defeats on land, we will have to try and win in China. This means total war will take place in East Asia, and it seems it won’t be an easy, nor a short, war."
 japfor.231.a: "Any other option would have meant total massacre."
 japfor.231.b: "It seems it's live or die, then."

 japfor.232.t: "End of the Second Sino-Japanese War."
 japfor.232.d: "The war of 1894-1895 had been a humiliating defeat for our nation. Now, the Japanese aggressors have finally been driven out, and we have finally avenged our fallen brothers in the First Sino-Japanese war. No more we shall allow foreign imperialist powers to meddle in the affairs of our proud nation, no more China shall be subjugated, for we will be the masters of our own destiny!"
 japfor.232.a: "Wansui!"

 japfor.233.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 japfor.233.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our peace offer. They will not be able to menace our coasts, since the Chinese lack a navy worthy of that name. However, facing the Chinese in a land battle will be no easy task, considering our previous tremendous defeat on the mainland. Winning this war will be hard for us."
 japfor.233.a: "We will have to fight until the last man."

 japfor.238.t: "Japan Offers Peace"
 japfor.238.d: "After being completely humiliated by the Russian army, Japan has offered a conditional surrender, offering full retreat from the rightfully Russian regions they have illegally occupied. Their navy can do nothing besides blockading our ports on the Pacific coast, and their army has been almost entirely destroyed. Most military leaders and ministers say we should accept their conditional surrender, while a minority suggests we should push for a total victory, considering our industrial superiority over the Japanese."
 japfor.238.a: "We accept their terms, Mukden has been avenged."
 japfor.238.b: "We won’t be satisfied until our army will march in the ruins of Tokyo."

 japfor.239.t: "Russia Accepts Peace"
 japfor.239.d: "The Russian Bear has accepted our conditional surrender, allowing us to retreat our army from mainland Asia back to the safety of the Home Islands. While this is a humiliating defeat, at least it wasn’t a total one. Our independence from the European imperialists has been maintained."
 japfor.239.a: "At least our boys are safe back home."

 japfor.240.t: "Peace with the Empire of the Fading Sun"
 japfor.240.d: "The coward Japanese nation has been humiliated, and the Sun is fading in the East. The Samurai fell to the ground under the pressure of steel and fire unleashed by our army. Our proud soldiers were able to kick the Japanese occupiers back to their pathetic \"Home Islands\", freeing thousands of Russian people that will now be able to reunite to the Motherland. Long live Russia, one and indivisible."
 japfor.240.a: "Hooray!"

 japfor.241.t: "Russia Refuses Peace"
 japfor.241.d: "The Russian Bear has refused our conditional surrender, citing that they \"will not allow an enemy they humiliated on the battlefield dictate the peace terms\". While we have been defeated on land, we will be able to give them hell on the seas, and on the Home Islands if it comes to it. Just like we repelled the Mongol invaders 800 years ago, we shall repel the Russian invaders in the same way."
 japfor.241.a: "We shall fight until the last man! Banzai!"

 japfor.251.t: "Japan Collapses"
 japfor.251.d: "Not so long ago, the Japanese Empire seemed invincible, a vigorous nation with limitless ambition, destined to break the back of Western imperialism in Asia. No longer. With the surrender of Japanese high command, and despite some units desperately fighting on across Asia, the [JAP.GetFactionName] has finally collapsed around us. Now we must fight on alone; our desinty our own to choose."
 japfor.251.a: "I thought they were stronger than that..."

 japfor.252.t: "Collapse of the Japanese Empire"
 japfor.252.d: "An unprecedented rising Asian powerhouse, the Empire of Japan, announced that they had formally surrendered all their forces on the Home Islands regarding their recent capitulation. The stubborn and warlike people of Japan are not accustomed to submitting yet faced with annihilation; they have undoubtedly decided to spare their country from further destruction. Once regarded as the premier industrial nation in the Pacific with one of the world's most modern navies and armies to boast, the Japanese defeat led to their sphere's ultimate dissolution. In the face of such an overwhelming defeat, the various members of the Co-Prosperity lay scattered and adrift - perhaps prone to foreign aggression. One thing remains certain, however, and that is that the rising sun has finally faded, and with it, new powers in Asia may soon take its place."
 japfor.252.a: "The Sun has faded."

 #japfor.230.t: "The Fading Sun"
 #japfor.230.d: "This is a dark day for the Empire of the Sun. Enemy forces have ousted our men from their vital bases in Manchuria and Korea; even our most optimistic generals believe there is little chance of counter attack. If we offer terms, perhaps we may keep the Home Islands intact and keep the Emperor safe. Our top diplomats say, a two week conference in Port Arthur may be enough to broker a deal, but it is far from certain. Should we offer everything to keep our homes safe?"
 #japfor.230.a: "We yield only because we have no choice."
 #japfor.230.b: "Japan will never surrender!"

 #japfor.231.t: "The Fading Sun"
 #japfor.231.d: "After the utter defeat of the Imperial Japanese Army, our forces control huge swathes of land in Manchuria and Korea whilst the Imperial Japanese Navy are reduced to attempting mere blockades. Our spies in Tokyo report severe dissent and war weariness among the populace. In light of this, the government has called a two week conference in Port Arthur to determine our war aims."
 #japfor.231.a: "We will accept their terms. Let them keep their pathetic 'Home Islands'."
 #japfor.231.b: "Rubbish, we push for total victory!"

 #japfor.232.t: "Our Terms Are Answered"
 #japfor.232.d: "Thankfully, our terms were accepted. While we have lost much, it is not the end for us yet. Praise the Emperor, even in these dark times."
 #japfor.232.a: "Peace at last."
 #japfor.232.b: "The war must go on."

 #japfor.233.t: "Peace With the Empire of the Fading Sun"
 #japfor.233.d: "The two week conference in [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has ended in agreements; the terms Japan offered were accepted and peace has been achieved. We have gained much and this is nothing less than a great victory."
 #japfor.233.a: "We fought well and deserve nothing less."

 #japfor.234.t: "War With the Empire of the Fading Sun"
 #japfor.234.d: "The two week conference in [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has ended in nothing; this war will be a total war. If we pushed the Japanese out of Manchuria and Korea we can surely push them out of the Home Islands."
 #japfor.234.a: "It'll be the same again I'm sure..."

 #japfor.235.t: "Japan has Surrendered!"
 #japfor.235.d: "Under assault from all sides, [JAP.GetNameDef] has signed a peace treaty after a two-week conference in [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], preserving the Home Islands from enduring invasion... but also casting [Root.GetNameDef] to the winds. The Japanese alliance has crumbled, and now we must fight on ourselves."
 #japfor.235.a: "I thought they were stronger than that..."

 #japfor.237.t: "The Imperial Japanese Navy Seizes the Moment"
 #japfor.237.d: "Due to the army's capitulation on the mainland, the IJN has been quick to assert its greatly increased relevance to the defence of the Home Islands. Army generals and their associates in the War Ministry have raised quite a fuss, but few disagree that the navy must stand guard as Japan rebuilds. It seems certain that they will receive a greater share of Japan's national resources than they might have previously."
 #japfor.237.a: "The navy must become an impenetrable shield!"

# Involving Anqing #

 #japfor.250.d: "The Anqing Clique, which recently emerged victorious against the League due to our help, has requested our support. If we invest significant capital and aid them in reconstruction on a massive scale, they believe that an attack on Beijing is possible relatively soon. The Fengtian government agrees with Anqing and has thus relayed this request to us. What will we do?"

 #japfor.251.d: "The Fengtian government has decided that the value of the Anqing Clique is too great to waste immediately and so has decided that it is better to delay their Reclamation War in order to allow Anqing to recover on its own. This is most likely a wise decision, as it will allow both governments to become more stable."
 #japfor.251.a: "Good"
 #
 #japfor.252.t: "Fengtian Wants to Strike Soon"
 #japfor.252.d: "The Fengtian government believes that the Beijing government is currently incredibly weak. Having the Anqing Clique on their side, even if they are in a tough position due to the recent League War, is an advantage they think should be used immediately. However, they have come to the conclusion that such a swift attack would be suicide if we do not stand behind their decision. Their operation is risky, but could potentially bring much of China under our influence in a matter of months..."
 #japfor.252.a: "Back them!"
 #japfor.252.b: "This is too risky."
 #
 #japfor.253.t: "Fengtian Prepares Fast Strike"
 #japfor.253.d: "After receiving our approval, Fengtian relayed its message to Anqing. While their leader, Chen Tiaoyuan, was sceptical to back such a quick attack considering the high stakes, he has now agreed. Fengtian will begin preparations to strike at Beijing within months."
 #japfor.253.a: "It will begin soon."
 #
 #japfor.254.t: "Fengtian Doesn't Change Strategy"
 #japfor.254.d: "Due to disagreements with us and with Anqing, the Fengtian government has not been able to determine a better strategy. So instead, they have chosen to stick to their existing timetable and hope that Anqing joins when the war starts."
 #japfor.254.a: "So be it."
 #
 #japfor.255.t: "Anqing Begins Reconstruction"
 #japfor.255.d: "With our assistance, Anqing has started to reconstruct their territory and deal with the devastation the League War caused. Telegraph cables are to be repaired, houses rebuild and roads cleared."
 #japfor.255.a: "Good."
 #
 #japfor.256.t: "Fengtian Abandons Strategy"
 #japfor.256.d: "The Fengtian government has abandoned its strategy, deciding it can no longer wait and has come to the defence of Shanxi. This means that its commitment to Anqing is void."
 #japfor.256.a: "Unexpected."

 japfor.257.t: "Anqing and Fengtian Ask Our Help"
 japfor.257.d: "The Anqing Clique, which recently emerged victorious against the League due to our help, has requested our help. The Fengtian government has committed to aid Anqing in its reconstruction, hoping that it will convince them to participate in the Reclamation War to retake Beijing. If we commit as well, this will surely improve their odds."
 japfor.257.a: "We'll commit resources."
 japfor.257.b: "This isn't worth it."

 japfor.258.t: "Anqing Begins Reconstruction"
 japfor.258.d: "With our assistance, Anqing has started reconstruction."
 japfor.258.a: "Good."

 japfor.259.t: "Anqing Abandons Reclamation"
 japfor.259.d: "Anqing has broken away from the reclamation project, and Fengtian has drawn a line in the sand. We have had to stop sending them aid for their reconstruction."
 japfor.259.a: "So be it."

 japfor.260.t: "Anqing Abandons Reclamation"
 japfor.260.d: "Anqing has broken away from the reclamation project, but Fengtian decided not to remove them from reconstruction, things seem like they are able to go on regardless."
 japfor.260.a: "That's good to hear."

 japfor.261.t: "Anqing Abandons Reclamation"
 japfor.261.d: "Anqing has broken away from the reclamation project, and while Fengtian decided not to remove them from reconstruction, Anqing broke away of their own accord regardless."
 japfor.261.a: "Well that was pointless."

### New Foreign Policy Events ###

 japfor.316.t: "Japanese on the Move in the Pacific"
 japfor.316.d: "The Japanese ambassador calmly came into [Root.GetLeader]'s office holding a telegram. A Japanese fleet has been dispatched to Hawaii, and within a few hours will be landing to set up a 'safety cordon'.  He has stated that it is in the best interests of the people of the Pacific that the chaos engulfing America not spread outside of its borders, and that the Japanese will be taking the initiative to bring stability and peace. He says that he hopes America will cooperate in the best interests of peace across the ocean, and invites us to send representatives to ensure a peaceful transition of power. This blatant power-grab has not gone unnoticed, but with America's current turmoil our leading officers question the Honolulu garrison's ability to hold of the invasion force. Hawks in cabinet insist the civil war will be short and that our men can hold out until reinforcements arrive. And that the Japanese would likely back down in face of American confidence. Others have called for calm, and are hoping to persuade [Root.GetLeader] to hold off on revenge till after America is stabilized. It is now up to the President to decide whether or not to instruct our Pacific garrisons to stand down or not. It is clear his decision may very well affect the future of the waters"
 japfor.316.a: "We will return..."
 japfor.316.b: "All hands, man your battlestations!"

 japfor.317.t: "The Americans Surrender the Pacific"
 japfor.317.d: "Victory in the Pacific! The American government, currently embroiled in political turmoil and lacking the political will to enforce it's hold on the Pacific Ocean has decided to accept our dominion and turn over control of their island bases. While some in America have called betrayal, their voices have so far been drowned out by the realities on the ground. A delegation has been sent to meet with American officials in Honolulu to secure a peaceful transfer of power and our troops landed without a shot fired. While the Americans insist that this is a "temporary" measure, this is no doubt a tremendous victory for us in our quest for a greater sphere of influence. However, some in our government have quietly wondered if this is a step too far. What if we've overstretched? And what if the Americans come back for revenge? There's no time for that defeatism now however, Japan is on the move and we will carve out our destiny in Asia!"
 japfor.317.a: "Subarashi!"

 japfor.318.t: "America Defiant!"
 japfor.318.d: "An escalating crisis in the pacific! Despite the chaos engulfing North America, their stubborn government has refused to loosen their grip on the Pacific, promising harsh retaliation for any attempt to violate their sovereignty. This arrogant, greedy attitude could only be expected of these colonizers, but it leaves us in a bind. While there is no doubt that we can seize these islands by force, some have questioned the ability of our navy to hold on to these islands for more than a few years. The United States is a force to be reckoned with, called a sleeping giant by some. But others say the Japanese spirit has always been about defying odds, whether it be bringing the Chinese dragon to heel in 1895 or banishing the Russians from Manchuria in 1905. To lose face even while the Americans are at their weakest would be tantamount to surrender, forever consigning the Japanese people to a secondary role in the Pacific. This is it then, Japan is at a crossroads - what will the land of the rising sun choose to do next?"
 japfor.318.a: "Tora! Tora! Tora!"
 japfor.318.b: "Call the Fleet Back, Patience is a Virtue"

 japfor.401.t: "An Invitation from [From.GetNameDef]"
 japfor.401.d.conf: "At the Tokyo Conference, Japanese officials brought up the notion of deeper economic ties between their nation and ours. Now they have approached the [Root.GetAdjective] government, presenting their offer to admit us into what they consider the economic part of their 'Co-Prosperity Sphere'. They say that we are free to join or refuse, as we desire."
 japfor.401.d.noconf: "The Japanese government has approached us with an offer to join the economic part of their 'Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere'. With it, we would relax the rules for Japanese investment in [Root.GetNameDef], and bring with that investment a degree of prosperity and independence from 'Western Imperialism'. Some say, however, that this would simply be exchanging Western Imperialism for Japanese Imperialism, and that we should beware opening a box we may not be able to close again."
 japfor.401.a: "We agree to their offer."
 japfor.401.b: "We've no need of this."

 japfor.402.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 japfor.402.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom and economic benefits that becoming part of our economic sphere would bring. They have agreed to our terms."
 japfor.402.a: "Excellent."

 japfor.403.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 japfor.403.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government, perhaps fearing our true motives, has declined our offer to join the Japanese economic sphere."
 japfor.403.a: "An unwise choice."

 japfor.405.t: "Increased Japanese Investment"
 japfor.405.d: "With active encouragement by the [From.GetAdjective] government, investors from [From.GetNameDef] have been arriving in [Root.GetNameDef] in droves. Their presence will have some benefits, it's true, but there is a growing fear that this domination by the [From.GetAdjective] economy will ultimately see us beholden to the [From.GetAdjective] government... if we are not already."
 japfor.405.a: "Investors means more money, right?"

 japfor.406.t: "Investors Build Factories"
 japfor.406.d: "The Japanese investors in [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy creating new factories - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, it seems."
 japfor.406.a: "That's good!"

 japfor.407.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Subservience to Japan"
 japfor.407.d: "If there were concerns about Japan's continued investment in [Root.GetNameDef] leading to their domination, they can be set aside - it has already come to pass. [Root.GetAdjective] policy is already routinely made to please Japanese interests, and any thoughts we had of our independence have slowly become a polite fiction. The arrival of several 'advisors' from [From.GetNameDef] has laid to rest any idea that we may act as we wish within the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 japfor.407.a: "So be it"

 japfor.408.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Ends Alliance"
 japfor.408.d: "Foolishly, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to end its military alliance with us. It seems they feel they can make it without our assistance."
 japfor.408.a: "We shall see."

 japfor.409.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Withdraws from Sphere"
 japfor.409.d: "Panicked by some irrational fears about us dominating it, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to end its participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, cutting the ties between the [From.GetAdjective] economy and ours."
 japfor.409.a: "How foolish."

 japfor.410.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Investments Nationalised"
 japfor.410.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has taken the drastic step of forcibly nationalising the investments we've made into [From.GetNameDef], also withdrawing their place in the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the process. Perhaps they worried about the prospect of Japanese control over their economy? If so, they have handed us the excuse to invade - if we desire to take them up on their provocation."
 japfor.410.a: "Leave them be."
 japfor.410.b: "We shall teach them a lesson!"

 japfor.411.t: "[withdraw_country.GetNameDefCap] Leaves Economic Sphere"
 japfor.411.d: "Having joined the [withdraw_country.GetFactionName], [withdraw_country.GetNameDef] can no longer be considered part of our economic sphere. They will have to go."
 japfor.411.a: "A foolish move on their part."

 japfor.412.t: "Withdrawing from the Japanese Sphere"
 japfor.412.d: "With our joining the [Root.GetFactionName], we can no longer be considered part of Japan's economic sphere."
 japfor.412.a: "So be it!"

 japfor.420.t: "Investors Build Dockyards"
 japfor.420.d: "The Japanese investors in [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy creating new dockyards - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere it seems."
 japfor.420.a: "Very nice!"

 japfor.421.t: "Japan Sends Naval Advisors"
 japfor.421.d: "As part of naval development program sponsored by Japanese Empire, group of Advisors came from Japan to aid us with our naval program. They are highly knowledgable in many aspects, so it is up to use to direct them to where would be most useful."
 japfor.421.a: "Direct them to assist our engineers."
 japfor.421.b: "We could use the help of their tactical expertise."
 japfor.421.c: "Some practical experience from training exercises would be best."

 japfor.422.t: "First Prosperity Ships"
 japfor.422.d: "The Japanese engineers which came to [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy teaching our dockyard workers how to build modern Japanese cargo ships, so called "Prosperity ships" - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere it seems."
 japfor.422.a: "Great news!"

 japfor.423.t: "Japan Wants Control of our Dockyards"
 japfor.423.d: "The Japanese army and naval official this morning officially demanded control of all dockyards built by their companies in our country. They are reasoning that during these hard wartimes, naval production must be unified under their command."
 japfor.423.a: "Very well."
 japfor.423.b: "Who do they think they are?"

 japfor.424.t: "Japan Returns Dockyards to Us"
 japfor.424.d: "As our common threat is no more there is no legal reason for Japan to have control over our dockyards any more and as such they have returned them to us."
 japfor.424.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."

 japfor.425.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Naval Advisors"
 japfor.425.d: "This morning we received request from [From.GetNameDef] to send small number of our advisors to help in their naval development."
 japfor.425.a: "A worthy request."
 japfor.425.b: "Oh, I don't think so."

 japfor.426.t: "Japan Denies Our Request"
 japfor.426.d: "Sadly Japan has denied our request to send us naval advisors."
 japfor.426.a: "A shame."

 japfor.427.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Denies Control of Dockyards"
 japfor.427.d: "In a truly audacious move, we have been denied control of the very dockyards we worked to create. While it would be diplomatically ill-advised to react straight away, we will not forget this betrayal. They will regret this."
 japfor.427.a: "So much for being allies."

 japfor.450.t: "Japan Embargoes [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 japfor.450.d: "For months we have been worried about the extent of Japanese ambitions and their aggressive moves in the South Pacific, and now we have reason to be. They have stated their intent to lead their sphere of influence to immediately end trade with [Root.GetNameDef], calling us an 'outpost of European colonialism and imperialism in Asia'. The strain this could place on our economy is not to be underestimated..."
 japfor.450.a: "We can endure this."
 japfor.450.b: "This means a trade war!"
 japfor.450.c: "We should draw closer to Japan."

 japfor.451.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Retaliates!"
 japfor.451.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has imposed tariffs back on us! This gives us precisely the casus belli we were hoping for!"
 japfor.451.a: "Yes, but not just yet..."
 japfor.451.b: "Respond with military action!"

 japfor.452.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Closer Ties"
 japfor.452.d: "In response to our embargo, the [From.GetAdjective] government has asked to become part of our economic sphere, clearly believing it is better to work with us than against us."
 japfor.452.a: "Even better!"

 japfor.453.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Does Nothing"
 japfor.453.d: "The cowardly [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to do nothing in response to our embargo. They intend to simply endure it. If we wish to draw them into a war, we will have to do it the hard way."
 japfor.453.a: "So be it!"

 japfor.454.t: "Japan is Preparing to Attack"
 japfor.454.d: "Increasingly frequent reports from Tokyo, Yokohama, and Nagasaki have begun to build a worrying picture; one of plans being laid, ships outfitted, and ammunition stocked. These are preparations for war. In a matter of weeks we may face the full force of the imperial Japanese military."
 japfor.454.a: "We have precious little time to prepare"

 japfor.455.t: "Japan Seems to Plan an Attack"
 japfor.455.d: "We have gathered intelligence suggesting Japan is seeking to take over our colony in the Dutch East Indies. Our military experts warn that we might not be able to fend off such an invasion, considering the state of the Japanese and government navies and the size of the Japanese military. They suggest that we go to the kaiser and beg him for help: their interest, maintaining the status-quo, aligns with ours and a Japanese takeover would threaten their possessions too. This might be our best shot at maintaining our colonial possession."
 japfor.455.a: "Message Berlin!"
 japfor.455.b: "Surely this isn't necessary..."

 japfor.456.t: "The Dutch Beg for Help"
 japfor.456.d: "The Dutch discovered evidence that the Japanese are planning to invade their colony; realising that they would never be able to defend their colony with their largely overextended colonial army and limited naval assets compared to Japan. They point out however, that a Japanese takeover of their colony would severely upset our own defensive situation, and there is no doubt at all that the Japanese seek to evict us from the region as well!"
 japfor.456.a: "We shall help you!"
 japfor.456.b: "Clog-wearers shouldn't have colonies anyhow..."

 japfor.457.t: "Germany Helps Out"
 japfor.457.d: "The Germans have agreed to help protect the Dutch East Indies from our joint Japanese menace that's seeking to take our colony away."
 japfor.457.a: "A toast to our friends!"

 japfor.458.t: "Germany Refuses to Protect Us!"
 japfor.458.d: "The Germans let us know that it would not be in their best interest to give their protection to our colonial possessions in the Indies. It seems we stand alone!"
 japfor.458.a: "We can defend the Indies ourselves, right?"

 japfor.459.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Stands Alone"
 japfor.459.d: "Unable or unwilling to get help, [From.GetNameDefCap] now sits alone. Their military is a fraction of the size of ours and their leaders weak; nothing shall stop us."
 japfor.459.a: "Banzai!"

 japfor.460.t: "Insulindia Resists with German backing"
 japfor.460.d: "The Germans have agreed to help protect the Dutch East Indies from us! While we still can attack, we should think carefully about if we are willing to start such a war."
 japfor.460.a: "We will not be swayed."
 japfor.460.b: "Perhaps now is not the time."

 japfor.461.t: "Japan Pursues Divide and Conquer Strategy"
 japfor.461.d: "It seems that Japan's long-standing claims to the legitimacy of our government, not to mention 'fraternal asian brotherhood', were nothing more than lip service. They are now moving towards a divide and conquer strategy for all of China. Our China. While this does signal that war with them might come sooner than we think, it has also damaged the standing of the Concordia Association, giving us more room to manoeuvre."
 japfor.461.a: "They will regret this."

 japfor.462.t: "Japan Pursues the Burn to Ash Strategy"
 japfor.462.d: "Word of abuses by Japanese troops against Chinese civilians have made their way to our ears for some time now. The Japanese Consulate in Mukden always assured us that these were exaggerated, and that where such crimes did occur they were the fault of indisciplined troops; an exception rather than the norm. However, Japan has now done the unthinkable. It has not only signalled open support for these horrific atrocities, but it has codified them as part of an official strategy. Such unparalleled barbarism cannot be tolerated, and we cannot afford to be painted guilty by association. Fortunately the pro-Japanese Concordia Association will have a hard time explaining this one away, will lose influence in our government."
 japfor.462.a: "We must seriously consider a new direction."

 japfor.463.t: "Japan Reveals its Ambitions"
 japfor.463.d: "Referencing unspecified 'recent events on the continent' as justification, the Japanese Government has announced its intent to begin a comprehensive colonial programme centred on the Northeast, and including all areas newly under Japanese administration. Soon, Sakura trees may line the Zhaode Dajie in Shenyang and Tiananmen in Beijing. Our exact position in this new order is unclear, but we will not suffer the same fate as Korea; the Japanese must go, Concordia Association and all."
 japfor.463.a: "Japan has made its choice."

 japfor.464.t: "Japan Rewards Our Loyalty"
 japfor.464.d: "In their wisdom, the Japanese government has decided to reward our loyalty, returning back to us land that is rightfully ours. While we are of course pleased at such a gesture, we must be careful; the Concordia Association has gained much support as a result, which will make it more difficult for us to oppose Japan in the future, should we wish to."
 japfor.464.a: "That land should have been ours in the first place."

 japfor.465.t: "The Enemy Has Overwhelming Force"
 japfor.465.d: "By now it is become common knowledge that our enemies force far outnumber ours. What began as rumours from our intelligence service has now ended up coming true. While we will do what we can to keep public moral up, even our most steadfast supports are starting to question if continuing the fight is worth it; are we just prolonging the inevitable at this point?"
 japfor.465.a: "There must be time to turn it around..."

 japfor.466.t: "We Have Overwhelming Force"
 japfor.466.d: "It has become increasingly clear to both us and Japan that our forces far outnumber theirs. As news of this has trickled down to the Japanese general public there is increasing unrest and support for their government is falling. If we maintain this advantage they will surely capitulate even sooner than we had hoped."
 japfor.466.a: "What excellent news!"

### Korea Events ###
 japfor.500.t: "Kitei Son and Nan Shoryu"
 japfor.500.d: "The 1936 Olympic games have come and gone, and we have reason to be proud. Our athletes have won us nine medals, setting a new national record, yet some of our victors have been... problematic. The athletes Kitei Son and Nan Shoryu - or as they prefer to be called, Sohn Kee-Chung and Nam Sung-Yong - did well in the marathon race, the former even winning 1st place, but they have overall failed to show enthusiasm proper for subjects of the Emperor. Between dropping their heads during the national anthem, hiding the flag on their chest, and insisting on being called Korean over Japanese, many within our country have been ashamed of their behaviour, in contrast to the popular attitude within Chōsen, largely supportive of their actions. As a result, the athletes have been banned by the central government from participation in future events as well as placed under surveillance. It would be a shame if their victory was used to promote instability within the empire.\n\nThe Foreign Office has also attempted to ensure sympathy abroad remains minimal by lodging a complaint with the Irish government and International Olympic Committee over a perceived lack of care towards ensuring that our athletes properly represent the empire. They have not yet responded."
 japfor.500.a: "How unfortuante"

 japfor.501.t: "The Legacy of the Korean Rebellion of 1925"
 japfor.501.d: "Due to the disastrous economic situation and ongoing instability, Korea rebelled against our government. Luckily, the rebellion was successfully suppressed and the dissidents were executed. However, because of recent political changes, minor students protests appeared in many parts of Korea. Suppressing them in time should nip the problem in the bud, but it may also have larger repercussions."
 japfor.501.a: "Launch a crackdown immediately!"

 japfor.67.t: "Wartime Unrest in Korea"
 japfor.67.d: "It appears that Japanisation efforts in Chōsen have not nearly been as successfully as hoped for by the government. With the outbreak of war, years of social and economic discontent towards Japanese authorities have begun boiling to the surface, resulting in greater reports of sabotage, noncompliance, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour from our Korean subjects. In due time, colonial officials are confident that the situation can be brought fully under control, but until that time comes, Chōsen may not be as stable as we hope."
 japfor.67.a: "Bolster the Chōsen Garrison!"

 japfor.510.t: "The Busan Negotiations"
 japfor.510.d: "As the liberalisation of our government was completed, the Koreans also demand reforms on their current situation. Korean leaders and social elites have proposed a possible meeting at Busan to negotiate about the future of Korea in the Japanese Empire."
 japfor.510.a: "Accept the proposal, let's see what they have to offer"
 japfor.510.b: "Arienai!"

 japfor.511.t: "Japanisation Policies"
 japfor.511.d: "Currently we are applying a Japanisation policy on our subjects in the Korean peninsula, hoping to integrate them one day into Japanese society. The Koreans are demanding to abolish that policy and recognise the Korean culture."
 japfor.511.a: "Recognise Korean culture"
 japfor.511.b: "Insist on Japanisation efforts"

 japfor.512.t: "Status of Korea in the Empire"
 japfor.512.d: "Korea is now a semi-autonomous region in the empire, it is neither a fully autonomous subject like the Fengtian government, but is has its own governor-general. What place will Korea have in Japan in the future?"
 japfor.512.a: "Incorporate it into the empire"
 japfor.512.b: "Retain its colonial status"

 japfor.513.t: "Governor-general of Korea"
 japfor.513.d: "Every governor-general of Korea has been Japanese since the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910. The Koreans are demanding their own Korean governor-general. This will probably make ruling over them easier, but it is not a small compromise..."
 japfor.513.a: "Choose a Korean governor"
 japfor.513.b: "Choose a Japanese governor"

 japfor.514.t: "Koreans Serving in the Government?"
 japfor.514.d: "As assimilating the Koreans into proper Japanese people has been designated as our main long-term goal, should we allow the Koreans to serve in local governments to ensure equality between the Japanese and the Koreans?"
 japfor.514.a: "Allow the Koreans to serve in civil services"
 japfor.514.b: "They are second-class citizens!"

 japfor.515.t: "Democracy in Korea?"
 japfor.515.d: "As democracy holds firm in mainland Japan, our Korean subjects are demanding the same democratic rights. Should we allow partial suffrage in Korea?"
 japfor.515.a: "Allow partial suffrage"
 japfor.515.b: "They are second-class citizens!"

 japfor.516.t: "Fate of the Political Prisoners"
 japfor.516.d: "Ever since the Japanese annexation of Korea, we have arrested many Korean independence movement leaders. Now the Koreans are negotiating for their release. Allowing them to go back to Korea may cause some potential threats against our rule in Korea, but it will make the Koreans satisfied."
 japfor.516.a: "Release the political prisoners"
 japfor.516.b: "They should stay locked up!"

 japfor.517.t: "Busan Negotiations Successful!"
 japfor.517.d: "The conference held between Japanese authorities and Korean leaders was successful. Chōsen has been bestowed a generous amount of autonomy, and though not all the residents there are satisfied with our reforms, it will be at least sufficient in the short term to quell unrest."
 japfor.517.a: "Splendid."

 japfor.518.t: "Busan Negotiations Failed!"
 japfor.518.d: "The conference held between the Japanese authority and the Korean leaders has ended in complete and utter failure! Korean leaders have stormed out of the conference, angrily declaring the Japanese delegates wholly unreasonable! We can only wonder where it all went wrong..."
 japfor.518.a: "How insolent of them!"

### Sino - Japanese War Events ###
 japfor.600.t: "The Japanese Descend Upon China"
 japfor.600.d: "That which we have long feared has finally come. Long have the Japanese greedily eyed our vast land, taking advantage of our natural resources and divided national unity. Now they are here in full force, this invasion will test our mettle and bravery, and we shall not falter. The Japanese are despicable barbarians. Already reports have reached us of unspeakable crimes and one can only imagine the fate of their countrymen at the hands of the loathsome pirates. The Western Powers, preoccupied with the events in Europe and America have abandoned us to our fate.\n\nAnd while we are in danger, has China not resisted and fought back against invaders for centuries? Our civilisation dates back 4,000 years - a testament to our glorious will and determination. We will resist their invasion with the greatest of tenacity and drive the Japanese back to their islands. Qilái! No longer shall we be divided and slaves to the Japanese dogs, now is not the time!"
 japfor.600.a: "United we stand, Divided we fall."

 japfor.601.t: "The Chinese Resist our Glorious Advance "
 japfor.601.d: "Thanks to the skilful strategic operations of the Imperial forces and the efforts of all the men, Japan has won continued victories. With each day, the Chinese armies disintegrate and break and victory is only a matter of when.\n\nThe Chinese however are offering considerable resistance to our liberation. They do not understand our true intentions of peace and our desire for a united Asian front against German imperialism. There are even rumours that should our advance push significantly far enough into the Chinese interior - the Chinese will even destroy the Yellow river embankments sacrificing the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent fellow-nationals. Such an outrageous and cruel act will never be permitted by man or Heaven.\n\nNonetheless one must not doubt the strength and determination of His Imperial Majesty’s Army! It is an honour to die for His Majesty as we complete Japan’s true destiny - to bring all of Asia under one roof."
 japfor.601.a: "Tennōheika Banzai!"

 japfor.602.t: "War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression"
 japfor.602.d: "China faces her greatest national peril and yet for each inch of Chinese land that is lost, the urgent call to action comes forth! Our troops fight back valiantly without outdated weaponry and we are abandoned by the imperialist powers - yet with each day the Japanese war machine suffers; unable to break our indomitable spirit. Soldiers and citizens, warlords and republicans, landlords and peasants - put away your squabbling for now is the time for unity! Greedy barbarians will always envy our beautiful country but they shall not have it. We will triumph over them, let the Chinese people be united in their fight against the bandits - the Chinese people will finally be emancipated from imperialism!"
 japfor.602.a: "We shall fight to the death! Wansui!"

 japfor.603.t: "The War in China"
 japfor.603.d: "As the war in China has escalated, our valiant troops have found themselves at a certain disadvantage despite their outstanding equipment and training. Our commanders in the field have already begun to bicker and quarrel, undertaking their own divergent initiatives, which the government in Tokyo and sometimes even Imperial Headquarters cannot constrain. On top of this the long-standing Army-Navy rivalry has already spilled over into the Chinese War, as the navy refuses to ship equipment, or even throws it overboard at ports, leaving it for the army to fish out of the water.\n\nNow that we are set to push further into China, our supply lines winding along muddy footpaths and through treacherous mountain passes, this problem can only worsen. We must strive to resolve internal conflicts, and optimize our means of war, or else risk defeat in the face of an inferior enemy."
 japfor.603.a: "Shō ga nai..."

 japfor.470.t: "The Great Pacific War"
 japfor.470.d: "Ever since the Second American Civil War, the Empire of Japan stood virtually unopposed in the Pacific, with many predicting that it would become the foremost power in the region, eclipsing its American and German rivals in influence. Rebuilding its military and industrial might after the civil war, the American government set its sight on the Pacific again, openly challenging Japan's dominance — with reports of naval engagements between the two great powers. \n\nDespite Japan's resounding successes across the Pacific, it now faces its most significant challenge yet, as the industrial juggernaut of America shakes off the rubble of the Civil War and its war machine comes to life again."
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_JAP: "The sun shall not set upon us!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_JAP_allies: "May we prevail, and quickly!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_USA: "In a moment of weakness we stumbled, but will not falter!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_USA_allies: "We stand with the eagle!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_GER: "It seems that Japan has overstepped its bounds for the last time."
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_INT: "The imperialists scuffle amongst themselves!"
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_neutralasia: "The balance of power will be settled one way or the other."
 worldnews_japan_vs_america_generic: "Can the juggernaut stand up to Japan's dominance?"

### Fengtian Events ###
 japfeng.1.t: "Our Influence In Manchuria"
 japfeng.1.d: "For many years now we have worked to gain control of Manchuria, and in the long-run all of China, by means of a group of Pan-Asian interests known as the Concordia Association. This is a political party that seeks to promote pro-Japanese views in [FNG.GetNameDef] and keep [FNG.GetLeader] subservient. In the long-run, its goals are to extend Japanese economic control over Manchuria further in partnership with Mantetsu, and slowly bring China proper into our orbit too.\n\nStanding apart from the politics of Manchuria's civilian authorities is our own military, the notoriously ambitious Kwantung Army. For decades now the army has sought to conquer and annex Manchuria, and their preferred methods and patience for working with the likes of [FNG.GetLeader] are infamously brutal and low respectively.\n\nRecently the government's policy aims have changed, the war situation we find ourselves facing makes the political independence of [FNG.GetNameDef] less and less suitable as certain allies become more valuable.\n\nWe face a choice: do we trust in the Concordia Association and the soft power they have steadily built up, or will we let the army off its leash and bring Zhang down by any means necessary?"
 japfeng.1.a: "If the bird will not sing..."

 japfeng.2.t: "A Sea Change..."
 japfeng.2.d: "It's hard to detect at first: coldness from officials, curt diplomatic communications, increased activity from the Kwantung garrison but no actual indication of what they are up to. All signs point to something happening in the Japanese government that bodes ill for us. Let us hope we have the strength to weather this coming storm."
 japfeng.2.a: "China cannot dance to their tune forever."

 japfeng.3.t: "Pushing For A Decision"
 japfeng.3.d: "The time has come to decide: where do our intentions lie with the Fengtian Government we have supported this long? Their loyalty to us was always questionable. What will we do with it?"
 japfeng.3.a: "... destroy it."
 japfeng.3.b: "... coax it."
 japfeng.3.c: "... wait for it."

As both militarists and a resurgent left thrive amidst mounting domestic chaos, the Emperor remains silent, his role unclear and undecided. However, when and if the Emperor does make his move, it will no doubt be decisive."
