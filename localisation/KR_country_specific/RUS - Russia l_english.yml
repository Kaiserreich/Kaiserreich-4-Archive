 RUS_totalist_party: "KNOF"
 RUS_totalist_party_long: "Kommunisticheskiy Narodno-Osvoboditelniy Front (Communist People's Liberation Front)\n§gThe KNOF is an underground organisation founded by the troika of exiled revolutionaries Karl Radek, Yakov Sverdlov and Grigory Zinoviev in the late 1920s that publishes propaganda about a Second Russian Revolution. Believing that Russia is the capitalist nation most vulnerable to a socialist revolt, they wait for a national catastrophe that will enable them to organise the workers into militias against the corrupt White establishment. Seeing itself as the vanguard of Russian socialism, the KNOF advocates rapid industrialisation under the auspices of five-year plans to quickly transition Russia into a proper socialist state. To that end, the troika seeks to control the labour unions and militarise their workers into labour armies that will diligently follow the will of the state.§!"
 RUS_syndicalist_party: "PSP"
 RUS_syndicalist_party_long: "Profsoyuznaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya (Trade Union Socialist Party)\n§gThe PSP is an urban-centred socialist party founded by former RSFSR Central Committee member Aleksandra Kollontai and her lover, fellow revolutionary Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. Although the PSP is a legal party, its supporters' rights have long been curtailed by the aristocracy, and they believe that the system must be overthrown. They hope that someday, the government will be weakened by a national catastrophe, letting them seize major cities such as Moscow to spearhead a revolution. True to its support base, the PSP believes that Russia must be managed by trade unions, seeing them as the most representative of the needs of the urban workers, themselves seen as the will of the proletariat. Due to this stance, the PSP is the Russian political party closest to orthodox French syndicalism, a fact conveniently utilised by its detractors to portray Kollontai, Shlyapnikov and the unions they represent as Communard-sponsored agitators.§!"
 RUS_radical_socialist_party: "NSP"
 RUS_radical_socialist_party_long: "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya (People's Socialist Party)\n§gThe NSP is a socialist party founded by Old Bolsheviks Nikolai Bukharin and Aleksey Rykov, in alliance with the renowned Left-SR Maria Spiridonova, who sought to reorganise the remnants of the Revolution into a new political party to regain power in Russia. Knowing that they have little chance of peacefully gaining power due to the military, Bukharin and Rykov hope that the ongoing political crisis will culminate in the generals dismantling their sham democracy and starting a wave of repression, enabling the NSP to launch another revolution in the name of popular freedom. An opponent of bureaucratisation, the NSP asserts that Russia must industrialise slowly to prevent the creation of a massive state bureaucracy that could curtail the power of the proletariat. In great part due to the influence of the \"revolutionary grandmother\" Spiridonova, the party also seeks the amendment of the divide between urban workers and rural peasants, so that they can unite against the reactionary aristocracy and military.§!"
 RUS_social_democrat_party: "RSDRP"
 RUS_social_democrat_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya (Russian Social Democratic Labour Party)\n§gThe RSDRP, a familiar sight to all Russians who lived through 1917, has undergone great change since its foundation in 1898. Originally encompassing both radical Bolsheviks and more moderate Mensheviks, the RSDRP split after the failure of the October Revolution forced each faction to adapt to the new situation differently. The Bolsheviks either fled to the newly-estabilished Commune of France and Union of Britain, went underground in the hopes that figures like Nikolai Bukharin would bring forth a Second Revolution, or reformed into democratic socialist parties deemed more acceptable by the victorious Whites. The Mensheviks, on the other hand, fled to Georgia, but a group of internationalists, disillusioned with the Georgian wing's growing nationalism, returned to Russia and took on the mantle of the RSDRP by themselves. Under Irakliy Tsereteli's leadership, they have returned to prominence in politics, becoming the leading opposition party.§!"

At last the Russian Bear has awakened, only when we have reacquired the territories from the empire of old shall we truly be able to consider Russia great. Long live Russia, one and indivisible."

 RUS_Invite_Serbia_desc: "We once fought Germany and Austria on the behalf of Serbia, although the Weltkrieg cost us dearly. With Russia now in a strong position perhaps it would be fitting if both us and Serbia right the wrongs of the Weltkrieg together."
 RUS_Invite_Baltics_desc: "The Baltic states were once part of the Empire, but perhaps it would be more pragmatic to offer them an alliance, rather than fritter away resources conquering and pacifying them. We would do well to align them to our aims, if even just to prevent others from doing so."
 RUS_Invite_Finland_desc: "Finland broke away from the Empire, and took with it the strategically valuable area of Karelia. But perhaps instead of demanding the region from them, we could see if they might seek common cause with us? Even if they say no, there is always the alternative..."
 RUS_Invite_Georgia_desc: "Georgia has refuted the Treaty of Poti, and in doing so has broken its previous ties with Germany. An alliance with them would do much to expand our influence in the region."

 RUS_Yunarmiya_desc: "Because of the civil war in Russia, millions of Russian children became orphans. The republic did almost nothing to improve their lives, but Boris Savinkov has other plans. The organisation \"Yunaya Armiya\" (\"Young Army\") has begun to militarise the asylums and school of the children. The coming generations of the Russian people will get a chance to improve their lives and become builders of a new society."

 RUS_Legacy_Of_The_Whites: "Legacy of the Whites"
 RUS_Legacy_Of_The_Whites_desc: "The White generals defeated the Bolsheviks more than 15 years ago and brought peace and prosperity in the country. The White knights shall be honoured as the heroes of Russia."

 RUS_Stratocratic_Government: "Stratocratic Government"
 RUS_Stratocratic_Government_desc: "The government's chronic incapacity to rule proved itself dangerous for Russia. To secure our power, proven officers will have to take up important positions of the administration. Only that way we'll enjoy a competent public service."

 RUS_Military_Spirit: "Military Spirit"
 RUS_Military_Spirit_desc: "The post-war young generation is told to be "lost", lacking of any goal, any vision of future. The army is the only obstacle on the path leading to chaos and disintegration of Russia, they shall take up the education of our youth and soon the education of the whole country. A military spirit can only benefit the Motherland."

 RUS_State_Revanchism: "State Revanchism"
 RUS_State_Revanchism_desc: "Now that Russia has stabilised and grown stronger under the rule of her army she must now grow, we must reclaim the land that has been stolen to us and liberate their peoples that are chanting for our return!"

 RUS_Establish_The_VES: "Establish the VES"
 RUS_Establish_The_VES_desc: "Now that Savinkov is in power, we can finally enact much needed economic reform to this countries neglected industrial base. We shall create a Supreme Economic Council. The VES (Verkhovny Ekonomicheskiy Sovet) shall take control of the industrial development of this nation and bring it up to western standards."

 RUS_Ural_Tractor_Plants: "Ural Tractor Plants"
 RUS_Ural_Tractor_Plants_desc: "If there's one thing that Russia does not lack, it is land. We shall set up state sponsored factories and steelworks deep within the heart of our nation to produce mechanised vehicles, far beyond the reach of Europe."

 RUS_Machine_And_Tractor_Stations: "Machine and Tractor Stations"
 RUS_Machine_And_Tractor_Stations_desc: "The land redistribution promised by Savinkov allowed us to fund many farms in the Central Russia. The next step is to provide our peasants with agricultural machinery. That's why we should establish machine and tractor stations (MTS), to be rural agencies that will supply farms with agricultural machinery and people to run it. Such cooperation will revive the agricultural sector in Russia."

 RUS_Railway_Nationalisation: "Railway Nationalisation"
 RUS_Railway_Nationalisation_desc: "Railways are the lifeblood of our vast nation, yet under the Tsar and later the Republic they have been sorely neglected. We shall nationalise all commercially owned railroads as well as enact government funded schemes to construct new lines to our cities and industrial complexes."

 RUS_Korporatsiya_Yusupova: "Korporatsiya Yusupova"
 RUS_Korporatsiya_Yusupova_desc: "\"Korporatsiya Yusupova\" (Yusupov's Corporation), a united civil and military engineering organisation, has launched several industrial projects, which will reduce our dependence on German goods, provide our army with new arms and help us bring down unemployment. It is however necessary to provide his corporation with the legal privileges to compete with foreign factories."

 RUS_Industrial_Draft_Scheme: "Industrial Draft Scheme"
 RUS_Industrial_Draft_Scheme_desc: "Although we have made great strides in improving the industrial capabilities of our nation, there is still a large labour pool of able bodied Russians we can put to work. We shall enact a scheme that will allow men to avoid the military draft in exchange for three years of mandatory service at state owned facilities, with social and financial incentives for each additional year they stay on."

 RUS_Reinstitute_The_Zemstva: "Reinstitute the Zemstva"
 RUS_Reinstitute_The_Zemstva_desc: "Zemstvo is a form of local governance and representation first introduced by Aleksandr II in 1864. It strongly weights favour to aristocrats but it still assures representation of the lower classes. It will, without a doubt, assure stability in our torn nation."

 RUS_National_Investment_Bank: "National Investment Bank"
 RUS_National_Investment_Bank_desc: "A national investment bank will safeguard not only the resources invested by the Zemstva, but should also offer beneficial loans to local projects. This bank will also help us to control many transactions of our Zemstva and the local businessmen."

 RUS_Local_Development: "Local Development"
 RUS_Local_Development_desc: "The large, bloated state apparatus of the past has often been a hindrance to local development as directives slowly trickled down through an inefficient chain of command. The best way to tackle this is to delegate more responsibilities to local structures of government led by the regional landowners. After all, who knows better how to improve local affairs than the people that own those land?"

 RUS_Zemstvo_Research_Initiatives: "Zemstva Research Initiatives"
 RUS_Zemstvo_Research_Initiatives_desc: "Economies, and businesses, need to be kept competitive in order to grow and expand. We should invest not only in these actual businesses but also the theories behind them. With sufficient science funding, it should benefit not only local companies, but Russia as a whole."

 RUS_War_Preparations_Programme: "War Preparations Programme"
 RUS_War_Preparations_Programme_desc: "With Russia's economy once again looking strong there's no doubt that our neighbours will look at us with envy. We must make no mistake, a civilian economy in a time of war would end the rising star in a matter of months."

 RUS_Funding_Frenzy: "Funding Frenzy"
 RUS_Funding_Frenzy_desc: "By offering more economic support and tax reductions to the Zemstva, we can make sure they start funding local projects like never before. More over it will strengthen the connections between the people of Russia and these new established state authorities."

 RUS_Bureaucratic_Overhaul: "Bureaucratic Overhaul"
 RUS_Bureaucratic_Overhaul_desc: "Our economy should, no matter what our government may look like, be governed by faceless but loyal bureaucrats. We need to remove the old guard of the previous regimes and set up something else. Something new."

 RUS_MinProm: "MinProm"
 RUS_MinProm_desc: "Ministry of Industry or \"MinProm\" in Russian is a united ministry, which will reorganise the industry in our country. Its first task will be to delegate industrial investments to several urban centres in order to boost our industry logically."

 RUS_Agricultural_Modernisation: "Agricultural Modernisation"
 RUS_Agricultural_Modernisation_desc: "In the eyes of the rest of the world, Russia is considered a backwards, poor country. We will show them that they are wrong, harnessing the massive resources hidden in the countryside through new technologies."

 RUS_Military_Production_Act: "Military Production Act"
 RUS_Military_Production_Act_desc: "Many of our military setbacks in the Weltkrieg were the result of shortages and shortcomings due to our outdated military industry. Proposed by our lawmakers, the MPA seeks to impose new standards and regulations on our military industry to bolster production quotas. While meeting these standards will be costly in the short term, it'll allow us to improve our production in the long term."

 RUS_Economic_Efficiency_Act: "Economic Efficiency Act"
 RUS_Economic_Efficiency_Act_desc: "Russia was the last great power in Europe to industrialise and as a result our industries have struggled to compete with its western rivals. The newly proposed ECA seeks to rectify this by creating a new legal framework for industrial production and safety standards. Though costly in the short term, it will be worth it once Russian factories can outproduce their western competitors in both quality and quantity!"

 RUS_National_Administration_School: "National Administration School"
 RUS_National_Administration_School_desc: "With the new bureaucracy steadily growing we should set up a National Administration School which prepares our future army of bureaucrats for the necessary work ahead of them."

 RUS_Cooperative_Capitalism: "Cooperative Capitalism"
 RUS_Cooperative_Capitalism_desc: "In the spirit of democracy, we should grant strong, local governance to the communes of our nation. Russia is a massive nation and to believe that it could all be governed from a single place is crazy!"

 RUS_New_Industrial_Programme: "New Industrial Programme"
 RUS_New_Industrial_Programme_desc: "By industrialising the far reaches of our country side we do not only make sure our whole nation stays alive, but also that targeting our industries becomes much more difficult for our enemies. Moreover, it will help us to reduce the unemployment rate in Russia."

 RUS_Industry_In_The_Urals: "Industry in the Urals"
 RUS_Industry_In_The_Urals_desc: "When the industrial revolution came to Russia its riches rarely stretched beyond the major cities. Beyond the Ural Mountains many localities rely on the same trades that they have since Ivan IV's eastward expansion. Instead of further industrialising the already wealthy cities, it's high time that we brought the riches of the Industrial revolution to the Urals and beyond."

 RUS_The_Wealth_Of_Siberia: "The Wealth of Siberia"
 RUS_The_Wealth_Of_Siberia_desc: "Beneath the Siberian soil there's an immense untapped wealth of resources. Metals, minerals and fuels that surpass the output of entire empires is within our reach. By investing capital and expertise into the neglected regions of our east, we can turn Siberia into an economic powerhouse as the crown jewel of our resource industry."

 RUS_Education_Campaigns: "Education Campaigns"
 RUS_Education_Campaigns_desc: "The Russian nation, torn apart by social and political unrest, has been unable to initiate any massive education programmes successfully. There's still a large rural population dominating the countryside. A school in every village will allow us to integrate even more people in our society and economy."

 RUS_Decentralised_Logistics: "Decentralised Logistics"
 RUS_Decentralised_Logistics_desc: "Russia's size is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. As hard as it is for hostile armies to remain in supply, it is so too for our armies. By establishing local supply points in key areas, we can make sure our troops stay in good supply at all times."

 RUS_Expand_The_Transsiberian: "Expand the Transsiberian Railroad"
 RUS_Expand_The_Transsiberian_desc: "The importance of the Transsiberian Railway to our military and economy cannot be overstated. With the infrastructure therein strained by growth, we must expand it, building new railways and junctions using newer technology."

 RUS_Research_Investments: "Research Investments"
 RUS_Research_Investments_desc: "With our heavy investment in our industry and economy, we have managed to free up more resources to be put into research. In the end, it will pay off greatly."

 RUS_Project_Kremlin: "RDS-1"
 RUS_Project_Kremlin_desc: "The Russian nuclear scientist corps led by Igor Kurchatov have given us a petition, informing us about the destructive potential of the split atom, and that we need to harness this power before our enemies do."

 RUS_Project_Kostikov: "Project Katyusha"
 RUS_Project_Kostikov_desc: "Championed by the young, yet exceptional inventor Andrey Kostikov, Project Katyusha will delve into the potential of jet engines and militarised rocketry. Should they prove to be practical, jets will turn our fighters into supersonic vultures and rockets will deal our enemies death from above..."

 RUS_Resource_Prospection: "Resource Prospection"
 RUS_Resource_Prospection_desc: "Minerals are numerous in Russia and can boost the economy rapidly. That's why we have to initiate an extraction of various minerals in the whole country."

 RUS_Rearmament_Programme: "Rearmament Programme"
 RUS_Rearmament_Programme_desc: "As tensions between the French and Germans continue to increase, the world finds itself closer and closer to the outbreak of a new war, one that will define the future of Europe. We must be ready to confront Germany when the time comes, and, to that end, we must embark on an ambitious programme to rearm the Russian Army."
 RUS_Proletarian_Humanism: "Proletarian Humanism"
 RUS_Proletarian_Humanism_desc: "Through his rhetorical skills and clever manoeuvring, Bukharin's vision for Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role in the All-Union Communist Party. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

 RUS_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict: "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
 RUS_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc: "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

 RUS_Voluntary_Collectivisation: "Voluntary Collectivisation"
 RUS_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc: "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a programme of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

 RUS_Cautious_Industrialisation: "Cautious Industrialisation"
 RUS_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc: "The superindustrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka - a necessary requirement in the short-term - will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

 RUS_Control_The_Unions: "Control the Unions"
 RUS_Control_The_Unions_desc: "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. We will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

 RUS_Fight_Bureaucratisation: "Fight Bureaucratisation"
 RUS_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc: "The fight against excessive bureaucracy is a constant one, something Lenin already understood. We will have to fight the bureaucracy before it can entrench itself, something we have to avoid at all costs. We will also have to train truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the reactionary bureaucrats we still have plenty of."

 RUS_Revolutionary_Vanguard: "Revolutionary Vanguard"
 RUS_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc: "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, he is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and five-year plans will allow the creation of the productive forces necessary for the transition towards socialism."

 RUS_Mass_Collectivisation: "Mass Collectivisation"
 RUS_Mass_Collectivisation_desc: "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar and the capitalist. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical programme of rapid collectivisation of our farms. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

 RUS_Militarisation_of_Labour: "Militarisation of Labour"
 RUS_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc: "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion to establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

 RUS_Proletarian_Revolution: "Proletarian Revolution"
 RUS_Proletarian_Revolution_desc: "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

 RUS_First_Five_Year_Plan: "First Five-Year Plan"
 RUS_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "The taxation of the peasantry and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created, which is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation."

 RUS_Industrial_Democracy: "Industrial Democracy"
 RUS_Industrial_Democracy_desc: "Kollontai's vision for union control over the economy has succeeded in winning over a majority of comrades. Despite her noble ancestry, she has always been a fighter for more control of unions and thus workers over the economy, as unions are the best representation of the will of the proletariat."

 RUS_Break_The_Smychka: "Break The Smychka"
 RUS_Break_The_Smychka_desc: "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the centre of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

 RUS_Create_the_VSR: "Create the VSR"
 RUS_Create_the_VSR_desc: "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

 RUS_Separation_Of_Powers: "Separation of Powers"
 RUS_Separation_Of_Powers_desc: "The interests of the unions have been ignored far too much. We will create a proper separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow representation for the proletariat while also permitting the effective defence against reactionaries."

 RUS_Rebuild_The_Country: "Red Star Over Kremlin"
 RUS_Rebuild_The_Country_desc: "The might of the Russian worker has been tested and proven as socialists of all kinds united in one front against reactionary oppression. While hope is in the air, a fog still lurks across Russia. Our front, formerly united, is succumbing to internal division, and enemies of the revolution hide in every corner, waiting for a chance to strike. We have been blessed with victory in one battle, but it will be the true test of Russian socialism to win the war."

 RUS_Help_The_People: "Help the People"
 RUS_Help_The_People_desc: "The depredations of the previous finance capital state has devastated large swaths of the nation and impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the previous regime, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

 RUS_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy: "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
 RUS_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "The capitalists' \"republic\" and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

 RUS_Allow_Small_Traders: "Allow Small Traders"
 RUS_Allow_Small_Traders_desc: "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

 RUS_The_GOELRO_Plan: "The GOELRO Plan"
 RUS_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc: "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."

 RUS_Form_Gosplan: "Form Gosplan"
 RUS_Form_Gosplan_desc: "In order to complete our economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. Employing the some of the brightest minds in Russia, Gosplan will greatly enhance our economy."

 RUS_Mechanisation: "Mechanisation"
 RUS_Mechanisation_desc: "The industrial revolution brought with it great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."

 RUS_Khozraschyot: "Khozraschyot"
 RUS_Khozraschyot_desc: "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

 RUS_Promote_Industrialisation: "Promote Industrialisation"
 RUS_Promote_Industrialisation_desc: "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

 RUS_Spreading_The_Revolution: "Spreading the Revolution"
 RUS_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc: "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

 RUS_Liberate_Central_Asia: "Liberate Central Asia"
 RUS_Liberate_Central_Asia_desc: "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring socialist leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

 RUS_The_Final_Battle: "The Final Battle"
 RUS_The_Final_Battle_desc: "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

 RUS_Modernise_The_VVS: "Modernise the VVS"
 RUS_Modernise_The_VVS_desc: "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air bases and training new recruits we could change this."

 RUS_Standardise_Pilot_Training: "Standardise Pilot Training"
 RUS_Standardise_Pilot_Training_desc: "Military aviation still bears many of the hallmarks of an emerging craft, one of which is the incredibly haphazard nature by which knowledge is shared. There is no unified training regimen — instead, experienced pilots are expected to find their own way to teach their art, leading to a shockingly inconsistent body of knowledge among our pilots. It is time we standardised this process."

 RUS_Promote_Amateur_Flying: "Promote Amateur Flying"
 RUS_Promote_Amateur_Flying_desc: "The amateur pilot has been a growing phenomenon — a number of civilians have begun to make a hobby of flying in recent years, with some achieving such impressive feats as flights across the Atlantic and winning great fame. If we cultivate and direct this popular image, we might be able to grow an experienced manpower pool for our air force."

 RUS_Night_Witches: "Night Witches"
 RUS_Night_Witches_desc: "The renowned aviator Marina Raskova has approached the VVS with a shocking idea: an all-female aviation regiment. Despite all conventional wisdom, there are actually certain officers who are supportive of her scheme. They argue that it has immense proaganda value, and may inspire our other pilots to reach bold new heights for Russia."

 RUS_Aviation_Bureaus: "Aviation Bureaus"
 RUS_Aviation_Bureaus_desc: "Aviation is a delicate craft. A seemingly small flaw can spell disaster in the skies, and designing an aircraft to withstand the rigors of combat demands perfection. Many a dogfight was decided before either plane even took flight: by establishing aviation bureaus across the country, we can proactively design and test more effective aircraft."

 RUS_Long_Range_Bombing: "Long Range Bombing"
 RUS_Long_Range_Bombing_desc: "As the limits of aviation are pushed, military theorists have conceived of a radical use for the technology: behemoth long-range bombers, operating in enemy industrial regions, and armed with enough firepower to level factories. This doctrine of 'strategic destruction' promises to annihilate the enemy's ability to wage war without so much as a boot on the ground."

 RUS_Create_The_VDV: "Create the VDV"
 RUS_Create_The_VDV_desc: "Some of the more experimental members of our high command suggests that the motorisation of our troops is only the first step. The next would be to move infantry not by ships or by trucks, but by planes! By dropping so called paratroopers behind enemy lines we can cut off enemy units and hit supply points. This new division of 'airborne forces' — vozdushno-desantnye voyska — would be the tip of the spear."

 RUS_Death_From_Above: "Death from Above"
 RUS_Death_From_Above_desc: "The third dimension of warfare is poised to revolutionise the art as we know it — between its immense tactical and strategic applications, control of the skies is certain to be critical not just to the next Great War, but every war to follow. The Russian military shall embrace the future: the Rodina's sons will no longer languish in misery on the earth, but win glory in the clouds."

 RUS_Transpolar_Flights: "Transpolar Flights"
 RUS_Transpolar_Flights_desc: "Our proximity to the Arctic has unexpected boons for our aviation industry: there are few better places in the world to put aircraft through their paces. By actively organising long-distance transpolar flights for testing purposes, we can design airplanes that fly farther, further, and faster than any other."

 RUS_Expand_The_Aircraft_Industry: "Expand the Aircraft Industry"
 RUS_Expand_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc: "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, but most of it is still in private hands. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry. integrate it into the state apparatus, and expand it considerably if we want to build a modern and strong air force."

 RUS_Airspace_Defence: "Airspace Defence"
 RUS_Airspace_Defence_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our skies and terrorise the land troops. Defending our land is no longer enough: the motherland's skies must be as impregnable as her ground if we are to triumph."

 RUS_Specialise_in_Ground_Support: "Specialise in Ground Support"
 RUS_Specialise_in_Ground_Support_desc: "New technologies open tantalising new possibilities for the development of new bombers. Aircraft may now serve as highly mobile artillery, able to strike enemy positions with precise and devastating attacks, able to be deployed anywhere on a front much faster than conventional support. This surely represents the future of military aviation."

 RUS_Maintain_Tactical_Flexibility: "Maintain Tactical Flexibility"
 RUS_Maintain_Tactical_Flexibility_desc: "The advance of aviation technology clears the way not only for more nimble aircraft, but also more durable ones. Some schools of theory have begun to champion a new 'tactical' bomber — a ground support craft with more range and survivability than 'close' support. This kind of bomber could perform further from bases and in more adverse conditions, as well as destroy enemy structures."

 RUS_Jet_Engine_Experiments: "Jet Engine Experiments"
 RUS_Jet_Engine_Experiments_desc: "For all its history, heavier-than-air flight has only been possible via propeller. However, the cutting edge of flight technology suggests that a new method of powered flight may be possible. In theory, an engine could compress air, combine it with fuel, and use the mixture to generate thrust — bypassing the issues inherent to propellers. While clearly insane, sane ideas rarely make breakthroughs."

 RUS_Naval_Bomber_Development: "Naval Bomber Development"
 RUS_Naval_Bomber_Development_desc: "As on land, the development of military aviation has begun to make its mark at sea. Theorists and designers have devised ways through which aircraft can carry a large enough payload to fell a dreadnought, opening lanes of attack that would be impossible any other way. Some dare to say that air-based firepower could render conventional sea power obsolete entirely."

 RUS_Carrier_Development: "Carrier Development"
 RUS_Carrier_Development_desc: "While the old guard speaks fondly of battleships, a new generation of naval theoreticians speak of the potential of the aircraft carrier as the future centrepiece of our navies. Each of these floating airfields can carry an armada of fighters and bombers directly into the heart of our foes, giving us unmatched power projection potential."

 RUS_Take_To_The_Seas: "Take to the Seas"
 RUS_Take_To_The_Seas_desc: "If we are to stand proud among the great nations of Europe again, we must build a new, modern navy that can challenge the great powers of Europe and the world. It is time for Russia to become a naval power once more."

 RUS_Naval_Air_Coordination: "Naval-Air Coordination"
 RUS_Naval_Air_Coordination_desc: "Before the revolution, some of our naval staff members visited [RUS_naval_officers_target], and it made them believe that the future of naval warfare is the aircraft carrier. These ships are expensive, but these officers claim that while Weltkrieg naval warfare was dominated by dreadnoughts, they will soon be overshadowed by massive aircraft carriers and the punching power of naval bombers."

 RUS_Floating_Fortresses: "Floating Fortresses"
 RUS_Floating_Fortresses_desc: "Many officers of the old school believe in the power of discipline and of majestic dreadnoughts based on experiences in the Weltkrieg and the Russian civil war. They advocate for these massive warships to remain the centrepieces of our navy, where thhe fleets of the other great powers."

 RUS_War_Under_The_Sea: "War Under the Sea"
 RUS_War_Under_The_Sea_desc: "While carriers and battleships may be the future, it may not be realistic for our young republic to focus on these massive ships. Building a large navy is expensive, and [RUS.GetNameDef] does not have the dockyards nor the resources to produce a fleet of that size. Instead, we should focus on the cheaper, but equally deadly submarines to harass enemy shipping lanes."

 RUS_The_Invisible_Navy: "The Invisible Navy"
 RUS_The_Invisible_Navy_desc: "The Great War taught us that it isn't always the biggest naval gun that wins the war. Cheap, silent, and deadly submarines can bring entire empires to their knees. With our shipbuilding capacity limited by Brest-Litovsk, focusing on these types of vessels will allow us to quickly regain an offensive capacity in the deep oceans."

 RUS_Coastal_Defences: "Coastal Defences"
 RUS_Coastal_Defences_desc: "Because our naval capacity has historically been less than that of our natural rivals, many of our naval theoreticians are advocating for a defensive stance against the enemy. By focusing on mining the seas, we could limit their movement at sea and cause losses to their fleets while exposing ourselves to minimal risk."

 RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada: "A Destroyer Armada"
 RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of every navy. Considering Germany's dominance in the Baltics, this will be doubly true for us. Swift, resourceful, and fast to build, a large force of these ships will be needed if we are to contest the straits and make it into the open seas."

 RUS_Fleet_Protectors: "Fleet Protectors"
 RUS_Fleet_Protectors_desc: "Until we finish our naval expansion programme, every ship is valuable and difficult to replace. By having our cruisers act as defensive centrepieces able to protect our screens and capital ships alike, our admiralty believes that we will be able to greatly improve the survivability of our naval assets."

 RUS_Commerce_Raiders: "Commerce Raiders"
 RUS_Commerce_Raiders_desc: "Modern cruisers have proved very effective commerce raiders in the past by combining good mobility with great firepower. Given their potential and our need to strike at the arteries of our enemies, we should devote more resources towards maximising their effectiveness in this particular role."

 RUS_Fleet_Vanguards: "Fleet Vanguards"
 RUS_Fleet_Vanguards_desc: "Striking a middle ground between larger battleships and smaller screens, cruisers are a versatile type of ship that can strike hard without being a disproportionate drain on our limited resources. By modernising their offensive gunnery, we can effectively turn these ships into pocket battleships: hard-hitting ships able to stand up to capital ships in a fight."

 RUS_Naval_Infantry: "Naval Infantry"
 RUS_Naval_Infantry_desc: "Landings against fortified enemy islands or beaches carried out by regular infantry without special training and equipment is a disaster waiting to happen. If we are to take the holdings of the empires to our west, south and east, we'll need to establish a new branch of marine infantry to act as the vanguard in any future naval invasion."

 RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships: "New Tactics for New Ships"
 RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships_desc: "Modern ships are hardly any more useful than the ships of the last century if our naval doctrine does not grow with them. Ready as ever, the admiralty has outlined a doctrinal modernisation plan that will help us rapidly overhaul our tactics and retrain our officers to take full advantage of the resources now available to them."

 RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards: "Modernise the Petrograd Dockyards"
 RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards_desc: "With Petrograd being the largest port city in western Russia, it's only natural that it will serve as the linchpin for any fleet expansion project. With a relatively modern infrastructure and skilled engineers already in place, modernising its dockyards is the fastest way of expanding our shipbuilding capacity."

 RUS_Modernise_Murmansk: "Modernise Murmansk"
 RUS_Modernise_Murmansk_desc: "As a gateway into the Barents Sea, Murmansk could be turned into a pivotal strategic location for our northern navy. Though its facilities are as of yet underdeveloped, expanding them could allow us to move submarines and other ships into the North Sea and beyond into the Atlantic, bypassing any western navies in the Baltic Sea."

 RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints: "Recover Foreign Blueprints"
 RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints_desc: "As a result of the decades lost to turmoil, we've fallen significantly behind several of our competitors on naval designs. With the right resources and connections, however, we could learn from their efforts to speed up our own naval research programme."

 RUS_Submarines_In_Nikolayevsk: "Submarines in Nikolayevsk"
 RUS_Submarines_In_Nikolayevsk_desc: "The loss of Vladivostok primed a generation of naval reformers to focus on smaller and more cost-effective ways to safeguard the Pacific. With all of the Sea of Okhotsk within its reach, basing a submarine fleet in Nikolayevsk would let us strike at any potential enemy throughout the entire Pacific theatre of operations."

 RUS_Repair_Sevastopol: "Repair Sevastopol"
 RUS_Repair_Sevastopol_desc: "With Crimea once again under Russian control, we finally have a proper warm water port to the south and a permanent foothold in the Black Sea. However, its facilities are currently built with Ukrainian and German specifications in mind. We need to rebuild and overhaul Crimea's shipyards and ports to fully utilise its potential!"

 RUS_Repair_Vladivostok: "Repair Vladivostok"
 RUS_Repair_Vladivostok_desc: "With Vladivostok back under our control, we are finally in a position to contest the other world powers for dominance over the Pacific Ocean. After decades of Kolchak's neglect and Japanese influence, however, it is pivotal that we renovate the port and bring it up to our naval specifications."

 RUS_Battleship_Development: "Battleship Development"
 RUS_Battleship_Development_desc: "From the carracks of old to the contemporary dreadnoughts, capital ships have been the centrepiece of every major navy for countless centuries. Building these mighty warships isn't just a massive boon to our navies, but also a clear sign to the rest of the world that we have overcome the injustices of Brest-Litovsk once and for all."

 RUS_Equipment_Modernisation: "Equipment Modernisation"
 RUS_Equipment_Modernisation_desc: "In the years following the civil war, military matters have frequently been the farthest thing on the government's mind — and as such, the Army's equipment has been allowed to become painfully outdated. While the rise of Savinkov has brought the matter to attention, modernization processes remain incomplete and must still be seen through."

 RUS_Cold_Warfare: "Cold Warfare"
 RUS_Cold_Warfare_desc: "The Russian soldier is no stranger to the cold. From the battlefields of the Great War, to the short days of the Ice March, our soldiers have braved conditions that would bring many an army to their knees. Our willingness to fight in such bitter conditions is one of our greatest assets — and it must be supported by officers who know exactly how to fight at twenty below."

 RUS_Mortar_Development: "Mortar Development"
 RUS_Mortar_Development_desc: "Contrary to popular belief, battles are not won by rifles alone. Many of our officers have expressed a love for large artillery pieces, but just as important are smaller infantry support mortars that can provide supporting fire on minimal notice. As with our other weapons, many of our mortars date back to the Great War — something that cannot stand."

 RUS_Military_Reorganisation: "Military Reorganisation"
 RUS_Military_Reorganisation_desc: "It can not be avoided any longer — the Russian Army has been at peace too long for its own good. For all the capable men at our service, there are those that are still stuck in the last decade, prepared to fight a war which has already come and gone. A thorough reorganisation of the military is needed if the world is to see Russia as a great power once more."

 RUS_Centralised_Command: "Centralised Command"
 RUS_Centralised_Command_desc: "A centralised command is necessary in military combat — any alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. An army can only succeed as a well-oiled machine, where its generals can confidently and quickly direct it to victory. Thus, we must aim to create a cohesive military chain of command."

 RUS_Empower_the_Generals: "Empower the Generals"
 RUS_Empower_the_Generals_desc: "German generals deign themselves the masters of warfare, but Russian ones know better. The crucibles of the world war and civil war have provided our general staff with a wealth of experience in all kinds of situations. All they need is to be granted the authority to properly lead their armies — and for those under them to know to stand at attention."

 RUS_Streamline_Intelligence_Gathering: "Streamline Intelligence Gathering"
 RUS_Streamline_Intelligence_Gathering_desc: "It is difficult to fight an enemy you don't understand. While the centralisation of the army has provided the general staff with knowledge of their own forces, it is just as important for them to understand the force opposite. All means of collecting this intelligence must be integrated into the military structure."

 RUS_Cossack_Cavalry: "Cossack Cavalry"
 RUS_Cossack_Cavalry_desc: "The infantry may be the backbone of the Russian Army, but the Cossack cavalry is its soul — the brave Cossack has been here to serve Russia for centuries as a peerless horseman. Some say that warfare has moved past the age of the horse, but they are simply not inventive enough: under the leadership of the Cossacks, Russian cavalry will find a place next to any invention."

 RUS_Protectors_of_the_Motherland: "Protectors of the Motherland"
 RUS_Protectors_of_the_Motherland_desc: "Other armies fight for gold, glory, or godless ideology — but a Russian fights for his motherland. The Rodina is a savage place to many a foreigner, but for a Russian it is a home which holds no secrets. It is for this land that a Russian has and will do great and beautiful things, and any nation who thinks they can conquer it is in for a very rude awakening."

 RUS_Reorganise_Armament_Production: "Reorganise Armament Production"
 RUS_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc: "The current state of armament production is a disaster, to put it mildly. Production chains are often disjointed, outdated, or both — no condition in which a modern army can fight under. Only by thorough reorganisation of this system can we ensure that very soldier will have a gun with which to fight the foes of the Rodina."

 RUS_Expand_the_Logistics_Corps: "Expand the Logistics Corps"
 RUS_Expand_the_Logistics_Corps_desc: "One of biggest lessons of the Great War and the Civil War is that logistics is all-important to a modern army. Military equipment, special resources such as fuel, and simple necessities of life must all be provided in a timely fashion, or an army simply cannot exist. Thus, an expansion of the army must also be met with an expansion of the Logistics Corps."

 RUS_Local_Workshops: "Local Workshops"
 RUS_Local_Workshops_desc: "In the age of industrial war, all means must be taken to grow military production. A system of local workshops across the nation can organise production in a way that takes local conditions into account, and expands production to include even the most minor settlements that can bear industry."

 RUS_Terrestrial_Dreadnoughts: "Terrestrial Dreadnoughts"
 RUS_Terrestrial_Dreadnoughts_desc: "The advent of the tank promises to bring an entirely new paradigm in warfare. During the Great War, they were envisioned as nigh-impenetrable 'landships' that could sail past enemy entrenchments and achieve breakthroughs otherwise impossible. This ideal stands on the edge of realisation: tanks designs have grown into veritable dreadnoughts to serve as the centrepieces of the army."

 RUS_Asymmetric_Tactics: "Asymmetric Tactics"
 RUS_Asymmetric_Tactics_desc: "Although no army wants to fight on unequal footing, the experience of the civil war has arguably left the Russian army the largest force familiar with unorthodox scenarios. Perhaps the lessons learned can be put to good use — a doctrine that attempts to account for disadvantaged engagements, and allows us to make the most out of even a single batallion."

 RUS_Decentralised_Structure: "Decentralised Structure"
 RUS_Decentralised_Structure_desc: "Orthodox military thought tends to subscribe to a cult of command — the supremacy of the high general, commanding his army like pieces on a chessboard. But the reality of war is messy and complicated. An overly centralised command structure runs the risk of becoming rigid and inflexible in the fast pace of modern war. A more delegated structure avoids such trappings."

 RUS_Reconnaissance_Units: "Reconnaissance Units"
 RUS_Reconnaissance_Units_desc: "Knowledge is power — and the best way of learning what the enemy is doing is to go up and ask them. The art of reconnaisance is nothing new, but advances in technology and tactics has changed the game significantly, demanding new skillsets, specialisations, and equipment. Dedicated recon units attached to formations can allow all soldier to know where they are, when they are."

 RUS_Officer_Initiative: "Officer Initiative"
 RUS_Officer_Initiative_desc: "War is chaos, and to thrive in modern war is to embrace it. Situations can look very different to the general staff than they do on the ground, and in some cases can change completely in the time it takes for a general to make a decision. Empowering local officers to set objectives and make meaningful decisions for their units will allow our forces to adapt under pressure and fight with sense."

 RUS_Small_Unit_Tactics: "Small Unit Tactics"
 RUS_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc: "Instead of using masses of troops, organising our army into small units can allow for greater flexibility and more precise strikes and movements that would be difficult with larger formations. Smaller units can maneuver faster while maintaining cohesion, allowing for kinds of strategies that more conventional units would defeat themselves attempting under pressure."

 RUS_Superb_Training: "Superb Training"
 RUS_Superb_Training_desc: "An army is only as good as its soldiers. For all the noise made about new technologies and revolutions in warfare, there will inevitably have to be soldiers there to exploit them — and a soldier not trained to use his weapon is little more than a farmer with a gun. The Russian Army must be the best in the world, and so our soldiers must be trained to be the best in the world."

 RUS_Expand_The_High_Command: "Expand the High Command"
 RUS_Expand_The_High_Command_desc: "The army's high command cannot be a social club for nobles, as it was during the Great War. Exclusivity and cliques can not and will not be tolerated if it hinders the army's effectiveness — instead, the general staff will be expanded to include all of our best and brightest commanders. Only the best of the best are fit to lead the world's greatest army."

 RUS_Officer_Training_Academies: "Officer Training Academies"
 RUS_Officer_Training_Academies_desc: "Our military academies are in many ways woefully outdated — for all of the talent bred by the Great War and the Civil War, the old academy structures have often proved ill-suited to disseminating this wisdom to the rest of the army. A renovation of the circuit is in order, to properly teach the modern art of war to not just generals, but lower-level officers as well."

 RUS_Professional_Engineer_Corps: "Professional Engineer Corps"
 RUS_Professional_Engineer_Corps_desc: "Our army still lacks a proper engineer corps, or at least a formalised one. The value of army engineers cannot be underestimated: they are responsible not only for navigating unusual terrain or constructing fortifications, but they are also usually the people who best know how to break through enemy defenses. Formalising this position is long overdue."

 RUS_Moscow_Strategic_Echelon: "Moscow Strategic Echelon"
 RUS_Moscow_Strategic_Echelon_desc: "No plan survives contact with the enemy, and the war with Germany is not guaranteed to go our way. It would be wise to create countermeasures in case we are forced to retreat — Moscow must not fall into enemy hands."

 RUS_Urban_Defensive_Perimeters: "Urban Defensive Perimeters"
 RUS_Urban_Defensive_Perimeters_desc: "Nobody wants to repeat the experience of the Great War, but the truth is that we may be forced to defend the Rodina from invaders. Petrograd and Tsaritsyn have been identified as prime strategic targets in such an instance — and so detailed plans have been drawn up for their defense, should the worst come."

 RUS_Combined_Arms: "Combined Arms"
 RUS_Combined_Arms_desc: "The theory of combined arms presents itself as the logical conclusion of the strides made in military technology during and since the Great War. It envisions the perfect harmony of combat arms, simultaneously utilising combinations of infantry, armour, air, and naval forces to create attacks that are impossible to defend against. It is an attractive vision."

 RUS_Mass_Breakthroughs: "Mass Breakthroughs"
 RUS_Mass_Breakthroughs_desc: "Armour is the future. Advances in technology allow these fortresses to move at speeds once thought impossible, supported by infantry moved entirely by vehicle. We will need to support the development of new tanks if we want to create a truly modern armoured force, able to encircle and destroy enemy divisions at record speeds."

 RUS_Land_Air_Integration: "Land-Air Integration"
 RUS_Land_Air_Integration_desc: "For all of the noise made about air power, it is ultimately a complementary force. Regardless of its structure and use, the conversation regarding military aviation will inevitably return to how it will aid grounded forces. By staying true to this philosophy, we can devise an air force that multiplies the effectiveness of our army by providing support where it's needed, when it's needed."

 RUS_Realpolitik: "Realpolitik"
 RUS_Realpolitik_desc: "Realpolitik is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian. We enjoy this notion."

 RUS_Expansionism: "Expansionism"
 RUS_Expansionism_desc: "The theory of expansionism constitutes that Russia's borders are only as safe as they are distant from our heartland. Every neighbouring state which is not a puppet of the Russian state is, as such, a threat or a target, depending on their military and political strength. Needless to say, this adaptation of policies will not be well-liked by the rest of the world."

 RUS_Secure_Central_Asia: "Secure Central Asia"
 RUS_Secure_Central_Asia_desc: "A decade of continued instability has left Russia's power projection weakened, and allowed its sphere of influence to slowly be eroded away. The isolated region of Central Asia, once part of the Russian Empire, should prove a good starting point in restoring Russian influence in the global stage."

 RUS_The_Road_To_War: "The Road to War"
 RUS_The_Road_To_War_desc: "Tensions are rising across Europe, and Russia cannot allow itself to stay out of the war which is due to break out. The conflict between Germany and France is our only chance to reclaim the lost territories in the West - and we need to prepare the country for this goal."

 RUS_Seek_Allies: "Seek Allies"
 RUS_Seek_Allies_desc: "With our geopolitical bloc established, it's time we sought out allies. We cannot hope to take on Germany alone, and there are many countries around Russia willing to align themselves with someone other than the Reichspakt or the Internationale - be it because of historical ties with Russia or simple pragmatism."

 RUS_The_Academy_Of_Sciences: "The Academy of Sciences"
 RUS_The_Academy_Of_Sciences_desc: "We should foster deeper cooperation between our allies by creating a collective research initiative. The Russian Academy of Sciences, already a gateway for Western scientific thought into Russia, will serve us well as the foundation of this initiative."

 RUS_Crush_The_German_Hegemony: "Crush the German Hegemony"
 RUS_Crush_The_German_Hegemony_desc: "The time has come for us to end the injustices inflicted from the first Weltkrieg and strike back at the damnable Kaiser. Brest-Litovsk shall be avenged!"

 RUS_Enemy_In_The_East: "Enemy in the East"
 RUS_Enemy_In_The_East_desc: "Ever since the Russo-Japanese war the true enemy of Russia has, and will always be, the rising Empire in the East. The extremely rich and populous regions of China would also serve us very well."

 RUS_country_intro_header: "A Troubled History"
 RUS_country_intro_content: "The February Revolution put an end to centuries of Tsarist despotism, but its achievements were on the verge of being undone. In October of 1917, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, stormed the Winter Palace and seized control of Russia, declaring the world's first revolutionary socialist state, Soviet Russia. A wide front of monarchists, republicans, moderate socialists and foreign interventionists rose up against it. The Bolshevik revolution was stillborn - in September of 1918, Lenin was assassinated by Fanny Kaplan, a disgruntled Left SR, and the Bolshevik cause began to disintegrate. This, combined with German supplies provided to the White Movement throughout the civil war, meant that by 1920, the revolution was successfully suppressed.\n\nIn 1922, the White generals dictated a constitution for the new Russian Republic, which, albeit democratic, was riddled with issues and did not satisfy everyone. Hoping that he would prove to be a weak figurehead, the Whites pushed forward Aleksandr Kerensky, the leader of the Provisional Government before the October coup, as the first President of the Russian Republic. Kerensky would prove to be at least minimally capable, however, as he survived the 1925 Kolchak Putsch and implemented the New Economic Policy to restore economic growth. In 1934, however, he was pushed into the opposition by the sudden rise of Boris Savinkov’s NRPR, and Savinkov’s election to the Presidency.\n\nBy 1936, however, President Savinkov has not yet been able to solidify his control, and domestic political elements prevent him from turning his focus abroad. While his party is reasonably popular and controls the lower house, monarchists believe Savinkov has betrayed Russia’s history, democrats believe that he is betraying its promise, and socialists believe he has betrayed its people. All of them share one belief, however - that Russia still has potential to assert its power in the world..."

 RUS_country_intro_header_1: "The Russian Constitution of 1922"
 RUS_country_intro_content_1: "Signed in 1922, after the end of the Russian Civil War and five years after the February Revolution, the Constitution of the Russian Republic is a scar of the fractured White movement which saw its adoption. It defines Russia as a federal democratic republic, guarantees universal freedoms and rights to every citizen of the Republic, and is the document by which the country's political institutions have been organised since then.\n\nIn some ways, the Constitution is an updated version of the Tsarist constitution of 1906 - the upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, is the main example of this authoritarian heritage. It is an unelected institution composed of senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations. The lower house, the State Duma, is elected and holds most of the legislative power in the country. The presence of the unelected Senate curbs democratic process in the country, however.\n\nThe President is elected by the Senate, but many of his powers and duties are styled after the position of Tsar in the 1906 Constitution - therefore, he holds significant executive power, and appoints the Council of Ministers with the approval of both legislative houses. The President is the primary actor in executing legislative acts and represents the Republic in foreign affairs. He also has access to the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution, which allows the President to take emergency actions without the approval of the Duma. President Boris Savinkov has grown fond of using this power to bypass the increasingly fractured legislature and thus pass decrees and laws.\n\nDrafted under the guidance of the White Generals, the Constitution can only call itself a protector of democracy when its articles are not used against it."

 RUS_country_intro_header_2: "New Economic Policy"
 RUS_country_intro_content_2: "The Russian Civil War left the economy of the Republic in a pitiful position — the conflict had devastated the country and left millions dead, famine was breaking out in the Volga Region and anarchy reigned across much of the country. The government of Aleksandr Kerensky had a lot of political capital and used it for a vast series of economic stimulus programmes dubbed "New Economic Policy" (Novaya ekonomicheskaya politika)\n\nThe NEP combined financial stabilisation with concessions to the progressive movement. A new currency was introduced, the Chervonets Ruble, backed by the gold standard, which put an end to rampant inflation. The de facto land redistribution in the countryside was recognised and additional land reform promulgated in order to restore the efficiency of agriculture. A restored agricultural sector allowed Russia to become an exporter and use the revenue from these exports, combined with considerable American and German investment, to restore industrial zones and rebuild the rail system. By the late 1920s, Russia was one of the fastest growing economies on the planet with plenty of potential to spare.\n\nThe economic miracle began to slow down by 1933. The Great Depression in America depreciated investment in Russia, agricultural efficiency stopped growing due to lacking mechanisation, and the gold standard was shackling finances, rather than stabilising them. This economic downturn led to election of ultranationalist Boris Savinkov as the President of Russia in 1934. He swore to avenge Russia's humiliations, but his NRPR party has not been able to secure absolute majority to finalise his dictatorship - yet."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.0.t: "A Heated Session in the Duma"
 russia_kerensky_assassination.0.desc: "The Russian Senate once again voted down President Boris Savinkov's attempt to further centralise Russia. The Act on Protection of the Republic had already passed through the NRPR-dominated lower house, but the Opposition Bloc, still holding a majority in the Senate under the leadership of Alexander Kerensky, blocked the law as 'unconstitutional'. What the Opposition terms as valiant resistance to increasingly tyrannical attempts by the President to destroy Russian democracy, Savinkov's supporters view as yet another proof of the inefficiency of Russian parliamentarism."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.1.desc: "KERENSKY DEAD, the newspapers declare. The Chairman of the Senate, Alexander Kerensky, was shot on the stairs of the Senate Building in the Kremlin. The killer was shot dead by the military police before he could make his escape. The assailant's motives will forever be unknown. Regardless, the fate of Russia has been irrevocably changed.\n\nImmediately, a flurry of theories rose: was the assassination ordered by the president? Or the military? Or was it genuinely an independent act? An investigation has been started on the matter, but it seems like the political situation will boil over before anything can be concluded."
 russia_kerensky_assassination.1.a: "Good riddance, but this is going to give us a headache."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.2.t: "The Opposition Accuses Savinkov"
 russia_kerensky_assassination.2.desc: "The Senate, now led by Viktor Chernov, the late Kerensky's Deputy Chairman, has demanded that the investigation on Kerensky's murder be placed under the supervision of a nonpartisan Senate committee. The statement implied that the current Savinkov-appointed police investigation is not neutral, and that the president should restrain himself from the investigation process as 'one of the prime suspects'."
 russia_kerensky_assassination.2.a: "And they claim to be nonpartisan?"

 russia_kerensky_assassination.3.t: "Massive Protests Break Out!"
 russia_kerensky_assassination.3.desc: "Savinkov refused to budge to the outrageous demands of the Senate and instead placed the investigation under a Duma committee mostly made up of NRPR members. There has even been rumours of starting a state of emergency for the duration of the investigation. All the chaos has prompted the full might of Russian left to mobilise in support of Chernov's demands.\n\nThousands of peoples have took to the streets in Moscow, demanding answers. Soon the demonstrations have grown in scale, even demanding rolling back many undemocratic reforms that Savinkov has passed during the past two years. It seems clear that socialists are behind some of it, fermenting unrest and agitating people against 'the Terrorist of the Kremlin'.\n\nThe President held an emergency meeting with his cabinet and Moscow police chiefs today, and it seems clear that they cannot contain the protests, should they grow even bolder. The mutinous mood has spread to even many soldiers in the Moscow garrison, so forces outside the city are needed to contain the masses. However, mass mobilisation would possibly light the capital on fire, so only a limited force should be requested.\n\nOut of possible options, General Pyotr Wrangel's forces are close by, but he and many of his staff are monarchists. General Anton Denikin may be more loyal to the republic than he is to its president. Lastly, General Lavr Kornilov may be the most like-minded to Savinkov, but his involvement might inflame tensions even more."

 RUS_protests_hold_firm_tt: "With protests growing ever larger, doing nothing might lead to the end of Savinkov's shaky rule."
 RUS_protests_wrangel_tt: "Given his monarchist leanings, calling on General Wrangel in this moment would give him an opportunity to topple the republic."
 RUS_protests_denikin_tt: "Despite being a capable General, Denikin may be more inclined to show sympathy towards the protesters than the totalitarian-minded Savinkov."
 RUS_protests_kornilov_tt: "General Kornilov's reaction upon seeing the chaos in the capital will no doubt be ruthless, but is sure to cower Savinkov's opposition."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.4.t: "Savinkov Dead!"
 russia_kerensky_assassination.4.desc: "It was a mistake to believe that the protests would simply cease. The President's decision to flee the capital by a car proved fatal, as someone - possibly some disgruntled soldier who happened to be a member of the President's staff - had placed a bomb inside the car. Savinkov was terribly wounded in the blast, and died before he could be transferred to a hospital. There is some irony of fate in the fact that a former bomber died from a bombing."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.5.desc: "With the President's death, the Chairman of the Senate will serve as interim President until elections can be arranged. The role falls to Viktor Chernov, Savinkov's sworn enemy. The government is in chaos, as the NRPR has been immediately consumed by a struggle for leadership between Savinkov's followers.\n\nChernov has started negotiations with other large parliamentary blocs for the formation of a temporary government. He has been already approached by the Maria Spiridonova and Aleksey Rykov with the intent of forming broad left-wing government dedicated to a free Russian Republic. However, such a move can be seen as socialist takeover by the still powerful political right and the military. The right is pushing Dmitriy Romanov as the interim president, arguing that as much more moderate option he is able to command loyalty of both the army and the Duma, and stabilise the situation."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.6.desc: "Chernov's joint government with socialists has ruffled some feathers in the Russian High Command, where many generals are still intensely wary of socialism. The hawks such as Kornilov and Manstein are demanding the military to step in, arrest Chernov and the socialist ministers and to put a stop to flirting with communism. Calmer heads are trying to maintain peace, arguing that a military coup would only undermine Chernov's attempts to stabilise the republic. A coup could even make him and the others democratic martyrs to every socialist and liberal in the country."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.7.desc: "The military coup was launched under Kornilov's leadership, but it seems that the army vastly overestimated their support. After a night of fighting, the army took the Kremlin and dissolved the Duma. They have arrested Chernov, but many in his government escaped and fled to Petrograd. Multiple army units have refused to support Kornilov, seeing his coup as attempt to usurp the legitimate democratic government. The popular opinion has swung strongly against the military, and mutinies have become widespread."

 russia_kerensky_assassination.8.t: "The Third Revolution"
 russia_kerensky_assassination.8.desc: "Aleksey Rykov and other socialist leaders have declared a temporary government in Petrograd as response to the Kornilov coup. They have called loyal Russians to rally behind them and against the army's attempt to 'become the second Savinkov'. In the general state of chaos, Red Guards have been formed by the SRs, anarchists, Bolsheviks and other socialists in most cities of western Russia. Most of the violence apparatus is in a dysfunctional state, as men appointed by Savinkov are merely trying to save their own skins as targets for both the military and the socialists.\n\nFighting has started all across the country, with many lower officers and common soldiers siding with Rykov's government rather than the putschist generals. Even many generals have avoided taking part, opposing Kornilov's actions just as much as they are distrustful towards ex-Bolsheviks' 'democratic' government. The combination of passivity and chaos in the ranks of the right, combined with broad popular support to the 'Anti-Kornilov Front' has made the outcome of the fighting clear. Kornilov's forces in Moscow were surrounded and the general himself was forced to surrender.\n\nSoon, Rykov's regime began rounding up the Savinkovites and Kornilovites for trials. Political prisoners are being freed, and anyone complicit in Savinkov's regime is trying to flee the country. Some parts of the army are still resisting, but the miracle of the Volunteer Army does not seem to be happening this time."

The Duma, with the majority of its NRPR members being arrested or having fled, has given support to the new government until new elections can be arranged.

Moving against the protestors would only brand him with Savinkov's crimes, so Wrangel and his closest co-conspirators elected to instead move against the President. Baron Wrangel, alongside Pavel Shatilov, Vladimir Kappel and Mikhail Drozdovsky entered the Presidential Palace and arrested Savinkov on charges of murder and violating the Constitution of Russia.

They began to quickly arrest 'Bolshevik agitators' within the protestors' ranks, which did turn bloody rather quickly. Sporadic fighting in the streets was predictably won by the military, bolstered by the NRPR paramilitary forces. Many were shot, and hundreds of opposition activists were arrested.

 russia_kerensky_assassination.14.desc: "As the streets of Moscow flowed red, a state of emergency was declared by the President, and large number of opposition members of the Duma were arrested for suspected connections with the 'attempted Bolshevik revolution'. This made it possible for NRPR to pass the The Act on Protection of the Republic into effect, which de facto gives the President under state of emergency almost unlimited powers. The last remnants of the resistance are being eradicated by Kornilov's forces and the NRPR paramilitaries, marking the end to free Russia."

 russia.38.d: "During a meeting of the left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Socialist Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov diarchy."

 russia.39.d.savinkov: "Lavr Georgyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. With Kornilov gone nothing stands in the way of Savinkov merging the posts of prime minister and president and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The merger was approved by a dubious plebiscite where more than 90 percent of the electorate voted \"Da\" (Yes). Savinkov now rules a potent and aggravated nation, ready to shed itself of the many humiliations faced since the Weltkrieg and step into the sun once more. The Vozhd commands!"
 russia.39.d.denikin: "Lavr Georgyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov's passing. The first, led by Field Marshal Anton Denikin, favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism. In opposition stands the young officers of Baron Pyotr Wrangel. By no means a liberal, the Baron, however, knows that Russia must modernise and the societal issues of the state be resolved by a certain amount of governmental pragmatism."

 russia.40.d: "With the merger of the offices of president and prime minister, Boris Savinkov continued to solidify his grip over the Russian State by penning Directive No. 1 (also known as the first 'Prikaz Vozhdya'), technically an application of Article 48 of the Constitution. Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organisation and an auxiliary force to the Russian army, tasked to enforce ideological control of the nation.\n\nTo fulfil his revanchist ideals, Savinkov chose to appoint a close ally of his party, entrepreneur and industrialist Aleksey Putilov, as his Minister of the Economy. Putilov has been tasked to transform the Russian economy into a war machine, without any reservations."

 russia.21.t: "'Genghis Khan's Legacy', Nikolay Trubetskoy"
 russia.21.d: "A famous linguist and historian, Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy turned to politics in the 1930s and has now chosen to codify his ideological doctrine of Eurasianism into a single book — \"Genghis Khan's Legacy: A Look at Russian History from the East\". It has already begun making rounds across Russian literary circles and crude quotes are being passed around across the public.\n\nEurasianism believes in the concept of "living space" ("mesto dlya razvitiya"), geographical conditions which define the peoples living within them. People who live in the same biome or geographic area form a common civilisation and have a natural desire to unite. Russia, in their view, forms the core of a "steppe civilisation" which encompasses all peoples in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Eurasianists ascribe them a collective kinship and call for them to unite under Russian rule. Trubetskoy declares that the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and therefore Russia, is the successor to the Mongol Empire and Genghis Khan was a hero of the Russian people.\n\nThis "Russia-Eurasia" needs to embody ideas and beliefs which Eurasianists believe are "Eurasian" — selflessness, heroism, societal hierarchy and obedience. Eurasianists believe that democracy is a form of governance for "sea peoples" and is completely unfitting for Russia — not only should Russia fight against democracy being imposed upon it, but also liberate other non-European nations from Western rule and defeat what they perceive as Western "cultural imperialism".\n\nAfter the publication of the book, its ideas have begun to float around the Russian right."
 russia.21.a: "An interesting concept indeed!"

 russia.22.t: "Never Another Brest-Litovsk"
 russia.22.d: "Now that the situation in Russia has begun to stabilise, the Russian people have begun to turn westward. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk has been paraded as an example of a punitive treaty since its inception, but only now has Russia gotten confident enough to consider repudiating it. Printing presses are publishing maps and treatises where Russia's western neighbours are declared \"German-occupied Western Territories\" and the locals living there are described as suffering, awaiting the return of Mother Russia. This is one issue which can unite the Russian right, left and centre, though for different reasons. Russian nationalists obviously seek revenge against Germany, whereas the leftists see Germany as the hegemon which prevents the rise of socialism and Syndicalism in Europe.\n\nNo matter what regime may be in charge, they will need to place the reconquest of Russia's western territories at the top of the priority list. Few want to see Russia start this war, however. The general line of thought among the Russian populace, intellectuals and politicians is that Russia needs to wait. Observe. And descend like a hawk when Germany is focused elsewhere. Cunning has saved Russia in countless wars before, and this moment will be no different."
 russia.22.a: "... and we can't wait to watch Berlin burn."

 russia.24.t: "Levyj Kartel'"
 russia.24.d: "The assassination of Kerensky and the volatile political situation in Russia have led to the rise of new political forces and new alliances to sustain them. Hoping to consolidate the numerous marginalised far left parties under one banner, the Mensheviks have formed an electoral alliance with the People's Socialist Party and the Trade Union Socialist Party. This alliance, dubbed the \"Left Cartel\" (\"Levyj Kartel\"), is understandably shaky, but nevertheless presents a serious challenge to established political forces in Russia. In its alliance manifesto, the Cartel calls for democratic socialist reform in the Republic, a hostile stance towards German imperialism, and the maintenance of democratic institutions."

Due to heavy pressure and occupation by enemy forces, the Russian Army is unlikely to be able to mount a coordinated defence. As such, [RUS.GetLeader] has opted to go into exile, and mount a defence from their allies' territories. However, with the leader of the alliance in such a dire predicament, it is unlikely that us, and other members of the [RUS.GetFactionName] will pursue a prolonged conflict with the enemies of [RUS.GetNameDef], and will instead seek for peace, out of self-preservation. With this, the collapse of the [RUS.GetFactionName] will be inevitable."

 russia.1902.t: "The Fall of Russia"
 russia.1902.d: "Not long ago, [RUS.GetNameDef] was at the zenith of their power - fueled by revanchist sentiment, the Moscow Accord posed one of the most credible threats to the German world order. Some went as far as to say that, in a few years, Russia was poised to take Germany's place as world hegemon. \n\nHowever, its current war effort has proven to be disastrous. With several major cities fallen, the situation has reached the point where the Russian government can no longer offer serious resistance to its enemies, and has begun to seek peace terms - and with its defeat, the international alliance that it led has broken down. Its surviving members must now fend for themselves in an uncertain future."

 russia.1920.d: "When the working men of Britain rose up against the tyranny of the upper class in 1925, many generals of the failed Soviets in Russia offered their services to our fledging rebels. Since the revolution they had pledged their allegiance to Britain and trained our own officers in exchange for safe harbour and to work towards the international cause. But today, Russia calls once more and they now depart to take up their positions in the new Russian military. After emotional farewells, the exiles have departed for Russia with the blessing and best regards of the whole TUC."
 russia.1920.a: "Godspeed, gentlemen."

 russia.1921.t: "Exiles Arrive From Britain"
 russia.1921.d: "When the British Revolution broke out in 1925, many Bolshevik officers offered their services to the British and since then had resided in the country serving and training the Republican Army. But with our own revolution now arrived, they have returned once more and are ready to help in the fight for world revolution - as soon as we stabilize our political situation."
 russia.1921.a: "The revolution fights on."

 russia.2000.t: "Independence for the Alash Autonomy?"
 russia.2000.d: "Our country, despite nominally being part of Russia with an autonomous status, has been de facto independent since the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite a Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia while repelling an invasion from Turkestan, our status has remained unchanged thanks to Admiral Kolchak's coup attempt. Now, with Russia engulfed in chaos, the time has come to throw off the chains of its oppression and end our servitude to our oppressors!"

While many hotheads in the General Staff are demanding immediate action, ongoing chaos prevents us from responding to this treachery. It seems that we must let Alash-Orda be for now..."
 russia.2001.a: "There is nothing we can do..."

 russia.25.t: "Reorganisation of the Internal Police"
 russia.25.d: "As a symbol of Tsarist repression, the Okhrannoye Otdeleniye (Guard Department) was abolished by the Provisional Government on March of 1917, and never restored. In effect, however, secret police practices in the Russian republic never vanished and simply changed form. The White forces in the Russian Civil War operated their own measures against Bolshevik subversion, and several departments were formed under the Ministry of Internal Affairs to fulfil the same purpose, such as the Third Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, or the Gendarmerie. The government has used these institutions with little hesitation to prevent a second Revolution, the most famous of their actions was the assassination of Tambov revolutionary Aleksandr Antonov.\n\nBy mid 1935, the President was planning to reorganise the internal police and establish the Department for Protecting Order (Otdeleniye po Okhraneniyu Poryadka), which would bear the same name as the Tsarist Okhrana. Though he may have passed, people in our government call to finish his reforms and thus grant us a powerful tool at defending the current order."
 russia.25.a: "A good idea!"

 russia.26.t: "Reforming the Military"
 russia.26.d: "The Armed Forces of the Russian Republic have had a difficult history - it took a decade after the end of the Civil War to restore a stratified, professional army. During the war, it had devolved into cliques of White Generals and their volunteer followers, after all. Still, a lot of work needs to be done before the Russian army can compete with its likely challengers, be it Germany or Japan.\n\nSome see a future in the mobilisation of the Russian masses and predict that the next Weltkrieg will be a total war which will require all of the country's resources dedicated to the front. Others, such as General Sergey Markov, were impressed by the effectiveness of armoured cars, tanks and trains during the Weltkrieg and hope to organise the army around this armoured breakthrough priority. Other officer cliques are more moderate, though their proposals for army reform no less extensive. The ultimate decision lies in your hands, however."
 russia.26.a: "I will have a look."

 russia.184.t: "Reforming the Navy"
 russia.184.d: "Recent naval manoeuvres have led us to one conclusion: the Russian navy is a mess! Sweeping reforms are needed if we are to dominate the seas once more. Each of our top admirals have come up with a plan. Their proposals await the government's consultation."

However, many believe we need to take greater measures to promote the cause of order. But the question is should we keep our democratic progress or should we bring the political system back to the certainties of the Tsarist era? We could also make Wrangel the permanent leader of Russia."
 russia.27.d.dmitriy: "Grand Duke Dmitry has been president for more than a year now and his time in office has been a great success. The people are once again becoming accustomed to the rule by their social betters and now could be the perfect time to restore the Tsarist system. But who should be Tsar, Dmitry or the legitimate Tsar Kirill? Or maybe we should maintain the republic of aristocrats."
 russia.27.d.republic: "More than a year has passed since our assumption of power and we have brought some measure of stability to the country. Changes to our political system could bring even more stability, or maybe not - the Republic seems fine as it is."

 rusd.38.t: "Status of the Orthodox Church"
 rusd.38.d: "Article 5 of the Constitution of the Russian Republic states that 'Russia is henceforth a state in which no faith or belief can have privileges and rights which other faiths do not share, and religion does not have a say in government'. For a country which, up to that point, was built upon the Russian Orthodox Church, this was a rather shocking change in policy which many people could not agree with. In 1927, the Church saw a new Patriarch rise - Kirill, who has since been vehement in his crusade to amend the Fifth Article and grant the Church a prestigious status in the Russian republic. Now that Kerensky is gone and new people are in charge, he has officially petitioned the government to amend the Constitution and elevate the Church to the status of a state religion."

 rusd.40.t: "The Patriarch Criticises Our Government"
 rusd.40.d: "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state.

 rusd.44.d.orthodox: "A small celebration dedicated to the prosperity of our Motherland has been performed yesterday in one of our towns. Even though it was very modest in scale and attendance, it attracted the conservative media's attention. Many common people consider this to be a visible sign of the Church's support for the Motherland."

 rusd.48.a: "Let them shout!"

 rusd.49.t: "Unrest Among the Military"
 rusd.49.d: "The election of Shlyapnikov to the position of interim president seems to have caused negative repercussions. Much of the top military leadership have vocally spoke out against his premiership and it is alleged that privately, those generals both vocal and quiet of the situation have signalled that they would not intervene were the president to be deposed. Among the lower levels of the military there has been great unrest with reactionary agitation whipping the soldiers into an unruly frenzy."

 rusd.56.d.wrangel: "The Romanov pretender, Kirill Romanov, has died. His son Vladimir is in his early twenties and may make an excellent and pliable figurehead as Tsar. Perhaps now it is time to restore the Monarchy?"
 rusd.56.e: "Yes, a new Tsar shall promote order and stability!"
 rusd.56.f: "No, the time of the Tsars is over."

 rusd.57.t: "The Investment Debate"
 rusd.57.d: "The ability to help fund the Zemstva institutions is a double-edged sword. As it stands, the Zemstva only invest money they gain from local taxes, and if something happens, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] can always pin the blame on the local governor and have him replaced, without mentioning the advantages inherent in such a localised form of management. On the other hand, this does limit the scope of what they can achieve. The moment we step in, however, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will be held responsible for anything that fails.\n\nFor this reason, some are recommending cautious - if any - investments on our part. While some cite the need to not get involved in every minor issue in every Siberian hamlet, more market-oriented ministers cite that the Zemstva have largely been doing just fine without our direct intervention and that the state should allow the local governance to function as intended. Other ministers, however, prefer a more direct approach by the government and insist that we can't let a handful of irresponsible career politicians blind us to the potential benefits we could reap by providing state funding to the Zemstva."
 rusd.57.a: "Keep it small."
 rusd.57.b: "Give them increased funding."
 rusd.57.c: "Make a large investment."

 rusd.58.t: "Direction of Investment"
 rusd.58.d: "As we help expand the Zemstva institutions, new investment opportunities have opened up. Now we must decide where and how to direct our investments, in order to maximise their impact."
 rusd.58.a: "Focus on bureaucratic matters."
 rusd.58.b: "Fund industrial development of the region."
 rusd.58.c: "Invest in local research facilities."

 rusd.59.t.hospital: "Healthcare Expansion"
 rusd.59.d.hospital: "Today marked the opening of a number of new hospitals. As the more localised form of government under the Zemstva allows for local leaders to react more quickly and precisely to the needs of the local citizenry, the new hospitals mark a fast response to what could otherwise have turned into a regional health crisis in the wake of our rapid growth. As living standards improve, so too will satisfaction with our government."

 rusd.59.t.schools: "New Schools Opened"
 rusd.59.d.schools: "Thanks to well-placed investments, the state has seen a remarkable up-tick in schools built and teachers being trained. The rapid improvements being made to the education system has led to a marked improvement in the quality of life for the locals. Another success for the Zemstva is another success for the government as well."

 rusd.59.t.housing: "Zemstva Housing Programme"
 rusd.59.d.housing: "A housing programme initiated by local Zemstva has yielded positive results so far. Already we're seeing reports that homelessness is at a record low. As people's lives improve, so too will their patriotism. After all, fighting for their land is an easier sell when their government makes sure they have a roof over their heads."

 rusd.59.t.civilian_industry_1: "Industrial Expansion"
 rusd.59.d.civilian_industry_1: "A Zemstva consisting of many wealthy industrialists has seen considerable investments into building new factories in the region. These newly expanded industrial concerns have proved a boon to the local economy, and the expansion of industry in the region will inevitably be a boon to the state as well."

 rusd.59.t.civilian_industry_2: "Economic Development"
 rusd.59.d.civilian_industry_2: "Several Zemstva have pooled their resources and expertise together and embarked on a major economic stimulus plan for the region. Millions of rubles have poured into local companies and the large up-tick in economic activity has acted like a magnet for outside investments as well. Stores and factories have opened in several cities and new railroads are bringing goods from one end of the region to store shelves across Russia. Naturally, these riches will inevitably trickle their way upstream to [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as well."

 rusd.59.t.military_industry: "Increased Arms Production"
 rusd.59.d.military_industry: "Investments by local merchants in modernising production methods have recently resulted in a large up-tick in productivity. With goods filling store shelves at record speeds, we should also count ourselves lucky that the benefits of these investments are trickling down to many of our state-run companies as well. More civilian goods are nice, but we're equally concerned with the more pressing matters of state defence."

 rusd.59.t.civilian_industry_3: "Large Industrial Expansion"
 rusd.59.d.civilian_industry_3: "Several cities have become epicentres of what can best be described as a localised industrial revolution. A good investment climate, an abundance of expertise and a visionary ruling class has led to the gradual establishment of a new industrial concern in these regions. Thousands of people now find themselves employed on these factory floors and goods are being produced at an astonishing rate. This is clearly a great success for our economic policies!"

 rusd.59.t.infrastructure: "Infrastructural Improvements"
 rusd.59.d.infrastructure: "A local governor, appalled by the poor state of the roads in the region, has paid for the construction of new ones out of his own pocket. Over the past several weeks, labourers have put their shovels into the ground and helped to improve our infrastructure. The local papers may be praising his efforts, but it's ultimately the government in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that reap the benefits of this act of generosity."

 rusd.59.t.agriculture: "Increased Crop Yields"
 rusd.59.d.agriculture: "New agricultural initiatives have recently led to a large bumper crop this year! Store shelves are full and so are the bank accounts of the farmers! Of course, one way or another, a lot of the benefits of this abundant yield will trickle back to us in due time."

 rusd.59.t.synthetics: "Breakthrough in Synthetic Oil"
 rusd.59.d.synthetics: "It'd seem that the recent spending increases towards the Zemstva has yielded a tremendous breakthrough! We have reports that they've established a synthetic plant, adding a healthy production to its fuel and rubber production. This will help keep the region's population more self-sufficient, and is already yielding large export profits. Naturally, this development is quite pleasing to our military industrial complex as well..."

 rusd.59.t.failure_1: "Mismanagement Plagues the Zemstva"
 rusd.59.d.failure_1: "While more decentralised rule has its benefits, the lack of government oversight can sometimes have a negative side as well. We've recently been informed that many factories and companies are poorly run due to gross mismanagement, a situation that unfortunately has flown under the radar for longer than it ought to have. While the governor of the region has stepped in to remedy matters, we're nonetheless left paying the price for not being able to stop this widespread neglect sooner."

 rusd.59.t.failure_2: "Zemstva Embroiled in Embezzlement Scandal"
 rusd.59.d.failure_2: "Though our laissez-faire approach to economic matters has been a great boon to the economy, the lack of oversight means that sometimes the wealth being generated ends up in the pockets of crooks. The country recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down. As their findings seem to indicate that this is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, it seems like we'll be battling this kind of corruption for the foreseeable future..."

 rusd.59.t.failure_3: "A Zemstvo Needs a Bailout!"
 rusd.59.d.failure_3: "A string of failed investments and poor planning has led to several key companies involved in a Zemstva project going so far down into the red that we have no choice but to provide them with a government bailout to keep their projects from utterly falling apart. We'll just have to bite the bullet on this one, tighten our belts, pay up, and tighten our belts in the coming months ahead. Needless to say, the governor that greenlit this will have some explaining to do..."

 rusd.59.t.industrial_research_failure: "Industrial Research Set Back!"
 rusd.59.d.industrial_research_failure: "Our researchers in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are reporting a major setback. The professors in the employ of the Zemstva made a dire miscalculation in their assessments and it turns out (unfortunately only after extensive testing) that a lot of their hard work was based on a faulty premise. Unfortunately, some of our state-run research teams had used their work as a basis for their own projects as well, meaning that we're likely to see an overall slowdown of our research efforts in the months ahead."

 rusd.59.d.military_research_failure: "Terrible news! Smoke billowed out of a main research centre in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today as their tests... Well, quite literally blew up in their faces. Although no one's injured, we've learned the hard way that there are no shortcuts when it comes to putting out even bigger guns for our military to use.

 rusd.61.d.republic_1937: "According to the Constitution of 1922, elections to the both houses of Parliament are to be held every five years.

 rusd.66.t: "Chernov and Tsereteli Break"
 rusd.66.d: "For the longest time, the Social Democratic Labour, still called the \"Mensheviks\" despite their Bolshevik counterparts having long since vanished to history, were the primary source of opposition to Savinkov's regime from the left. Its leader, Irakliy Tsereteli, failed to take advantage of all of the party's potential, however, mostly because he refused to - vehemently opposed to petty politicking, backstabbing and manipulation, he was one of the few political leaders in Russia truly guided by ideals rather than pragmatism. On the other side stood Viktor Chernov, who was once an idealist like Tsereteli, but twenty years after the Constituent Assembly have left him a changed man, and he had since become the political machine behind the politics of the Russian centre.\n\nThe January events pushed the two leaders closer to one another, forming a plural left alliance between them, but it was not to last. After several months of cooperation, the Mensheviks have finally broken with their Socialist-Revolutionary allies. This has once again left the Russian left splintered. The Mensheviks are taking a turn towards the left, courting the Syndicalist-influenced extremists, who, to Tsereteli, are better than the SRs, whereas Chernov has once again made his way to the Kadet benches to negotiate an alliance."

 rusd.106.t: "Maxim Gorky Dies"
 rusd.106.d: "Russian writer Aleksey Maximovich Peshkov, better known under his pen name Maxim Gorky, died today in Moscow at 68. A fellow traveller of the Bolsheviks, he experienced oppression under the Tsarist regime but was quite doubtful during the October Revolution, thus avoiding reprisals after the Civil War. As he narrowly followed his son in death many think that his sudden death could be due to the changing political atmosphere in Russia."
 rusd.106.a: "I assure you, 68 is old age!"

 rusd.109.t: "Lavr Kornilov Dies"
 rusd.109.d: "Field marshal Kornilov, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, has passed away. Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."

 rusd.120.t: "Black Monday Hits Russia!"
 rusd.120.d: "Almost three weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the shock waves of the crash have reached Russia. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid off their workers, the Russian ruble is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking."
 rusd.120.a: "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst!"

 rusd.122.t: "The Kurchatov Petition"
 rusd.122.d: "Particle physicists have achieved many breakthroughs in Russia in the 1930s. Spearheaded by scientists such as Igor Kurchatov, Abram Alikhanov, Georgy Flyorov and others, our experimental research institutes have formed a sound theory on the potential held by nuclear fission. They were not the only ones, however. It is no secret that nuclear physicists in Germany and the Third Internationale have been delving into the potential of nuclear power as well, and all of them have come to the same conclusion — that it can be weaponised.\n\nIgor Kurchatov and several other Russian nuclear physicists have collectively signed a petition and presented it to [Root.GetLeader], where they have rung alarm bells. Kurchatov informs that foreign scientific journals have ceased any and all publications about nuclear research, even the most mundane reports, which can only mean that it has become confidential information and Russia's enemies must be actively developing nuclear armament. The only answer is to create a dedicated Russian nuclear weapons programme — a request which Kurchatov and his peers have been granted. Under [Root.GetLeader]'s personal orders, new facilities have been opened deep in Central Siberia for the RDS-1 project - "Reaktivny Spetsialny Dvigatel" (Reactive Special Engine), which shall recruit Russia's brightest to develop a weapon with the power to manifest Apocalypse on Earth."
 rusd.122.a: "Russia shall wield this superweapon."

 rusd.123.t: "NRPR and the Civil War"
 rusd.123.d: "Before the second Russian Civil War, Boris Savinkov and the National Republicans were one of the most popular political parties in Russia, and they operated an extensive paramilitary organisation known as the Combat Squads. Now, with a war against Savinkov's despised socialists at hand, the former terrorist is at our doorstep, offering his support. He promises that he will be able to bring us forty thousand armed volunteers in a matter of days, and though most of them may not be trained soldiers, their support in this war would be invaluable. Of course, it will also not be free."

 rusd.124.d: "Volga-Volga is a Russian film comedy directed by Grigori Aleksandrov, released on April 24, 1938. Widely claimed to be Boris Savinkov's favourite movie, this classic musical comedy is a must-see. It centres on a group of amateur performers on their way to Moscow to perform in a talent contest called the Moscow Musical Olympiad. Most of the action takes place on a steamboat travelling on the Volga River."
 rusd.124.a: "Funny enough to make the Vozhd smile!"

 rusd.125.t: "Bastion of Democracy"
 rusd.125.d: "Maintenance of the democratic regime combined with the stable development of the state led to the emigration of some celebrities from syndicalist countries to Russia. This led, for example, to the arrival in Russia of the good friend of Dmitry Pavlovich, Coco Chanel. That mademoiselle Chanel has chosen to open her office in a village near Tula shows that Russia is a Bastion of Democracy, where everyone can run his or her business without difficulties from the government."
 rusd.125.a: "Glamour in his democracy!"

 rusd.126.t: "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
 rusd.126.d: "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms six months ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this \"Second Weltkrieg\" has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them have chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nThe Petrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces — one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expresses his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the "French sphere", and hope that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech have set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world have been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy... or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."

Accepting this proposal will surely boost the strength of our army and give significant propaganda value - but conservative elements in our armed forces, unwilling to change the status quo, have to be taken into consideration as well..."

 rusd.130.a: "Three hoorays for our caring Tsar!"

 rusd.131.t: "A Plot Against Russia"
 rusd.131.d: "Maria Spiridonova's death was a severe blow to the Left SR, but many enemies of Savinkov's regime remain. As time passed, the Vozhd has turned increasingly paranoid that he will go the way of the tyrants his younger self eliminated with a bomb in his hand, and to ease this paranoia, the National Republican Party has put a plan into action. Russian newspapers have increasingly begun to speak of a 'plot against Russia', orchestrated by Syndicalists and socialists in cahoots with Germany and the other powers. Numerous high ranking public figures such as Dmitry Merezhovskiy and Dmitry Romanov have published their own articles in which they assert that some "bloodletting" is necessary to restore stability in Russia.\n\nUnder the organisation of Okhrana, a wave of mass crackdowns on suspected political opponents has begun. The Okhrana has been given extraordinary powers to search homes and arrest dissidents without the approval of any judicial institution, several notable leftist politicians and publicists have disappeared off the face of Russia outright. While some are given show trials, others, especially the rank and file of the SR, Mensheviks and Syndicalist parties, are summarily executed or deported. Savinkov has personally presided over several of the show trials, especially those for his old comrades in the Socialist Revolutionaries. In private, to Merezhovskiy, he has remarked how much of a catharsis it is to see the Okhrana, the police he used to flee from and fear three decades ago, now bow to his every whim."
 rusd.131.a: "All enemies of the Nation will be stopped."

 rusd.132.t: "All-Russian Nation"
 rusd.132.d: "\"Crimea, White Russia, Little Russia and beyond. No matter what some say, those are our lands, our people. They are waiting for us to liberate them from the German yoke. Will we leave them in trouble? Never. Will we save them? Yes, because we cannot abandon our brothers and sisters. We are the Phoenix that was destroyed and yet reborn. Wait for us - we will come.\" - millions of Russians would hear today on their radios, declared by several energetic speakers under the state propaganda services. The NRPR always decreed irredentism as their primary goal in foreign policy and they were going to live up to their promises.\n\nThough Savinkov's expansionist plans cannot be realised right now, this declaration of common blood and common struggle shows that Russia won't avoid confrontation with the German Empire anymore."
 rusd.132.a: "One nation, one country, one Russia."

 rusd.133.t: "National Rebirth"
 rusd.133.d: "Though Savinkov has never been much of a public speaker, his National Republican Party has always been one of spectacle politics, and their growth in power has only made this more visible. Mass rallies of NRPR members are held across the country, hundreds of thousands attending and flooding the streets to intimidate political opponents with this display of popular might. Armed members of the Combat Squads, Savinkov's personal paramilitary, maintain order — their black uniforms, modelled after the Kornilov Regiment from the Civil War era, make them easily stand out from the crowd. The speakers in these rallies vary in their topics and invoked themes, but a few of them are shared — Russia's impending national rebirth and return to greatness, the complete reformation of the state, and the role of two living giants in seeing this through — Lavr Kornilov and Boris Savinkov.\n\nStarting with "The Pale Horse", Savinkov has consistently invoked the theme of "national rebirth" in his literature. Borrowing the original concept from Russian Symbolists, such as Dmitry Merezhkovskiy, he asserts that a new, stronger Russia will be born through pain and suffering, and this third Russia, neither Tsarist nor democratic, will be able to assert its rightful place among the Great Powers. Though Savinkov has never personally used the term, his emphasis on nationality, national unity, and the power of the masses, the populus, to restore national glory, got the intellectual Nikolay Trubetskoy to dub it "National Populism" (Natsionalniy populizm). When he coined the term in the 1920s, Trubetskoy meant it in a negative light, implying that it is little more than populistic slogans, but it has since become popular, even among parties outside of Russia who try to imitate the NRPR."
 rusd.133.a: "Russia for the Russians!"

 rusd.134.t: "VDNKh"
 rusd.134.d: "Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (\"Vystavka Dostizheniy Narodnogo Khozyaystva\" or VDNKh) is one of the most ambitious projects of the new government. Forgotten and unremarkable wasteland in the North-East suburbs of Moscow was turned into an ideal model of the future of Russia. Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour. Moreover, this exhibition is used by the government to help the farmers to establish contacts between them and the new regime and also to conclude long-term contracts with the Republic."
 rusd.134.a: "That's how we will rebuild Russia."

 rusd.135.t: "Supreme Privy Council"
 rusd.135.d: "Though Savinkov and Kornilov have established a dictatorship, disputes between Savinkov's NRPR republicans and Kornilov's young officers can still endanger the cooperation of these two sides of the new regime. It is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate to use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and the NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council ('Verkhovnyi Tainyi Sovet'), which once had both executive and legislative power and consisted of a small number of the most important Russian ministers. Membership of the SPC, known as "Verkhovniki", will consist of 3 party members with Savinkov on top along with Kornilov and 3 of his old comrades from the Russian Army. The Council will be able to issue executive orders, which will have superiority over Russian law."
 rusd.135.a: "History repeats itself."

 rusd.136.t: "Feliks Yusupov and the SPC"
 rusd.136.d: "The richest man of Russia, well-known aristocrat Feliks Yusupov has always wanted to take part in the political life of Russia, but even using his money he could get only a small group of the supporters in the Senate and State Duma. With the creation of the SPC Yusupov has finally understood how he can get one of the highest posts in the Russian Republic. Yusupov has proposed to create the united civil and military engineering organisation with him on the top, which will use Yusupov's money as a start-up capital. But in exchange for this necessary investment for our country, Feliks asks us to make him the new 'Verkhovnik'."
 rusd.136.a: "Feliks, you are the new member of the SPC!"
 rusd.136.b: "There won't be any nobles in the Council!"

 rusd.137.t: "Yusupov's Corporation and Foreign Investors"
 rusd.137.d: "It turned out that using special executive orders of the SPC, Yusupov has seized some foreign factories, which he has included in his monopoly. Though these factories were de-facto stolen from the Russian owners after the end of the Civil war by the foreigners, who didn't pay all taxes during the last decade, anyway they invested some money and now we should give them compensation."
 rusd.137.a: "Feliks, you have to warn us!"

 rusd.139.t: "Reforming the Senate"
 rusd.139.d: "The recent political crisis has shown the need for extensive reform of the governmental apparatus. The Senate is a useless talking shop, many officials are corrupt and local authorities conceal the real situation in their regions. All these problems should be solved as soon as possible. Our plan outlines creation of a power vertical, the Senate's powers will be restricted and a special control commission will be organised and integrated in the state apparatus."
 rusd.139.a: "The new Senate will represent the new Russia!"

 rusd.140.t: "Noviyi Kurs"
 rusd.140.d: "Almost immediately upon assuming power as President, Dmitry Romanov began looking into all the ways he could possibly expand his power while remaining in the trappings of the Constitution. The document has got enough errors that it did not take a long time — soon, the President appeared before the Duma again, this time to announce his "New Course" (Noviyi Kurs). Under this reform programme to the Constitution, the powers of the State Duma have been limited for an indefinite duration of time, and while they remain the main legislative organ in the state, they now have to share their powers with the Senate, which has received the power of legislative initiative, as well as the ability to promulgate executive orders bypassing the Duma outright. As the Senate is far more loyal to the new president than the Duma ever was, it means that Dmitry has gained a powerful tool at his disposal in order to reform the state to his whim."
 rusd.140.a: "Let it be."

 rusd.141.t: "Elite Gymnasiums"
 rusd.141.d: "Each city in the Russian Empire used to have a gymnasium, where the smartest children and the children of the local elite studied. With the republican reforms most of these schools were cancelled and all these students had to study together with the sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums…"
 rusd.141.a: "Elite gymnasiums for the smartest children!"
 rusd.141.b: "Public schools for everyone!"

 rusd.142.t: "Tradition of the Masquerade balls"
 rusd.142.d: "Masquerade balls were widespread among the Russian nobles and students before the revolution in 1917. With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprising is that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."
 rusd.142.a: "This youth is beautiful as Russia itself."

 rusd.143.t: "Mansions of the Aristocrats"
 rusd.143.d: "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the 1920 regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the policies of Dmitry Pavlovich. There is a possible solution to this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."
 rusd.143.a: "Let's hope nobody will notice this reform."
 rusd.143.b: "The senators have enough money, they don't need state investments!"

 rusd.144.t: "Union of Nikolay II"
 rusd.144.d: "\"Union of the perpetuation of the legacy of Nikolay II\" or just \"Union of Nikolay II\" is an organisation, founded by the former tsarist officials such as Pyotr Bark and Vladimir Kokovtsov, who want to keep the remembrance of the last Russian tsar and his policy. They have proposed a programme of the events to show the role of Nikolay II for the Russian people all over the country. The Senate pointed out that we should support this union to establish close connections with the former, but powerful officials. It should allow us to gain some votes of the conservative members of the local and state Dumas."
 rusd.144.a: "We will remember Nikolay for all his good deeds for Russia."
 rusd.144.b: "Many people are still republicans - we won't support the Union."

 rusd.145.t: "Day of Triumph"
 rusd.145.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov, who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give Dmitry Romanov the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nikolay II didn't have. Nothing can stop the Duke from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"
 rusd.145.a: "Long live Dmitry Pavlovich!"

 rusd.146.t: "Endless Deadlock"
 rusd.146.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitry Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
 rusd.146.a: "Oh well."

 rusd.148.t: "Nikolay Ustryalov's History of the Civil War"
 rusd.148.d: "Eminent professor Nikolay Ustryalov has published a history of the Russian Revolution and the Civil War, sparking discourse among intellectuals. In his history, Ustryalov presents a massive break from standard Russian historiography, delving deep into the political and social policy of the Bolshevik movement and doing away with its villainisation. He states that while the bloodshed committed during the Russian civil war was unacceptable and could not be tolerated, Vladimir Lenin and his followers had very clear reformist goals, some of which they implemented - such as calendar reform, land reform, and equality between sexes. If the Bolsheviks were more moderate in their approach, a Russia led by them could have been stronger in the long term. Ustryalov even challenges the limits of our tolerance by considering that the Bolsheviks were the only \"nationalist\" faction in the Civil War - they were supported by no one, whereas the White movement was supported by the Entente Powers and later by Germany.\n\nMore right wing intellectuals, such as Ustryalov's former ally Nikolay Trubetskoy, have challenged this viewpoint, creating a debate in the scientific community on how the Russian Civil War should be treated. It is thanks to our liberal, democratic society that this debate can take place without any intervention from above."
 rusd.148.a: "Hurrah for the freedom of speech!"

 rusd.149.t: "Russo-German Study Society"
 rusd.149.d: "The growth of international Syndicalism and the threat it poses to Russia has gotten a handful of our intellectuals to look towards Germany as a potential ally. The so-called \"Russo-German Study Society\" has been established in Moscow and unites a circle of historians, writers, and politicians who all share staunch right-wing ideals. In its first proclamation, the Society has stated that Russia should finally come to terms with the losses of Brest-Litovsk, and strike an agreement with Germany to reclaim the Caucasus and Central Asia in exchange for forming an anti-Syndicalist axis. This \"Berlin-Moscow Axis\" would be able to overcome Syndicalism through sheer combined might and manpower.\n\nThe Society's call to abandon Russian irredentism in the West has eroded the influence it could have over our policy, however."
 rusd.149.a: "Keep an eye on them, they could be traitors."

 rusd.150.t: "National Rearmament"
 rusd.150.d: "Russia may hold ambitions of retaking the West, but even the most radical Russian nationalists can tell that she will not be able to challenge Germany in this state. Her military industry has been neglected and her economy is not yet ready to out-produce the West. Though Russia holds massive potential, many sacrifices will have to be made before we will be able to repudiate the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Which is why these sacrifices have been proposed. The government has been introduced a bill for national rearmanent, including austerity policies and the expansion of state owned arms production enterprises, even if they will come at a cost."
 rusd.150.a: "Anything to reclaim our lost territories!"
 rusd.150.b: "Limited expansion should be enough."

 rusd.151.t: "All Quiet in the Senate"
 rusd.151.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov could finally stop the lasting crisis which weakened Russia. Though the problem is that Dmitry Pavlovich doesn't always pay attention to the advice of the Senate and it often leads to the misunderstanding between the Grand Duke and this important state authority. But there are still good chances that they will find a proper way to negotiate and to recover Russia."
 rusd.151.a: "We hope so."

 rusd.152.t: "The National Bloc"
 rusd.152.d: "Dmitry Romanov has yet to get accustomed to his new duties and powers, which means that a large clique is starting to gather around him in hope that they will be able to use him to their interest. After negotiations, the Octobrists and a plethora of smaller political parties have chosen to join forces, gathering to a tight political alliance named the National Bloc. Its political programme calls for extensive political and social reform to maintain stability and prevent the growth of radical left wing forces, it is funded by several industrialist lobbies and supported by aristocrats.\n\nThe National Bloc has thrown its full weight behind President Romanov, granting him and his government a stable base of supporters in both houses of Parliament."
 rusd.152.a: "It is time for a return to normalcy."

 rusd.153.t: "Dmitry Romanov Assumes Power"
 rusd.153.d: "The Kremlin Palace in Moscow was not left vacant for long. Dmitry Romanov, Grand Duke of the House of Romanov and member of the Senate, has been elected as the new President of Russia with a narrow majority of Octobrists, Russian nationalists, Eurasianists, and right wing Kadets. Playing the role of a "Modern Romanov", Dmitry finds his appeal among conservative republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, both of whom see a saviour in the man. After getting elected by the Senate, the Grand Duke declared it as his first intention to restore stability to the fallen nation - surprisingly, or perhaps not so, he made sure to omit any promises to support democracy in particular. Neither he nor the right-wing Senators who stand behind his back are all that thrilled with the democratic governance which the Left champions, although they're fine with paying lip service to it.\n\nThe people await the first actions of their new President."
 rusd.153.a: "Perhaps he can save Holy Russia."

 rusd.154.t: "The Summer Camps of \"Yunarmiya\""
 rusd.154.d: "One of the most important aims of the \"Yunarmiya\" is the formation of the summer camps for the children, where they will be able to spend summer and be involved in the various activities, studying the new ideology of Russia. Our Vozhd proposes that the first camp, called \"Sovyonok\" (\"Owlet\") should be built in the Yekaterinodar region, on the Black Sea coast. It seems to be a perfect place for the Russian children, where they will have fun for three months."
 rusd.154.a: "They will remember this summer as a long one, maybe even as an everlasting."

 rusd.155.t: "The New Duma?"
 rusd.155.d: "After Savinkov's rise to power, the lower house of the Russian parliament - the State Duma - was dissolved. However some members of the Supreme Privy Council propose to re-establish this authority with limited powers. Besides the National Republican Party of Russia (NRPR) led by Savinkov, which will definitely have a majority, various business circles as well as conservative groups and politicians also want to take part in the election, promising that they will support our new state policy, but they also want to represent their interests and help the government to strengthen the Russian economy as well as the army. Though their support can be important for Savinkov, there is a chance that one day they will try to take control over the country..."
 rusd.155.a: "NRPR is strong, but needs connections in the elite. Start the elections!"
 rusd.155.b: "We don't need any independent legislators as well as the State Duma itself."

 rusd.156.t: "The New Duma Is Elected!"
 rusd.156.d: "After the elections to the State Duma, Savinkov's NRPR got 73%. The conservative and right parties as well as the movements led by the representatives of the Russian business and industry got the remaining 27% of the vote. It seems that the new legislators are ready to change Russian laws to improve the situation in the country."
 rusd.156.a: "Very well."

 rusd.157.t: "The Myth of October"
 rusd.157.d: "Though the Bolshevik Party may be destroyed and its influence rendered null by the Syndicalist movement, the October putsch, called a Revolution by some, left Russia changed forever. This means that it is very easy to blame Russia's faults and weaknesses not on inaction, not on the failures of the current government, but on the Bolsheviks who supposedly ruined it all - and the NRPR is sure to take advantage of this myth. History textbooks are being amended, a mass propaganda campaign started, and the message sent that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. An international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, was responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."
 rusd.157.a: "You wanted to revoke our rights in 1917, but now you will lose yours."

 rusd.158.t: "Vox Populi"
 rusd.158.d: "Boris Kamkov, pre-1917 Savinkov's ally and later one of his main enemies, who had became the leader of the Left SRs after the assassination of Maria Spiridonova, died this night in Moscow. It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the \"vox populi\" about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."
 rusd.158.a: "Farewell Boris, farewell Boris, I'll see you in my dreams."

 rusd.159.t: "Shattering the Democratic Opposition"
 rusd.159.d: "Until this point, leaders and high ranking members of the "establishment" parties, namely the Kadets, Right SR and Octobrists, have gotten away lightly. As long as they did not raise too much of a fuss, they were allowed to keep on living and doing their jobs. The extent to which Russia is rapidly being transformed to Savinkov's wishes intimidates them, as much as it did the socialists, and so they ultimately decided they had enough. Viktor Chernov, Pavel Milyukov and Ariadna Tyrkova have collectively drafted a manifesto in which they declared the formation of a Movement to Restore the Constitution and sent a demand to Savinkov to resign and allow free elections.\n\nSavinkov was not pleased, and the regime immediately moved against the democrats. A crackdown on democratic leaders has begun, numerous newspapers have been closed and their editors arrested, and the prisons overflowing with political arrests yet again. The downfall of the democratic constitutionalists left the last possible challenge to Savinkov's unquenched ambition dead in a ditch."
 rusd.159.a: "It was not a matter of if. Only when."

 rusd.160.t: "The Purge"
 rusd.160.d: "Though thousands have already been summarily executed and many more arrested for real or suspected crimes, Savinkov's paranoia has not been satiated. Enemies still lurk at every corner to him and the Syndicalists may come for his head any moment now. This is where one of the rising stars in the National Republican Party and the Deputy Minister of Interior, Viktor Abakumov, stepped in to offer a solution. To ensure that the Vozhd's rule is forever solid and his regime lasts a thousand years, the Russian nation must learn to fear, and above all else, its enemies must learn to fear.\n\nAbakunov's brainchild is a purge not from the top down, done via orders to arrest this dissident or that dissident, but instead from the bottom up. All regional governors need to be given quotas of "enemies of the state" they need to find, extract, and purge. Those who do not deserve a bullet to the back of the head should work off their debt instead - the Tsarist Okhrana laid the groundwork for deporting thousands of dissidents to Siberia, but this system can be modernised, industrialised, and turned into an archipelago of destruction. Even those who are not plotting against Russia must know their place - Abakunov offers to incentivise ratting out possible enemies of the state in workplaces, schools or even families, creating an atmosphere of worry and uncertainty under which the masses will flock to the only thing which can keep them safe, loyalty to the Vozhd.\n\nEven fellow members of the NRPR believe that Abakumov's proposal is... crazy, but Savinkov has taken personal interest in the proposal."
 rusd.160.a: "This all sounds rather dreary..."
 rusd.160.b: "Just like we said. Through pain, a stronger Russia will rise."

 rusd.161.t: "Trial of the Left Separatists"
 rusd.161.d: "The NRPR's policy towards Russia's numerous ethnic minorities has always been very abstract. Though much of its support comes from Russian nationalists, Savinkov himself recognises that Russia is too ethnically divided for him to be able to go too far. What he and the Party can do, however, is take action against Russia's ethnic minorities via proxy. During the Russian Civil War, many ethnic minority groups joined the Bolshevik side, hoping to achieve autonomy in a greater Soviet Russia, and thus gained the collective term of "Left Separatists".\n\nCiting this as an example of possible minority disloyalty, Savinkov's regime has begun the move against them, pressuring numerous ethnic newspapers to close and arresting hundreds of high profile minority politicians, such as Jews, Tatars, Finns, Volga Germans, and Yakuts. Minority regions have had their administration staffed with "loyalists", generally Russians."
 rusd.161.a: "You fought the law and the law won!"

 rusd.163.t: "Pavel Gorgulov and the KPZ-NRPR"
 rusd.163.d: "Rapidly growing in strength during the 1930s, the NRPR absorbed several other far right parties in the Russian sphere to its enormous mass, all of them bringing political concepts and ideas of their own. One of these was the Peasant Green Party (Kryestyanskoy partii zelyonikh), led by Pavel Gorgulov, a Kuban Cossack writer and political ideologue. Though as Russian chauvinist, anti-semitic and nationalist as any other member in Savinkov's party, the KPZ emphasises the connection which the Russian people have with the soil and with the peasant life.\n\nAfter Savinkov's takeover of Russia, Pavel Gorgulov, now appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, has began taking on tours across the country, bringing the message of the NRPR to dozens of villages across Central and Southern Russia. His call of "Russia for Russians" and this emphasis on the "national peasantry" reflects in the reforms he's undertaken ever since his appointment — their aim is to turn Russian villages into tightly knit, ethnically pure communities, perfectly obedient to the Vozhd and representative of Russian national superiority.\n\nGorgulov's views are also highly esoteric and even his subordinates aren't sure whether he is... sane. His emphasis on the peasantry culminates in his messianic belief that "wild, primitive and Scythian" Russian civilisation will prevail over Western civilisation and establish a new order across the world. His somewhat low ranking role in the government means that this creed has little influence over the government, although his "agrarian" faction within the NRPR, composed mostly of former members of the KPZ, stands by his ideology."
 rusd.163.a: "Interesting ideas..."

 rusd.164.t: "The Russian Academy of Sciences"
 rusd.164.d: "While the Moscow Accord and our membership within it is, theoretically, of a purely military nature, the reality is far more complex than that. One of the legacies of the Great War was the advent of mass mobilisation - the consolidation of large swathes of potentially useful sectors of society into an apparatus designed to aid the war effort. The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\n\nTo this end, the old and prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences has been given a new mandate by [RUS.GetNameDef] - the coordination of research efforts across Russia and her allies, and the swift dissemination of breakthroughs between them, particularly breakthroughs with potential military applications. As we are currently on very good terms with Russia, we have been extended an invitation to contribute talent to this programme and share research between us and other participating nations. The potential boons that this could have for our technological development are, of course, obvious and plentiful."
 rusd.164.a: "Excellent."

The Economy of Transamur, a rebellious state created via Japanese incursion during Russian civil war, started to experience serious economic difficulties thanks to relatively unrestricted influx of cheaper goods, coming through the recently liberated Trans-Siberian railroad. The weakened state can now be easily taken with a detachment of a few soldiers."
 rusfor.1082.a: "Claim Transamur! All Russians must be under Russian rule!"
 rusfor.1082.b: "Send a detachment of troops to Vladivostok to dissolve Transamur!"

 rusfor.1083.t: "The Russians Claim Transamur!"
 rusfor.1083.d: "Following the re-establishment of Russian control over the Trans-Siberian railroad the Russians have announced that the Transmur-Primorsk region is rightfully a Russian province! Can we afford to oppose an increasingly powerful Russia for the sake of Transamur or should we concentrate on China?"
 rusfor.1083.a: "Send a warning, Transamur is our protectorate!"
 rusfor.1083.b: "Abandon Transamur to its fate."

 rusfor.1084.t: "Russian Troops Arrive in Vladivostok!"
 rusfor.1084.d: "Following the re-establishment of Russian control over the Trans-Siberian railroad the Russians have decided to enlist the support of some rebellious Transamurian capitalists in order to establish control over the Primorsk territory by force! Can we afford to oppose an increasingly powerful Russia for the sake of Transamur or should we concentrate on China?"
 rusfor.1084.a: "We shall defend Transamur!"
 rusfor.1084.b: "Abandon Transamur to its fate."

 rusfor.1087.t: "Transamur Is Russian!"
 rusfor.1087.d: "Facing the threat of Russian military force and deprived of the support of the local capitalists and the Japanese, Transamur's government is ready to collapse in the face of the popular will. We can now do what we like with Transamur but it has been independent for a long time and will be difficult to integrate into our country. Perhaps some sort of compromise is needed?"
 rusfor.1087.a: "Put their leaders on trial and incorporate Transamur!"

 rusfor.1088.t: "The Japanese Have Sent a Warning"
 rusfor.1088.d: "The Japanese are not happy that we are interfering in Transamur's internal politics and have warned us that it is rightfully a Japanese protectorate. However, they have other military concerns at the moment and may not be willing to risk a two front war to protect a colony of minimal importance."
 rusfor.1088.a: "Call their bluff, send in the troops!"

 rusfor.1089.t: "The Russian Army Enters Our Territory"
 rusfor.1089.d: "Not fearing the threat of Japanese involvement since our liberation the Russians have sent an army to Vladivostok with the hope to annex our territory. How shall we react to this aggression?"
 rusfor.1089.a: "We're no match for the Russians."
 rusfor.1089.b: "We'll never surrender!"

 rusfor.1113.t: "Russia Seizes Tuva"
 rusfor.1113.d: "Our government has awoken this morning to the news that Russian troops have crossed the border and taken control of Tuva and Khem Beldyr. How shall we answer this insult?"
 rusfor.1113.a: "This isn't worth fighting for..."
 rusfor.1113.b: "Tuva is rightfully ours!"

 rusfor.1114.t: "[FROM.GetName] Surrenders!"
 rusfor.1114.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has bowed down and accepted our rightful claim on the Russian lands they possessed; we are now in possession of Northern Mongolia once more!"
 rusfor.1114.a: "Great!"

 rusfor.1116.t: "Border Clashes in Tuva!"
 rusfor.1116.d.baron: "We have just received a written response from the \"Mad Baron\" himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. In his response the Baron presents us with nothing more than a series of excuses, attempting to justify a demand to return 'rightful Mongol territory'. The strongman of Asia has shown his true colours, grovelling at our feet hoping that we will overlook his defiance."
 rusfor.1116.d.other: "We have just received a response from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government, demanding the return of Tuva and presenting a series of flimsy excuses as to why the state is rightfully [FROM.GetAdjective] territory. They have mobilised, and clashes have already begun between [FROM.GetAdjective] and [ROOT.GetAdjective] troops."
 rusfor.1116.a: "What impudence! We shall crush them."

 rusfor.1180.t: "Russia Demands Bessarabia"
 rusfor.1180.d.ROM: "Yesterday the Russian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, we will lose a major part of our territory, but if we refuse, we shall face an immediate Russian invasion. How should we react to these awful claims from the Russian leadership?"
 rusfor.1180.d.ROM_overlord: "Yesterday the Russian government demanded the return of the Bessarabia region. If we agree with Russian claims, Romania will lose 1/3 of its territory, but if we refuse, we shall both face an immediate Russian invasion. How should we react to these awful claims from the Russian leadership?"
 rusfor.1180.a: "Accept their terms."
 rusfor.1180.b: "Never!"

 rusfor.1181.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
 rusfor.1181.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government published a note, where it insists that Bessarabia is rightfully Romanian territory, and Russia will never get it back. The only solution to this problem for us is war with [From.GetNameDef]."
 rusfor.1181.d.ally: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has politely refused our request, stating their hard-won conflict against the Romanians, and their wish to preserve goodwill between themselves and their subservient government in Bucharest."
 rusfor.1181.a: "Then it is war."
 rusfor.1181.b: "Back down."
 rusfor.1181.c: "Cheeky bastards."

 rusfor.1182.t: "The Transfer of Bessarabia"
 rusfor.1182.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to transfer the larger part of Bessarabia in return for monetary and material compensation as well as the guarantee of the security of their new borders!"
 rusfor.1182.d.ally: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to transfer the larger part of Bessarabia as a sign of goodwill to their valiant allies!"
 rusfor.1182.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

 rusfor.1183.t: "Russia Requests Bessarabia"
 rusfor.1183.d: "Yesterday the Russian government requested the return of the Bessarabia region. As it comes from the leader of our mutual alliance, and the former controller of the state in question, the request was an amicable one. If we agree with Russian claims, Romania will lose 1/3 of its territory, but our allies will be grateful for the support."
 rusfor.1183.a: "This seems reasonable."
 rusfor.1183.b: "It suits the Romanians better."

 rusfor.1190.t: "Russia Demands Armenia"
 rusfor.1190.d.TUR: "Under the pretense of 'protecting the Armenian Christian people', Russia has issued series of outrageous demands that would essentially cede control of Armenia up to the city of Kars to Russia. In attempt to seem diplomatic, they even offered that the Armenians should hold a referendum themselves, with Russians guaranteeing the freedom of such election. It's all just an imperialist charade, but they seem to be serious. Threat of military escalation is imminent."
 rusfor.1190.d.TUR_overlord: "Our loyal regime in Istanbul informed us that under the pretense of 'protecting the Armenian Christian people', Russia has issued series of outrageous demands that would essentially cede control of Armenia up to the city of Kars to Russia. In attempt to seem diplomatic, they even offered that the Armenians should hold a referendum themselves, with Russians guaranteeing the freedom of such election. It's all just an imperialist charade, but they seem to be serious. Threat of military escalation is imminent."

 rusfor.1191.d: "[From.GetName] has refused to accept any of our diplomatic overtures and have declared the entire incident as one of \"Moscow's power-hungry delusions\". In a defiant act, they have moved more and more units to our border, clearly willing to fight over the matter."
 rusfor.1191.a: "Then it is war."
 rusfor.1191.b: "Back down."

 rusfor.1192.t: "The Transfer of Armenia"
 rusfor.1192.d: "In a desperate attempt to avoid total destruction, the occupiers of Armenia have retreated, and have acknowledged our right to protect our Armenian brothers. A referendum was organised promptly after the arrival of the Russian army, which justified annexation of Armenia with great popular support."
 rusfor.1192.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

 rusfor.1210.t: "Ultimatum for Galicia"
 rusfor.1210.d: "The Russians sent us an ultimatum, they want us to cede Galicia to them or they will declare war on us, how shall we react?"
 rusfor.1210.a: "We must accept it."

 rusfor.1212.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is defying our power by refusing our ultimatum, how shall we react to this infamy?"

They are offering us monetary and material compensation as well as a guarantee of the new state borders in return. How shall we react?"
 rusfor.1229.d.FIN_refused_alliance: "In what cannot be described as surprising, the Russian foreign minister has informed our prime minister that since Finland does not wish to be at Russia's side, then they must insist that they gain immediate control of Vyborg and part of Karelia, for their own security. They are offering us monetary and material compensation as well as a guarantee of the new state borders in return. How shall we react?"

 rusfor.1236.d.victory: "The forces of the resurgent Russian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to rip Bessarabia from us, but much to their surprise, we have not only blunted their advance, but actually started to push them back! Perhaps now would be a good time to send a message asking them to come to the negotiating table. The embarrassment they just received should be enough to at least get them to hear us out."
 rusfor.1236.t.defeat: "The Russians Are Beaten!"
 rusfor.1236.d.defeat: "The forces of the resurgent Russian state have begun moving against us in earnest, seeking to reconquer Bessarabia; and as valiant as our efforts may be, ultimately it was in vain. Our forces put up a good fight but were pushed aside, and now the country is holding its breath in anticipation of the hardships of a Russian invasion. There may be hope however, if we sue for peace and cede Bessarabia, the Bear's wrath may be abated just enough to save our country."
 rusfor.1236.a: "We have no choice; send word to Moscow."
 rusfor.1236.b: "We can still win this!"

 rusfor.1237.t.defeat: "The Romanians Hold!"
 rusfor.1237.d.defeat: "Disaster! Our attempt to march into Bessarabia and reclaim that which is ours has been met with far more resistance than we originally envisioned! Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time by now! If this embarrassment continues, our military machine will become the laughingstock of the world! Our foreign ministry recommends we accept their terms, although this may not be seen in the best light by our people..."
 rusfor.1237.a: "Accept; no point in wasting any more Russian lives."
 rusfor.1237.b: "Refuse; they must be taught a lesson!"

 rusfor.1238.d.victory: "With their recent humiliation, the Russian government has reluctantly agreed to renounce their claim on Bessarabia, in exchange for an immediate cession of hostilities and Romanian troops' withdrawal to their side of the border. The storm has come; and we have successfully weathered it."
 rusfor.1238.d.defeat: "While we have successfully managed to convince the Russians to agree to an immediate cession of hostilities and withdrawal of troops, the Russians have not budged on the Bessarabia issue; it is to return to Russian control, as it was before 1918. Fortunately we have managed to preserve the rest of our country any further humiliation, and one day we may have an opportunity to reunite with our brethren again..."
 rusfor.1238.a: "United just to be torn asunder again..."
 rusfor.1238.b: "1812 has been avenged at last!"

 rusfor.1239.t: "Russia Refuses Peace"
 rusfor.1239.d: "Shocking news from Moscow have arrived recently, as the Russians have refused to begin peace negotiations! They claim that the injuries against the Russian nation are too great to overcome, and that the war will not end until Russian troops are marching through Bucharest. We must see to our defences..."
 rusfor.1239.a: "God have mercy."
 rusfor.1239.b: "If it's a fight they want..."

 rusfor.1273.t: "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia."
 rusfor.1273.d: "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."
 rusfor.1273.a: "Create a new Spiritual Administration."
 rusfor.1273.b: "Orenburg Assembly will deal with it!"

 rusfor.1274.t: "Problems in Central Asia."
 rusfor.1274.d: "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Central Asia since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
 rusfor.1274.a: "Oh well..."

 rusfor.1275.t: "Pacification of Central Asia."
 rusfor.1275.d: "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
 rusfor.1275.a: "That's great!"

 rusfor.1300.t: "Offer Peace to Russia?"
 rusfor.1300.d: "As our soldiers continue to mount gains in the grueling war against the Russian bear, calls for peace have only become louder. The Russian invaders are quickly losing ground and have already lost many of their major cities and industrial centres, making a counterattack unlikely. Reports of desertions and even mutinies on the side of our enemy have seemingly become more and more commonplace, and many predict that a full collapse of the Russian army - if it has not already happened - is inevitable.\n\nWhile the leadership in Moscow had previously vowed that they would not seek any conditional surrender with Germany, this now seems to be in doubt. It is now up to us: do we seek terms with Russia? Through a negotiated peace, we will be able to thoroughly dismantle Russian power through breaking off the territories our allies claim, subject them to humiliating economic treaties, and greatly limit the size of their army. Many claim that it will not be enough, but an outright occupation of Russia is not desirable either. It seems that peace will be the best way to secure Germany's hegemony on the content and completely neuter Russian aggression for decades to come."
 rusfor.1300.a: "Of course. Let's end this."
 rusfor.1300.b: "We will seek nothing but unconditional surrender."

 rusfor.1301.t: "Germany Offers Peace"
 rusfor.1301.d: "Through the careful mediation of neutral countries, German diplomats have offered us peace, on their terms. This would include humiliating terms such as giving away territory to their client states in the east, paying a huge amount of reparations, and greatly reducing the size of our army. What do we say?"
 rusfor.1301.a: "We can only accept. There is no choice."
 rusfor.1301.b: "We fight on!"

 rusfor.1302.t: "Russia Accepts Our Terms"
 rusfor.1302.d: "German and Russian leadership decided to meet in Moscow, where the Russians were forced to sign greatly unequal terms. All of our demands were met, and we can finally return home after a long struggle. This is a great day for Germany - and the world!"
 rusfor.1302.a: "Finally!"

 rusfor.1303.t: "Peace in the East?"
 rusfor.1303.d: "The German ambassador in our country has informed us that, with the tides fully turning against Russia's favour, they plan to force Russia's conditional surrender. Russia will cede any claims we have on their territory, should we have any, and they will be forced to demobilise and pay Germany enormous war reparations. The idea of peace is alluring after such a long war, but perhaps we should be skeptical and advise them to further punish Russia."
 rusfor.1303.a: "Yes, let's end this."
 rusfor.1303.b: "No, we fight on!"

 rusfor.1304.t: "The War in the East Continues"
 rusfor.1304.d: "Due to the veto of [FROM.GetName] on a conditional surrender from Russia's part, we will not be having peace with Russia - at least, not until they completely and unconditionally surrender, that is."
 rusfor.1304.a: "Damn!"

 rusfor.1305.t: "The Vozhd Has Met His End"
 rusfor.1305.d: "In the midst of the chaos that followed on from the loss of Moscow and many of the nation's other great cities, contact was lost with the nation's great Vozhd Boris Savinkov as he attempted to relocate to a new base of operations. Many have feared that the worst had come to pass, and today those fears have been confirmed. The Vozhd's lifeless corpse has been recovered, dragged out of the wreckage of his private car, seemingly destroyed by an artillery barrage.\n\nWith the Vozhd's death a power vacuum has been forcefully opened, with Pyotr Wrangel seeming like the man destined to fill it. Few however expect anything from the new leader except his rubber stamping of a Russian surrender, and diplomats have already begun drafting the potential terms with the nation's enemies. It seems that the Russian fire has finally been extinguished..."
 rusfor.1305.a: "It can't be..."

 rusfor.1306.t: "The Vozhd Has Met His End"
 rusfor.1306.d: "In the midst of the chaos that followed on from the capture of Moscow and many of Russia's other great cities, rumours begun to spread like wildfire after the Russian army lost contact with their Vozhd Boris Savinkov as he attempted to relocate to a new base of operations. Today's news has been met with jubilation both in Berlin and across the nation as Savinkov's death has been confirmed at last. While the exact circumstances are not yet known, it appears that the car he was in was hit with an artillery barrage from advancing troops, with soldiers still loyal to him soon finding his lifeless corpse in the wreckage.\n\nWith the Vozhd's death a power vacuum has been forcefully opened, with Pyotr Wrangel seeming like the man destined to fill it. It is widely expected that this man's lasting legacy will be nothing more than the signature left on the document of Russia's surrender, a document already being hastily drafted by diplomats from both sides. It seems that the Russian flame has finally been extinguished for good."
 rusfor.1306.a: "Find the man who fired that shell and give him a medal!"

 rusfor.1307.t: "The Government Collapses"
 rusfor.1307.d: "Since the end of the war, protests have sprung out in various cities demanding the resignation of the government. The utter catastrophe in Russia after the Treaty of Moscow has led [RUS.GetLeader]'s rule to be untenable, and without much bloodshed, they have given up power and allowed an opposition government to form."
 rusfor.1307.a: "It is time we look to a new direction."

# Socialist Events #
 russoc.100.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Join the Internationale"
 russoc.100.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap], having recently become enlightened to the benefits of socialist government, has approached us with a request. They wish to formally join the Internationale. Would such a distant ally be worthwhile?"
 russoc.100.a: "Of course! We welcome them."
 russoc.100.b: "We have no need of them."

 russoc.101.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 russoc.101.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not syndicalist enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
 russoc.101.a: "A poor decision on their part."

 russoc.102.t: "Conflict in the Party"
 russoc.102.d: "The party has come to be divided between three factions, one led by Bukharin and Rykov, one by Kollontai and Shlyapnikov and one by Radek. The first champions a path of socialism at a snail's pace, where cautious industrialisation prevents the creation of a massive state bureaucracy, preserves the Smychka at all costs and bridges the general urban-rural divide in the country.\n\nThe syndicalist faction promotes an economy managed by unions, seeing them as the best way to give workers a voice in the economy and the nation. They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus strongly wish to break up the Smychka in support of the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction led by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation - that is, to extract the peasants’ surplus value and use it towards developing the nation’s productive forces in order to transition Russia into a state ready for socialism - which, in their minds, is best accomplished through five-year plans."
 russoc.102.a: "Socialist front will continue."
 russoc.102.b: "Syndicalism supporters win the day."
 russoc.102.c: "Radek wins a surprise victory."

 russoc.103.t: "The Eastern Threat"
 russoc.103.d: "Despite their best efforts and our generous support, the republican government of Russia has collapsed in the face of the socialist forces' onslaught. This is nothing less than an utter catastrophe - the newly-empowered Russian socialists are all but certain to align with [FRA.GetNameDef] and the Third Internationale, reviving the dreaded spectre of another two-front war. However, [RUS.GetNameDef] will need time to recover from the devastation of the civil war, a time we must use to extend our protection to any countries endangered by the new regime.\n\nGeorgia and Azerbaijan are under threat - we must do whatever we can to protect them, lest they fall to the incoming Russians."
 russoc.103.a: "Offer protection to all threatened nations."
 russoc.103.b: "We don't fear the Russians."

 russoc.105.t: "N.N. Sukhanov's Memoirs of the Revolution"
 russoc.105.d: "For years, the course of events during the October Revolution have been a mystery to the world and the general population. The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."
 russoc.105.a: "Your sacrifice will not be in vain."

 russoc.106.t: "Farmers Begin to Burn Livestock En Masse"
 russoc.106.d: "The government's programme of mass collectivisation, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialise in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the programme of collectivisation to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivised, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivisation of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivisation and has generally destabilised our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialise the nation."
 russoc.106.a: "We will have to educate the farmers on the superiority of collectivisation"

 russoc.107.t: "Search and Requisition"
 russoc.107.d: "The spectre of collectivisation seems to have also now entered the mind of children throughout the republic, as a [RUS.GetAdjectiveCap] form has Cowboys and Indians has become popular, known as 'Search and Requisition.' In this game, there are two teams: kulaks hiding grain and requisitioning brigades intending to requisition the grain. The [RUS.GetAdjectiveCap] government has encouraged this, seeing it as a possibility to increase the influence of Socialists among the children."
 russoc.107.a: "We shall turn the youth into good Socialists"

 russoc.108.t: "Reds and Whites"
 russoc.108.d: "A truly socialist courtyard game has become popular among children, the game in question being called 'Reds and Whites', a form of Cowboys and Indians, where the Cowboys are the Reds and the Indians the Whites. The game has become so popular, in fact, that companies have begun to sell air-guns explicitly for Reds and Whites, with those guns being very popular among children too. The government has strongly supported this, seeing it as a way to mould the youth to be more open to Socialism in the future."
 russoc.108.a: "Children are like soft wax"

 russoc.109.t: "Change in Family Rules Result in Spike in Divorce Rates"
 russoc.109.d: "While many revolutionaries had a religious background or learned at religious schools, they do not have a good opinion of the Church in general, seeking to break the Orthodox Church and its influence on the Russian society both legally and through their public influence. However, while curbing their cultural influence will take longer, the government has begun legally eroding the Orthodox Church's influence.\n\nThe [RUS.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away control over marriage formation from the Church and make it a civil affair of the government. They have also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorces being this easy."
 russoc.109.a: "An unforeseen consequence for sure"

 russoc.110.t: "The Latinisation of the Languages Begins"
 russoc.110.d: "As socialism seeks to unite humanity and wither away states in the future, many in the government have proposed that the [RUS.GetAdjectiveCap] government should begin Latinising the languages in its nations, as the Cyrillic alphabet would impede communication between Western Europe and Russia and the people compromising it, among others. However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the number of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the nations compromising our Union. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoly Lunacharsky, who is known for his rather unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious group."
 russoc.110.a: "It will be worth all the effort"

 russoc.111.t: "Formation of the Young Pioneers"
 russoc.111.d: "The Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organisation has recently been founded after a long conflict between the Komsomol and the scout movement was decided in favour of the scout movement, who wanted an independent organisation while Komsomol wanted to keep them integrated into their organisation. The scouts were helped by the widow of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya, who supported the cause of their movement against Komsomol.\n\nThe intent of the Young Pioneers is to further integrate the youth into the state machinery, swearing an oath to 'stand firmly for the cause of our Communist Party.' While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organisation, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the Young Pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the Young Pioneers consists of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs, which have given the Young Pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as they give many who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."
 russoc.111.a: "Be prepared! Always Prepared!"

 russoc.112.t: "Generals Join the Revolution"
 russoc.112.d: "It is not just the ordinary soldiers who have chosen to defect to the Revolution. Dominated by the White generals of the Russian Civil War, the Russian Army is not the best place to be for the so-called 'new guard', officers and commanders who enrolled in the Russian army after the Civil War. They were barred from numerous prestigious positions and would often struggle to advance in their career. The decay of order in the country and the growth of socialism left many of them sympathising with their cause, and now, with the Second Civil War going ahead, they have defected from their ranks and switched their sides to their brothers-in-arms in Moscow.\n\nImmediately, these brave heroes received commissions in the Red Army and will lead us to victory!"
 russoc.112.a: "Welcome, comrades."

 russoc.113.t: "Defections in the High Command"
 russoc.113.d: "It is not just the ordinary soldiers who have chosen to defect to the traitorous uprising. Dominated by the White generals of the Russian Civil War, the Russian Army is not the best place to be for the so-called 'new guard', officers and commanders who enrolled in the Russian army after the Civil War. They were barred from numerous prestigious positions and would often struggle to advance in their career. The decay of order in the country and the growth of socialism left many of them sympathising with their cause, and now, with the Second Civil War going ahead, they have defected from their ranks and switched their sides to the Bolshevik mobs in Moscow.\n\nImmediately, these traitors have all been tried to death in absentia and will certainly receive due punishment after our victory."
 russoc.113.a: "Traitors, all of them!"

 russoc.114.t: "The Eastern Front of the Internationale"
 russoc.114.d: "Though we have managed to protect the revolution at home, as the world enters crisis after crisis, we remain far from our allies in the West. However, this does not mean we are alone in the East. Now, [RUS.GetNameDef] has embraced the revolutionary cause and stands as the largest Socialist nation in the world. It may be wise to draw closer to nearby [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], lest [INT.GetNameDef] proves to far off to support us."
 russoc.114.a: "Very well."

 russoc.115.t: "Russia Joins the Internationale"
 russoc.115.d.guaranteed: "The Russian socialists, after a period of diplomatic isolation, have joined forces with the Third Internationale, joining the increasingly wide alliance for the cause of world revolution. As we have previously aligned ourselves with the regime in Moscow, an invitation has been extended to us as well. Shall we follow their lead and become a full fledged member of the Internationale?"
 russoc.115.d.invited: "The Russian revolutionaries, having taken control over their country not too long ago, have reached out to us. [RUS.GetLeader]'s diplomats have arrived to our capital, offering a common socialist front against the reactionaries - in the form of membership in the Third Internationale. While this will tie us tightly to the regime in Moscow, something not everyone among our population is happy with, surely the cause of world revolution should trump this nationalist particularism?"
 russoc.115.a: "Yes, let's join forces."
 russoc.115.claims: "We'll join for our claims."
 russoc.115.b: "We shouldn't provoke Germany..."

 russoc.1150.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Territory"
 russoc.1150.d: "Rather than join outright, [From.GetNameDef] has conditionally accepted our proposal in exchange for the return of claimed territories."
 russoc.1150.a: "We accept. Welcome, comrades."
 russoc.1150.b: "We rebuke such revanchism."

 russoc.1154.b: "They had their chance."

 russoc.116.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Seeks Membership in the Internationale"
 russoc.116.d.guaranteed: "We have received a telegram from [FROM.GetName]. A fellow socialist state aligned with Russia, it wishes to tie its future with the worldwide revolutionary cause much like its patron to the east. Shall we give them a seat in our alliance?"
 russoc.116.d.invited: "Through our communications with Russia, we have received information that they have invited [FROM.GetName], a fellow socialist state aligned with the regime in Moscow, to the Third Internationale. Shall we accept the Russian invitation and bring this potential ally to our alliance?"

 russoc.116.b: "No, we don't need them."

 russoc.117.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Protection"
 russoc.117.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our offer, citing that for several reasons, they are unwilling to accept our offer - clearly, they have been overtaken by nationalist particularism instead of dedication to a world revolution."
 russoc.117.a: "Their loss."

 russoc.118.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Membership"
 russoc.118.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has responded to our message and informed us that [FROM.GetName] will not become a member of the Third Internationale."
 russoc.118.a: "What!?"

 russoc.1180.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Membership"
 russoc.1180.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has responded to our message and informed us that [FROM.GetName] will be allowed to become a member of the Third Internationale."
 russoc.1180.a: "Great."

 russoc.119.t: "German Protection?"
 russoc.119.d: "The legitimate regime in Moscow has fallen, and the successors to the Bolsheviks have taken over Russia, declaring their intent to spread the world revolution in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Fortunately, before the Socialists could turn their armies towards us, the diplomatic corps of the German Empire have reached out to us with a message - offering protection from the eastern threat. Shall we join the Germans and tie our destiny to their efforts, or is this unnecessary?"
 russoc.119.a: "Accept their offer."
 russoc.119.b: "Ask for a guarantee instead."
 russoc.119.c: "Refuse."

 russoc.121.b: "We're doing fine on our own."

 russoc.122.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Calls for Aid"
 russoc.122.d: "[From.GetAdjective] diplomats have approached us discreetly, asking us to join their wars in the name of shared struggle for the liberation of mankind. Given our close relations with this, such call is hardly unexpected. Still, we aren't bound to join their conflict - but such move would be hard to justify, given our aligned goals."
 russoc.122.a: "And [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] will answer!"
 russoc.122.b: "They can deal with it on their own."

 russoc.123.t: "Electing the Premier"
 russoc.123.d: "The assembly is now voting on the next Premier of [RUS.GetNameDef], and by extent, whose supporters will take the reins of the revolution from now on. Aleksander Shlyapnikov is the expected winner as a reliable trade union leader and generally well-liked man. However Aleksandra Kollontai has been chalenging his leadership, presenting herself as more revolutionary and bold option."
 russoc.123.a: "Shlyapnikov."
 russoc.123.b: "Kollontai."

 russoc.124.t: "Electing the Premier"
 russoc.124.d: "The assembly is now voting on the next Premier of [RUS.GetNameDef], and by extent, whose supporters will take the reins of the revolution from now on. Aleksei Rykov is reliable organiser especially well versed in economic matters, and preferred by much of the urban workers. Nikolai Bukharin is close to Rykov, but ultimately differs much in policy, as he is proponent of mixed economy and moderation. Finally, Maria Spiridonova is beloved in much of Russia's rural areas as someone who has never forgotten the poor peasantry of Russia."
 russoc.124.a: "Rykov."

 russoc.125.a: "Radek."
 russoc.125.b: "Sverdlov."
 russoc.125.c: "Zinoviev."

# World News Events #
 russianews.0.t: "Assassination of Alexander Kerensky"
 russianews.0.d: "Chairman of the Senate, Alexander Kerensky, has just been shot dead on the stairs of the Senate building in the Kremlin. While the assailant's motives are unknown, Kerensky had acted as the de-facto leader of the Russian opposition, blocking President Boris Savinkov's attempts to further centralise Russia.\n\nThe democratic opposition has already accused Savinkov and his followers for engineering Kerensky's murder. The investigation of the assassination has been left to the Duma, largely made up of Savinkov's party members, which has sparked protests in major cities. It remains to be seen whether Savinkov can weather the storm..."
 russianews.0.a: "Not the first politician Savinkov has killed."

 russianews.1.t: "Boris Savinkov Assassinated"
 russianews.1.d: "Boris Savinkov, President of the Russian Republic since 1934, is dead. In an attempt to flee the capital after massive protests broke out, his car was blown up while he was in it, and he succumbed to his injuries shortly after.\n\nIn the wake of his assassination, a power vacuum has opened up, and the national populist government once pioneered by Savinkov has collapsed. The new Chairman of the Senate, Viktor Chernov, has been sworn in as the interim president, but his rule has already been challenged by the right and the military, who fear that a socialist revolution may be imminent."
 russianews.1.a: "How ironic."

 russianews.2.t: "Dmitry Romanov Appointed Interim President"
 russianews.2.d: "Today, interim President Viktor Chernov's bid to retain his position has been narrowly defeated by Grand Duke Dmitry Romanov. Dmitry has found his appeal among the right wing Kadets, Russian nationalists, Octobrists and other conservatives who have supported his rise to power.\n\nThe Grand Duke has promised to restore stability to the country after Savinkov's death, but in what direction he will push Russia is unseen so far. Much of his coalition has never favoured the left-wing republcan ideas of Chernov, and a restoration of the monarchy is not out of the question. "
 russianews.2.a: "Another Romanov? Really?"

 russianews.3.t: "Viktor Chernov Appointed Interim President"
 russianews.3.d: "The power vacuum in Russia has seemingly ended. Backed by a coalition of SRs and other left-wing republicans, Viktor Chernov has been appointed as interim president of Russia despite immense pressure from the Duma and military.\n\nNew elections are to be held the next year, but for now, it is safe to assume that Russian liberal democracy has prevailed."
 russianews.3.a: "Liberty has triumphed... for now, at least."

 russianews.4.t: "Revolution Sweeps Russia"
 russianews.4.d: "The socialist-leaning coalition, led by Viktor Chernov, posed an immense threat to the right and the military. So, ultimately, army officers led by Lavr Kornilov and others launched a coup, detaining Chernov and dissolving the Duma.\n\nHowever, it seems that the army vastly overestimated its support. Massive protests and armed insurrections proved fatal against Kornilov's coup, who was forced to surrender Moscow to the left-wing forces. In the blink of an eye, socialism in Russia has rose up again, and its impact will no doubt be felt across Europe."
 russianews.4.a: "How can things get any worse?"
 russianews.4.b: "We'll have to call a party conference on this..."
 russianews.4.c: "Not like this..."

 russianews.5.t: "Wrangel Marches on Moscow"
 russianews.5.d: "The massive protests in Moscow and other Russian cities proved to be too much for Savinkov to handle - so, he called on General Wrangel to quell the protests. What he did not expect was for Wrangel to act against him: after arriving in Moscow, together with his co-conspirators he arrested the President and swiftly secured control of the capital.\n\nUpon his ascension to power, Wrangel dissolved the Duma, though promised that free elections will be held as soon as the situation is stable. When that day will come, however, is anyone's guess."
 russianews.5.a: "The monster eats its own tail."
 russianews.5.b: "From one butcher of the workers to another."
 russianews.5.c: "They should know their place."

What he did not expect was for Denikin to act against him: after arriving in Moscow, together with his co-conspirators he arrested the President and swiftly secured control of the capital.\n\nUpon his ascension to power, Denikin dissolved the Duma, though promised that free elections will be held as soon as the situation is stable. When that day will come, however, is anyone's guess."
 russianews.6.a: "The Marshal of the Peasants has acted boldly."

 russianews.7.t: "Kornilov Crushes Anti-Savinkov Revolt"
 russianews.7.d: "The massive protests in Moscow and other Russian cities proved to be too much for Savinkov to handle - so, he called on General Lavr Kornilov to quell the protests. In the ensuing violence, the streets of Moscow ran red with blood, but Kornilov's forces ultimately prevailed.\n\nWith the opposition now in utter disarray, President Savinkov has finally been able to pass the 'Act on the Protection of the Republic'. The act has given him sweeping powers to deal with his political enemies, legally transforming Russia into a dictatorship with Savinkov at the helm..."
 russianews.7.a: "Clearly, this problem won't solve itself..."

 russianews.7.g: "Thus falls the curtain on Russian democracy."

 russianews.8.t: "Dmitry Crowned Tsar"
 russianews.8.d: "Initially elected as interim president in the wake of Boris Savinkov's assassination, Dmitry Romanov has quickly set a wildfire of popularity across Russia. So much has the Romanov's popularity grown that after a landslide referendum, thousands of cheering citizens now flock to watch the coronation of the new Tsar of Russia.\n\nBacked by an expansive coalition of conservatives, monarchists, nationalists, and everything in between, it appears the Russian populace has avenged the February Revolution as the Russian Republic dies. Now, a Romanov once again takes his place as the head of the Russian Empire."
 russianews.8.a: "At this point, it changes little."

Now, that has come to an end, as the protests and riots have been quelled by an iron fist, no doubt orchestrated by general Pyotr Wrangel and politician Dmitry Romanov. And what more fitting a helmsman of this new regime than the heir to the Romanov family himself, [RUS.GetLeader]?\n\nAfter Russia was on the verge of explosion it now stands eerily still. The former flame of not just the protests, but Russian democracy is quietly snuffed out as the February Revolution is avenged, the Tsar is crowned, and the Russian Empire is once again declared."
 russianews.9.d.democratic: "After the downfall and death of former president Boris Savinkov, Russia had once again been left in a power vacuum.

And what more fitting a helsman of this new regime than the heir to the Romanov family himself, [RUS.GetLeader]?\n\nWith elections being scheduled at a later date, for now thousands of Russians cheer as their new Tsar is crowned, the chaos and bloodshed caused by the February Revolution is avenged, and an old, yet modern Russian Empire is declared."

Russia seems to not buy the illusion either, and their expansionist rhetoric reveals that they will seek to restore the borders of the former Empire with force."

 russianews.12.d: "For the past two years, observers foreign and domestic have noted the slow erosion of democracy in Russia. Ever since the Russian opposition was thrown into disarray after the death of Kerensky, President Savinkov has tightened his grip over the state — and with the Duma and Senate controlled by members of his party, the NRPR, there was little in the way of Savinkov's destruction of the Republic.\n\nToday, the last nail in the coffin has been hammered. After merging the offices of the president and prime minister, Savinkov has declared the end of the Republic and the creation of the Russian State. Berlin and their allies have looked upon this development with worry as anti-German rhetoric has only become stronger..."

 russianews.13.d: "Today, the last hopes of the Russian war effort against Germany and its allies have been snuffed out. Initially posing one of the most credible threats to German hegemony across Europe, it seems that Russian efforts were for naught. Both sides met in German-occupied Moscow to negotiate a conditional surrender on Russia's part. In the ensuing treaty,  Russia was forced to cede swathes of territory to Germany's allies, as well as pay huge amounts of reparations.\n\nIt is expected that Germany will turn west to face the remainder of the Internationale. Thus far, the Internationale has been able to avoid total defeat. Whether Germany will seek to destroy the socialist alliance entirely or simply seek continental supremacy remains an open question."

With their defeat almost guaranteed, it was expected that Russia would take advantage despite its weakness.\n\nCiting the need for stability and order in Eastern Europe, [RUS.GetLeader] announced the renewal of military operations against Germany and their allies. It is expected that Russia's reentry will make the once proud hegemon of Europe fall even faster."

 RUS_irakli_tsereteli: "Irakli Tsereteli"
 RUS_irakli_tsereteli_leader_desc: "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakli Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognise the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."

 RUS_viktor_chernov: "Viktor Chernov"
 RUS_viktor_chernov_leader_desc: "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasily Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1920, Chernov and Kerensky formed a tandem which dominated the Russian centre for the last fifteen years. While Kerensky was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."

 RUS_pavel_milyukov: "Pavel Milyukov"
 RUS_pavel_milyukov_leader_desc: "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation — if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right — he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerensky's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments over the years until Savinkov took over in 1934. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."

 RUS_vasily_maklakov: "Vasily Maklakov"
 RUS_vasily_maklakov_leader_desc: "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasily Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defence of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticised Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigory Semyonov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1920 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."

 RUS_nikolay_trubetskoy: "Nikolay Trubetskoy"
 RUS_nikolay_trubetskoy_leader_desc: "Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy represents a new generation of Russian nobility, an educated, ideologically driven upper class which is opposed to radicalism from the right and from the left. A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanisation of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

 RUS_ariadna_tyrkova: "Ariadna Tyrkova"
 RUS_ariadna_tyrkova_leader_desc: "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalised her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead.\n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union. Russia's first democratically elected female head of state has a deeply conservative society to resist against, but she is no pushover, and will not shy away to assert Russia's role as the harbinger of Eurasia."

 RUS_lavr_kornilov: "Lavr Kornilov"
 RUS_lavr_kornilov_desc_body: "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerensky's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

 RUS_boris_savinkov: "Boris Savinkov"
 RUS_boris_savinkov_leader_desc: "A terrorist, a violent madman, a murderer, a revolutionary and a dictator is just a few of many labels given to Boris Savinkov, the leader of the National Republican Party of Russia. Throughout his colourful life, he has assassinated and bombed many as a part of the Combat Organisation of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, before moving on to becoming a pragmatic schemer behind Aleksandr Kerensky's back - as Assistant War Minister in 1917, he nearly assumed dictatorial power in Russia from the shadows, and only the collapse of the Kornilov coup led to his downfall. However, he rehabilitated himself by organising the Union for the Defence of the Motherland, an underground resistance organisation in Moscow which prepared the soil for the city's fall in 1919. \n\nNRPR's star-like rise in Russian politics, feeding off from the revanchism and disillusionment with Kerensky's rule, culminated in electoral victory in 1934 in the aftermath of economic depression and political scandal. \n\nSavinkov may have once been a socialist, but he has long since abandoned the weak Socialist Revolutionaries in favour of a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced him over the years - all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, extreme Russian nationalism, and a concept of palingenetic rebirth: like an eagle rising from the ashes, the Vozhd shall restore the glory of the Russian state and transform it into a hegemon of reaction."

Only when he was drafted to the Russian Army did his superiors begin to take note of his bravery in battle and sent him to accelerated training courses. Stationed in Romania, he was present for the formation of the Drozdovite Regiment and followed Drozdovsky to the Don, where he rose through the ranks of the White Army. In the restored Russian Republic, Turkul was no longer ignored and eventually gained the rank of General.\n\nOne of the youngest generals in the Russian general staff and yet highly talented, Turkul is considered by many to be the vanguard of a new generation of Russian officers. He's taken a liking to attracting attention to himself and helping craft this image as well - though he might be a little vain, he is still a valuable commander."

 RUS_vladimir_manstein_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 3rd, 1894, in Kremenchug, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe son of general Vladimir von Manstein, Manstein was born to a family of Russified Germans who accepted Orthodoxy and abandoned much of their heritage. When the Weltkrieg began, Manstein was a cadet in the Pavlovsky Military School in Petrograd, his class was released ahead of schedule and commissioned in the army due to a severe lack of officers on the front. Even before the war began to take its toll, the officer's peers caught note of him — he was certainly brave and fearless, but in his own way, with a complete lack of restraint, sympathy, and full of contempt towards his fellow man. The events of 1917 only aggravated these tendencies — the collapse of the Russian Empire, which he wholeheartedly believed in, and a brutal injury during the Civil War, after which his left arm was amputated.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Manstein gained the nickname "One-Armed Devil". Claiming to be "possessed by Russia", he commanded units in the White Army with exceptional efficiency, showed no remorse to Bolsheviks, and personally executed numerous political commissars — his contemporaries described him being as cold as a machine, "a terrible invention of death and blood". And for that, the Whites respected him whole-heartedly. After the Civil War, however, Manstein's life fell to a slump. War is all he had ever known, his injury meant that he was unable to find any other job, and his marriage turned estranged - before they could get divorced, his wife mysteriously disappeared, and rumours say that Manstein shot her himself. The disillusioned officer found his salvation in Boris Savinkov's national populism - its call for national rebirth and vengeance against Germany spoke to him, and he became a card-carrying member of the NRPR. Only his German heritage, as much as Manstein might deny it, prevents him from becoming Savinkov's closest ally."

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect.\n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armoured train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armoured vehicles and manoeuvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."

 RUS_karl_radek_leader_desc: "Karl Radek would struggle to count the number of socialist movements he's had a hand in over the years. Born in Austria-Hungary to a Jewish Litvak family, he joined the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and participated in the Revolution of 1905 in Warsaw — only to get expelled a few years later during an anti-semitic and anti-Leninist campaign within the party. He briefly worked for the German SPD before getting expelled from it as well. He then worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did, however, not stay in Russia either — in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser.\n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life — instead of being executed, as the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans until he was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through the use of extensive state planning in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."

 RUS_aleksandra_kollontai_leader_desc: "Aleksandra Domontovich, marriage name Kollontai, was born to a liberal cavalry general from whom she inherited an interest in history, analytics and political reform. Her leftist sympathies began when she was sent to Western Europe to distance her from a relationship with a poor fellow student, and she started reading into radical leftist literature during the exile. During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov.\n\nKollontai was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions' Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

 RUS_aleksey_rykov_leader_desc: "Born from rural Russian peasantry, Aleksey Rykov was an early member of Social Democratic Labour's Bolshevik faction and a supporter of Vladimir Lenin over his political rivals in the movement. After returning from exile in Siberia in 1917, he joined the October Revolution, although he disagreed with the radical inclinations of the Bolshevik movement, and was put in charge of the fledgling Soviet state's industry. During this period, he organised the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

He was an early member of Social Democratic Labour and its Bolshevik faction, convened the conference which founded its youth movement, the Komsomol, and maintained contact with the rest of the party while in exile in the West. There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik.\n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing — he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organised the underground Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party. Wary of possible bureaucratisation and "military-feudal exploitation" of the peasantry, Bukharin endorses a moderate approach of cautious industrialisation and an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labour for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticised their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern.\n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontai, he founded the Trade Unions' Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

Even at a young age, he did not lack ambition - once the Weltkrieg began, he proudly declared that he will either be a general at thirty or dead by then. After showing skill and bravery in the Eastern Front, Tukhachevsky fulfilled this goal - but not in the way he anticipated. He joined the Red Army as a volunteer and rapidly rose in rank, becoming a close associate to Leon Trotsky and achieving the rank of General not long after Lenin's assassination. The Fifth Army he commanded was one of the Red Army's finest units and pioneered the concept of motorised concentration warfare, but was ultimately defeated by Vladimir Kappel.\n\nAlongside several high ranking Bolsheviks and Red Army leaders, Tukhahevskiy escaped to France, a nation he was already familiar with, and offered his service to the newly established Commune. In the following years, he dedicated his time to essay after essay on the reforms which he believed the French army needs - his close associates said that he owns over a hundred volumes on military tactics and has read every single one. Tukhachevsky expressed dismay at the decentralised structure of the Syndicalist Commune, believing it unfit for modern warfare, and proposed the creation of a unified, centralised, apolitical army instead. Because of this, he came into constant conflict with the French government, but the CGT could not simply remove him from the academy - even they understood that Tukhachevsky was the best general which the Internationale has available.\n\nTo resolve this, he and the other Bolsheviks were sent to Patagonia to lead a military mission to help the Argentinian Revolution."

He became organiser in the newly-born Red Army, and used his experience in trying to hammer an effective fighting force out of the irregular Bolshevik militias. As the war grew more grim for the Reds, he was dispatched to command the southern front. Yegorov was wounded yet again in bloody fighting near Tsaritsyn. Despite his skill and respect by his men, the tide of the war was turning against the Revolution for good.

Here, he found his calling, displaying skill, bravery, and finishing server as a non-commissioned cavalry officer. After the October Revolution, he briefly went back home, but once again returned to the frontlines, this time as a junior commander in the Red Army.\n\nZhukov's service was rather brief, however, but once the Soviet regime collapsed, he escaped his homeland with numerous other Red Army commanders, and landed in France. Getting accustomed to a completely foreign country was difficult, but Zhukov had fully dedicated himself to the Bolshevik course by then and pushed forward with dedication - he completed officer training courses, maintained contact with Mikhail Tukhachevsky, studied modern strategy from his superior, and voluntarily joined the Internationale mission to Patagonia.

Born to an impoverished Georgian family, Ioseb was physically disabled from young age and had a troubled childhood, marked by fights, abuse and alcoholism. Early in his life, he got drawn to Georgian nationalist poetry and enrolled in the Tiflis Seminary, but abandoned his previous calling when he came into contact with socialist literature. He dedicated himself to Marxism, joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, and raised money for the revolution with protection rackets, counterfeiting and bank robberies. He was a loyal follower of Lenin and represented the party in the public by running the newspaper 'Pravda', and his articles there helped make a name for himself as well.\n\nDuring the fateful months of 1917, Dzhugashvili helped organise the July Days uprising and the October Revolution, and gained a seat in the Sovnarkom. He, Lenin and Trotsky formed the informal troika which controlled the state - as a result, Dzhugashvili was sent to Tsaritsyn to organise resistance against the Whites, where he showed himself as an adequate, if reckless commander. Once Lenin was assassinated in August 1918, it was Trotsky who took charge and not him - but the Soviet state was not one to last, eventually collapsing. Dzhugashvili, unlike Trotsky, managed to escape, making his way to France with the rest of the Bolshevik remnants, and helped reestablish the Party in exile.\n\nTo support the Patagonian Syndicalist revolution, Dzhugashvili was sent to the Southern Cone alongside a mission of other Bolsheviks, and alongside Makhno, he is one of the highest ranking Internationale officials in Patagonia - albeit unlike Makhno, representing the political interests of the Internationale.§!\n\n§YNotes: Aligned with the Communist faction."

He completed a course in military law and joined the front during the Brusilov Offensive, where he served with distinction and achieved the rank of captain, thanks to high casualties among his fellow officers leaving a vacancy to fill. The war left Vasilevsky sick, however, and he returned to his village after being demobilised in 1917, hoping to return to an agronomist's career.\n\nThat did not come to be, as in 1919, he ended up conscripted into the White Army and fought in the Volunteer Army during the last few months of the Russian Civil War.

Considered to be one of the best organisers in the general staff and a grey eminence, he is seen by many as a vanguard of the new generation of Russian officers.

Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare.\n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilisation never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilisation and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war.
