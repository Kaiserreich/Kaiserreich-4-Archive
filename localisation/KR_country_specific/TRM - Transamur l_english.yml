 tram.intro.t: "Transamur - Provisional Russian State in Vladivostok"
 tram.intro.d: "Siberia and the Russian Far East had been a major area of conflict during the Russian Civil War, as the location of a short-lived democratic republic, the rising of the 'Czech Legion' and Japanese intervention. While forced to evacuate their forces due to German pressure (as well as intense resistance from local Cossacks), the Japanese remained eager to extend their influence and in 1922 pushed for the establishment of an independent state in the Transamur region. This motion gained the support of the Vladivostok business community, despite the fact that it left them vulnerable to forming an economic dependency on Japan. The majority of the business community, however, saw economic and diplomatic relations with the rising power in the East as a significant advantage, especially when compared to the alternative of being sucked further into the disorder plaguing the rest of Russia. The new nation gained a prominent figurehead in the form of Admiral Kolchak, one of the more successful White Generals of the civil war and the one-time self-proclaimed 'Supreme Ruler of All Russia', who had been forced to flee Russia following his unsuccessful attempt to seize control in 1925. In 1936, the Transamur Republic has become a corporate and militaristic state, and is politically, economically and militarily under the thumb of the Japanese Empire. And yet Kolchak has ambitions of his own. Could he simply be playing a very dangerous game, using the Japanese protection to establish his own rule, first over Siberia, and then over Russia as a whole?"
 tram.intro.a: "Interesting..."

 tram.1.t: "Transamur Breaks Away!"
 tram.1.d: "The Transamur Republic has taken great offence at our attempts to regulate their internal affairs, and are severing all political ties with us!"
 tram.1.a: "Destroy them!"
 tram.1.b: "We can only let them go..."

 tram.21.t: "Transamur Invades the Far East!"
 tram.21.d.RUS: "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty we are currently very weak and may not be able to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since fighting Transamur may mean fighting Japan as well."
 tram.21.d.SOV: "Transamur has taken advantage of the unrest in Siberia to establish its control over the region. While this is a great infringement on our sovereignty, we are currently very weak in the Far East and can not hope to win a war to reclaim our lands, especially since we are still recovering from the deadly civil war."
 tram.21.a: "It is useless to fight over an icy wasteland."
 tram.21.b: "Come and take it then - who believe in such ruse anyway?"
 tram.21.c: "Damn it!"

 tram.23.t: "Russia Refuses to Intervene"
 tram.23.d: "The so-called "Russian Government" have seemingly accepted the fait accompli in Siberia, and have taken no serious military action against our liberation effort."
 tram.23.a: "A smart choice."

 tram.24.t: "Russia Responses with Force!"
 tram.24.d: "The so-called 'Russian Government' have not only refused to give up our rightful lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us and aim to retake Vladivostok."
 tram.24.a: "War it is then!"

 tram.42.t: "Transamurian Expansion in Siberia"
 tram.42.d: "Our client state, the Transamur Republic, has established its control over several parts of Siberia. While this is a fine addition to the Co-Prosperity Sphere it is possible that Transamur is becoming too powerful and needs to be restrained."
 tram.42.a: "Demand Kamchatka and Okhotsk!"
 tram.42.b: "It is good to have strong client states!"
 tram.42.c: "[TRM.GetLeader] is too greedy for his own good, it is time to replace him."

 tram.47.t: "Japan Demands Bases"
 tram.47.d: "The Japanese have congratulated us on our seizure of Siberia but the representative of the Mikado states that we should allow Japan to administer Kamchatka and allow them to establish a naval base in the Sea of Okhotsk."
 tram.47.a: "Yes, we still need Japanese protection."
 tram.47.b: "It is time to throw off the Japanese yoke!"

 tram.48.t: "Japan Plots a Coup Against [TRM.GetLeader]!"
 tram.48.d: "The Japanese believe [TRM.GetLeader] has outlived his usefulness and have approached the elite of Transamur with the plan of backing a coup d'etat to replace him with a more compliant council of business and military leaders."
 tram.48.a: "Yes, [TRM.GetLeader] should be removed!"
 tram.48.b: "[TRM.GetLeader] will not go anywhere!"

 tram.49.t: "Transamur Submits"
 tram.49.d: "[TRM.GetLeader] has decided to submit and kneel before us. Now, there is an empty office of the Vladivostok governorship, and so we shall find a replacement. We have a perfect candidate in the loyal general Oi Shigemoto, leader of the Siberian Intervention during the Russian Civil War. As of today, Transamur is now officially ruled by general Shigemoto, having effectively become our puppet."
 tram.49.a: "Excellent."

 tram.67.t: "Transamur Attempts to Break Free"
 tram.67.d: "With the recent reconquest of Siberia by Transamur they have become much bolder, trying to forge their own way under the sun. Recently they have moved their capital from Vladivostok to more remote parts of their republic, a clear attempt to minimise our influence. What shall we do?"
 tram.67.a: "It is good to have strong allies!"
 tram.67.b: "Try to restore our influence over Transamur!"

 tram.68.t: "Japan Demands Our Submission!"
 tram.68.d: "The Japanese feel threatened by our attempts to minimise their influence over our country and they have issued an ultimatum to us in which they demand the cessation of steps threatening their sphere of prosperity."
 tram.68.a: "Submit before Japan."
 tram.68.b: "Never!"

 tram.80.t: "Anti-Kolchak Coup"
 tram.80.d: "The opposition have started an open revolt against us. Disloyal generals and soldiers, lead by Sergey Wojciechowski, have captured the most important neighbourhoods and are now marching right to us. Those who are still loyal to Admiral Kolchak are ready to fight these filthy traitors."
 tram.80.a: "Kolchak's guards manage to defeat the rebels."
 tram.80.b: "Kolchak gets overthrown."

 tram.81.t: "Kolchak Is Overthrown!"
 tram.81.d: "Aleksandr Kolchak, leader of Transamur for more than 12 years, has been overthrown by members of the general staff led by Sergey Wojciechowski and executed by a firing squad. His death opens the field for various possibilities of political change in Transamur including the declaration of a republic, if Sergey Wojciechowski and his staff allows it."
 tram.81.a: "Sergey Wojciechowski is the new leader of Transamur!"
 tram.81.b: "A Republic is founded."

 tram.84.t: "Anti-Kolchak Coup in Transamur!"
 tram.84.d: "Admiral Kolchak, the long term leader of the Transamur state has been overthrown and assassinated by members of his own general staff. This was used by the democratic opposition to gain control over the state, effectively turning Transamur from a military junta into a democracy. How shall we react?"
 tram.84.a: "Demand the restoration of a military cabinet!"
 tram.84.b: "Congratulate the new government!"

 tram.86.t: "The Duma Elections"
 tram.86.d: "After several months of preparations the provisional government has completed the arrangements for the first free election in Transamur since 1920. There are 90 seats in national assembly available and various political parties have begun their campaigns. Currently only three parties have a chance of gaining a majority, thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
 tram.86.a: "The People's Far East Party!"
 tram.86.b: "The Party of Popular Freedom!"
 tram.86.c: "The Zemski Krai Party!"

 tram.87.t: "The Duma Elections"
 tram.87.d: "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every four years. The state Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. There are 90 seats in the Duma available and various political parties have begun their campaigns. Only three parties have a chance of gaining the majority, thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
 tram.87.a: "The People's Far East Party!"
 tram.87.b: "The Party of Popular Freedom!"
 tram.87.c: "The Zemski Krai Party!"

 tram.92.t: "Propose Reunification with Russia?"
 tram.92.d: "With our chances of overcoming the might of Japan being slim, there have been calls from a number of leading figures within Transamur to set aside our previous rivalry with Russia and join them in order to stave off the Japanese threat. By proposing to join the Russian state peacefully, we could finally end years of isolation imposed on us by Kolchak's belligerence and hopefully avoid subjugation at the hands of Tokyo."
 tram.92.a: "We must ensure our own survival. Send the proposal."
 tram.92.b: "Are you crazy?"

 tram.93.t: "Transamur Proposes Reunification"
 tram.93.d: "It seems that the traitors in Transamur have finally realised the folly of their actions. Their miserable rump state is at war with Japan and they assuredly have no chance of victory in the face of Japanese military power. Representatives from Transamur have come to us begging us peacefully rejoin our nation, presumably in the hopes of avoiding conquest by Japan. Vladivostok is an important port, no doubt, but are we ready to confront Tokyo yet?"
 tram.93.a: "Welcome home, Russians."
 tram.93.b: "It's too risky..."

 tram.94.t: "Transamur Reunifies with Russia"
 tram.94.d: "It appears that the traitorous scum in Transamur have managed to temporarily escape their inevitable conquest by reunifying with Russia. Our pride demands retribution for their betrayal, but, is it wise to strike at Russia right now?"
 tram.94.a: "To war!"
 tram.94.b: "Transamur isn't worth it."

 tram.95.t: "Russia Refuses Unification"
 tram.95.d: "Despite our best efforts to join Russia, negotiations have failed, with the Russian representatives refusing to countenance our peaceful reunification. With vast Japanese forces arrayed against us, it seems that we are on our own."
 tram.95.a: "Damn."

 tram.96.t: "Disaster"
 tram.96.d: "The so-called "Russian Government" have refused to return our lands. Moreover, they have declared war on us, eager to retake Vladivostok."
 tram.96.a: "Damn!"

 tram.97.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Breaks Away!"
 tram.97.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has decided to leave our sphere of influence and cease all contact with us! Our elaborate military-industrial stranglehold over them and their fetid regime lies in ruins, and it appears that our carefully laid plains for increasing our influence in the Russian Far East are in tatters."
 tram.97.a: "Destroy them!"
 tram.97.b: "We can do nothing, for now."

 tram.98.t: "Attempted Coup in [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 tram.98.d: "News about an anti-Kolchak coup in [FROM.GetNameDef] has recently reached us. It appears that rebels sought to kill Aleksandr Kolchak, our de facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, but their best efforts seem to have come to nothing, with the putsch crushed by loyalist guards. Still, Kolchak has made a number of enemies in [FROM.GetNameDef] and his vulnerability is becoming increasingly clear. Perhaps we should demand that Kolchak resign and assign a new, more pliant leader for [FROM.GetNameDef]."
 tram.98.a: "Replace him."
 tram.98.e: "Kolchak may be a loose cannon, but he's our loose cannon."

 tram.100.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in [FROM.GetNameDefCap]"
 tram.100.d: "News about anti-Kolchak coup in Transamur has recently reached us. It appears that rebels have successfully killed Aleksandr Kolchak, our de-facto puppet leader of the Vladivostok regime, and General Wojciechowski has become the new dictator. Although he is less brave and ambitious than his former political rival, Wojciechowski still has great expansionist vision for Transamur. Perhaps we should replace him before he starts a geopolitical crisis?"
 tram.100.a: "Wojciechowski is the best choice for us."

 tram.102.t: "Admiral Kolchak Murdered in [FROM.GetNameDefCap]"
 tram.102.d: "The leader of the 1925 coup, rogue admiral Aleksandr Kolchak was recently killed by his own soldiers during a military coup in his beloved state of [FROM.GetName]. A man of great ambitions, he had contested our rights to rule the Russian Republic until his last breath. With his death, our society becomes a bit more pacified."
 tram.102.a: "So, the bastard is gone. Excellent!"

 tram.103.t: "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
 tram.103.d: "Harbin is an important city, placed in the middle of Fengtian's territory, and connects two parts of the Chinese Eastern Railway which our republic sold to the Fengtian government in 1927. But even now lots of the Russians live there and play a significant role in the railway. Since many of them have bonds with us, they prefer to use the more or less stable Transamurian Ruble instead of the fluctuating Fengtian Tael, though its unclear if the transactions with our currency are legal or not. Our Economic Minister has proposed that we should make an agreement with Fengtian, which will allow the usage of the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, but will permit additional taxation by the Fengtian Government."
 tram.103.a: "Let's propose it!"
 tram.103.b: "The current situation is acceptable."

 tram.104.t: "Transamurian Currency in Harbin"
 tram.104.d: "Transamur has proposed that we allow transactions between our own currency and the Transamurian Ruble in Harbin, which has the largest Russian population in the whole of the Northeast. The government in Vladivostok says that we will be able to tax these transactions, moreover such an agreement could have a positive influence the industrial development of the city as well as the region, where the local Russian business started to make various investments. But, some members of our government mention that the free use of the Transamurian Ruble can lead to the increase of Harbin's autonomy."
 tram.104.a: "An agreement will help our economy."
 tram.104.b: "We don't need this deal."

 tram.105.t: "Fengtian Accepts"
 tram.105.d: "The Fengtian Government has agreed to allow the usage of our currency in Harbin. We hope that it will strengthen the economic bonds between our countries."
 tram.105.a: "Excellent."

 tram.106.t: "The Fading Sun"
 tram.106.d: "With the collapse of the Empire of the Rising Sun, we have lost an important source of support - but we are now free from their meddling, for good or ill."
 tram.106.a: "A mixed blessing?"

 tram.121.t: "White Refugees in Vladivostok"
 tram.121.d: "After their victory in the Second Russian Civil War, the Reds have begun to terrorise their internal enemies. Many former White forces and their supporters have managed to flee from mainland Russia to join our cause against the Bolsheviks taking advantage of a period of instability and anarchy in Siberia to flee east. Along with soldiers, several well-educated officers have arrived offering their services. No matter their prior political affiliations, together we must strike at the Red Hydra!"
 tram.121.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

 tram.122.t: "More Exiles Arrive in Transamur"
 tram.122.d: "A long period of political instability in mainland Russia has caused anarchy to erupt in distant parts of Siberia. With the [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government otherwise occupied containing instability in the West, it is quite difficult for them to exert real power over this region. People are losing hope in their leaders and fleeing to our country. More and more refugees and exiles are joining our cause."
 tram.122.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"

 tram.123.t: "Send Agitators into Siberia"
 tram.123.d: "With the death of Kerenskiy, the political situation in Russia proper is more chaotic than it has been even in recent years. Some of our ministers believe that the opportunity now exists for us to strike again. We should start with sending agents to push our agenda all across Eastern Siberia. If the people hear us, it is inevitable that they will join us to bring down the corrupt regime in the West."
 tram.123.a: "Send the agitators."
 tram.123.b: "It's too risky."

 tram.124.t: "Results of our Agitation Efforts"
 tram.124.goodagit: "Recent reports have reached us making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was even more effective than we had predicted before. A number of people, many of them armed and military trained, left their homes for our host. We now have enough additional manpower for a good division."
 tram.124.agit: "Recent reports have reached us, making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was effective. A number of people, several of them armed, left their homes for our host. We now have enough additional manpower to reinforce existing divisions."
 tram.124.badagit: "Recent reports have reached us, making clear that our plan to send agitators into Siberia to spread our ideas was ineffective. The people of Siberia, no matter the anarchy taking hold in the country, seem unwilling to abandon their lives and join us for such a hopeless dream. It seems that we have wasted resources for nothing."
 tram.124.a: "Welcome home, brothers!"
 tram.124.b: "Welcome home, brothers!"
 tram.124.c: "We don't need them anyway..."

 tram.125.t: "Our Old Friend Is Dead"
 tram.125.d: "News of the death of George V, the king-in-exile of the United Kingdom has recently reached Vladivostok. Once Kolchak's ally, the monarch guaranteed his safety in 1925 until the British Revolution. His son, [CAN_king_first_name], has now ascended to the throne in Canada. Although, neither Kolchak or [CAN_king_first_name] know each other personally, this resetting of relations could be the start of a long period of partnership between our countries. We should send an envoy to negotiate for support."
 tram.125.a: "Strong allies are always good."

 tram.126.t: "Envoy from Transamur"
 tram.126.d: "Today an envoy from the petty military junta of Transamur has come to visit His Majesty, [CAN_king_full_name]. In his speech, the envoy informed us about King George V's previous support of Kolchak's 1925 unsuccessful coup in Petrograd and assured us that this time the rogue admiral will triumph - however, he once again requests support from the Entente. We owe Kolchak nothing, but maybe he's not that useless? How should we answer?"
 tram.126.a: "Assure him that he'll get everything he need."
 tram.126.b: "Limited support will be enough."
 tram.126.c: "He is just an old buffoon."

 tram.127.t: "Report on the Meeting with [CAN_king_full_name]"
 tram.127.fullsupport: "Our envoy has returned with magnificent news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed a deep respect for our cause. The King has promised that we can rely on him for some degree of military support. It seems that the Entente is now an effective partner for our regime."
 tram.127.partialsupport: "Our envoy has returned with good news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed respect for our cause. However, though the King has promised to partially support us, he has refused to give us complete backing. While the outcome is not as great as we had previously hoped, some support from the Entente is most welcome."
 tram.127.nosupport: "Our envoy has returned with unfortunate news: [CAN_king_full_name] has expressed little interest in our cause, to put it mildly. The King said bluntly that we are nothing but a clique of buffoons desperately trying to preserve our misbegotten rule. He promised absolutely nothing from the Entente and our relationship has definitely worsened."
 tram.127.a: "Destination, [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"
 tram.127.b: "It's better than nothing!"
 tram.127.c: "What a rude person..."

 tram.128.t: "Vladivostok Treaty"
 tram.128.d: "The war between Japan and Transamur has clearly not ended in a Russian defeat. Japanese troops, taking immense casualties from brave Russian defenders, were unable to conquer Vladivostok for such a long time the entire perspective of taming Transamur may now seem to have too high a cost.\n\nEmperor [JAP.GetLeader] and [TRM.GetLeader] met today in Vladivostok to sign a peace treaty and end all hostilities between these two countries. It seems that Japan has lost its only tool to press Russia. The people of Transamur are celebrating this outstanding victory."
 tram.128.a: "Curse you, traitors."

 tram.129.t: "Moving the Capital to [566.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 tram.129.d: "We now control [566.GetName], which provides us with an industrial base to build up our country. In order to continue with our aspirations of a united Russia we must relocate the provisional capital to [566.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. This may alarm the Japanese as it would give them an indication of our true goal but it would also lower their influence."
 tram.129.a: "It is worth the risk."

 tram.130.t: "Moving the Capital to [653.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 tram.130.d: "As our might grows stronger every day we become more and more autonomous from Japan and their imperial ambitions. Moving the provisional capital to [653.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will show them that we are their lapdogs no more."
 tram.130.a: "One step closer towards freedom."

 tram.131.t: "Moving the Capital to [219.GetName]"
 tram.131.d: "[219.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] hasn't been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great made what is now [193.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] the capital. Since the illegitimate [193.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Regime used the city we should perhaps consider using [219.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as our new capital, not only to distance ourselves from the [193.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] regime but as a callback to the foundation of Russia. "
 tram.131.a: "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

 tram.132.t: "Moving the Capital to [195.GetName]"
 tram.132.d: "[195.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great created it from the ground up. Our government using the city as our capital is a sign of legitimacy and will allow the public see us a the legitimate Russian State."
 tram.132.a: "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

 tram.145.t: "A Changing Attitude"
 tram.145.d: "Most people in Russia are tired of the constant wars and wish for the fighting to end. With the recent victory of our regime many believe we can deliver peace and prosperity to the people who have suffered for so long."
 tram.145.a: "Russia must never fight herself again"

 tram.1000.t: "An Offer from an Old Ally?"
 tram.1000.d: "The rump state of Vladivostok has actually won and now a government has been established to rule over Russia. Since we provided some aid in their bleak situation they have offered their assistance in the Entente."
 tram.1000.a: "Their aid is vital, let them in!"
 tram.1000.b: "Didn't they lose last time?"

 tram.1001.t: "We Are Now a Member of the Entente"
 tram.1001.d: "The British Empire has decided that the Russians, French and British should unite in an alliance once more. Together, we shall restore the world to sense."
 tram.1001.a: "We will avenge the fallen men from the first Weltkrieg"

 tram.1002.t: "The Entente Rejects Us"
 tram.1002.d: "The Entente clearly do not understand what we could do for their war effort. They have instead rejected us, citing the possibility of being drawn into a war with Germany."
 tram.1002.a: "Faithless friends!"

 TRM_Russias_Eastern_Harbour_desc: "Vladivostok was both a major port and city in the Russian Far East under the old Tsarist regime, but with the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war, Vladivostok has lost some of its importance.

 TRM_Legacy_Of_The_Weltkrieg_desc: "A lot of time has passed since the end of the Weltkrieg. Naval thought has changed and new technologies such as carriers and submarines have experienced much development. Still, these frivolous new toys are nothing compared to the old warships.

 TRM_A_New_Path_desc: "The rise of submarines and carriers during the Weltkrieg was unexpected. They have since proven themselves to be very effective. Though we will likely still rely on our extant main fleet, perhaps we could augment it with these new types of ships?"

 TRM_Develop_The_Caucasus_desc: "The lands of the Caucasus are rich with oil, which is why Germany wanted to have a tight grip on the area. With the region under our control, we can improve the industry for the people who have long suffered."

 TRM_Increase_Trade_With_Japan: "Increase Trade With Japan"

 TRM_Aid_From_Japan: "Aid from Japan"
 TRM_Aid_From_Japan_desc: "We can ask Japan to invest some money into our industry. It will allow us to develop our country faster. However, the deepening ties between us will also grow increasingly apparent, which means our people will be displeased."

 TRM_Invite_Japanese_Instructors: "Invite Japanese Instructors"
 TRM_Invite_Japanese_Instructors_desc: "While Japanese aid and investment has been highly lucrative, our economy is laughably inefficient compared to that of the land of the rising sun.

 TRM_Draw_Closer_To_Fengtian: "Draw Closer to Fengtian"
 TRM_Draw_Closer_To_Fengtian_desc: "The Fengtian regime is also under a great deal of Japanese influence, and thus our ally. Despite this and our close geographic proximity, our nation has diplomatic and economic ties comparable to that of any other with Fengtian. We should expand our diplomatic mission in the capital of Fengtian to foster closer ties."

 TRM_Invite_Fengtian_Workers: "Invite Fengtian Workers"
 TRM_Invite_Fengtian_Workers_desc: "To the west lies the vast lands of Manchuria ruled by Zhang Zuolin who is our occasional partner and ally. A lot of poor Chinese people are willing to work for us, even for a mere bowl of rice per day.

However, these harsh measures will disrupt the capabilities of our army for some time."

 TRM_The_Supreme_Ruler: "The Supreme Ruler"
 TRM_The_Supreme_Ruler_desc: "Kolchak claims himself to be the "Supreme Ruler of Russia".

 TRM_Vladivostok_Under_Japan: "Vladivostok under Japan"
 TRM_Vladivostok_Under_Japan_desc: "The Japanese have never been welcomed in Transamur.

 TRM_Attract_Japanese_Immigrants: "Attract Japanese Immigrants"
 TRM_Attract_Japanese_Immigrants_desc: "Now that our puppet regime stands on more solid ground, the time has come to take the first steps toward Japanisation of the whole region.

 TRM_Invite_Japanese_Workers: "Invite Japanese Workers"
 TRM_Invite_Japanese_Workers_desc: "With the colonisation programme already under way, soon thousands of hungry poor Japanese will flee to our country in search of work. A cheap workforce and investment from the mainland means new facilities and new capabilities."

 TRM_Pro_Tokyo_Propaganda: "Pro-Tokyo Propaganda"
 TRM_Pro_Tokyo_Propaganda_desc: "Russian resistance to our cultural assimilation is even stronger than we anticipated. As such we should take measures prevent them speaking, listening and even thinking Russian.

 TRM_Major_Education_Reform: "Major Education Reform"
 TRM_Major_Education_Reform_desc: "No matter if it is a dictatorship or a democracy, the aspects regarding education are clear in both cases. No men or women ever won a war, but science did. We must invest as much as possible to give our scientists everything they want."

 TRM_Secure_Azerbaijan: "Secure Azerbaijan"

 TRM_japanese_influence_desc: "Our government is not seen as a legitimate Russian state by the Russian people, this is made even more apparent through Tokyo's ever growing influence.

 TRM_visit_from_japan: "A Visit From Our Masters"
 TRM_visit_from_japan_desc: "Isolated and confined to the Far East, we have no allies in these turbulent times to aid us in our glorious crusade. However, we have received word from the Japanese Embassy in Vladivostok that the Japanese are willing to support us, whether financial aid or even arms and equipment.

 TRM_hold_vladivostok_desc: "We have little chances to fight ba ck Japanese troops down to the ocean. Our only solution to survive is to hold Vladivostok long enough to make the whole point of this war non-sense in minds of Japanese people.

When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However, the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."

 RUS_aleksandr_kolchak_leader_desc: "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy who fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak tried to proclaim himself the 'Supreme Ruler of Russia' but failed to garner enough support. His relationship with the newly created Russian Republic's government was deeply fraught due to the latter's acceptance of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, culminating in his failed coup attempt against the 'German lapdogs' in 1925. The rogue admiral managed to flee Russia and found shelter in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur. Now an effective puppet of Tokyo, Kolchak is trying to gather enough power and support to overthrow the government in Petrograd and proclaim himself leader of Russia."

 RUS_sergey_wojciechowski: "Sergey Wojciechowski"
 RUS_sergey_wojciechowski_leader_desc: "A leader of Czechoslovakian Legion and hero of the Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to accept the Brest-Litovsk treaty as legitimate. Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right-hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergey betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
