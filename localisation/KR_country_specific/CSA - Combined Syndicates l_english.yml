### Decisions ###

 CSA_destroy_federalist_decision: "Destroy Loyalist Terrorists"
 CSA_destroy_longist_decision: "Destroy Longist Terrorists"
 CSA_delay_canadian_intervention: "Delay Canadian Intervention"
 CSA_delay_canadian_intervention_desc: "We cannot prevent the Canadians from intervening in the civil war... but we can delay them. If we sponsor nation-wide strikes with a clear syndicalist connection, they'll be tied up at home and too paranoid to take action. We will only be able to do this so many times before the Canadians figure out where the funds are coming from, however."

### Reconstruction Focuses ###
 CSA_rebuilding_the_country: "Rebuilding the Country"
 CSA_rebuilding_the_country_desc: "The Revolution is over, but without swift action, the wounds torn open by the Second American Civil War will continue to fester and bleed. We must work with haste to build up an egalitarian, equal, and enduring America, from the ruins of the old."
 CSA_social_revolution_desc: "The land of the free and the home of the brave was anything but. We have our work cut out for us in ridding America of corruption, racism, and chauvinism. The first step is to tear up the very core of all these things - the capitalist system itself!"
 CSA_redistribute_wealth: "Redistribute Wealth"
 CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc: "We will no longer tolerate a social order wherein men who do absolutely nothing useful can amass millions of dollars while millions of proletarians who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough to prolong a wretched existence. The end of the banks, corporations and hoarders is finally here."
 CSA_homes_for_the_people: "Homes for the People"
 CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc: "Landlords and real estate tycoons have been a plague upon this nation. Now that they have been cast down or fled the country before our righteous advance, we will expropriate their ill-gotten lands and give them to those in need. Let us lift the poor and starving from their slums!"
 CSA_emancipation_for_all: "Emancipation for All"
 CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc: "Foolish and vain is the working man who makes the colour of his skin the stepping-stone to his imaginary superiority. Proletarians of all colours and creeds fought and bled together to build our new America. The loyal immigrant shall also be afforded natural-born citizenship in the spirit of emancipation."
 CSA_womens_liberation: "Women's Liberation"
 CSA_womens_liberation_desc: "With the men fighting on the front lines, it fell to the women to run the factories, build the munitions, and feed our revolution! That's to say nothing for the many female nurses, pilots and Red Guard members who gave their all. Their sacrifices and struggles shall not have been in vain; in the new America, women will at last be recognised as truly equal to men."
 CSA_revolutionary_education: "Revolutionary Education"
 CSA_revolutionary_education_desc: "Academia has been the nurturing mother of many revolutionaries, but the education system itself is still inherently reactionary. Throughout American history, education was designed and reformed to produce more obedient workers, more crooked capitalists, and more heartless politicians. That ends now!"
 CSA_reconstruction: "Begin Reconstruction"
 CSA_reconstruction_desc: "The Second American Civil War blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of rural America are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smouldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
 CSA_deal_with_feds: "Deal with the Feds"
 CSA_deal_with_feds_desc: "Since the beginning of the Revolution, we've accumulated an extensive list of political prisoners whom are awaiting trial. Now that the war is over, the time to judge these men has finally come. Although some amongst our leadership believe in rehabilitating these captives, other more radical comrades are eagerly calling for extreme revolutionary justice."
 CSA_transformative_justice: "Transformative Justice"
 CSA_transformative_justice_desc: "Although we've firmly dealt with the old American elite, there's still a sizeable popular movement opposing our new regime. We'll need to pacify any remaining counter-revolutionary cells, and make sure to track down every last infiltrator in our midst before we can finally be sure we've won."
 CSA_deal_with_firsters: "Deal with America First"
 CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc: "Huey Long's foul crew of reactionary demagogues, heartless industrialists, and tyrannical generals will finally stand trial. Although the Kingfish himself has escaped capture, we'll eagerly dish out a fair punishment to everyone who collaborated with him."
 CSA_destroy_jim_crow: "Destroy Jim Crow"
 CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc: "Ridding ourselves of the southern terrorists will not just be a matter of military might. We'll need to uproot the bigotry and racism that's plagued America for centuries, and crush Long's cult of personality. Let us make Lincoln proud and bring old Dixie down, once and for all!"
 CSA_equality_for_all: "Equality for All"
 CSA_equality_for_all_desc: "The long-fought battle for true liberty looks to be almost over. The old hierarchies and horrors are fading away. Soon the American injustices will be nothing but bitter memories and the stuff of history books."
 CSA_reconstruction_is_over: "The Syndicated Public Service"
 CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc: "Agitation propaganda cannot reach the millions of Americans that object to an overseas war. The Mormons, Mennonites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Hutterites that refused to fight in the civil war are now offered an outlet in forestry to aid in reconstruction."
 CSA_a_new_america: "Revisit and Remember American Heroes"
 CSA_a_new_america_desc: "The names of Joe Hill, The Haymarket Martyrs, and even Eugene Debs are famous today, but only as the top layer of a long legacy of American Syndicalist heroes. We must undo years of misinformation about these figures through a concentrated propaganda effort, and also begin to teach a new generation about the legacy of the countless brave American heroes who fought for workers' rights."

### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
 CSA_second_convention: "Second Constitutional Convention"
 CSA_second_convention_desc: "The time has come to take the next step in our revolutionary struggle and find a way to unite the workers of America behind a single cause and ideology. Although our delegates come from a wide variety of unions and communes, we hope for a consensus on the future of our new socialist government. Just as it was over a century ago, Philadelphia shall be the site of a Constitutional Convention!"
 CSA_american_commonwealth: "Commonwealth of America"
 CSA_american_commonwealth_desc: "We did not come this far just to fall back into tyranny! Our monumental support in the Constitutional Convention has shown that Union-based Socialism will reign, succeeding the nationalism of Bellamy, but with social and economic freedom for all workers and labourers of our nation!"
 CSA_protect_the_working_class: "Protect the Working Class"
 CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc: "While the workers of America have long striven for a better economic system, one truly designed by, ran by, and for the people, they have been powerless to implement such a system. With our victory in the civil war, we have ample time and opportunity to forever enshrine worker friendly, labor and safety regulations as well as safeguards against unfair discimination in the new America!"
 CSA_empower_councils: "Townhall Democracy"
 CSA_empower_councils_desc: "The new Commonwealth cannot be built through authoritarian means. We must pursue a better class character for our democracy by passing laws empowering grassroots engagement and town hall meetings. Political decisions will no longer be a distant murmur on Capitol Hill; instead, they'll be made right amongst the workers!"
 CSA_mutal_economic_comitee: "Craft Union Committee"
 CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc: "Reforming the capitalist system will be a Herculean task, and it can't merely be wished away with state quotas and economic plans. Congress will now begin assembling local representatives of Craft Unions in order to determine the best plan for economic growth while protecting professional workers from obsolescence."
 CSA_councilism: "Councilism"
 CSA_councilism_desc: "Maintaining America's old bureaucracy is pointless. A compromise between the craft and industrial unions has been reached in the implementation of decentralised worker councils. These Councils will allow states to exert autonomous power in how unions are organised."
 CSA_federalism: "Federalism"
 CSA_federalism_desc: "Even if the old United States was home to political corruption, gerrymandering and inefficient bureaucracy, its administrative system is an unshakable cornerstone of our national identity. With compromise between craft and industrial unions impossible, we must rely on this cornerstone as the first American revolutionaries did."
 CSA_power_to_the_people: "The Ununionized Social Security Act"
 CSA_power_to_the_people_desc: "At the urging of the old-age pension activists, Congress has been compelled to reserve some money for a social security fund for ununionised workers. This value is in keeping with our socialist ideals, and breaks ground in ensuring that workers in unprotected industries receive protection as the unionised already do through their retirement funds."
 CSA_federalist_economics: "Business Unionism"
 CSA_federalist_economics_desc: "Many within the Combined Syndicates mock the idea of 'Business Unionism', calling it a betrayal of the Revolution. What these purists fail to realise is that after two hundred years of capitalism in America, we will need an intermediary economy to ease the transition into socialism. Thus, Congress has ended the system of state-controlled pricing of goods that was implemented under Reed."
 CSA_mutualism: "Protectionist Policies"
 CSA_mutualism_desc: "The Councils of Professional Workers have concluded that a protectionist policy towards American goods is in order, but not as drastic as the old Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. A softer approach will see increased tax breaks for unions that operate solely in the States, as well as a propaganda push to \"Buy American\" just as we should have during the first Weltkrieg."
 CSA_workers_cooperatives: "Worker's Cooperatives"
 CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc: "The dominance of industrial unions need not mean the death of enterprise! We shall simply replace the bosses who take an unjust cut of the profits. Instead, let the workers decide within their workplaces, dividing the wealth fairly amongst themselves."
 CSA_social_dividends: "Social Dividends"
 CSA_social_dividends_desc: "Congress has passed a law instituting a basic universal income, wherein a portion of all profit generated from state-run enterprises will be divided amongst our citizens. Our labourers are not just mere subjects, they're the very thing that keeps our nation running; therefore, they shall hereby be entitled to some of America's collective wealth!"
 CSA_public_owned_enterprise: "Publicly Owned Enterprise"
 CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc: "Public enterprises were for a long time shunned in America, as every one of our old presidents was beholden to the will of Big Business over their electorate. However, now that we've broken the yoke of the corporations, Congress has finally found room to make use of publicly-owned enterprises in the American economy. Rooseveltism and conservationists only hold us back!"
 CSA_american_syndicalism: "New American Syndicalism"
 CSA_american_syndicalism_desc: "America has finally left exploitative capitalism behind and is now marching eagerly towards a brighter future. Though purists in Congress still mock our idea of 'Syndicalism with American Characteristics', their complaints bear no weight when industries roar with energy, and our people celebrate hitherto-unknown prosperity!"
 CSA_unionist_economics: "Industrial Unionism"
 CSA_unionist_economics_desc: "Although there has been some push for a synthesis between Syndicalism and Business Unionism, it’s obvious to us that there can be no compromise with the old system. Industrial labour unions must rise to become the dominant force within our economy, just as unions now form the basis of every part of the Commonwealth government."
 CSA_industrial_unionism: "Syndicalist Dominance"
 CSA_industrial_unionism_desc: "Whereas markets were previously decided by supply and demand, or the whims of investors, our new system will be built by and for demand side economics. Congress has declared that workers must register unions with the IWW or risk fines and loss of benefits."
 CSA_workers_self_managment: "Worker's Self-Management"
 CSA_workers_self_managment_desc: "A great goal of this Congress is to remove the old hierarchies which permeated American workplaces. Thus, a law illegalises Executive Officers and preferred stockholder voting rights. Now Unions can take control over all of the means of production through common shares ownership."
 CSA_industrial_democracy: "Industrial Democracy"
 CSA_industrial_democracy_desc: "Democracy is integral to the American identity. Yet, for far too long, whatever fig leaf of democracy existed was left at the factory door as Americans became slaves to petty tyrants. No longer. Congress has mandated a new Industrial Democracy Committee to promote cooperation between unions towards a democratic goal."
 CSA_agricultural_unions: "Agricultural Unions"
 CSA_agricultural_unions_desc: "The Agricultural sector will be obliged to feed our nation, but other than that broad instruction, we can allow the farmers to operate mostly independently. Congress has extended union protection to agricultural workers, enabling them to unionise and join the IWW."
 CSA_syndicalist_economics: "Decentralised Planning"
 CSA_syndicalist_economics_desc: "State governments have brought forth an awakening of self-sustaining communes in the cities and even counties. These communes cooperate closely with their neighbours and maintain a well-functioning social order. Although this system is nowhere near utopian, it is the first step towards a true worker's paradise!"
 CSA_protect_the_revolution: "Protect the Revolution"
 CSA_protect_the_revolution_desc: "Maintaining and protecting the spirit of the revolution will be vital in the coming years. We face enormous outside pressure from the reactionary powers around the world, sabotage from dissidents within our own nation, and the strife of factionalism even amongst our leadership. Our will isn't yet broken though, the struggle continues!"
 CSA_general_defense_comitte: "General Defense Committee"
 CSA_general_defense_comitte_desc: "Entrusting military leadership and the safety our nation to a group of elites can only end poorly. We must ensure that our Commonwealth remains meritocratic and free from corruption, as such Congress has organised a committee of union advisors and military strategists."
 CSA_indepedent_media: "Protect Free Speech"
 CSA_indepedent_media_desc: "The free media and the right to free speech is an unalienable right to the American people. The Court system has reaffirmed the right to free speech in spite of calls for censorship. Let the reactionaries and traitors shout what they will, their treasonous drivel be drowned out by the cries of our comrades celebrating a new age of prosperity!"
 CSA_strategic_services: "Committee of Strategic Services"
 CSA_strategic_services_desc: "While the General Defense Committee has proven quite effective it has also been criticised as being too open and public. It is a shame to have to conspire in secret from our citizens, but we can at least ensure that this second Congressional Committee will uphold the spirit of the revolution and be closely supervised."
 CSA_the_revolution_continues: "The Revolution Continues"
 CSA_the_revolution_continues_desc: "With stability brought to our democratic government, our economy and internal security, we can begin to heal. The scars from the Civil War will last many more years, but that doesn't mean our nation is infirm and weak. The struggle continues, the fires of revolution still burn, and the Commonwealth shall stand tall as a liberating force for all!"

### Union of American States Focuses ###
 CSA_usas: "Union of Socialist American States"
 CSA_usas_desc: "The authoritarian is ascendant, as the petty squabbles of the Constitutional Convention have ended in favour of a strong and centrist Marxist government. The USAS will show the world that the civil war has done nothing to reduce nations strength and influence, it has merely been redirected to the new revolutionary cause of Vanguardism!"
 CSA_lead_the_revolution: "Lead The Revolution"
 CSA_lead_the_revolution_desc: "The Vanguardist America is a centrist nation, not subject to IWW mob rule or AFL backsliding. Thankfully, our loyal Craft Unions and anti-Judiciary advocates understand this. Making sure that our new Union does not collapse into infighting, reaction will be the first agenda of our new government."
 CSA_peoples_commisars: "People's Commissars"
 CSA_peoples_commisars_desc: "Already during the civil war, we had many militias, communes and syndicates adopting a system of Political Commissars. These watchful and vigilant citizens kept a close eye on any potential counterrevolutionaries within our ranks. Congress has allowed these commissars under direct state control, and expanded the system nationwide."
 CSA_control_townhalls: "Sign the Hall-Ballam Act"
 CSA_control_townhalls_desc: "The issue of loyalty is becoming a wedge that is beginning to drive Congress apart. To fix this, Gus Hall and John Ballam have brought to the floor a Bill to require affidavits of loyalty for USAS elected officials. This law ensures the safety of all by prosecuting those in politics guilty of treason in any form."
 CSA_politics: "Democratic Centralism"
 CSA_politics_desc: "The concept of Democratic Centralism where once a decision is made by the Central Committee then it must be followed by those lower within the party and government. A Central Committee over Congress was voted in, and they shall have the final say on policy changes. Only reactionaries and traitors should fear us."
 CSA_communist_party: "Ban Wall-to-Wall Elections"
 CSA_communist_party_desc: "Despite our centralisation of power, there's still some squabbling amongst Congress. We cannot progress if the IWW, AFL, KoL and all the acronyms squabble. Don't they realise the Vanguard is the centrist position, and we are the only things keeping the revolution from tearing itself apart. Thus goes the anarchistic wall to wall elections of the IWW."
 CSA_proletarian_dictatorship: "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 CSA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc: "Everything we have achieved so far has been won with violence and force, the bourgeois thought still clinging to America cannot be voted away, it cannot be debated or discussed away, it must simply be destroyed. How else can anything take its place, if we tolerate the past? Their actions are treason, and the Committee the judge."
 CSA_fosters_economics: "Foster's Economic Policy"
 CSA_fosters_economics_desc: "William Foster has managed to successfully push through his radical policies, as outlined in his manifesto, \"Toward Syndicalist America.\" Foster has immediately called for mass nationalisation of all industries and natural resources, as well as a series of radical reforms to protect unions."
 CSA_resource_nationalization: "Resource Nationalisation"
 CSA_resource_nationalization_desc: "The establishment of a truly American Syndicalist government will require the confiscation of large landed estates in every Union State. Including the whole body of forests, mineral deposits, lakes, and so on. No longer will Americans be under the yoke of the bourgeoisie."
 CSA_union_managment: "Protect Craft Unions"
 CSA_union_managment_desc: "The Trade Unions perform a very important function within our economy. But they do not of themselves actually lead the production, this being the responsibility of the government economic organs. Our loyal Craft Unions gladly comply with close local and national supervision from the Party to protect their rights from mob rule."
 CSA_collective_farming: "Green Fields Program"
 CSA_collective_farming_desc: "The Committee has approved of the Green Fields Program to the millions of acres of seized land. This is seen by the public as preferable to collectivisation, as it brings back the competitive spirit in land acquisition. This program places land that was either seized or set aside for state use to the lowest bidder who promises the highest yield."
 CSA_decentralized_planning: "Socialist Self-Management"
 CSA_decentralized_planning_desc: "The Central Committee will immediately proceed with the difficult task of creating an adequate supply of reliable technicians and managers for the industries. The scattered technical institutes, trade schools, correspondence schools, etc., will be organised, expanded and linked up directly with the industries."
 CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ: "Centralised Syndicalism"
 CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ_desc: "The Proletarian revolution initiates changes more rapid and far-reaching than any in the whole history of mankind. The hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, smashing their chains of slavery, will construct a society of liberty and intelligent prosperity. Syndicalism will inaugurate a new era for the human race, the building of a new world."
 CSA_browders_economics: "Browder's Economic Policy"
 CSA_browders_economics_desc: "Earl Russell Browder has managed to successfully introduce a series of policies meant to forge a stable, predictable economy. Built mainly on industrial plans and the direct control of several sectors of the economy by the state, through the use of commissariats and quotas. The Committee and the Craft Unions in Congress have received it well."
 CSA_price_controls: "Price Controls"
 CSA_price_controls_desc: "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
 CSA_control_unions: "Dismantle the IWW"
 CSA_control_unions_desc: "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the leadership of the revolution, the Vanguard Party. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USAS, the people, see that Vanguardism represents their interests better."
 CSA_state_farms: "Collective Farms"
 CSA_state_farms_desc: "The State agriculture organisation is now grouped under the Committee's Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for individual crops and geographical divisions of the industry. Crops are sold either directly to the government, to the cooperatives, or, in a very rapidly lessening extent, upon the open local markets."
 CSA_state_quotas: "State Quotas"
 CSA_state_quotas_desc: "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilisation of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles. The Committee has refused the idea of awards for meeting quotes, stating that advancement in the economy should be a reward, not an expectation."
 CSA_planned_economy: "Browder's Anticapitalist Society"
 CSA_planned_economy_desc: "Browder's Committee has approved a national plan, which declares a total economic war against the forces of monarchism and reaction. Therefore, industrial decision-making shall be socialised. Exemplar facilities will be observed as schools for uplifting others, while failing facilities will be required to adjust or be liquidated."
 CSA_defend_the_revolution: "Defend the Revolution"
 CSA_defend_the_revolution_desc: "All the forces of capital and reaction are conspiring to destroy the new order. We face not just a war of ideals, but a war of bloody sabotage and shady subterfuge, one that must be won at all cost. Traitors in our own midst thankfully can be prosecuted."
 CSA_revolutionary_guards: "Revolutionary Guards"
 CSA_revolutionary_guards_desc: "Exercising our new authority in order to crush terrorists, conterrevolutionaries and traitors will require the creation of new, well-structured military and law enforcement agencies, not any wayward Red Guards or crazed vigilantes."
 CSA_state_media: "State Media Initiative"
 CSA_state_media_desc: "The Daily Worker, Hollywood, and now the radio have all been seized by the Artists' Congress by the CC's graces. Under the tutelage of such luminary socialist thinkers such as Hemingway, Welles, and Hughes, all the world will know of the American Socialist revolution."
 CSA_create_the_csb: "Create the CSB"
 CSA_create_the_csb_desc: "In order to defeat the class enemies of the revolution, we have laid the groundwork for a Central Security Bureau, managed directly by the ruling committee. A clandestine security organisation that will always have an iron fist or a dagger in the back ready for counter-revolutionaries."
 CSA_purge_reactionaries: "Purge Reactionaries"
 CSA_purge_reactionaries_desc: "In no country was culture so debased by capitalism as in the United States. Essentially a gigantic effort to perpetuate the robbery of the workers. Sterile, hypocritical, lifeless. The proletarian revolution in the United States has at once made a slash into the maze of hypocrisy and intellectual rubbish, paving the road for a glorious new America."

### Army Focuses ###
 CSA_second_continental_army: "The Second Continental Army"
 CSA_second_continental_army_desc: "\"The revolution has begun!\" - zeal and enthusiasm are pouring forth as people line up to support our brave volunteers. Regular Chicagoans even say that \"we'll take Washington in a week and then the reactionaries will surely collapse!\". People are ready to get rid of the capitalistic government."
 CSA_a_gun_in_hand: "A Gun In Hand"
 CSA_a_gun_in_hand_desc: "'What more could a man need than a gun? Why a better gun of course!' Massed infantry dominates our army - and we should ensure they are as well-armed as possible."
 CSA_a_boot_under_foot: "Uniforms And Grenades"
 CSA_a_boot_under_foot_desc: "Our forces thus far lack even a standard uniform. By adapting a standard set of combat fatigues as well as producing a set pattern of mortars, grenades and machine guns, we can keep our boys ready for anything."
 CSA_appoint_butler: "CIC: Smedley Butler"
 CSA_appoint_butler_desc: "Former Marine Corps general Smedley Butler has stepped up to lead our armies as Commander in Chief. We wish him luck, and are eagerly looking to his experience and his ideas in the fields of doctrine and war materiel."
 CSA_the_first_draft: "Implementing Conscription"
 CSA_the_first_draft_desc: "It seems that despite the enthusiasm for the ideals of the revolution, fewer men than we would have liked have volunteered to leave their homes and families for an uncertain future on the front lines. An executive order from President Reed that a draft be instituted has therefore been drafted"
 CSA_creating_cohesion: "Political Officers"
 CSA_creating_cohesion_desc: "Our militiamen are enthusiastic, but they lack an education in the finer points of socialist theory. In order to keep morale up and ensure that more uncertain occupied areas see the benefits of the revolution we intend to create so-called political officers who will be responsible for helping us win hearts and minds."
 CSA_the_long_haul: "The Long War"
 CSA_the_long_haul_desc: "Our earlier optimism may have been misplaced - it seems as though the American Revolution will be lasting much longer than anticipated, and so we must broaden the depth and complexity of our military programme."
 CSA_disciplinary_standards: "Enforce Discipline"
 CSA_disciplinary_standards_desc: "One of the increasing problems we are suffering is a lack of organisation and frequent insubordination in our forces, to this end we have re-created the Military Police and intend to crack down on those who disobey orders."
 CSA_the_second_draft: "Women's Military Equality Act"
 CSA_the_second_draft_desc: "As the war continues on, young women join our forces or even mask themselves as men to serve in our military. By allowing them to serve on the front lines, we can show our commitment to equality and the progress of women in the new America."
 CSA_upgrade_the_m1: "Roll Out The AO-2"
 CSA_upgrade_the_m1_desc: "Production of a new battle rifle, based on a design by Auto-Ordnance rejected by the bourgeois military, should be sped along in order to ensure we have top-class weaponry. Our best workers have already started a discussion on improving the production lines for the new rifle."
 CSA_baptism_by_fire: "New European Military Schools"
 CSA_baptism_by_fire_desc: "The Army War College in Pennsylvania was closed at the start of the war for its potential to serve as a hotbed of pro-federal sentiment and reaction. Now however we see that there may be some value in making use of its facilities, to educate the officers of the New America."
 CSA_reform_the_cavalry: "Re-create The Cavalry"
 CSA_reform_the_cavalry_desc: "The US cavalry was rejected by the revolution as an aristocratic institution and an outmoded one on the battlefield. As the war wears on however we see the need for mounted soldiers who can serve as recon and keep down civil unrest where vehicles and regular police forces are not available."
 CSA_standardize_unit_sizes: "Reorganise Unit Size"
 CSA_standardize_unit_sizes_desc: "Our Red Guard militia forces have done well to take us this far, but their irregular numbers, often simply based on however many willing men can be found in a given town, hamper their ability in the field. By creating a table of standard unit sizes and uniting different units under command of Armies, we can enforce better interaction of our units in the field."
 CSA_field_canon: "The Red Dragon"
 CSA_field_canon_desc: "The 240mm Howitzer, nicknamed the \"Red Dragon\" by our troops, is the latest in heavy field guns for use by our army. Traditionally we have failed to make much use of artillery but now we should be able to deploy heavy support whenever our troops need to enter battle against fortified positions."
 CSA_motorisation: "A Motorised Force"
 CSA_motorisation_desc: "Motorisation is the key to modern armies, with mobile infantry the backbone of an effective force. By ensuring that our combat-ready motors are up to date we can keep our edge in this field."
 CSA_every_man_a_truck: "Redouble Production"
 CSA_every_man_a_truck_desc: "The order has come down from the highest authority: every effort is to be made to produce enough material for the revolutionary war and nothing is to be wasted."
 CSA_reactivate_the_officer_corps: "Create NCO Field Schools"
 CSA_reactivate_the_officer_corps_desc: "We shall create Non-Commissioned Officers' Field Schools to allow our unit leaders to be trained and educated by the older generation. Our best commanders who met enemies of syndicalism in battle shall become their teachers."
 CSA_the_dust_settles: "The Dust Settles"
 CSA_the_dust_settles_desc: "As the revolution comes to a close and victory seems to be in sight, we must now take stock and evaluate the state of the army comprehensively. Already proposals are flurrying about this project or that to enhance our military might."

 CSA_tank_development: "Tank Development"
 CSA_tank_development_desc: "The role of armour was neglected by the old America, and now we must make great strides in very little time to update our forces."
 CSA_professionalise_the_airforce: "Professionalise The Air Force"
 CSA_professionalise_the_airforce_desc: "The Red Air Force was comprised largely of amateurs and enthusiasts during the revolution, now we must bring a proper system of ranks and training to an independent branch of the armed forces."
 CSA_lessons_of_the_revolution: "Lessons From The Revolution"
 CSA_lessons_of_the_revolution_desc: "Army doctrine in our nation has largely been an ad-hoc development, now the revolution has provided us with a large pool of experienced men who can serve as theorists for the future of the army."
 CSA_red_magic: "Red M.A.G.I.C"
 CSA_red_magic_desc: "M.A.G.I.C was the name of a US spying project to decipher Japanese military codes, and its principles can be applied to our own army too, in order to speed the development of electronic warfare."
 CSA_take_to_the_waves: "Take To The Waves"
 CSA_take_to_the_waves_desc: "The time has come to project power at sea, while the federals were successful in scuttling much of their fleet during the civil war's final days we have been able to dredge many of the vessels up and make use of them for designs, as well as having access to admirals eager to develop new theories of naval warfare."
 CSA_arsenal_of_the_revolution: "Arsenal Of The Revolution"
 CSA_arsenal_of_the_revolution_desc: "While America's army is not the most experienced, our nation is one of the most productive on earth. By allowing the Syndicalist nations of earth to freely borrow gear from [ROOT.GetNameDef] we can supply them with what they need to defeat capitalism."
 CSA_armoured_thrust: "The Armoured Thrust"
 CSA_armoured_thrust_desc: "Tanks have changed modern warfare. While ossified nations still rely on Weltkrieg tactics, we must look to the future and ensure that our forces have the number of modern vehicles and tanks that can lead us to victory."
 CSA_bomber_command: "Bomber Command"
 CSA_bomber_command_desc: "The new American People's Air Force or APA has proposed several aviation programmes, one of which is the formation of a large and well-equipped \"Bomber Command\" that can coordinate the levelling of enemy cities."
 CSA_fighter_command: "Fighter Command"
 CSA_fighter_command_desc: "The APA has a second plan competing for funding, which would form a vast \"Fighter Command\", allowing us to have one central authority coordinating our domination of the skies."
 CSA_flexible_airforce: "Maintain Flexibility"
 CSA_flexible_airforce_desc: "Rather than accept any of the APA's suggestions, we should direct them to stay flexible and develop methods, rather than equipment."
 CSA_unleash_the_hellcat: "Unleash The Hellcat"
 CSA_unleash_the_hellcat_desc: "One of the most innovative things the air force has done is present a design for a carrier-based aircraft known as the Bethpage F6 Hellcat, courtesy of the Bethpage Aviation Union & Design Bureau. The Hellcat would be our most agile carrier fighter to date."
 CSA_disband_the_militias: "Disband The Red Guard"
 CSA_disband_the_militias_desc: "The Red Guard militias served us well in the Revolution, but now their time has ended. By disbanding and then disarming them we can ensure that they don't cause trouble, and keep a large pool of men available to do work incidental, but still important, to future wars."
 CSA_incorporate_the_militias: "Incorporate The Red Guard"
 CSA_incorporate_the_militias_desc: "The Red Guard are a vital component of our broad and democratic system, which must be preserved at all costs. To that end we will take advantage of them to serve as experienced reservists, ready to replace casualties on the front lines."
 CSA_SONAR_project: "The SONAR Project"
 CSA_SONAR_project_desc: "SONAR is a marine equivalent of RADAR and is a fascinating new proposal brought to us by the American People's Navy or APN. Funding it will ensure we can keep our eyes in the seas as clear as those on land."
 CSA_the_atlantic: "Atlantic Focus"
 CSA_the_atlantic_desc: "Our fleet must be designed with war in the Atlantic in mind, against the German Empire in particular. To that end we need to fund the development of new capital ships, new destroyers and new battle cruisers."
 CSA_the_pacific: "Pacific Focus"
 CSA_the_pacific_desc: "Our fleet must be designed with war in the Pacific in mind, against the Japanese Empire in particular. To that end we need to fund the development of new carriers, submarines and light cruisers."
 CSA_fuel_for_the_fire: "Fuel The Revolution"
 CSA_fuel_for_the_fire_desc: "The revolution is always short of oil? Not any more! [ROOT.GetNameDef] is more than capable of supplying every barrel of gasoline the Internationale needs."
 CSA_synthetic_rubber_experiments: "Synthetic Rubber Experiments"
 CSA_synthetic_rubber_experiments_desc: "With Asia in imperialist hands we are forced to come up with a substitute for the vital resource that is rubber, seeking to produce synthetic alternatives. While we're pretty sure we've got something, further testing is needed."

 CSA_organise_pilots: "Organise Pilots"
 CSA_organise_pilots_desc: "For some time, our aviation forces have consisted of unorganised pilots who seized their planes or got them from manufacturers directly. This has led to a situation where pilots are freely moving between different sections of the front — usually leaving our forces without air support. This practice must be stopped, and pilots must be organised into squadrons and attached to battle areas."

 CSA_continental_airforce: "Create the Continental Air Force"
 CSA_continental_airforce_desc: "Even before the Second Revolution, it was obvious that the air forces worked better if they were not tied to the ground command. Although our adversaries still rely on old air tactics and organisation, we must move forward and begin organising independent air forces."

 CSA_second_continental_navy: "The Second Continental Navy"
 CSA_second_continental_navy_desc: "Created at the start of the Second American Revolution, our navy is mostly composed of seized ships, led by ideological comrades as Admirals. In the coming months and years we must make major decisions on the doctrine and philosophy of our new navy. As it is built up from both captured federal ships and brand new ships from our comrades on the dockyards, our navy will soon be a force to be reckoned with."

 CSA_red_angels: "Red Angels"
 CSA_red_angels_desc: "With the ever growing presence of our air force and ever growing needs of the battlefield, new experimental Air Doctrine has been charted. Innovations presented to us in response to the Hang-glider operations pioneered in Europe by capitalist countries. With many volunteers from the Civil War veterans, the army command has authorised the experiments."

 CSA_american_air_industry: "American Air Industry"
 CSA_american_air_industry_desc: "America is a country in which there have always been the best pilots and the largest aircraft industry in the world. Now, with the advent of the revolution, we have lost air superiority. But confident actions will restore one of America’s pride - with the new government-approved plan, we will subsidise our aircraft industry and be ready for battle on American soil or abroad."

 CSA_caf_schools: "Air Force Schools"
 CSA_caf_schools_desc: "After the end of the civil war, we got a lot of experienced aces who can train the pilots and aces of the next generation and will create the theory of modern air war. The creation of special flight schools under the command of the Continental Air Force will organise this process."

 CSA_continental_air_command: "Continental Air Command"
 CSA_continental_air_command_desc: "Most of our military experts propose the creation of a Continental Air Command, which will unite our air forces in a single whole. This will separate them from the army command and give more freedom in action. Although this step has its advantages, it is definitely not supported by people who consider this a return to U.S. centralisation policies."

 CSA_state_air_force: "State Air Forces"
 CSA_state_air_force_desc: "While some members of the government suggest the Air Force be subordinate to the central command - the first intention was to decentralise the Air Force and create their branches at the states' level. Although this will limit our ability to train pilots for long-distance flights, they will be more effective in supporting the troops with which they will share training even in peacetime."

 CSA_wings_of_revolution: "Wings of the Revolution"
 CSA_wings_of_revolution_desc: "In time of the Second Revolution pilots, who put their lives on the line for those who have come after them, made a great sacrifice so that the people of America will be the first in the air. Now when we have returned our aviation industry to the pre-war level and trained our pilots to mastery that can never be reached by capitalist countries, we are ready to protect workers in all parts of the world."

 CSA_professionalize_continental_army: "Professionalise the Continental Army"
 CSA_professionalize_continental_army_desc: "Despite the opposition of some political circles to this step, our high command has a plan to professionalise our militias and turn them into a proper army. Although our lower-level commanders and some militias are concerned about this step and look at it as a return to pre-revolutionary times, this will definitely improve the effectiveness of our soldiers and command."

 CSA_states_red_guards: "States' Red Guards"
 CSA_states_red_guards_desc: "Most of our political apparatus insists on the creation of state militias who will submit to the central command only in wartime. Although the proposed plan is close to the pre-war organisation of the US Army, there is a big difference - since any militias will be subordinate only to the local state's army command - and which, in turn, will be subordinate to the central command."

 CSA_distribution_of_duties: "Distribution of Duties"
 CSA_distribution_of_duties_desc: "While our the State Army Commands will plan the battles, our central command should concentrate its efforts on planning entire campaigns, supply lines and interaction between the armies of different states. This will allow us to quickly and efficiently solve any problems that the army may encounter in the war and defend the Second Revolution from reactionaries."

 CSA_armies_of_states: "Armies of the States"
 CSA_armies_of_states_desc: "After the new army reform, we decided to organise separate State Armies that will be responsible for training our soldiers, for their equipment and commanding them on the battlefields. Although this has led to great zeal and the arrival of a huge number of recruits in our new armies, we need to set minimum standards for them."

 CSA_american_red_guard_corps: "American Red Guard Corps"
 CSA_american_red_guard_corps_desc: "The reforms were successful, but a decentralised army cannot quickly respond to some problems on the battlefields without the force that will be directly subordinated to our high command. The Department of the Commander-in-Chief has already proposed the creation of the American Red Guard Corps, which will be under the direct supervision of the headquarters of the Continental Army."

 CSA_revolutionary_naval_industry: "Revolutionary Naval Industry"
 CSA_revolutionary_naval_industry_desc: "The superiority of the old U.S fleet was not only in our commanders, but also in Fleet size. Although we still do not have as many shipyards and factories as the United States had before the war, we can focus on specific ships and simplify production."

 CSA_new_american_dockyards: "New American Dockyards"
 CSA_new_american_dockyards_desc: "Most shipyards were damaged or lost their workers during the Second Revolution. The restoration of the old and the reform of the present naval facilities will be the second step towards the restoration of the American Navy. Competitions of new ships have already begun and will help us not only recreate the American Navy, but also get rid of old designs that proved to be ineffective."

 CSA_martime_industry: "American Maritime Industry"
 CSA_martime_industry_desc: "Most shipyards were damaged or lost their workers during the Second Revolution. The restoration of the old and the reform of the present naval facilities will be the second step towards the restoration of the American Navy. Competitions of new ships have already begun and will help us not only recreate the American Navy, but also get rid of old designs that proved to be ineffective."

 CSA_new_naval_plan: "New Naval Plan"
 CSA_new_naval_plan_desc: "With the victory in the Civil War, the American fleet was harshly damaged - many officers and sailors joined the reactionary forces and fought against the will of the people. In the end, when they were defeated, they damaged and destroyed their ships. Our oldest naval commanders propose starting the restoration of the American fleet to its former status."

 CSA_american_peoples_navy_desc: "With the Civil War over, some politicians say that our current need is to protect the American people. The idea was proposed to reintroduce the old American naval doctrine - but an additional proposal was made by former members of the Naval Militia who joined our side - creation of a new American Navy based on states' command, which would unite under leadership of the central command only in wartime."

 CSA_refit_old_ships: "Refit Old Ships"
 CSA_refit_old_ships_desc: "Our fleet mainly consists of old ships that date from the beginning of the 20th century or even the end of the 19th century. During the Civil War, our captains and engineers already began installing custom modifications on ships. Some of them have developed plans and equipment to improve the conversion of our ships to modern standards."

 CSA_liberty_ships: "Liberty Ships"
 CSA_liberty_ships_desc: "Our dockyard has at last switched to a new model of production. We can easily produce a massive number of convoys to supply our allies around the world."

 CSA_revolution_on_high_seas: "Revolution on the High Seas"
 CSA_revolution_on_high_seas_desc: "The old federal fleet was limited to 'naval traditions' that did not allow them to see that aircraft carriers would rule the oceans in the future. Although our oldest admirals are still inclined to the idea of 'big guns and armour', they agreed that the aircraft was very effective against enemy ships. We need to ensure that the new American Navy receives air support when it is needed in any part of the world."

 CSA_recreate_continental_marines: "Recreate the Continental Marines"
 CSA_recreate_continental_marines_desc: "In the past, the Continental Marine Corps proudly fought against the British oppressors. Many of the soldiers of its successor, the U. S. Marine Corps, under the command of Smedley Butler, joined us when we met with the capitalists in the Second Revolutionary War. With recreation of the navy, we need to be sure that we organise and train forces that can meet with other enemies of the Revolution abroad."

 CSA_navy_of_new_age: "Navy of a New Age"
 CSA_navy_of_new_age_desc: "The second revolution almost destroyed the navy, and none of us expected that we could recreate the old American fleet. But it was restored - perhaps not in the same quantity and form, but now the old ships have been replaced by new ones. Without the old biased admirals, naval tactics have been modernised. And now the New American Navy is ready to defend freedom in America - or around the world."

 CSA_armour_development: "Armour Development"
 CSA_armour_development_desc: "The role of armour was neglected by the old America, and now we must make great strides in very little time to update our forces. With the experience that we gained in the Civil War and handed over to our engineers, we already have several proposals for creating a modern tank."

 CSA_armoured_vehicles_industry: "Armoured Vehicle Industry"
 CSA_armoured_vehicles_industry_desc: "The Civil War forced us to rely on motorised units and proved their effectiveness. But it also showed that motorised infantry needed more armoured vehicles which could protect them on the battlefield from enemy bullets and shells."

 CSA_anti_tank_production: "Anti-Tank Production"
 CSA_anti_tank_production_desc: "Enemy armour is worthless when faced with high ordnance and dedicated anti-tank units that can smash them to pieces. Unlike tanks, we can attach anti-tank guns to our units and produce them in greater numbers."

 CSA_continental_red_army: "Continental Red Army"
 CSA_continental_red_army_desc: "Our army needs only the best soldiers. For this purpose, the local Red Guards will be transformed into our reserve forces, which will be drafted into the army in case of war. Already trained by army standards, with the same equipment - they can replenish our army if necessary. But this also means that we must raise our standards for the Red Guard."

 CSA_increase_military_spending: "Increase Military Spending"
 CSA_increase_military_spending_desc: "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."

 CSA_defense_logistics_agency: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 CSA_defense_logistics_agency_desc: "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralised logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."

 CSA_always_ready_always_there: "Always Ready, Always There"
 CSA_always_ready_always_there_desc: "Our New Army has come a long way from inexperienced militias to true fighting force with an American spirit in their hearts. With the final reforms, we need to adopt the motto of the old colonial forces. This motto will show that our army is always ready to fight for the workers, always ready to defend the Second Revolution."

 CSA_red_ball_express: "Red Ball Express"
 CSA_red_ball_express_desc: "Use of the term \"Red Ball\" to describe express cargo service dated at least to the end of the 19th century. Now this term will also mean the support of our comrades from the ocean who are fighting the reactionary threat."

 CSA_on_the_beach_desc: "Our enemies must fear American soldiers landing on their shores, and to that end we must work to ensure that we have the skill and power to take advantage of our longer reach."
 CSA_from_the_sky: "From the Sky"
 CSA_from_the_sky_desc: "Our greatest chance at projecting power across the oceans is through the use of air power - we can aid our allies best by helping them achieve air superiority, and through that control over the battlefield."

 CSA_free_the_west: "Free the New World"
 CSA_free_the_west_desc: "Our place is not in the Old World, but in the New. Our focus should be on achieving dominance in North and South America, and standing tall as an independent syndicalist power, rather than acting as subservient partners to the Europeans."
 CSA_mexico_friendship: "Friendship with Mexico"
 CSA_mexico_friendship_desc: "Mexico is a friendly power, and one we would do well to approach with a treaty of friendship and cooperation. We should work out any remaining land disputes, and find a way to better trade and military cooperation, so that we can co-exist in North America peacefully."
 CSA_free_mexico: "War Plan Green"
 CSA_free_mexico_desc: "This has been coming for a long time - the Mexican state must fall, and its workers granted the same freedom we have achieved for ourselves."

 CSA_look_to_the_south: "Look to the South"

 CSA_master_of_the_west_desc: "We have achieved our goal: America stands tall on its own, masters of the New World and free from the chains of capitalist domination.

 csa.1.d: "Today delegates have gathered from across the country in the city of Philadelphia as the Second Constitutional Convention is convened in order to draft a new and better constitution for America. Initial controversy erupts as the AFL brought their own delegation in spite of orders from the IWW to let them represent the whole of industrial labour. Other interest groups that swore allegiance to Reed have also shown up, including members of the defunct Knights of Labor and National Civic Federation. The most important of these smaller Labor Federations is the Trade Union Unity League. This organisation, represented by Earl Browder and William Foster, represent a resurgence of Vanguardism in the States. A small riot on the second day erupted when the International Peace Mission and Southern Tenant Farmers Union were ejected from the Convention. These unions had been neutral during the revolution, and were initially accepted due to their high percentage of black membership."
 csa.1.a: "Loyalists to the old order are not invited!"

 csa.2.t: "Socialist Constitution - System of Government"
 csa.2.d: "The AFL has made a splash in what many had expected to be a landslide victory for the IWW. What was supposed to be an easy article, that of the new Legislative Branch, has drawn a line in the sand. IWW representatives argue that America should be a strictly anarcho syndicalist government with all legislative vested in the industrial trade unions. These unions seek to abolish membership fees, and elect representatives via wall-to-wall bargaining unit elections. The AFL argues that America should be a socialist state with power vested in local Councils of Professional Workers. The AFL claims representatives would be elected via seniority, with full voting rights given to only citizenry that have spent some years paying dues and serving their fellow man. TUUL Representative William Foster spoke in favour of the IWW, stating 'seniority and paying to vote is no different than graft, which is something a vanguard of syndicalism cannot support'. Foster's impassioned speech, if it leads to the IWW's legislation passing, could signal a shift in support for the TUUL over the IWW."
 csa.2.a: "The people exercise state power through Trade Union Councils."
 csa.2.b: "The people exercise power through Councils of Professional Workers."
 CSA_totalists_gain_power: "§YTotalists§! gain an edge at the convention.\n"
 CSA_syndicalists_gain_power: "§YSyndicalists§! gain an edge at the convention.\n"
 CSA_radsocs_gain_power: "§YRadical Socialists§! gain an edge at the convention.\n"

 csa.3.t: "Socialist Constitution - Framework"
 csa.3.d.socialist: "Article 1. All power in America derives from the people and belongs to the people. The people exercise state power through Councils of Professional Workers, which constitute the political foundation of America. All other state bodies are under the control of, and accountable to, the Councils of Professional Workers.\n\nArticle 2. All the representative organs of state authority are elected by the citizens on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot to their respective unions. Unions reserve the right to deny workers' membership if their membership fee falls into the public debt. The worker's representatives in all organs of state authority are responsible to their electors. It will be determined by law in which cases, under what conditions and in what way the electors may recall their representatives even before the end of the period for which they were elected.\n\nArticle 3. No law or administrative or local rules and regulations shall contravene the Constitution. All state organs, the armed forces, all political parties and public organisations and all enterprises and undertakings must abide by the Constitution and the law. All acts in violation of the Constitution and the law may be investigated by a commission of Councils of Professional Workers. No organisation or individual may enjoy the privilege of being above the Constitution and the law."
 csa.3.d.syndicalist: "Article 1. All power in America derives from the people and belongs to the people. The people exercise state power through local trade union councils, which constitute the political foundation of America. Local trade union councils are not permitted to deny membership due to ability to pay or on the basis of pre-existing conditions. All other state bodies are under the control of, and accountable to, the All-Industrial Congress.\n\nArticle 2. Trade union councils are to act as wall-to-wall bargaining unions in the All-Industrial Congress. Wherein all the representative organs of state authority are elected by the citizens on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by election. The people's representatives in all organs of state authority are responsible to their electors. It will be determined by law in which cases, under what conditions and in what way the electors may recall their representatives even before the end of the period for which they were elected.\n\nArticle 3. No law or administrative or local rules and regulations shall contravene the constitution. All state organs, the armed forces, all political parties and public organisations and all enterprises and undertakings must abide by the Constitution and the law. All acts in violation of the Constitution and the law must be investigated by the All-Industrial Congress. No organisation or individual may enjoy the privilege of being above the Constitution and the law."
 csa.3.a: "Approved."

 csa.4.t: "Socialist Constitution - Human Rights and Workers Rights"
 csa.4.d: "Article 6. Citizens are guaranteed the freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, the freedom to hold public meetings and demonstrations. Freedom of conscience and freedom of religion are guaranteed to citizens. Citizenship is defined as all Americans living legally within America during the time of ratification of the Constitution. The Church and the State are not obligated to adhere to each others' authority.\n\nArticle 7. Women have equal rights with men in all fields of state, economic and social-political life. Women have the right to collectively bargain as men do for the same work, and as workers or employees they enjoy special protection. The state reserves the right to pay an equivalent wage up to 20 hours of work a week to mothers before and after childbirth.\n\nArticle 8. Citizens of America are guaranteed inviolability of the person. No one may be arrested except by a court decision or on the warrant of a procurator. Citizens of America are guaranteed inviolability of the home. No one may, without lawful grounds, enter a home against the will of those residing in it.\n\nArticle 9. The state promises working people the right to associate and organise themselves to collectively bargaining units. The state protects persons' dignity of labour from exploitation by private enterprises, ensuring the right to paid annual holidays, by controlling working conditions, by devoting attention to housing conditions and social insurance."
 csa.4.a: "Approved."

 csa.5.t: "Socialist Constitution - Judiciary"
 csa.5.d: "The IWW has made a strong impression for removing the Supreme Court as the final appeal for constitutionality, instead making the Appellate Courts carry that weight. Reminding members of the Convention of the Court's track record for legalising oppression of unions and downright reactionary laws, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn remarked that preserving an unelected position of final legal decision could lead to authoritarianism. To the surprise of many, Earl Browder of the TUUL dissented, arguing that this discrimination was the result of a corrupt party system, and not an inherent flaw in the U.S. Constitution. To Browder, removing the Supreme Court would endanger the unity of the nation, and lead to more schisms as had happened in Bolshevik Russia. The AFL have quietly dissented with their vanguardist cohort, and pledge to support Flynn if her resolution passes."
 csa.5.a: "Enshrine Judicial Review of the Court."
 csa.5.b: "The Supreme Court will not be missed."

 csa.6.t: "Socialist Constitution - Economics"
 csa.6.d: "Article 15. The foundation of the economic system of America is socialist ownership of the means of production in the form of public property, belonging to all the people, and collective cooperative property.\n\nArticle 16. All mineral and other wealth underground, the waters, including mineral and medicinal waters, the sources of natural power, the means of rail and air transport, the posts, telegraphs, telephones and broadcasting are public property.\n\nArticle 17. The Land belongs to those who cultivate it. The property of collective farms and other cooperative organisations, and of their joint undertakings, comprises the means of production and other assets which they require for the purposes laid down in their rules. The land held by collective farms is secured to them for their free use in perpetuity.\n\nArticle 18. Private property and private initiative in economy are guaranteed. The inheritance of private property is guaranteed. The right of inheritance is regulated by the state. No person is permitted to use the right of private property to the detriment of the people's community. The existence of private monopolist organisations, such as cartels, syndicates, trusts and similar organisations created for the purpose or re-purposed for dictating prices, monopolising the market and damaging the interests of the public economy, is forbidden. Private property may be limited or expropriated if the common interest requires it, but only in accordance with the law. It will be determined by law in which cases and to what extent the owner shall be compensated. Under the same conditions individual branches of national economy or single enterprises may be nationalised by law if the common interest requires it."
 csa.6.a: "Approved."

 csa.7.t: "Socialist Constitution - Status of the President"
 csa.7.d: "A surge of unaligned delegates has attempted to leave for recess several times to no avail. It appears that the issue of Executive power has met an impasse, and a decision must be made before the delegates starve in indecision. On one side is the IWW, whose plan for a complete anarcho-syndicalist government requires there not to be an executive officer. Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Thomas suggests a weak head of state position. The opposition is another cooperation of the AFL and TUUL who wish for a strong face to represent America. A leader without the means, argue they, could never save America as Reed did without power. Norman Thomas has condemned the AFL for what he sees as a 'boulangist coup' perpetrated by the AFL and TUUL to revive the old federal government. John L Lewis of the AFL rises to object, saying 'subordination to the IWW programme is no different than a single party state'. "
 csa.7.a: "A Weak Head Can Never Oppress"
 csa.7.b: "A President with Power We Shall Have"

 csa.8.t: "Socialist Constitution - Centralisation or Decentralisation"
 csa.8.d: "The Convention, after resuming, has found themselves more divided than ever. The core of the IWW has galvanised into a stricter dogma that pushes for the remaining articles to protect against tyranny of a central government. Demanding protection through the lifetime assurance of union membership and compounding social security with lifelong employment. Several IWW delegates had implied that the AFL has been antagonistic, and would prefer a return to capitalism. In response, the AFL have been swayed by TUUL to emphasise the 'Dignity of Labour' in government. This argument rebukes Industrial Unionism with Craft Unionism, where the right to fair wages for fair work done replaces the IWW's goal of the abolition of wages. Browder again takes the stage calling to protect craft unionism, as it prevents a 'tyranny of the 51% over the 49%' in union elections."
 csa.8.a: "Guaranteed Employment will stop tyrants."
 csa.8.b: "Dignity of Labour will stop tyrants."

 csa.9.t: "Socialist Constitution - Capital"
 csa.9.d: "One of the last things to be decided is the capital of America. While Many are advocating for Washington DC as the location of the new capital as it was the old capital, and it easily fits that purpose. Others are advocating for the loyal cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City. Which shall the convention choose?"
 csa.9.a: "Keep it in Chicago."
 csa.9.b: "Washington, DC."
 csa.9.c: "Philadelphia."
 csa.9.e: "New York City."

 csa.10.t: "Constitutional Convention has concluded"
 csa.10.d: "The Constitutional Convention has finally come to an end and the new Constitution of America has been written. The Delegates are returning to their home states, with a new set of allies and rivals. Despite the optimism expressed in the congratulatory photos, the real work of rebuilding the country has just begun."
 csa.10.a: "Long live the Workers of America!"

 csa.11.t: "The Interim President"
 csa.11.d.commonwealth: "On the final day of the Congress, John Silas Reed - better known as Jack Reed - announced that he would step down as leader of the country. Rumours of his deteriorating health were kept away from the press, a gentleman's agreement of sorts. Jack Reed proclaims he will spend his remaining time with his wife, Louise, and his daughter. More-over, Reed emphasised his role was to see the country through to the revolution, but a new leader needs to lead it now. Of the attendees at the Congress, two have gained the most prominence. One is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn of the IWW, who has begun a national campaign to excite voters for a possible female president - namely herself. The other is Norman Thomas who has led SPA delegates to work with Social Democrats to pledge votes to him. There is an understanding that even though this position of leadership is interim until the election, it still will allow either president to exert a great deal of influence over the country's groundwork."

One is Earl Browder, currently Secretary of Communications, who has taken his allies for State Planned Economy and has begun advertising his own campaign on state media. The other is William Foster, a major force in the Constitutional Convention for getting the AFL to advocate centralism, who has called in his connections for his campaign. There is an understanding that even though this position of leadership is interim until the election, it still will allow either president to exert a great deal of influence over the country's groundwork."
 csa.11.a: "Elizabeth Gurley Flynn will take the position."
 csa.11.b: "Norman Thomas gets enough votes to win."
 csa.11.c: "Earl Browder will take the position."
 csa.11.e: "William Foster gets enough votes to win."

### Reconstruction Events ###

 csa.12.t: "Trial of the America First Party"
 csa.12.d: "With the Revolution over, the time comes now to deal with those that fought against us. Huey Long, so according to Earl Browder, could have been a great ally to socialism. We do admit that Long's plan for welfare was in the right direction, but his authoritarian practice was abhorrent. As Long's family and close associates are now in exile, we'll have to make due with putting the leaders that remain in chains. Francis Townsend has defended the actions of the AFP's core membership, saying that the radical militarism was due to the nature of Southern Populism, not Huey Long-ism. Some in the jury have been swayed, but the final decision is to..."
 csa.12.a: "Pardon AFP Leadership."
 csa.12.b: "Convict AFP Leaders."
 csa.12.c: "Seize and arrest all party members."

 csa.13.t: "Trial of the Federal Government"
 csa.13.d: "With the Revolution over, the time comes now to deal with those that fought against us. The charges against, among other former Federalist politicians Douglas MacArthur. that of seizing the government and suspending civil rights in defence of conservative Democrats. Henry Morganthau Jr. has appeared in MacArthur's stead, due to his recent exile. Representing the business and social interest of the old regime, Morganthau stated that it was only under MacArthur that the mob violence against Jews committed by the AFP was halted. The testimony of MacArthur's reluctance to accept extra-legal power, and his personal accounts of admiring the socialist Jacob Coxey has swayed some. Ultimately, the jury has decided to..."
 csa.13.a: "Pardon the Federal leaders."
 csa.13.b: "Convict the Federal leaders."
 csa.13.c: "Seize and arrest all regime supporters."

 csa.14.t: "Avant-Garde Film"
 csa.14.d: "Avant-Garde art forms are not inherently a political tool, but the artists have shown an overwhelming support for the SPA in 1936. From the surrealists in New York shocking viewers with graphic sex on screen, to the Dadaists who challenge the very concept of popular art. As part of this movement, many of the countries thousands of movie theatres have been expropriated to ensure that work of this calibre is not censored by prudish theatre owners. They are brightly painted and carrying on board a printing press, government complaint office, printed political leaflets and pamphlets, library books, and a mobile movie theatre. Theatres are part of the new revolutionary government to indicate the values and programs to the scattered populace of America, particularly the rural regions of the country."
 csa.14.a: "Make sure kids don't see the surrealist films."

 csa.15.t: "Art Deco versus Modernism"
 csa.15.d: "For most of the 1920s and 1930s the Art Deco art style was the dominant type of architecture, and from coast to coast, buildings were built in the Art Deco way. However, a number of revolutionary architects within the SPA wish to break away from that style and seek a more Modernist approach inspired by the designs coming out of France, Italy, or Britain. The AFL have come out in force to counter that Art Deco is an American style that cannot be erased by political whims. The AFL point to Diego Rivera's recent demolition of the Rockefeller Center artwork, after his modification of chiselling the faces of Marx and Lenin over Zeus and Thor were decried as being in poor taste. Which style shall be supported?"
 csa.15.a: "Preserve Art Deco."
 csa.15.b: "Modernism."

 csa.16.t: "Debates over Union Membership Fees and Racism"
 csa.16.d: "What sounded like a simple proposition during the revolution, that of abolishing segregation, has run into numerous potholes. Starting with the debate over whether union membership fees were inherently discriminatory towards black workers. Evidence on both sides appears inconclusive, and most of the unions that were rejected from the Constitutional Convention have protested in favour a maximum union membership fee. These protestors claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW. Then came the union Congressmen from the newly liberated states, who are protesting that forcing integration is a violation of their union rights to collectively bargain. Ultimately the IWW have persevered in Congress, and publicly shamed the new Congressmen and protestors as reactionaries."
 csa.16.a: "We shall not give in to more racists in disguise!"

 csa.17.t: "The Rise of Women-Only Unions"
 csa.17.d: "Since the revolution, more and more women are entering into politics and technical fields. While in certain states the transition to women's liberation has gone smoothly, in other places the wave is impeded. A national poll has shown the number of women-only unions have quadrupled in the past year. When interviewed, these Women-Only Unions claim persistent systematic discrimination in the fields of science and civil service. In the aftermath of this release, the planned Women's Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of women's liberation. [CSA.GetLeader] has settled the debate by decrying both Women-Only Unions and the systematic discrimination, arguing that 'there are people to blame on both sides for discrimination'."
 csa.17.a: "The Revolutionary Man and Woman are equals."

 csa.18.t: "Redistributing Corporate Wealth"
 csa.18.d: "One of the few things Reed had agreed with the villainous Long on is wealth redistribution. Reed's wartime rationing has given way to a peace-time legislation to prevent the robber baronies he had fought all his life. This is enacted in the form of his final wishes to Congress, the expropriation of all assets owned by a single person in excess of $$10 million USD. [CSA.GetLeader] has taken this one step further to decry the idea of corporations, and has threatened to declare the legal concept of corporations to be illegal. The very next day, the state offices were inundated with hundreds if not thousands of formal requests to dissolve corporations into their component businesses, and applications for new Consortium's in the same breath. It is obvious to [CSA.GetLeader] that this is just a ploy for the robber barons to hide their business practices from the government, and has ordered a moratorium on reclassification until wealth redistribution is over."
 csa.18.a: "You won't get away that easy."

 csa.19.t: "Land Redistribution Clashes with local Warlords"
 csa.19.d: "From the mansions of the Rockefeller, the Morgans, the Carnegies, and the Vanderbilts, to the sharecroppers who run company stores. The land of the United States still belongs to the capitalist. The worst example being Murphy Ranch out in California, which was a hive of Silver Shirt activity during the war, and took months to starve out by our forces. It has been decided by Congress to exercise expropriation on these estates. Many of the southern and western estates have been given over to the local communes and established as public housing for the people. As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation. One particular tough nut to crack was in Montana, where the initial militia sent in turned traitor, and held onto a large estate for its warlord owner for eight months before our Red Guard were forced to intervene. The program seems to be working however, so there is no reason to reconsider."
 csa.19.a: "Who would've thought, warlords?"

 csa.20.t: "Prisons Overflowing with Reactionaries"
 csa.20.d: "Nobody could have expected our crime and punishment system would become so overstuffed as to require this decision. The numerous small schisms in the SPA has left our government with its fair share of detractors, as well as the expected resistance. Thousands upon thousands are being fed, clothed and housed on our dime for their crimes against the people. Our more reform minded are worried that prisons will be a breeding ground for reactionary though, so workingmen should be diverted to work camps. There they will be able to pay back the state for what they stole from the people. Vanguardists believe that we have been too lenient on these traitors, and must execute the traitors of the highest standing in the prisons, as a rebellion is surely about to come. The Catholic Workers Movement strongly disagree, and claim that exile and life elsewhere is the most Christian thing to do."
 csa.20.a: "Execute the traitors of high standing."
 csa.20.b: "Take the working men into work-camps."
 csa.20.c: "Exile them to Canada and Mexico."

 csa.21.t: "Education Revolution"
 csa.21.d: "A notable professor out of John Hopkins University by the name of John Dewey has been appointed Secretary of Education. In Dewey's eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a predetermined set of skills, but rather the realisation of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. In particular, he emphasises that schooling must include hands-on learning famously stating 'if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind'. Dewey's detractors, notably the Catholic Workers Movement, claim his polities are antagonistic to religious education. Ultimately [CSA.GetLeader] has decided to endorse Dewey's reforms."
 csa.21.a: "Towards a New Generation."

 csa.22.t: "The President Uncovers the Greater Business Plot"
 csa.22.d: "[CSA.GetLeader] and the Attorney General appeared at Congress today to allege that they uncovered a connection between the corporations that supported Huey Long, MacArthur, and the Pacific States. This accusation alleges that business interests in America were behind the degradation of civil politics during the revolution, and in the event of the Syndicates being defeated, the Corporations would be the true power behind the presidency. The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL. It appears that some of the corporations on the chopping block include large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co. Many Congressmen worry that punishing the medical profession will harm the life expectancy of the CSA. An alternate proposal for these corporations to be collectivised and their members rehabilitated and let free."
 csa.22.a: "Small sacrifice for a future without capitalism."
 csa.22.b: "We shall have them rehabilitated."

 csa.23.t: "Resistance to social changes"
 csa.23.d: "In an attempt to observe the changes in society that socialism is building, Congress has approved of a roaming documentary to film the new America, so that the world may know our progress. The film was shown to Congress to shock and revulsion, with scenes government of propaganda defaced, continued social barring of women from workplaces, and a union representative charging a black worker nearly five times the going rate for union membership. The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted. A minority of Congressmen came to defend the film, claiming that this shows the systematic difficulty in enforcing such revolutionary acts throughout the nation. These unpopular Congressmen were then ejected from the building."
 csa.23.a: "Reactionaries will be dealt with!"

 csa.24.t: "Family Code of [GetYear]"
 csa.24.d: "With the social revolution in full swing, Congress has passed the Family Code of [GetYear]. The Family Code is a revolutionary code that is driven by an ideological desire to wither away the capitalist model of the family to be replaced by a socialist model of the familial free unions based on mutual love and respect.\n\nThus, to that end, the code included a number of revolutionary changes. It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidised. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, as well as decriminalising homosexual behaviour. A Committee of Sexology, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, Wilhelm Reich, and Alain Leroy Locke are still locked in debate over how to approach this."
 csa.24.a: "The world is changing."

### Commonwealth Events ###
 csa.26.t: "Flynn vs. Sinclair"
 csa.26.d: "After some time, the interim government term laid out in the Constitution of [CSA.GetNameDef] has finally drawn to a close - meaning that the time has come for a new permanent President to be elected by the assembly. Although the office is still young and Syndicalist dominance at the constitutional convention has done much to leave the executive fairly weak, the election still carries much significance - it is a chance to measure the current prevailing attitudes towards the state of the revolution, and the President is still seen as the face of America abroad. Furthermore, garnering enough support to get their candidate installed in the presidency is strong proof of a faction's leading role in politics - and the break-up of the SPA has left two opposing parties very interested in doing as such.\n\nAt an appointed time, in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], a stage was set in front of the assembled $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ and $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ delegates. From the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ in Portland, Oregon, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn gave a speech appealing for nomination as President of the CSA. Flynn drew on her foundational role in the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ as well as the American Civil Liberties Union. Flynn promised members both in the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ and $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ that her commitment to free speech would ensure that no worker, unionised or otherwise, would lose their rights in the new government. The next speech was from California $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ representative Upton Sinclair, founder of the 'End Poverty in America movement'. Sinclair promised to use his political experience in convincing old American parties to ensure the legitimacy of the CSA.\n\nSinclair and Flynn spent the next few days in a sporadic debate across union papers, Flynn accusing Upton Sinclair of being an insincere self promoter, using politics to enhance his reputation as an artist prior to the ACW. Upton retorted that Flynn is unpopular with the great body of rural Americans, saying that her free speech absolutism would lead to a third civil war. Flynn attempted to counter this assertion by arguing that Sinclair's status among this demographic is hardly any better, and that allowing for free speech is the most effective way to ease along reintegration - but Sinclair remained adamant that French mindsets cannot be applied to America so soon, and that this line proves that the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ is too radical and idealistic to remain at the helm.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted. The winner, and the next [Root.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] president will be..."
 csa.26.a: "Elizabeth Gurley Flynn!"
 csa.26.b: "Upton Sinclair!"

 csa.27.t: "Hoan vs. Thomas"
 csa.27.d: "After some time, the interim government term laid out in the Constitution of [CSA.GetNameDef] has finally drawn to a close - meaning that the time has come for a new permanent President to be elected by the assembly. Although the office is still young, the dominance of the SPA party core at the constitutional convention has ensured that the President wields a fair degree of power. As such, the election carries much significance - the man elected to the presidency will likely help shape [CSA.GetAdjective] policy for the next four years. Furthermore, garnering enough support to get their candidate installed in the presidency is strong proof of a faction's leading role in politics - and the break-up of the SPA has left two opposing parties very interested in doing as such.\n\nAt an appointed time, in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], a stage was set in front of the assembled $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ and $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ delegates. From the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ in Wisconsin, Daniel Hoan gave a speech appealing for nomination as President of the CSA. Hoan promised to defend the legitimacy of the CSA both internally and abroad, and has put forward his successful mayorship of Milwaukee as an template for rebuilding America's cities. The next speech was from New York $CSA_radical_socialist_party$ representative Norman Thomas, former Presbyterian preacher turned socialist advocate. Thomas vowed to form a popular front with survivors of the Farmer-Labor Party, apply Christian ethics to [CSA.GetName]'s government, and ensure that the country would not experience a drastic government change so soon after its establishment.\n\nHoan and Thomas spent the next few days in a sporadic debate across union papers. Hoan accused Thomas of being a closet-nationalist, citing his long record of antiwar activism prior to the civil war and challenging his dedication to the cause of internationalism. Thomas defended himself, saying that antiwar politics were the right path for America to stay out of imperialist wars. He returned that Hoan was beholden to allies in the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$, and would infringe on workers' rights in favour of industrialisation, to which Hoan replied that he and the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ were very active in guaranteeing labor rights into law during the constitutional convention, and that there is no reason to believe that industrial expansion will cause such a large crisis.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted. The winner, and the next [Root.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] president will be..."
 csa.27.a: "Daniel Hoan!"
 csa.27.b: "Norman Thomas!"

 csa.29.t: "Flynn vs. Lewis"

However, she is not without controversy: the speech issue in particular continues to haunt her, as while most violent opposition to the revolution has been neutralised, rural opposition has been more than happy to use her free speech laws to continue to call for passive resistance.

Flynn has stubbornly stood by the ideal of free speech, and has accused Lewis of being two-faced - she has asserted that Lewis is hardly a socialist, and that it is deeply disingenuous of him to argue for a crackdown on reactionaries, which is to say nothing about the allegations of Lewis being a ruthless and bullying union leader.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted.

Amter's health has also been a serious issue of debate - the 67 year old Amter was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

By nominating Randolph, the Socialists hope to appeal to un-unionised, African-American, and more moderate voters in addition to those discontent with twelve years of Worker government.\n\nPresident Zeidler and the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ have held their ground, dusting off an old Constitutional Convention-era proposal to make union membership mandatory, in order to resolve the legal double standard between unionised and unionless workers. They charge that the party has not stopped listening to the needs of the people and has been making good progress in desegregation efforts, and that they remain the \"natural party of government\" as opposed to the moribund Socialists.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted. The winner, and the next [Root.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] president will be..."

 csa.45.t: "Allison vs Sinclair"
 csa.45.d: "As [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] looks to a new decade, the time has come once again for the country to determine who will lead it for the next four years. The term of President Allison has turned out to be...uneventful. Allison's primary program was the transfer of many responsibilities away from the executive and towards Congress, which has come with the curious side effect of drawing a lot of media attention away from the presidency. This has resulted in what is being called the quietest period in the history of [CSA.GetNameDef] - in the public eye, very little happened during the term, with mixed reactions.\n\nTo challenge Allison, the $CSA_radical_socialist_party$ has nominated Upton Sinclair, a party veteran. Sinclair brings to the debate his decades of popularity outside politics as a writer, and socialist credentials dating back to before the civil war. The opposition's primary angle of attack on Allison has been calling him the head of a do-nothing government, a charge that Sinclair has carried on by accusing the President of being an ineffective propagandist for the Syndicates and alienating westerners who cannot relate their needs to industrial labour.\n\nAllison, meanwhile, has returned fire by accusing Sinclair of being flighty within the political realm, citing his work on Mental Radio while his End Poverty in America program floundered during the civil war. The President holds that the expectations set of him by his opponents are ridiculous - despite his reserved use of the executive, Congress has been active during this term and has not been getting the credit it deserves. However, Sinclair still holds that an active executive can be far more responsive to the issues facing the nation.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted. The winner, and the next [Root.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] president will be..."

 csa.46.d.johns: "As [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] looks to a new decade, the time has come once again for the country to determine who will lead it for the next four years. Completing his final term, President Johns has presided over an era of renewed radicalism, as the government attempted to further socialism through means previously thought unthinkable. However, eight years of this approach seem to have created a real fatigue among the American people, who increasingly desire a more relaxed political scene after years of a rhetoric of vigilance.\n\nTo succeed President Johns, the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ has nominated Henning Blomen of Massachusetts, representing a new generation of socialist organisers. In a stark turn for the party, Blomen did not actively participate in the civil war, preferring to hold to his ideal of a 'bloodless revolution' that would abolish capitalism. He has campaigned on a policy of leniency towards former establishment partisans, and a renewed commitment to socialist pacifism.\n\nMeanwhile, the $CSA_radical_socialist_party$ has elected to nominate Asa Philip Randolph, the first African-American to be nominated to the presidency by a major party - and, if elected, America's first African-American president. Randolph has a long history as labour and a civil rights leader, and has spent the post-civil war era leading many efforts to desegregate unions as a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation.\n\nFor much of the campaign, the respective parties and their history has been the primary bone of contention - Randolph holds that the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ cannot claim to be genuinely interested in reconciliation after such a militant eight years and that only the $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ has the credentials to lead a lasting peace. Meanwhile, Blomen argues that the $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ has, on occasion, been the preferred party of the American Federation of Labor, who have become a major target of desegregation campaigns.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted.

Against all odds, the controversial President Roosevelt has managed to defy expectations and complete a full two terms, championing her personal brand of equality and reconciliation. Although some radicals remain bitter over the perceived undermining of the revolution, the times seem to have changed - both parties have elected to nominate moderate candidates, speaking to a new era in [Root.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] politics.\n\nTo succeed President Roosevelt, the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ has nominated Henning Blomen of Massachusetts, representing a new generation of socialist organisers.

 csa.46.d.lewis: "As [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] looks to a new decade, the time has come once again for the country to determine who will lead it for the next four years. President Lewis looks destined to go down as one of the most controversial presidents of not only the post-civil war era, but in American history as a whole - Lewis leaves office praised for what his supporters call direct action for the workers, but decried for what his opponents label a bullying personality and \"fraudulent socialism\". Although divisions over the Lewis presidency remain, the [Root.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] political scene seems to have changed despite, or perhaps because of, this fact: both parties' nominees for President are notably moderate this year.\n\nThe $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ has elected to nominate Henning Blomen of Massachusetts, representing a new generation of socialist organisers. Unlike some, Blomen did not participate in the civil war, preferring to hold to his ideal of a 'bloodless revolution' that would abolish capitalism without a need for violence. Blomen remains opposed to Lewis's style of government and many of his policies, and still campaigns on a renewed commitment to socialism, but also maintains a need for pluralism in politics, pointing to a moderation of the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$\n\nTo succeed President Lewis, the $CSA_radical_socialist_party$ has nominated Asa Philip Randolph, the first African-American to be nominated to the presidency by a major party - and, if elected, America's first African-American president.

 csa.47.d: "As [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] looks to a new decade, the time has come once again for the country to determine who will lead it for the next four years. Thus far, President Cannon has lived up to his word - his term has seen a both a remilitarisation of society in the name of defence against foreign reactionary powers, and a renewal of reforms intended to expand the syndicalist system in America. However, as the civil war becomes an increasingly distant memory, many have questioned the necessity of his hawkish stance - there seems to be an increasing desire among the American people for demobilisation and more relaxed politics.\n\nAiming to ride the anti-militarist wave, the $CSA_radical_socialist_party$ have nominated the long-time party veteran Norman Thomas. After participating in the constitutional convention and losing his bid to be [CSA.GetNameDef]'s first president, Thomas took a relatively reduced role in politics, lending his wisdom to $CSA_radical_socialist_party_abbrev$ members and occasionally taking a position in Congress, but the controversy of Cannon's militarism has spurred him to once again run for the presidency.\n\nCannon has come out of the campaign gate swinging, charging that Norman Thomas would, should he win, revert the country to pacifism typical of his early career, and rendering America vulnerable to enemies both foreign and domestic and water down the socialist revolution. Thomas struck back, criticising Cannon's embrace of civilian militarism as undermining the true aim of the revolution, and bearing a striking similarity to rhetoric used by both Longists and the political establishment before the civil war. Thomas has reaffirmed his commitment to \"all-inclusive socialism\", where socialists and progressives of all stripes have a voice in government, as an alternative to Cannon's itinerant militancy. Although there certainly is a backlash against Cannon's governance, how deep it runs is still untested - and in an age where weapons of unimaginable destructive power seem to be leaving the realm of fiction, Cannon's defensive stance may still find an audience.\n\nAt the end of this, the parties reconvened in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and voted.

 csa.48.d: "As [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] looks to a new decade, the time has come once again for the country to determine who will lead it for the next four years. President Amter's term has seen an unprecedented centralisation of power in the federal government, aided by the tacit support of the $CSA_totalist_party_postwar_long$ - a connection that the opposition has regularly used as ammunition against the government. Further complicating matters are the intensifying rumours of Amter's declining health - while the President and his aides insist that he is healthy enough to run for another term, his public appearances have been increasingly sparse, and he has been delegating much power to his cabinet.\n\nIn a bid to capitalise on the perceived weakness of the administration, the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ has elected to nominate Henning Blomen of Massachusetts, representing a new generation of socialist organisers. In a stark turn for the party, Blomen did not participate in the civil war, preferring to hold to his ideal of a 'bloodless revolution' that would abolish capitalism - it's hoped that Blomen's brand of idealistic socialism will provide a welcome to relief to a country increasingly searching for more normal politics.\n\nAmter and his allies have charged that Henning Blomen would, should he win, divide the nation by unfairly demonising those who prefer a strong government to ward against reactionaries. Blomen struck back, criticising Amter's abandonment of Reed's idea of syndicalist primacy over partisanship, and has accused the Amter administration of fostering caesarist tendencies within the government - a shot widely seen as one against the Unity League caucus.

President Hoopes's term has largely been defined by a relative period of calm - as the civil war becomes an increasingly distant memory, there is an increasing sense that America is settling into a new normal as socialist militancy begins to fade into the background, aided by Hoopes's cooperation with the moderate Progressive and Farmer-Labor parties.\n\nThis year, the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar$ have nominated Henning Blomen of Massachusetts, hoping to adapt to the shifting political scene. In a stark turn for the party, Blomen did not participate in the civil war, preferring to hold to his ideal of a 'bloodless revolution' that would abolish capitalism - it's hoped that Blomen's brand of idealistic socialism will provide a palatable packaging for the new American syndicalism.\n\nPresident Hoopes has charged that Henning Blomen would, should he win, reverse the progress made by his administration by attacking his moderate allies in the service of syndicalism, insinuating that the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ has not moderated as much as they claim. Hoopes struck back, criticising Blomen for fear-mongering in spite of Blomen's pacifist reputation - he maintains that there's no need to persecute the moderates now that the war is over. Blomen has argued that the $CSA_syndicalist_party_postwar_abbrev$ has been practising the line of 'syndicalism by ballot' ever since they were defeated in the constitutional convention, and that their turn isn't as new as Hoopes suggests.

 csa.52.d: "William Foster and Earl Browder have long viewed each other as the enemy to the people, more than just a stepping block to their own power. To Foster, Browder's economic policies will strip power from the unions and thus the proletariat. To Browder, Foster's social policies include dangerously unsocialist principles that engender to divide the proletariat by promoting Craft Unions and promoting darwinism over cooperation. As the revolution has come to an end their struggle has taken on new heights. How this shall end, is hard to say. Though some are fearing what will happen should the other be deposed."

 csa.53.d: "William Foster and his supporters have denounced President Earl Browder after his dissolution of the IWW - claiming that Browder’s actions as tyrannical and contradictory to the revolution.

 csa.54.t: "Browder Reassigned to Europe"
 csa.54.d: "Following Earl Browder's denouncement of President Foster in a public speech, Earl Browder has been reassigned to a newly-created party position in Europe. This new position, as dictated by President Foster, entails Browder oversee furniture assembly and candlestick making unions that are so vital to our economy. Such an illustrious post demands that Browder not return until his year-long tenure is up. Unfortunately, communication to this international facility is spotty at times, so Browder will no longer be able to coordinate with his party allies back in America."

Evidence displayed prominently in the papers showed secret communication between Foster, MacArthur, and Huey Long. Irrefutable testimony from Foster's emaciated family who attest to seeing Foster moving gold from the old Federal Reserve to his home. The Tribunal has declared that as such that he will be executed.

 csa.65.d: "Following the end of the Syndicalist Revolution, numerous members of the Progressive Party had pledged allegiance to the USAS in a massive show of support. While the public at large was fooled by this display, the Vanguard party is not so easily deceived. President [CSA.GetLeader] has spent the last several weeks building up a case to present to Congress purporting the inherent betrayal of Progressives to the socialist ideal. A gaunt and limping Henry Wallace appeared in a political rally today to denounce the Progressives as 'social klansmen disguised to deceive the working class.' Wallace then joined [CSA.GetLeader] in announcing that he will testify in the upcoming sedition trial against the Progressives, and they assure the public that traitors of this calibre deserved death."

The rest of America watches with bated breath to see what happens in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. [CSA.GetLeader] has responded by calling for as many allies in the military, including the Red Guards, to seize the traitorous generals before the revolution dies fighting 'another MacArthur'.

 csa.68.t: "Restoring Democracy"
 csa.68.d: "'Americans did not fight and die in the revolution to overthrow a capitalistic dictatorship only to install a socialist dictatorship. The president, however, corrupted the revolution and tainted it. I have removed him from power, not to make myself a dictator, but to stop a tyrant. A new and free election shall be held within a year's time.' With these words on the radio from [CSA_GetButlerOrCarlsonName], America was shocked to find that the government had been overthrown. Perhaps, however, some measure of freedom had been restored - the only question left now is who should oversee the difficult transition period."
 csa.68.a: "Elizabeth Gurley Flynn."
 csa.68.b: "Norman Thomas."

 csa.69.t: "Self Determination in the Black Belt"
 csa.69.d: "Before the revolution, there were plans by [CSA.GetLeader] to implement an autonomous region within the South for the African-American community. With the ascension of William Foster comes a dedication to the dream of creating a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress. While the ruling party as a whole supports this, several critics from other parties note that this policy would create an unequal standard for civil rights."
 csa.69.a: "Self Determination is good for all."
 csa.69.b: "We can't proceed without support."

 csa.70.t: "Reactions to the Black Belt"
 csa.70.d: "The African-American community is split over the Black Belt. On one hand it dramatically increased the number of black Vanguard politicians and in the country overall, as the independent communes required elected officials. On the other hand several non vanguard black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colourblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in laws, or to expand the Black Belt northwards."
 csa.70.a: "We stand firm."

 csa.71.t: "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
 csa.71.d: "Demand for food to feed the armies and citizens of a starving, war-torn Europe led many commercially-minded Southern landowners to grow corn and wheat during the years of the Weltkrieg. For nearly a decade, sales to Europe during and after the war made landowners, bankers, and commercial insurers rich, but this prosperity would not last. In 1925, the British Revolution wracked the United Kingdom, precipitating a debt crisis as scores of Britons lost their lives' savings and as even the British government went into a de-facto default, plunging the United States into the Great Depression. To make matters worse for the South, the recovery of the German agricultural sector following demobilisation caused demand for food crops to plummet even further.\n\nThe tenant farmers who had worked the land for the landowners that had profited during the high times responded by unionising during the lows. With some encouragement from Norman Thomas, sharecropper and gas-station worker Harry Leland Mitchell and his friend Clay East formed the Southern Tenants Farmers' Union in 1934, eventually coming to affiliate with the AFL-CIO. However, during the turbulent years leading up to the Revolution, many members of the STFU were taken in by Huey Long's populist rhetoric, and openly supported the America Firsters. Since the end of the Second American Civil War, the STFU has only continued to attract Longists and other seditious elements seeking to use it as a cover to legitimise their presence in the new America.\n\nToday, however, the STFU met its fate before the unions as a bailiff presented Mitchell and East to a union court on charges of sedition, high treason, and harbouring reactionaries and crypto-Longists such as Francis Townsend, one of the chief architects of Long's \"Share Our Wealth\" program and who was found by the CIA in Tyronza, Arkansas after East confessed to CIA agents that he had harboured Townsend and his wife at his home.\n\nPresident Browder, for his part, is said to be privately ecstatic at finally having the chance to destroy such a dangerous pocket of resistance as he turns the increasingly mighty state apparatus of the Union of Socialist American States to the task of dismantling the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union and turning their lands directly to the purposes of the state."
 csa.71.a: "Good riddance to bad unions!"

 csa.72.t: "The International Peace Movement disbanded"
 csa.72.d: "The revolution against capitalism drew a line in the sand. You were either with the union or a scab, that mantra worked for John Reed, but not for Earl Browder. It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivisation. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of Trade Union Unity League members."
 csa.72.a: "You're not God, little man."

 csa.73.t: "Foster dissolves the AFL"
 csa.73.d: "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labour leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labour by adopting industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence and allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labour."
 csa.73.a: "Good riddance to Lewis."

 csa.74.t: "Browder purges The Daily Worker of Reactionaries"
 csa.74.d: "After months of investigation into the editors of the Daily Worker, President Browder has called for their immediate removal. Citing numerous examples of sub-textual betrayals within the newspaper, including ghost-written opinion pieces mouthing reactionary ideas. Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Daily Worker. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy. All were approved, and thus the mind of America is once again safe from pollution."
 csa.74.a: "No more crude cartoons, either."

 csa.75.t: "River Rouge Wildcat Strike Turns Deadly"
 csa.75.d: "The workshops of the River Rouge Plant have been a known hotbed for violent activity. It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes as no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [CSA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."
 csa.75.a: "It's what Reed would have done."

### General Flavour Event

 csa.76.t: "Premiere of God Save King Billy"
 csa.76.d: "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save King Billy, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save King Billy is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."
 csa.76.a: "Chaplin has outdone himself."

 csa.77.t: "The Catholic Workers Movement"
 csa.77.d: "While a good number of religious Americans have protested the effects of the revolution, that is not true for all groups. Of these groups the one that has attracted the most attention and popularity recently is the Catholic Workers Movement. Led by Comrade Dorothy Day, the movement has attracted popularity for combining Catholicism with socialist values. They focus on the concept of Works of Mercy. They have also built a number of Hospitality Houses in many major cities. The Hospitality Houses are acting as support shelters for those trying to return to civilian life, now that the revolution has come to fruition."
 csa.77.a: "Live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ."

 csa.78.t: "Grapes of Wrath Premiere"
 csa.78.d: "Today, the film Grapes of Wrath premiered in theatres. The film is based on the book of the same name by acclaimed patriotic author John Steinbeck. The story follows the Joads, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. The story illustrates the weight that federally enforced capitalism puts onto their average lives and drags their traditional values through the mud of reality. The movie does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more optimistic tone, showing the family working for the revolution overthrow their California work camp. The main protagonist Tom Joad chooses to stay with his family instead of fleeing into the night, declaring his intention to set up a Red Guard in California to reclaim his farm in Oklahoma. The film has been well regarded by both critics and the public, particularly because of the necessary edit."
 csa.78.a: "A film for the masses."

 csa.79.t: "The People's Conservation Committee"
 csa.79.d: "Since the 1916 National Park Service Act, Americans have been able to preserve natural splendour safe from industrialisation. Since the revolution has now been achieved, a movement has cropped up to combine this conservationism with old Progressive ideals. A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees in the Midwest, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply. Though it took a lot of convincing to get Congress to fund this project, the PCC hopes that in a few years the dust storms that used to reach Washington D.C will only be a memory."
 csa.79.a: "And it puts people to work to boot."

 csa.80.t: "Revolutionary Memorials"
 csa.80.d: "With the revolution now over, countless memorials have gone up throughout the country to honour the sacrifice of the men and women that made the revolution possible. While many honour those that fought for the revolution itself, there are also ones honouring the struggles like the Haymarket Square Riot. As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honouring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing, and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and are honouring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."
 csa.80.a: "Everyone shall be honoured, unless they were bombers."

 csa.81.t: "Cure for Polio"
 csa.81.d: "Dr. Jonas Salk has created a cure for Polio. This is a miracle cure that many are calling a breakthrough in modern science. The scourge of Polio in America will now be forever gone from the minds of Americans. Parents are lining up in droves at health clinics across the country to get the vaccine for their children and themselves."
 csa.81.a: "Thank you, Dr. Salk."

 csa.82.t: "Fate of the Boy Scouts"
 csa.82.d: "A question has come up in regards to the Boy Scouts of America. Some within Congress regard it as a reactionary organisation, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end, a number within Congress believe that a new Pioneer organisation should be created, similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe, called the Pioneers of America. Unlike the Boy Scouts, this organisation will be for both boys and girls. These Pioneers are supported by the government to help make sure that the new socialist ideas are passed down to the next generation."
 csa.82.a: "Leave it alone."
 csa.82.b: "Create the Pioneers of America."

 csa.83.t: "American Artists' Congress"
 csa.83.d: "The American Artist Congress is an organisation that has been created to unite artistic people around the country and help promote the arts within America. From traditional artwork to film-making, all are supported within the artists' congress. It quickly has become a popular organisation to show the new Avant-Garde art of the revolution. Their Chairman, Ernest Hemingway, has already begun planning for a series of patriotic publications about life during the revolution. Ernest Hemmingway's appointment to Chairman has caused some backlash from artists like John Dos Passos and John Steinbeck, who claim Ernest's politics have turned authoritarian in recent years due to his work in producing propaganda for the 1936 US election."
 csa.83.a: "Art for the masses."

 csa.84.t: "John Reed Clubs"
 csa.84.d: "Throughout the country a number of literature clubs called John Reed Clubs have emerged. They are to help organise writers across the country and to help to promote reading and literacy through the local communities. They focus on Socialist Literature, and in particular the corpus of John Reed's nonfiction work."
 csa.84.a: "Reading for Reed!"

 csa.85.t: "Paul Robeson Takes A World Tour"
 csa.85.d: "After a long hiatus from acting, socialist activist Paul Robeson is ready for a world tour. With a powerful voice and a collection of traditional African American labour music, Robeson has become the Marian Anderson of socialists in America. Just like Anderson before him, he has chosen to embark on a world tour to spread his music and support for black American rights to European theatres. The tour includes stops in London, Paris and even Florence. These European audiences, though in touch with American culture, still see black American culture as exotic."
 csa.85.a: "Bon voyage, Robeson."

 csa.86.t: "Promoting Sewer Socialism"
 csa.86.d: "In the old days of the Socialist Party, successes were measured by how clean your sewer system was. Especially in Wisconsin, where Morris Hillquit made it his campaign promise to clean up the city. In reforming and organising public maintenance services, Hillquit showed that socialism could reorganise society without having to redefine or destroy its foundations. The principles of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation now that the chains of oppression have been broken. Many cities such as Pittsburgh are filled with pollution that covers the skies. Now that the revolution is over, cities all across the country shall be cleaned up and modernised. Americans, and the international community, should appreciate a clean sewer as much as they do a skyscraper."
 csa.86.a: "Cleanest sewers in the world."

 csa.87.t: "Anthem for the New America"
 csa.87.d: "Congress is debating what tune shall become the Official Anthem of [CSA.GetNameDef]. Several songs have quickly become the candidates to debate. The question is which shall be voted on to become the official anthem of America?"
 csa.87.a: "Solidarity Forever."
 csa.87.b: "There Is Power In A Union."
 csa.87.c: "This Land Is Your Land."

 csa.88.t: "Stone Mountain, Georgia"
 csa.88.d: "On the face of Stone Mountain, deep in the state of Georgia, lies a long stalled government supported project to carve bas-reliefs to honour the Confederate side of the last civil war. The site has been a hotbed of neo-Confederate activity, a history that has included hosting the site of the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan. Many wish to remove such a blight from the land of the new America, especially as other monuments to the Confederacy are torn down. However, people are divided with regards to the specifics of the incomplete project, which had run out of funding and seen highly public infighting by its patrons in the 1920s. Some believe the limited work done should be destroyed and the mountain allowed to heal the best it can, especially since the face of Robert E. Lee was already blasted off in 1928. James Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to continue the project but feature Jemmy, John Brown and George Padmore, feeling that these heroes of African-American emancipation are best-suited to inspire the new America. Diego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honourable compromise. The relief will be chiselled down to replace the Confederates with leaders of Socialist thinking and revolution. Those being Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and John Reed. A redesign wouldn't be completely out of order given the numerous development issues the monument has faced and indeed the project had already been scaled back and replanned even before the revolution. But our government's final decision will likely send a lasting message about what our new America stands for."
 csa.88.a: "Destroy the relief carving."
 csa.88.b: "The Relief shall show the heroes of emancipation."
 csa.88.c: "The Relief shall show the history of socialism."

 #Suicide is legal:
 csa.89.t: "Syndicalist Ethics"
 csa.89.d: "With the onset of a new society, a new set of ethics must take the place of the old ones. What is truly ethical behaviour? Waging revolution by all means. Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years or persecution. This lead to behaviour the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose souls suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretence to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalise murder so long as it looks like suicide. Foster's cabinet has called him in to reconsider, but the ultimate result was..."
 csa.89.a: "Foster backs down."
 csa.89.b: "Foster wins them over."

 csa.90.t: "The USA Trilogy by John Dos Passos"
 csa.90.d: "Film montage, modernist writing, and the socialist spirit comes together in John Dos Passos's new book U.S.A. The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such an unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of illegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. Dos Passos has defended this inclusion, saying that the truth in art, as he shows it, must still exist even if it is bleak. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by the Congress."
 csa.90.a: "Calm Hemingway down."
 csa.90.b: "Hemingway is right."

 csa.91.t: "Union Vacations"
 csa.91.d: "One of the changes that has come with the Revolution is the transformation of vacationing. The workers of America rarely got to enjoy the luxuries that they created, stolen as they were by capitalists even though they rightly belonged to the people. How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visits to the national parks when they had to work so many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to, have begun to take over and manage various cultural centres as well as help sponsor vacations. This is supported by the government at both a local level and national level as a way to boost productivity and encourage comradeship."
 csa.91.a: "Culture belongs to the people."

 csa.92.t: "The Family and Freedom Program"
 csa.92.d: "Our workers in the factories need to be free from distractions, our revolutionary soldiers must not be burdened with unnecessary worries about the well-being of their family. As part of the program to ensure that the American worker is relieved of responsibilities which President Foster has termed \"A millstone about the neck of the workers\" Today the first train from Chicago to the rural plains in the centre of our country has left with children from mothers and fathers who work in important positions in the industrial heartland. The kids will be safe on the countless fields and ranches in the pastures, making themselves useful in farm labour and running errands, living a healthy life. This frees their parents to wage revolution with all their hearts and energy. With the success of this first train, Foster has proposed to his cabinet to make this a mandatory arrangement throughout the USAS, even going so far as to propose that children be taken by force from more stubborn worker families for their own good."
 csa.92.a: "Foster's cabinet talks him down."
 csa.92.b: "Foster's cabinet agrees."

 csa.93.t: "Woody Guthrie Music Tour"
 csa.93.d: "With Reconstruction on the way, famed musician Woody Guthrie and his band the Almanac Singers has gone on a musical tour. Popular with many throughout the country, Guthrie and his band play old classics such as Solidarity Forever and There is Power in a Union but they also have written many new songs, such as This Land is your Land, Ease My Revolutionary Mind, Tear the Capitalists down, and All you Capitalists are bound to lose. The tour has proven to be widely popular in all the venues that he and his band play at."
 csa.93.a: "Roll the Union on."

 csa.94.t: "1st World Science Fiction Convention"
 csa.94.d: "Today in New York City, the first ever world Science Fiction Convention was convened, gathering literary minds in science fiction to discuss and talk about the genre. It had such people as John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Donald A. Wollheim, Frederick Pohl, John Michel, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and Jack Gillespie. While it had a modest size of 200 participants, it was still considered a success with a second one planned next year."
 csa.94.a: "The World of Tomorrow."

 csa.95.t: "Indian Revolution Committee"
 csa.95.d: "The native people of America have long been mistreated by the old Capitalist government. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, they stole their land from them to turn a profit. Now that we have done away with the old Bureau government we can address the issue of the Indians. Thus, the Indian Revolution Committee has been created. The IRC will work with the local tribes and communities about how to handle the abuses that the Bureau government committed and how the revolution and its ideals can be implemented within their territory."
 csa.95.a: "The revolution has come to the Native Americans."

 csa.96.t: "Travel in America"
 csa.96.d: "With the revolution over and reconstruction under way, a debate over the future of travel has come up. Automotive Unions believe that cars will be the perfect vehicle for the new America, a symbol of the Freedom that Americans fought for. However, the train unions contest that claim and believe that America should invest in trains as a way to help connect all the towns and cities. Who shall Congress support?"
 csa.96.a: "Support the Automotive Unions."
 csa.96.b: "Support the Train Unions."

 csa.97.t: "Alternative to Hollywood"
 csa.97.d: "With the west still occupied by capitalist reactionaries that has meant that Hollywood is no longer available to us. Thus, the various film and artistic unions have been searching for an alternative and they have presented to Congress a number of alternative locations for filming. Which city shall be given the support?"
 csa.97.a: "Dallas."
 csa.97.b: "Miami."
 csa.97.c: "Houston."
 csa.97.e: "St. Louis."

 csa.98.t: "[GetYear] World Series"
 csa.98.d: "The [GetYear] World Series of Baseball is here. This is the first world series since the revolution and attendance is high. Seven games of Baseball over six days as the Cincinnati Reds fought the Detroit Tigers. The games are extremely close so the final game is anyone's guess."
 csa.98.a: "And the winner is..."

 csa.99.t: "Detroit Tigers win"
 csa.99.d: "The Tigers have won the game. The final game was close but Hank Greenberg, known as the Hebrew Hammer, scored the final home run in the final inning securing the win for the Detroit Tigers and making it so that they won the [GetYear] World Series."
 csa.99.a: "Go Tigers!"

 csa.100.t: "Cincinnati Reds"
 csa.100.d: "The Reds have won the game. The final game was close but Ernie Lombardi scored the final home run in the final inning securing the win for the Cincinnati Reds and making it so that they won the [GetYear] World Series."
 csa.100.a: "Go Reds!"

### Foreign Policy ###

 csa.101.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Join the Internationale"
 csa.101.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap], having recently become enlightened to the benefits of socialist government, has approached us with a request. They wish to formally join the Internationale. Would such a distant ally be worthwhile?"
 csa.101.a: "Of course! We welcome them."
 csa.101.b: "We have no need of them."

 csa.102.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 csa.102.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not syndicalist enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
 csa.102.a: "A poor decision on their part."

 csa.103.t: "America's Protection"
 csa.103.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has decided to offer protection to make sure that our new Commune does not falter in the Pacific."
 csa.103.a: "Thank you America."

 csa.104.t: "America's Protection"
 csa.104.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has decided to offer protection to make sure that our new republic does not falter in the Pacific."
 csa.104.a: "Thank you America."

### Military ###

 csa.126.t: "Boldness in Science"
 csa.126.d: "From the bold new class of scientists our generation has produced, none can match the imagination of our Oppenheimer and Pasons. Oppenheimer the ambitious physicist with a connection to the brightest minds in the Internationale can make the atomic weapon dream a reality. Pasons the liberated rocketry pioneer whose devotion to socialism is only matched by his devotion to advancing rocketry research. Unfortunately, we can only fully fund one of these due to budgetary concerns."
 csa.126.a: "We shall be liberated from the earth."
 csa.126.b: "We shall liberate the atom."

 csa.127.t: "No Longer Chained To The Earth"
 csa.127.d: "Despite his unorthodox lifestyle, Jack Parsons has made hasty work of completing a rocket to our specifications. We've had to hold back many objections from politicians claiming that Jack Parsons is secretly in a cult with his work associates. Easily dismissed hogwash, until a meeting held with the team late into production. Parsons surprised everyone with a film of a successful rocket take-off ahead of schedule, but then dropped a bombshell by asking that his rocket be used primarily for scientific exploration of outer space. This incredible news is still being mulled over by the Committee, with their decision dictating the future of the program."
 csa.127.a: "Parsons is off, proceed as planned."
 csa.127.b: "Parsons request is accepted."

 csa.128.t: "The Atomic Chain Broken"
 csa.128.d: "An international cooperation resulted in fantastic progress on the nuclear weapon. The biggest hurdle came when none of the Southwestern states would allow a test of such importance on their land, due to public knowledge of nuclear radiation. We've had to settle for an old munitions test site in West Virginia. There the test was made, and the entire Internationale celebrated this occasion."
 csa.128.a: "We hold the future now."

 csa.129.t: "America is Liberated"
 csa.129.d: "At long last all of America is now part of [CSA.GetNameDef]. The revolution has achieved its a major victory and the people have been unshackled from the chains of capitalism. All our waving the red flag of socialism from California to New York Island. While the scars of the revolution are everywhere we can look forward to bringing the revolution to everyone."
 csa.129.a: "This land is your land."

 csa.130.t: "Overtures from [From.GetNameDef]"
 csa.130.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has arrived, offering a treaty of friendship between [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef], suggesting that two countries with so much in common should work together rather than be at odds."
 csa.130.a: "They are wise."
 csa.130.b: "We have no use for Americans, syndicalist or otherwise."

 csa.131.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 csa.131.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our offer of a treaty of friendship. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our nations."
 csa.131.a: "Excellent."

 csa.132.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 csa.132.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer of a treaty of friendship. Perhaps both our nations being part of the revolution is not enough for them."
 csa.132.a: "A poor decision on their part."

 csa.150.t: "Illinois General Assembly Invites the IWW"
 csa.150.d: "The state legislature of Illinois has invited the IWW to discuss the current crisis and the looming deadline issued by the federal government. Jack Reed accepted this offer, and held an informal meeting with several trade union leaders prior. Reed made it clear that the situation was dire, and the SPA would need to unite behind the IWW in order to survive the coming conflict. This silent agreement meant that the traditional SPA leadership would be reorganised along Industrial Unionist lines, with each union representative allowed a single vote. The SPA immediately and unanimously pledged their support for a social revolution through direct action, not diplomacy."
 csa.150.a: "So Say We All!"

 csa.151.t: "Jack Reed Declares the [GetMonth] Revolution"
 csa.151.d: "In the Illinois General Assembly, Reed delivered a fiery broadcast describing the wealth of America and the Syndicates. Declaring that direct action against capitalist society was a vital necessity for all Americans, and that the federal government's deadline must not only be ignored it must be defied. Telegrams from the Third Internationale poured in to support Reed's SPA, exciting the attendants. A vote was called to begin reforming the American capitalist economy into an anarcho-syndicalist economy. This referendum, signed by the attendants, declared the Federal Reserve null and void. The IWW was appointed the labour chamber for the new syndicalist government, and the selling of company shares declared illegal. The representatives, satisfied with their success, have returned to Chicago to organise the armed revolution."
 csa.151.a: "E pluribus unum."

 csa.152.t: "General Strike Moves on the Federal Reserve"
 csa.152.d: "The General Strike, whose goal has been to protect workers from federal tyranny, now moves to seize the means of production. The Red Guard have ordered an evacuation of lower Manhattan, in order to both seize the gold in the Federal Reserve Bank as well as dismantle Wall Street. In this delegation were reporters, who were allowed to watch congressmen carry safe boxes away for safekeeping in Chicago. These items are put under the trust of the IWW, whom have elected Norman Thomas as their under-secretary. Several SPA politicians were arrested in Washington D.C for meeting outside the Eccles Building, ordering the Federal Reserve Chairman Eugene Black to hear their petitions."
 csa.152.a: "Release those men now!"

 csa.153.t: "Deadline Looms"
 csa.153.d: "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Reed's supporters, Red Guards have been raised in large numbers and a growing determination to see the country remade in a syndicalist image by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they see no path to compromise."
 csa.153.a: "It is only a matter of time."

 csa.154.t: "Reconcile with the CSA?"
 csa.154.d: "Against all odds, [CSA.GetNameDef] has triumphed against all opposition, radically transforming America overnight. From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centred around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at is core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of a peaceful reunification. While our government is favourable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical, and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, [CSA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's Union State crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed, before the victors turn their eyes towards California."
 csa.154.a: "Yes, let us end this ruinous war. (Play as the CSA)"
 csa.154.b: "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

 csa.155.t: "America is Reunited!"
 csa.155.d: "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
 csa.155.a: "From Sea to Shining Sea!"

 csa.156.t: "No Reconciliation"
 csa.156.d: "With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, many in [Root.GetNameDef] hoped the rebel government to the west would prove amenable to a peaceful end to the conflict that's ravaged America. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they have bitterly denounced the Revolutionary Congress as a hollow mockery of democracy, no better than the tyrants in Washington and Baton Rouge it had replaced. It seems that once again, force of arms will be needed to reunite the shattered pieces of the country."

 csa.200.t: "Longist Bombing"
 csa.200.d: "Supporters of Huey Long and his ideals have targeted factories, railways, and troop installations throughout [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. The National Guard are on the scene in [attack_state.GetName], and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind these groups than they were before."
 csa.200.a: "We shall crush these terrorists."

 csa.204.t: "Federalist Bombing"
 csa.204.d: "Federalists who still fight for their delusions of capitalism and exploitation have targeted factories, railways, and troop installations throughout [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. The National Guard are on the scene in [attack_state.GetName], and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind these groups than they were before."
 csa.204.a: "We shall crush these terrorists."

 csa.205.t: "Commander of the Second Continental Navy"
 csa.205.d: "After the start of the Civil War, some high ranking captains and commanders of the U.S. navy have chosen the side of people. Some of them even brought with them ships under their command into our revolutionary endeavour. In our time of need, we need to appoint a Chief to our Navy which will lead us to victory against Federal forces. One of the best choices is experienced William Rea Furlong, a supporter of old U.S. naval doctrine, but we are still not in position to fight in open battle against the Federalist navy. Opposite of him, Hyman Rickover suggests to concentrate our attention against convoys in deep oceans. Finally the young but promising Arleigh Burke suggests to concentrate our effort on use of light ships and give to their captains freedom from high command."
 csa.205.a: "Furlong is our man."
 csa.205.b: "Rickover will strangle the Federalist supply lines."
 csa.205.c: "Burke's decentralisation is the future."

 csa.206.t: "Naval Industry after the Revolution"
 csa.206.d.ACW: "With the outbreak of civil war, most of the shipyards were captured by the enemies of the Revolution. The shipyards that remain in our hands do not allow us to recreate the old US fleet, and we cannot fight against the enemy fleet in our present situation. But there is good for us - most of our shipyard workers have experience, and some of them have already proposed plans to simplify ship production and organisation of work. This will take resources and experienced workers from other places, but allow us to prepare for a naval war against the Federal Government. Our captains are divided into two groups - supporters of destroyers or submarines. The first group are insisting destroyers can fight against most enemy ships, and can also support our main ships in battle. The second group says that submarines are more efficient and can work alone at large distances without the support of the main forces of the fleet. Meanwhile, our leading engineers have proposed an option between them. Although this option is not as effective as specialising in one of the production lines, it will allow us to create a flexible fleet."
 csa.206.d.post_ACW: "During the civil war, most of the shipyards were captured by the enemies of the Revolution. Now, despite our triumph, the US fleet stands in tatters, broken in the war, leaving us dangerously exposed against enemy fleets in our present situation. But there is good for us - most of our shipyard workers have experience, and some of them have already proposed plans to simplify ship production and organisation of work. This will take resources and experienced workers from other places, but allow us to prepare for a naval war against the reactionaries. Our captains are divided into two groups - supporters of destroyers or submarines. The first group are insisting destroyers can fight against most enemy ships, and can also support our main ships in battle. The second group says that submarines are more efficient and can work alone at large distances without the support of the main forces of the fleet.

 csa.206.a: "Focus on submarine production"
 csa.206.b: "Focus on destroyer production"
 csa.206.c: "Let's keep our options open"

 csa.207.t: "Corruption in the Shipyards"
 csa.207.d: "After the end of the Second Revolutionary War, our previous decision to increase ship production shows this model does not work in peacetime. A leading engineer at one of the shipyards was recently caught receiving a bribe from one of the union members, in a private arrangement to prioritise their own work before others. To make matters worse, various shipyards spent money intended for building ships to “improve working conditions”. Despite those claims, that money ended up lining the pockets of the navy officers who supervised the construction and assigned foremen, not the workers.\n\nThe growing corruption in shipyards has become a problem. We must reorganise ship production processes in order to root it out of our system."
 csa.207.a: "We must purge this rot."

 csa.208.t: "First Paradrop Exercise"
 csa.208.d: "While technically speaking, the first paradropping exercises were practised by U.S army in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from Alpena Airfield and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Custer. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was William N. \"Red\" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."
 csa.208.a: "What an achievement!"

 csa.209.t: "Formation of the First Parachute Battalions"
 csa.209.d: "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of high officers and politicians, Fort Custer had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a recruitment drive, the number of volunteers was enough to form 3 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the Continental Army Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

 csa.210.d.butler: "After our decision to organise the army on a state principle, our Commander-in-Chief Smedley Butler, an opponent of this decision, decided to leave the army. Following his example, many of our officers who fled the federal army during the Civil War, also decided to resign - and we don’t have any possibility to stop them and not harm our image in the process. Unfortunately, we will need to reorganise our entire senior command and replace at least half of our field commanders, which will take at least several years."

 csa.210.d.butler_dead: "After our decision to organise the army on a state principle, many opponents of this decision have decided to leave the army. Following their examples, several of our officers who fled the federal army during the Civil War, also decided to resign - and we don’t have any possibility to stop them and not harm our image in the process. Unfortunately, we will need to reorganise much of our senior command and replace at least a quarter of our field commanders, which will take at least a year."

 csa.212.t: "Former Red Guards Rob a Small Town!"
 csa.212.d: "A group of former members of our Red Guard robbed a small town. While the local militia tried to confront them, the bandits had artillery, which soon ended the battle in their favour. The city was devastated, people were killed, and these bandits left the territory without any problems.\n\nAfter the news of this event reached large cities, people began to massively criticise our government, which cannot protect citizens from its former soldiers."
 csa.212.a: "Catch them - this is not China!"

 csa.213.t: "Violence in the Factories!"
 csa.213.d: "The workers of one of our states cooperated and began a mass strike against a 12-hour working day and demanded better working conditions. Although the strike was at first peaceful, the violence began when the Red Guard tried to calm them down and demanded that the workers go home. No one knows who fired the first shot, but many workers were killed and the factory was seriously damaged."
 csa.213.a: "But we are protecting the working class!"

 csa.214.t: "Clashes between Bandits and Rebels!"
 csa.214.d: "A group of bandits and one of the rebel cells recently met. This led to turning the area near one of the small cities into a battlefield. While we are still not sure who won the battle, one of the groups retreated to the neighbouring town and was caught by the enemy. Huge damage was done and many citizens died in this accent. There is no doubt that the rebels will use this episode for propaganda purposes against us."
 csa.214.a: "Just get rid of both of them!"

 csa.215.t: "Growing Banditry and Protests"
 csa.215.d: "Our advantage in the civil war - the number of troops - became a problem after the war ended. With ruined and damaged infrastructure and no government support to help them get to their homes, most of the former militias have turned into a bunch of bandits who rob people for food. This became a common problem in territories that were under enemy control in the last stages of the war. These bandits not only rob people, but also start shooting with small groups of reactionaries when they meet. Some newspapers have already stated that “The Second Civil War did not end and became a procession of warlords,” which seriously damaged our authority, as these people fought for us in a civil war.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, some of the workers started protests - at least now peacefully - with demands to reduce working hours and stop mass production of weapons.\n\nIf we do not start the demobilisation program in the near future, this will only lead to the ongoing devastation of the country."

Having successfully overthrown the federal government in Washington and crushed the counter-revolution launched by Huey Long, the Combined Syndicates of America called for a second Constitutional Convention in order to lay the groundwork for a new nation. During this lengthy deliberation, numerous factions bickered, debated and discussed until a consensus was reached.\nThe new America has rejected the growing threat of Totalism and tyranny, in favour of a socialist republic, maintaining the spirit of American freedom. It remains to be seen how stable the new government will be, and if the syndicalists can successfully root out capitalism in their new bastion of liberty."

### Characters ###
 CSA_earl_browder: "Earl Russell Browder"
 CSA_earl_browder_leader_desc: "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist at age 16. His allegiance to the Socialist Party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favoured an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the Socialist Party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."

 CSA_william_edward_foster: "William Edward Foster"
 CSA_william_edward_foster_leader_desc: "A radical labour organiser who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment to seeing the Socialist Party of America adopt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologues. His famous manifesto, \"Toward Syndicalist America\" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to build America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."

 CSA_jack_reed: "John Silas 'Jack' Reed"
 CSA_jack_reed_leader_desc: "As the United States crashed into flame and a Syndicalist revolution grew in the Steel Belt, at its forefront stood John 'Jack' Reed - a writer, a trade unionist, a journalist and a Senator, if not more. Born to a business family on the West Coast, he lived an unassuming upper-class life until studies in Harvard, where he, coming into contact with socialist clubs and literature, came to realise that there is a world beyond the dull halls of college, and that world suffered constant hardship. Despite being in poor health from birth, Reed chose a traveller's life, working as a common labourer to make a living and travel from nation to nation, and gaining fame as a war correspondent.\n\nWhat earned him more fame, however, was his involvement in the great revolutions of the period. The first he witnessed was the Mexican one as early as 1913, then the Russian one, in 1917, which he worked for devoutly and which consolidated his revolutionary socialist beliefs. It was during this time period that he wrote the 10 Days That Shook the World, his most famous work. In 1918, he returned to America, but was no longer welcome by America and its anti-sedition acts, so a year later, he fled again - this time to France, to a new, brewing revolution, and unlike the Russian one, actually successful. Fighting alongside the French Syndicalists dictated Reed a goal in life - to import this success to America, to have it be the next to come, and with America's unfathomable industrial might, bring forth a world revolution.\n\nA long time has passed since then, and Reed has achieved far - he has helped orchestrate the union of American socialists into one united front, served as a Senator, as a Presidential candidate, and has finally called the Steel Belt to revolution. However, his goal remains the same - to be the next great revolutionary, to be the same figure greater than life which the lowly war correspondent from twenty years ago would write about."

 CSA_elizabeth_gurley_flynn: "Elizabeth Gurley Flynn"
 CSA_elizabeth_gurley_flynn_leader_desc: "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organiser for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organised legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defense. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organise the longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."

 CSA_daniel_hoan: "Daniel Webster Hoan"
 CSA_daniel_hoan_leader_desc: "Daniel Webster Hoan is one of the enduring figures of the American left - born in Waukesha, Wisconsin on March 12, 1881, Hoan enrolled in the University of Wisconsin and swiftly laid out the foundation for the university's Socialist Club, back when it had a mere four members. Hoan was admitted to the state bar in 1908 and moved to Milwaukee, where the longtime Socialist Party member began working with Victor Berger, editor of The Milwaukee Leader, in advocating for radical reforms to the city: public ownership of utilities, urban development programs, free legal, medical, and educational services, and other policies widely unheard of in most of the country. Hoan decided to enter politics by running for city attorney in 1910, where he edged out a plurality against both Democratic and Republican opponents - in the same year, Emil Seidel was elected mayor of Milwaukee, the first socialist to leader to a major American city. In 1916, Hoan succeeded him as mayor, a position that he continued to hold all the way until the Second Civil War. As mayor, Hoan codified what is sometimes called 'constructive socialism', emphasising practical reforms over haughty revolutionary ideals - some more itinerant socialists derisively called the Milwaukee branch members 'sewer socialists' for their constant touting of their city's sewer system.\n\nHoan silenced most doubts to his commitment during the war, proving invaluable to organising the Milwaukee war effort. With the revolution won and the Socialist Party's factions diverging, Hoan was expected to remain loyal to the moderate party core - however, shocking some observers, the breakaway Workers' Party declared that they would nominate him as their candidate for President in the 1940 elections. More astute observers noted that Hoan had not always gotten along with other Socialists during his time with the party, and that he didn’t seem to share the remaining membership’s pacifist tendencies. Whatever the reason, Hoan provides considerable legitimacy to the young Workers' Party, and to many represents a new sense of practicality for a revolution looking to settle down."

 CSA_frank_johns: "Frank Tetes Johns"
 CSA_frank_johns_leader_desc: "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the Second American Civil War as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected President of a brand new America!"

 CSA_eleanor_roosevelt: "Anna Eleanor Roosevelt"
 CSA_eleanor_roosevelt_leader_desc: "At first glance, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt as the leader of a Syndicalist revolution seems to be a paradox. Born and raised as a socialite in the wealthy and influential Roosevelt family, she was not with the Combined Syndicates when the revolution began, remaining in New England and hoping until the last moment that a peace could be found. While supportive of the workers' struggle, her revolutionary credentials are lacking, and she hardly fits the image of the jumped-up union boss that many associate with our young nation's leadership. Her opponents insist that these appearances are not deceiving - diehard supporters of the revolution call her a Trojan horse for the bourgeoisie, while opponents of the new government decry her as a laughable attempt by the socialists to convince the American people that they aren't bloodthirsty tyrants.\n\nAnd yet, when one considers it, the logic becomes a bit more clear. The triumph of the Combined Syndicates created a problem for both the old American elite and the new revolutionary government: the former had been defeated and left ostracised in the new America, while the latter was faced with a population that was and is reluctant to trust them. In Roosevelt, the Workers' Party saw a solution to both - a reconciliatory figure that might unite the supporters of the revolution with feminists, African-Americans, and reformists and ease the reintegration of old elites into society. Whether this controversial plan will work remains to be seen, but what is certain is that with her ascent to the presidency, America will yet again never be the same."

 CSA_frank_zeidler: "Frank Paul Zeidler"
 CSA_frank_zeidler_leader_desc: "Frank Paul Zeidler, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 12, 1912, has spent much of his life in poor health - an unfortunate reality that prevented him from completing his studies. Perhaps because of this, Zeidler was drawn to socialism from a young age - growing up in the throes of the Great Depression, Zeidler read extensively from left-wing writers like Norman Thomas and Eugene V. Debs. When asked about his reasons for supporting socialism in 1933, Zeidler cited the tenets of international brotherhood, the struggle for peace, equal distribution of goods, cooperation, and democratic planning. He would become active in the Socialist Party of America's youth wing, the Young People's Socialist League, and shortly before the civil war became the head of the Milwaukee branch of the Red Falcons, another SPA organisation aimed at educating children. Frank was aided in his activist work by his brother, Carl Zeidler, who would go on to volunteer for the navy of the Combined Syndicates, only to die in the effort.\n\nDespite his perpetual sickly health and the untimely death of his brother, Zeidler did what he could to support the Syndicate war effort on the home front, and attended the constitutional convention on the behalf of Milwaukee mayor Daniel Hoan. In the post-war political scene, Zeidler was seen as relatively neutral figure (outside of his disdain for the Unity League), and was tapped by the Workers' Party to be the successor to President Flynn largely for this reason - after all, the WPA holds dearly to the idea of a symbolic executive, and the martyrdom of his brother generates much sympathy among veterans of the revolution. Only 36 years old on his election, President Zeidler comes in as a symbol of the unity between the senior professional revolutionaries and a generation of young socialists that have swiftly been maturing with the new America."

 CSA_elmer_allison: "Elmer Thompson Allison"
 CSA_elmer_allison_leader_desc: "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in the streets of Seattle. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he gladly pursued!"

 CSA_james_cannon: "James Patrick Cannon"
 CSA_james_cannon_leader_desc: "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well-versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the Socialist Party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian Revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists caused Cannon to adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organise foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisors, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon immediately began to build the momentum needed to run for President, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"

 CSA_henning_blomen: "Henning Albert Blomen"
 CSA_henning_blomen_leader_desc: "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second American Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organise the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."

 CSA_norman_thomas: "Norman Mattoon Thomas"
 CSA_norman_thomas_leader_desc: "Norman Thomas has seen the lows and the highs of social stature, and remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through from newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector. Prior to the civil war he had served as New York City's mayor and Jack Reed's vice-presidential candidate. Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription. After the war, he used his learned experience and close friendship to Jack Reed, preaching on behalf of the Federalists to lead the democratic socialists to victory in the Second Constitutional Convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."

 CSA_upton_sinclair: "Upton Beall Sinclair Jr."
 CSA_upton_sinclair_leader_desc: "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton Sinclair was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labour conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry; in response to this reaction, he declared \"I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach\". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the \"End Poverty In California\" campaign. E.P.I.C, as it came to be known, was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing an E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."

 CSA_john_llewellyn_lewis_leader_desc: "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labour movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the Steel Belt. Although he initially bickered with William Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."

 CSA_israel_amter_leader_desc: "Israel Amter was born on March 26, 1881 to Jewish parents, namely a father that was immigrated from the city of Riga, then held by the Russian Empire. Amter briefly joined the Socialist Party of America in 1901 before moving to Germany in 1903, becoming a member of the Social Democratic Party and studying music at the Leipzig Conservatory. Eventually, Amter found it necessary to return to the United States to escape the war, and after the move renewed his SPA membership and became active within the party's left wing. It is here that Amter had his first brush with the law - in April 1921, he and three others were arrested in a joint raid by New York bomb squad police and Department of Justice agents. Since then, Amter became particularly active in the SPA's more militant underground circles that aimed at preparing the working classes for the final conflict against capitalism - work that only grew in importance as the country veered closer and closer to civil war. Amter was eventually arrested yet again in 1930 alongside William Foster in connection to a riot that took place during the party's International Unemployment Day protest campaign, for which he was convicted and spent some time in prison.\n\nAlthough seemingly a strange choice for the Socialist Party's 1948 nominee for President, it could also be said that [CSA.GetNameDef]'s political scene has become equally strange - the moderating tendency that the Workers' Party has developed has led to the Socialists determining that the best avenue of attack is by rebranding their message as a renewal of the revolution, and that Amter's militant past makes him a perfect candidate for their realignment attempt. Time will tell whether President Amter will live up to these expectations."

 CSA_darlington_hoopes_leader_desc: "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers. During his time at boarding school, he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian socialist Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labour in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."

Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a docent position at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming civil war abroad.

 CSA_asa_philip_randolph_leader_desc: "Asa Philip Randolph was born April 12, 1889 in Crescent City, Florida to a minister father and a seamstress mother. As a child growing up in Jacksonville, Randolph learned the importance of character over skin colour from the former, and the importance of education and defending oneself from the latter - he would later vividly recall a night from his youth where his mother sat in the front room of his house with a loaded shotgun, while his father took a pistol and left to prevent a man from being lynched at the county jail. A gifted student, Randolph enrolled in the Cookman Institute - then the only high school in Florida for African Americans - before being forced by employment segregation to move to New York City to study at City College. After a short attempt at theatre, Randolph became increasingly familiar with socialism, determining that people could only be free if not subjected to economic deprivation - with this in mind, Randolph began his civil rights career by establishing an employment office in Harlem aimed at providing work training to southern migrants. Randolph, along with his partner Chandler Owens and the aid of the Socialist Party of America, founded 'The Messenger', a radical magazine calling for African Americans to organise and fight for an integrated society. Randolph also developed strong union credentials, most famously organising the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to address the deplorable working conditions of the primarily African American industry.\n\nAlthough Randolph was somewhat hesitant to embrace the cause of revolution by force, he, like many others, was left with little choice as civil war broke out regardless. During and after the war, Randolph continued to concern himself with the needs of African Americans as he always had, shifting his focus to union discrimination - arguing that the destruction of the colour barrier is a necessary component of a socialist America. For his efforts, he was picked as the Socialist Party's nominee for president - and with his election, President Randolph has become the first African American to lead America, providing hope to many that the days of racial inequality might, at long last, be drawing to a close."

He did not see combat until the end of the war, when he was sent to deal with insurgents in the Philippines and was once again put in charge of soldiers of a different race. Parsons began to get gradually involved in military office politics, relying on his old superior Robert Lee Bullard from the Alabama 3rd to provide him with support for his unorthodox proposals. Parsons was an adamant champion of racial integration. His radical proposal for an immediate and total racial integration of the army was dismissed as ludicrous and he was advised to focus on less controversial affairs.\n\nHe took up work commanding various National Guards before being sent to Fort Meade, Maryland, where he established a tank school and began to promote new theories about armoured warfare that he had learned from studying the Weltkrieg and the military of the Union of Britain. His subsequent recommendation to the U.S Army was to establish dedicated tank divisions who could punch through enemy defences at lightning speed, going far and beyond any scale of armoured warfare that had been seen before. Tank units were normally only the size of a regiment, but Parsons called for the establishment of six entire divisions as the optimal fighting force. This was quietly ignored, much like his integration proposals. By the time of the American Civil War, Parsons knew well and truly which side he was on. Having been appointed in 1936 to lead the 6th Infantry Division in Illinois, which was then in reserve, Parsons presented his credentials to Provisional Government in Chicago, which immediately made great use of his vigorous political commitment and his revolutionary military doctrines."

Excelling in academics and extracurriculars such as wrestling and football, he joined the United States Marine Corps for financial reasons. In the Marine Corps, Shoup was recognised for his athletics, marksmanship, and leadership skills - impressing his commanders and subordinates for his ability to keep morale with his sense of humour. From 1927 to 1934, Shoup served in China, protecting American interests in the war-torn country, a mission he was personally opposed to seeing his actions as simply an imperialist exploitation of the Chinese people. As the nation began to spiral into chaos, Shoup's anti-imperialist stance and personal beliefs made him a staunch supporter and ally of fellow Marine Corps General Smedly Butler. When the time came for revolution, Shoup committed himself to the syndicalist cause and Butler, bringing the experience and leadership the Second Continental Army desperately needed."

Allen was born Herman Greenberg until his father officially changed his name as the Weltkrieg raged on to avoid connections to Germany and to pick a real \"American\" last name. Lying about his age, Allen joined Pershing's expedition to seek out Pancho Villa after which he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and took up reporting. It was in Wisconsin, one of the key hotbeds of American socialism that Allen became dedicated to Reed's cause. As racial tensions seeped into American society with the ongoing economic crisis, Allen used his investigative journaling skills to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. A foreign correspondent with the Christian Science Monitor, Allen's dissatisfaction with the Hoover administration compelled him to write an anonymous expose \"Washington Merry Go-Round.\" Disillusioned with MacArthur's military clique in Washington and Hoover's incompetence brought Allen more and more committed to the vision of America held by the SPA. A proponent of speed and armour due to his experiences in the Pershing Expedition, Allen has pledged himself to the worker's cause in the wake of the civil war."

He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923, and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanisation officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armoured warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist Party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard. After having been recognised by Butler, he was promoted to the rank of General, and is widely considered the main mechanised warfare expert in the Syndicates' army.§!\n\n§YNotes: He hasn't pledged his allegiance to any of the CSA political factions, and he's rumoured to only be in our army in order to fight the anti-semitic officers of the AUS who once hindered his career."

 CSA_robert_hale_merriman_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 17th, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's PhD program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Reed's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command, and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.§!\n\n§YNotes: It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress.

His first posting as a temporary first lieutenant in the segregated all-black 8th US Volunteer Infantry, but he was unable to see combat during the war. Still, he reenlisted as a private for the 9th Cavalry Regiment, joining the so-called \"Buffalo Soldiers\". Tutored by Charles Young, the only black US military officer at the time, Davis was able to attend West Point and become a second lieutenant in the Cavalry. He fought in the Philippine-American war in 1901, before returning home to help teach Military Science and Tactics at the traditionally black Wilberforce College in Ohio - a position he would assume multiple times in his career. He also had a stint in Liberia and Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He was promoted to Colonel in the regular army in 1930, matching a feat his mentor Charles Young accomplished about a decade prior. \n\nThe deteriorating political situation in America and harassment by AFP members in Alabama saw Davis quietly ask to return north to Wilberforce to resume his position as a professor there for a third time. Although not known to be a socialist, Davis was sympathetic to the egalitarian message of the SPA and was one of the few high ranking American Army officers not openly hostile to Jack Reed. Disillusioned by the election of 1936 and the outbreak of civil war, when Ohio’s governor declared its loyalty to the Chicago government Davis remained at his post as a national guard commander. Recognising his long experience and his influence among his former students, Davis quickly appeared on the short-list before Jack Reed for potential generals of the new Continental Red Army."
