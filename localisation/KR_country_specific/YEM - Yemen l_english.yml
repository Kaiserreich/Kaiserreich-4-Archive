### Intro Screen ###

 YEM_country_intro_header: "The Imamate of Yemen"
 YEM_country_intro_content: "Following Ottoman Victories in Southern Arabia and victory in the Weltkrieg, along with collapse of the British Empire in 1920, Yemen experienced a large growth in the size of its borders. However with the continued Ottoman governance of the Sunni populations and their extremely lax ruling of the areas under their control, the newly enlarged state found itself riddled with unrest. With the Zaydi Shia Imam at the head of state, he seeks to dominate the Yemeni lands, earn his freedom from the Ottomans, and defend what his country had rightfully earned."
 yemen.1.a: "Greater Yemen must be defended!"

### Events ###
 yemen.2.t: "Black Monday Ripples Hit Yemen!"
 yemen.2.d: "After the crash of the German stock markets, the ripples have already washed over both the economically weak Ottomans and the economically young Egypt. What small economy we have in Yemen has been put into decline by the global crisis."
 yemen.2.a: "We must act soon!"

 yemen.3.t: "Rebellious Sentiment in Yemen"
 yemen.3.d: "After the end of the Weltkrieg, and past that, the unrest in Yemen has only been increasing. The poor administration by the Ottomans and the discontent from the authoritarian rule of the Imamate has led to rise of numerous intellectual groups, and over time they have sought refuge in areas out of our control and in more weak Ottoman governed regions. We must now decide how to handle these revolutionaries hiding in our lands."
 yemen.3.a: "They shall be rooted out!"

 yemen.4.t: "Rebellious Sentiment in Asir"
 yemen.4.d: "We have sent loyal troops under the guidance of a few local ministers and one of the Imam's sons into the Province of Asir to hunt for rebels, and find a way to deal with the unrest."
 yemen.4.a: "They shall be brought to the wall!"
 yemen.4.b: "Yemen must stand united!"

 yemen.5.t: "Rebellious Sentiment in Aden"
 yemen.5.d: "We have sent loyal Troops under the guidance of a few local ministers and one of the Imam's Sons into the Province of Aden to hunt for rebels, and find a way to deal with the unrest."
 yemen.5.a: "They shall be brought to the wall!"
 yemen.5.b: "Yemen must stand united!"

 yemen.6.t: "End of Anarchy"
 yemen.6.d: "Now that we have sent probing forces across our countryside and there is an air of control in the area, all we can hope for is that our actions were enough to preserve internal stability in Yemen."
 yemen.6.a: "It is time to heal."

 yemen.8.t: "A Light Hand"
 yemen.8.d: "Our military ventures into Ottoman-held land led us to realise that the true enemy are the occupying Turks, they are at fault for this unrest, and we shall rally the people against them."
 yemen.8.a: "Down with the Ottomans!"

 yemen.9.t: "Focused Crackdown"
 yemen.9.d: "After the first few crackdowns on dissent, we have taken a more lax tone in our anti-partisan efforts. This will ensure the people of Yemen do not hate us, and that the wounds we have opened can heal sooner."
 yemen.9.a: "We've shown our hand."

 yemen.10.t: "A Firm Grip"
 yemen.10.d: "We have searched high and low for as many people bearing unsavoury ideas as we could, some have fled into deeper hiding, however they are politically broken. Blood stains the streets of towns across Yemen."
 yemen.10.a: "There will be no questioning my rule!"

 yemen.14.t: "The Rebellion is Crushed"
 yemen.14.d: "With the rebellion rooted out in its infancy it did not have enough steam to resist the forces of the Imamate, the kingdom is preserved!"
 yemen.14.a: "We have assured peace and stability."

 yemen.16.t: "On the Verge of Collapse"
 yemen.16.d: "With our mercy towards dissidents within our country while we were under Ottoman rule, the rebels have begun to rise up against our regime! Wishing to end the Imamate and declare the Republic of Yemen, this group could be a risk to our sovereignty. We must crush these upstarts at once!"
 yemen.16.a: "For the republic!"
 yemen.16.b: "They must be stopped!"

 yemen.17.t: "Disorder in the Kingdom"
 yemen.17.d: "With our mercy towards dissidents within our country while we were under Ottoman rule, the rebels have begun to rise up against our regime! Wishing to end the Imamate and declare the Republic of Yemen, this group could be a risk of our sovereignty. We must crush these upstarts at once!"
 yemen.17.a: "The republic shall prevail!"
 yemen.17.b: "We will break them!"

 yemen.18.t: "The Rebellion is Crushed"
 yemen.18.d: "With the hard fought victory against the rebels, they lost all power to resist the forces of the Imamate, the kingdom has been preserved!"
 yemen.18.a: "We have assured peace and stability."

 yemen.19.t: "The Rebellion is Crushed"
 yemen.19.d: "With the rebellion rooted out partially in its infancy, it was softened up for the forces of the Imamate, the kingdom has been preserved!"
 yemen.19.a: "We have assured peace and stability."

 yemen.20.t: "The First Election of the New Republic"
 yemen.20.d: "With the overthrow of the corrupt Imamate, the first ever Yemeni election has been held. The two main factions, which have been the ones to overthrow the Imamate, are the Hait al-Nadial and the Shabab Al-Amr. Both parties have put towards great work towards their campaign, and the people all greatly await the results of the election."
 yemen.20.a: "The Hait al-Nidal shall guide us."
 yemen.20.b: "The Shabab Al-Amr will give us the change we need!"

 yemen.22.t: "Yemen Attains Independence"
 yemen.22.d: "The rebellious vassal state of Yemen in the south of us declared independence from us over 2 months ago. With very limited advances into their territory and fierce resistance, our advisors suggested letting them go, with the majority of the government and the Sultan all agreeing the resources and men lost are not worth it when we have the greater threats of Egypt, Arabia, and [PER.GetNameDef] to worry about."
 yemen.22.a: "We'll come back, stronger than before."

 yemen.23.t: "Our Independence Secured"
 yemen.23.d: "With our revolt against the Ottomans four months ago, the Turks obtained very minimal land gains against our newly found kingdom, and their government has officially decided to end the war. However with a unified threat gone, the republicans within Yemen have begun to move again. While independence has been obtained, the road ahead will still be a troubled one."
 yemen.23.a: "We will persevere."

 yemen.24.t: "Our Presence in Yemen"
 yemen.24.d: "While Yemen revolted against our rule over four months ago, we have managed to push past their prepared defences and take over the rest of Hejaz. With the Yemeni Imam and people realising their defeat, they have agreed to surrender on the terms that the Imam gets to remain on the Yemeni throne."
 yemen.24.a: "Another threat disposed of."

 yemen.25.t: "Defeat Against the Ottomans"
 yemen.25.d: "While the kingdom was proclaimed not longer than four months ago, the eternal Ottoman threat has managed to push deep within our lines. With the loss of Azir and the Ottomans encroaching upon our capital, our Imam officially decided to surrender to the Ottomans. The Imam due to this decision has been allowed to stay on the Yemeni throne, but we will most likely have a closer watch on our nation from now on."
 yemen.25.a: "One day, we'll all be free."

 yemen.26.t: "Conquest of Arabia"
 yemen.26.d: "While most assumed our war against Arabia would be a largely fruitless effort, we have not only managed to prevail, but push even further. With the fall of the Arabian capital, we have managed to unify Arabia under our banner. While the process of integration will be a long and drawn-out process, we can now declare ourselves Arabia."
 yemen.26.a: "Truly a Greater Yemen."

 yemen.29.t: "Dhofar Taken"
 yemen.29.d: "With our invasion of Oman over the territory of Dhofar a success, we can leave them to their own wits. Of course, there are some within the government which think we should continue the war in order to strengthen our state further, but a drawn out war in Oman is less than desirable when other threats still lie about."
 yemen.29.a: "We'll be taking Dhofar."
 yemen.29.b: "We'll be taking Oman!"

 yemen.30.t: "Dhofar Integrated"
 yemen.30.d: "With our takeover of Dhofar from [OMA.GetName] not long ago, we have begun to successfully integrate the territory into our country. While the territory is sparsely populated and arid, it is not any less useful to our kingdom than any other part of the Greater Yemeni state. With this, all of Yemen's claims lie within our hands, and we will try to keep them safe."
 yemen.30.a: "Our dream is complete."

 yemen.32.t: "Imam Hanged"
 yemen.32.d: "The former dictator and Imam of Yemen, Yahya al Hamid has been put to death in a public trial today in the name of the Republic. With the hanging comes a destruction of influence from monarchist restorationists, as they are left with Ahmad ibn Yahya to the throne, who is a less noticeable and inspirational figure than his father. Hopefully this will ensure the Republic remains strong in the face of threats into the future."
 yemen.32.a: "He got what he deserved."

 yemen.33.t: "Putting the Sauds to Death"
 yemen.33.d: "With us managing to calm the situation within Arabia significantly, we can begin to make moves against political opponents. The most obvious was the Saud Dynasty, which ruled over Arabia previously and attempted to put an end to our nation. This morning in a public trial, the entirety of the Saud Dynasty that we captured in the war, including Abdulaziz al Saud, have been put to death."
 yemen.33.a: "An end to an eternal enemy."

 yemen.34.t: "Rashids Invited to Arabia"
 yemen.34.d: "With the death of the Saud Dynasty, and Arabia now calmer than ever before, the conditions are right for our cousin dynasty, the Rashids of Jabal Shammar, to partake in the administration of our new Arabia. The Rashids are extremely grateful for this opportunity as they thought their chances of ever ruling Arabia were shattered after their defeat against Nejd, but, as the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is a friend."
 yemen.34.a: "Welcome Home, Dear Friends."

 yemen.35.t: "The Rebel Remnants"
 yemen.35.d: "With us managing to withstand the rebel scum earlier, our focus has largely been ignoring the remnants of the rebels and more of consolidating the regime after the civil war, the consolidation of the regime means we can finally finish them off. Yemeni Gendarmes have been sent all throughout Yemen to hunt down the remnants of this Republican rabble, with it being mostly successful. The reappearance of Republican movements in Yemen won't be happening anytime soon."
 yemen.35.a: "Traitors of the state will always be dealt with."

 yemen.36.t: "Continued Flow of Refugees"
 yemen.36.d: "As the Ottoman Empire continues to crack down in Hejaz and skirmishes between the Saudis and the Rashids drag on, more and more people flock to our borders to seek refuge. This includes those who align with the Republican side of Yemeni politics."
 yemen.36.a: "Hopefully they don't cause trouble..."

 yemen.37.t: "Black Monday Ripples"
 yemen.37.d: "Black Monday, while not hitting us as hard as other nations, has indirectly resulted in an increased amount of anti-monarchist thought within the country. Republicans, while typically concentrated in the north and south of our country, have begun to popup in our capital and other places unseen before. This could set a worrying trend if not handled carefully..."
 yemen.37.a: "They'll be crushed where they stand."

 yemen.38.t: "Yemen Requests an Old Ship"
 yemen.38.d: "Yemen, a nation in Southern Arabia has been attempting to build a navy for months now, with success occurring on rare occasions. In order to help kickstart the project further, Yemen has asked to purchase the 'SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse', which was built at the turn of the century. Considering the decent price Yemen is offering for a ship this old, there is little reason to refuse their request."
 yemen.38.a: "We'll accept the purchase."
 yemen.38.b: "We'd rather have the scrap."

 yemen.39.t: "Germany Provides a Ship"
 yemen.39.d: "Germany has accepted our purchase of a ship! They have given us the old ship 'SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse', which is hereby being renamed to the 'Yahya San'ā Aden Arwa' while under our control. This ship will be the starting point of a great Yemeni navy into the future!"
 yemen.39.a: "Yemen rules the waves!"

 yemen.40.t: "Germany Refuses the Purchase"
 yemen.40.d: "Despite our generous offer for such an old ship, Germany has decided to turn down our offer to purchase an old German cruiser. While this doesn't mean the end of a chance for a Yemeni navy in the future, it has served to demoralise Yemeni people who dreamed of sailing the seas in the future."
 yemen.40.a: "A sad day indeed."

 yemen.41.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 yemen.41.d: "With our liberation over 4 years ago, it is now time for another general election. The parties remain the same as last year, with the Hait al-Nadial and Shabab al-Amr going head to head over the victor. The results are opened, and the winner is..."
 yemen.41.a: "The Hait al-Nadial!"
 yemen.41.b: "The Shabab al-Amr!"

 yemen.42.t: "Peace with the Sauds?"
 yemen.42.d: "Our war with Saudi Arabia has not been going into our favour, with Asir being lost and the Saudis encroaching on our capital. With our nation's existence in danger, we might need to give up Asir just for the sake of our survival."
 yemen.42.a: "Offer them Najran and Asir."
 yemen.42.b: "We'll beat them back!"

 yemen.43.t: "Yemen Offers Asir and Najran"
 yemen.43.d: "With the war against Yemen going to our advantage, they have offered us the Najran Desert and Asir in exchange for their survival. While we could continue pushing onward, there are bigger threats like [PER.GetNameDef] to the north breathing down our shoulders."
 yemen.43.a: "What a fine deal!"
 yemen.43.b: "Yemen is Arabian, no matter what."

 yemen.44.t: "The Sauds Accept"
 yemen.44.d: "The Saudis have accepted our deal for peace in exchange for Najran and Asir. While our survival is secured, this has largely put an end to the Greater Yemen idea and has halted any ideas of expansionism."
 yemen.44.a: "A fate worse than death..."

 yemen.45.t: "The Sauds Continue the War!"
 yemen.45.d: "The Sauds has outright denied any attempts at peace between our two nations, claiming that 'Yemen is rightfully Arabian'. This war will now continue for who knows how long, with no end in sight!"
 yemen.45.a: "We'll resist to the last man!"

 yemen.46.t: "Imam Yahya Declares His Independence"
 yemen.46.d: "Official leader of Central Yemen since his successful revolt against our rule in the 1910s, Imam Yahya has always been an ambitious man who set his sights on Southern Yemen and Asir as the natural routes of expansion for his Yemeni fief. Although he stayed loyal to the Porte during the Weltkrieg, tempted by possible enrichment if they were victorious, it seems he now believes the wind has turned against them and he has refused to answer the call to arms sent out by our Sultan-Caliph. With the Arab coalition gaining strength, the loss of Aden is yet another blow to the Sublime Porte."
 yemen.46.a: "Grant Yemen their independence"
 yemen.46.b: "He shall be punished for his actions!"

 YEM_Every_Yemen_a_Kingdom_desc: "With our preparations complete, we can declare ourselves an independent kingdom when the Ottomans are in their most dire situation."

 YEM_Modern_Construction: "Modern Constructions"
 YEM_Modern_Construction_desc: "The methods of our current construction are long outdated, and don't work well for the modern setting. Reforming our construction policies could be a good start in building Yemen for the future."
 YEM_Update_Aden_Rail: "New Aden Rail Lines"
 YEM_Update_Aden_Rail_desc: "The Aden Railway was built by the British in 1916 in order to help the transportation of supplies within the region. While the railway still has its uses, it is in desperate need of an update to be used effectively."
 YEM_Western_Yemen_Infra: "Red Sea Railways"
 YEM_Western_Yemen_Infra_desc: "The Red Sea has been a hub for Yemeni profit ever since the beginning of the millennium, generating great profit. Expanding railways should help increase the income we get from the region."
 YEM_Hinterlands_Settling: "Populate the Hinterlands"
 YEM_Hinterlands_Settling_desc: "Despite our best efforts, the Hinterlands in the south of Yemen are still as empty and barren as ever. Making the region easier to commute to should help the region's population grow over time."
 YEM_Aden_Trade: "Expand Aden's Trade Influence"
 YEM_Aden_Trade_desc: "With the colonisation of the Hinterlands in the south, Aden will soon become a place for commercial profit for Yemen."
 YEM_Aden_Goods: "Aden Goods Production"
 YEM_Aden_Goods_desc: "The goods we got through the Aden trade show new things not known before revealed by the foreign traders. Using this new-found knowledge and materials, we can expand Aden's industry further."
 YEM_New_Oasis_Hunt: "Study Foreign Plans"
 YEM_New_Oasis_Hunt_desc: "While we could try and make our own strategy for the economic growth, surely powers who have already gone through the same problems as us before have plans that will work towards modernising the country."
 YEM_Start_Recovery: "End the Economic Downturn"
 YEM_Start_Recovery_desc: "Although Black Monday affected us much less than other countries due to our disconnection from Germany, some of its ripples have still managed to affect us. Solving these should help bring some light to our already poor economy."
 YEM_Arable_Land_Reforms: "Import Industrial Tools"
 YEM_Arable_Land_Reforms_desc: "Our country very much shows the way the old world was, with many of our methods of doing everyday things being outdated by centuries. This includes the instruments our workers use on a daily basis. Importing tools from beyond should help in making the lives of the workers easier."
 YEM_Oil_Prospects: "Prospect for Oil"
 YEM_Oil_Prospects_desc: "While we have managed to touch down upon light amounts of oil within Yemen, there has yet to be enough for us to actually generate profit. Perhaps searching for some more could bring unexpected results."
 YEM_Big_Farma: "Support Farming Industry"
 YEM_Big_Farma_desc: "The farming industry in Yemen is where a lot of the everyday population lies, especially in more sparsely populated areas. We need to ensure the industry remains up to date with the current standards set by the modern world."
 YEM_Modern_Economy: "Modern Economy"
 YEM_Modern_Economy_desc: "Through various reforms, plight, and crises, Yemen has been able to learn and build up from all these troublesome experiences. Yemen now stands proud before other European countries, with its newly reforged economy."

 YEM_Officers_Come_Home: "Return of the 40 Officers"
 YEM_Officers_Come_Home_desc: "The 40 Officers are a group sent by our government to the Ottoman Empire in order to learn their way of training. Perhaps it is about time we tell them to return?"
 YEM_Modern_Naval_Transports: "Metal Convoys"
 YEM_Modern_Naval_Transports_desc: "Trade fleets have been key to economic success for centuries, and ours needs the best ships we can muster to have any influence in this trade rich sea."
 YEM_Merchant_Marine: "Establish A Merchant Marine"
 YEM_Merchant_Marine_desc: "Merchant Marines are used to defend merchant ships and trade and are used by many countries now. Establishing a Yemeni Merchant Marine should hopefully increase the profit from our bountiful trade."
 YEM_Trade_Protection: "Protect the New Merchant Fleet"
 YEM_Trade_Protection_desc: "With the Yemeni Merchant Marine established, we need to ensure they can get whatever they need to go without any interruption."
 YEM_Aden_Ports: "Build Up the Port of Aden"
 YEM_Aden_Ports_desc: "Aden is one of our most profitable ports and is where the majority of our income comes from. With the newly established Merchant Marine, expanding the port can maximise our trading profit."
 YEM_Ship_Commission: "Commission a Flagship"
 YEM_Ship_Commission_desc: "Flagships are used as a point of national pride for countries, as it is their biggest and best ship that they send into battles. Taking a foreign design and making it our own can help boost our nationalism."
 YEM_This_Is_My_Boomstick: "New Rifle Designs"
 YEM_This_Is_My_Boomstick_desc: "The current design of our rifle is long outdated and ineffective for modern day combat, so creating a new one for our army is of the utmost importance."
 YEM_Bigger_Boom: "Import Artillery"

 YEM_Fortify_To_Protecc: "Fortify Asir"
 YEM_Fortify_To_Protecc_desc: "Asir is where the majority of fighting will be going on, with our Ottoman overlords and the Nejd Emirate to the north, so protecting it along with the rest of the country is our highest priority."
 YEM_Mountain_Warriors: "Professional Mountaineers"
 YEM_Mountain_Warriors_desc: "Yemen in various areas has a very mountainous landscape that can end up being hard to traverse, however we can turn this into an advantage. Teaching specific regiments of men how to effectively fight in these mountains can give us advantage against our inexperienced enemies."
 YEM_Arabian_Knights: "Arab Horsemen"
 YEM_Arabian_Knights_desc: "Cavalry is seen as a highly outdated form of fighting within the 'modern world', but it still has a place within the Middle East due to the vast deserts covering it. Ensuring we can master this art is crucial for Middle Eastern warfare."
 YEM_Better_Shovels: "Military Support"
 YEM_Better_Shovels_desc: "Raising a truly modern military requires men in the backlines to back it up, also known as support units. Things like hospitals and engineers can help specialise our forces for specific needs and circumstances."
 YEM_Trench_War: "Study Trench Warfare"
 YEM_Trench_War_desc: "Trench warfare was mainly used in the Weltkrieg and has been proven to work. Since the modern doctrine has not been tested on the scale of the Weltkrieg yet, trench warfare is the safer bet to use until a later date."
 YEM_Scouts: "Military Engineering"
 YEM_Scouts_desc: "Guns, especially our slightly outdated design, have a tendency to fail at the most inconvenient and unexpected times, which can end up deciding the fate of a battle. Having trusted mechanics and engineers on the ready can help reverse this effect."
 YEM_Hold_The_Line: "Planning In Advance"
 YEM_Hold_The_Line_desc: "We shall make war plans against nations before they have begun doing same against us, and open up a whole wing for our military experts and members of government to make said plans and debate them."

 YEM_All_Roads_To_Sanaa: "The Heart of Yemen"

 YEM_Regional_Rulers_desc: "With the victory of the Liberal party, we can end the autocracy of San'ā, and bring the power of Yemen back to the whole nation. Removing more power from the central government and moving it to regional government can help us ensure this."

 YEM_yahya_al_hamid: "Yahya al Hamid"
 YEM_yahya_al_hamid_leader_desc: "From 1934 onwards, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, he now seeks to establish control over the Yemeni hinterland, a modern standing army, and clear rules for succession of hereditary governorships, all while keeping a close eye on the tumultuous political environment in San'ā itself. With al-Hamid at the helm, Yemen moves into the modern age while maintaining its semi-feudal state of affairs."

 YEM_abdul_rahman_al_eryani: "Abdul Rahman al-Eryani"

 YEM_ahmad_muhammad_numan: "Ahmad Muhammad Numan"
 YEM_ahmad_muhammad_numan_leader_desc: "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a Sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in Muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumours that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group, Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a programme that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease coming change into a badly divided country."

 YEM_ali_nassar_al_qadari: "Ali Nassar al-Qadari"
 YEM_ali_nassar_al_qadari_leader_desc: "The son of Sheikh Nasser ibn Mas'ad, Ali Nasser had a common background. As a Sunni, he took up rebellion against Imam Yahya in 1928, when Imam had imposed his rule over Aden. Al Nasser then fled the Imam's draft, and joined the rebels. The rebellion saw Ali Nasser tap into his artistic side, waxing poetically about his mission to kill the Imam. To this end, he joined the underground Hait al-Nadial organisation, and through his expressive voice became their leader."
