### Ideas ###
 KDR_Religious_Fevour: "Religious Fervour"
 KDR_Religious_Fevour_desc: "Allahu Akbar! The heretic government in Kostantiniyye has proven that it cares little for the Islamic unity promoted by the office of the Caliph. It is now up to us, religious orders, tribesmen and devout followers of the Kurdish Sheikhs to take up arms and oust the traitors from their cushy seats in the capital."

 KDR_Irregular_Army: "Hamidiye Army"
 KDR_Irregular_Army_desc: "Based around the disbanded 'Hamidiye' regiments of the late Abdulhamid II, the Kurdish army suffers from an almost complete lack of discipline and unity as it relies far too much on a decentralised force led by Sheikhs and Aghas. Equipped with mostly pre-weltkrieg weapons, they furthermore suffer a serious material disadvantage compared to the much better equipped Turks."

 KDR_islamic_fervour: "Islamic Fervour"
 KDR_islamic_fervour_desc: "The unwavering faith in Islam is the heart of our revolt, unites our people and holds our otherwise so fragile country together. Furthermore, the belief in the will of Allah lends our brave soldiers and citizens the strength needed to endure the hardships of the war, and ensures that none of them would even think about surrendering to our Turkish foes."

 KDR_junta: "Reign of the Junta"
 KDR_junta_desc: "Ever since our declaration of independence and secession from the declining Turkish state, we have been led by a military junta, whose strong leadership will ensure the security and sovereignty of our state both now and in the future."

 KDR_junta_1: "Reign of the Junta"
 KDR_junta_1_desc: "Ever since our declaration of independence and secession from the declining Turkish state, we have been led by a military junta, whose strong leadership will ensure the security and sovereignty of our state both now and in the future."

 KDR_islamic_nation: "Islamic Traditions"
 KDR_islamic_nation_desc: "For centuries now, Islam has played a significant role in shaping Kurdish culture and society, and to this day Islamic traditions and customs are an important part of the day-to-day lives of many Kurds. Naturally, it is our duty to defend and uphold these traditions instead of abandoning what has made us who we are."

 KDR_islamic_nation_1: "A Nation of Islam"
 KDR_islamic_nation_1_desc: "Islam is the main pillar of our nation and plays an important role not just in politics, but also in the lives of our people. While other nations may have abandoned Islamic principles in favour of the more \"modern\" values of the West, we know better than them, and will stick to the faith that has led our people through the darkest times for centuries."

 KDR_agriculture: "Developing Agriculture"
 KDR_agriculture_desc: "The economic strength of Kurdistan lies not in its industry, but rather in its agriculture. Much of our rural population makes a living by herding sheep, cattle, and poultry or by growing different kinds of grain and vegetables. Though some may call us backwards because of this, they just fail to see the benefits this self-sufficiency brings."

 KDR_final_stand_idea: "Kurdistan's Final Chance"
 KDR_final_stand_idea_desc: "After hundreds of years of Turkish occupation and failed revolts, we have finally been given a taste of freedom, and true independence seems reachable for the first time in centuries. We shall seize this opportunity, defend our lands and fight to the death and beyond, for if we fail now, Kurdistan will have missed its last chance."

 KDR_build_railway_desc: "Unfortunately, there are hardly any railways in Anatolian Kurdistan, due to the peculiarities of the terrain: the high plateau and the mountain peaks.

 KDR_reinstate_the_caliph: "Reinstate the Caliph"
 KDR_reinstate_the_caliph_desc: "Turkey, our former enemy, has finally decided to fall into full secularism and has abolished the title and position of one of the most important people for Islam, the Caliph. We should invite him to come to us and turn the country into the centre of the Islamic world, as there are no more true defenders of the faith left in the world."
 KDR_call_to_bandit: "Call Upon the Bandits"
 KDR_call_to_bandit_desc: "After the Desert War and the start of the extreme changes in the [TUR.GetName], many inhabitants of these areas felt the unpleasant consequences.

 KDR_sabotage_turkish_railways: "Sabotage Turkish Railways"
 KDR_sabotage_turkish_railways_desc: "The Transanatolian Railway is still under construction, but is already a strategically important route for transporting [TUR.GetAdjective] soldiers.

 KDR_british_help: "Request British Support"
 KDR_british_help_desc: "During the Great War, the Western powers were favourable to the creation of an independent Kurdistan, and the idea was discussed during the Sykes-Picot Agreement debate. But the hope for an independent Kurdish state fell with the Weltkrieg. But perhaps now it makes sense for the Entente to have a potential ally in the Middle East?"

### Events ###
 anatolian_kurdistan.1.t: "The Turkish Defeat"
 anatolian_kurdistan.1.d: "Finally, the dream has become reality and the Turks have been driven out of our lands, unable to shatter the will of our courageous soldiers! After uprising upon uprising being crushed by the Ottoman forces over the course of the last centuries, Kurdish independence was believed to be an unreachable goal. However, we have shown those who doubted us and our people otherwise. Never again shall we be subject to any foreign power! The Kurdish people shall only be ruled by their fellow countrymen, and our nation shall prosper now that we have freed ourselves from the Turkish yoke! The golden age of Kurdistan begins now!"
 anatolian_kurdistan.1.a: "Freedom at last!"

 anatolian_kurdistan.2.t: "The Future of our Nation"
 anatolian_kurdistan.2.d: "With the Turkish beast being put in its place, the fragile alliance of tribal chiefs, religious leaders and military figures is slowly but surely beginning to fall apart, as there's no longer a common cause for them to rally behind. However, two factions seeking to stop our nation from falling into complete anarchy have arisen, and are now both competing over who should get to lead our new Kurdish state.\n\nThe first of these factions, the junta, consists mainly of important military figures, some of whom even having served under Ottoman banner in the past. Though still without a central and uncontested leadership, these men were the ones who instigated our revolt in the first place, and have been de facto leading Kurdistan ever since it declared its independence, earning them the trust of large parts of our population. The other faction is mainly made up of radical Islamists under the banner of Ali Rıza Fırat, the son of the old Sheikh Said, and claims that it is necessary to return to our Islamic traditions for our nation to prosper. As these clergymen are also quite respected by the public, it is only natural that many now see themselves torn between the two sides.\n\nOver the past few days, debates in [KDR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have grown ever more heated, causing a general fear that the situation might escalate into a full-blown civil war to spread. However, as the day comes to a close, it seems that both sides have finally come to an agreement. From now on, ..."
 anatolian_kurdistan.2.a: "The junta shall lead our way!"
 anatolian_kurdistan.2.b: "Islam shall guide us!"

 anatolian_kurdistan.3.t: "Head of the Junta"
 anatolian_kurdistan.3.d: "Ever since the outbreak of our rebellion against Turkish rule, our nation has been led by Mehmet Şerif Paşa. Until now, no one has bothered opposing his rule, as much of our population is either content with his leadership or remains apolitical, and because the other leading figures of our nation had bigger things to worry about during the war. But now that the Turks have been beaten back and the junta's rule has been cemented, some dissenting voices have grown louder. More concretely, it seems that Mustafa Yamulki, another famous Kurdish military leader, has grown rather ambitious and wants to assert his rule over the junta in order to form the Kurdish state in accordance with his own visions. With this goal in mind, he has now begun swaying important members of the junta, hoping to gain their support in his endeavour to evoke a change of course. But are these men willing to betray Şerif Paşa, or will they show loyalty towards him?"
 anatolian_kurdistan.3.a: "Şerif Paşa has served us well thus far!"
 anatolian_kurdistan.3.b: "It is time for a small change of course..."
