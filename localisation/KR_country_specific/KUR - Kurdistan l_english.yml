 kur.1.t: "A Fragile Rebellion"
 kur.1.d: "When the Sheikhs and Aghas planted their banners in the ground before the Diyarbakır Ulu Camii (Great Mosque of Diyarbakır), many doubted their capabilities to wage an effective war on the regime of the Kemalists. Nonetheless many also doubted that these forces would ever combine their arms in the first place.\n\nWith railroads encroaching on the Kurdish domain, with Faith losing the status it deserves by the day and with Turkish intellectuals attempting to force their vision on our Grand Caliphate, many have seen the Light. Letters of support are coming in from all across the Muslim world, and volunteers willing to fight for the Caliph are signing up in Diyarbakir. The cursed infidels of the capital will very soon be shown the error of their ways, and the streets will run red with the blood of those opposing us! So let us go, restore the honour of our Caliph and save all Islam from this catastrophe!"
 kur.1.a: "Allahu Akbar!"

 kur.2.t: "Sulaymaniyah declares its independence"
 kur.2.d: "Declared by the recently-returned Sheikh Mahmut Barzinji, the city of Sulaymaniyah and the surrounding territory has decided to break with the Ottoman Empire and use the ruling chaos in the Mashriq to carve out a state of their own. This decision comes a bit as a surprise for his former ally in [PER.GetName], who intended for him to destabilise the Porte but not declare a Kurdish state. Fearing support from their own Kurdish population for his cause, it remains currently unclear whether Iran will turn their guns on him before the situation could further deteriorate."
 kur.2.a: "Damn Barzinji!"
