 ENG_naval_devotion_desc: "Britain has always devoted itself to having the greatest navy in Europe, nigh the world. From the destruction of the Spanish Armada to the battle of Trafalgar and recently the near war winning naval starvation of the Teutonic hordes of central Europe, control of the sea has always been the priority of our nations armed forces. Yet, while we have cast off many reactionary traditions our love of the navy has remained, we must always be at the forefront of naval research and development. We must always Rule the Waves."

 ENG_IRA: "An Unlikely Alliance"
 ENG_IRA_desc: "While in principle all of our government supports an independent unified Ireland, it is clear that the Emerald Isle is not truly ready for the full liberation that socialism brings, and so we have decided to place it under the temporary joint occupation of RA and CIC until a suitable leader is found. Yet, despite destroying the chains that tied Ireland to capitalism, we have faced steep resistance from both the popular Irish Republican Army, primarily located in the Munster countryside, and the royalist Ulster Volunteer Force active throughout the North-east."
 ENG_IRA_only: "IRA Attacks"
 ENG_IRA_only_desc: "With our renewed occupation of Ireland; its national army; various partisans and other veterans have banded together to restore the old IRA that fought against us in the Anglo-Irish War. While not too powerful for now they are quickly becoming a dangerous threat and must be dealt with."
 ENG_synthetic_oil_lover: "Revolutionary Synthetic Oil"

### Focuses ###
 ENG_status_quo: "Embrace the Status Quo"
 ENG_status_quo_desc: "The syndicalist order has withstood an onslaught of political challenges, but has held firm. Britain shall keep its course, and continue to boldly and unapologetically champion the cause of the worker and the revolution above all else."
 ENG_united_britain: "United Britain"
 ENG_united_britain_desc: "Britain faces great adversity both within and without. While conflict with reactionary nations may prove unavoidable, surely our nation and its people should stand united. Enemies of the revolution must be confronted and eliminated by any means necessary."
 ENG_decentralized_command: "Decentralised Command"
 ENG_decentralized_command_desc: "While our armies are decentralised, they still rely on inefficient chains of command to make tactical decisions. Non-commissioned officers and even the humblest of militiamen must be instilled with the spirit of leadership and given the agency to direct their units as they see fit. No man should die waiting for an order to be issued."
 ENG_new_generals: "Promote Young Talent"
 ENG_new_generals_desc: "There exists an abundance of young, talented officers among our ranks, often overlooked due to superiors more interested in improving the conditions of their fellow pupils than the condition of their army. A new round of promotions, aimed at young officers with admirable performance in the military academies, will be conducted to give our military the shake-up it needs."

 ENG_the_common_land: "The Common Land"
 ENG_the_common_land_desc: "While Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, much of our nation remains rural and reliant on agriculture. To facilitate increased crop yields, all lands seized from noble estates during the revolution should be parcelled to rural syndicates. Britain's land shall now belong to her people alone!"

 ENG_cayley_plan: "The Hidden Fleet Plan"
 ENG_cayley_plan_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Their ultimate victory in the war has convinced influential groups of officers that to avoid our previous fate, Britain must rapidly expand its submarine fleet and restructure its doctrine with Germany as its model"
 ENG_anstice_plan: "The Aviation Fleet Plan"
 ENG_anstice_plan_desc: "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, believers of precisely such a thing assert the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, they propose that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded"
 ENG_dickens_plan: "The Grand Fleet Plan"
 ENG_dickens_plan_desc: "The Royal Navy was centred around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted effort to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
 ENG_merchant_marine: "Merchant Marine"
 ENG_merchant_marine_desc: "The British Merchant Service was on the bleeding edge of civilian shipping administration. During the Weltkrieg, tactics developed by the Service to counter U-Boat raids kept Britain from terrible starvation. If our republic is to have any chance of surviving future conflicts, we must develop a robust Merchant Marine to both regulate shipping and conscript civilian ships for military service when needed."
 ENG_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 ENG_expand_dockyards_desc: "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
 ENG_new_admirals: "Promote Fresh Leadership"
 ENG_new_admirals_desc: "For too long the Republican Navy has been too much of an old boy's club and this could seriously damage our naval effectiveness. To combat this we should ensure that some fresh new faces can take the reigns of leadership."
 ENG_submarines: "Submarine Effort"
 ENG_submarines_desc: "Per our efforts to shift the Republican Navy's focus, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models"
 ENG_destroyers: "Destroyer Effort"
 ENG_destroyers_desc: "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
 ENG_carrier_efforts: "Carrier Effort"
 ENG_carrier_efforts_desc: "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centrepiece of the renewed British Navy."
 ENG_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 ENG_naval_aviation_desc: "Traditional aircraft designs are unable to fulfil the unique requirements of naval aviation. We must develop new aircraft designed be operated from carriers and other situations where runway space is at a premium."
 ENG_battlecruisers: "Battleship Effort"
 ENG_battlecruisers_desc: "While lacking the armour of a Dreadnought, Battleships are agile and pack a versatile suite of heavy guns. An evolution of the Battlecruisers of WW1 who served effectively during the Weltkrieg, an expansion of our Battleship fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
 ENG_battleships: "Dreadnought Effort"
 ENG_battleships_desc: "Dreadnoughts are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
 ENG_republican_marines: "The Republican Marines"
 ENG_republican_marines_desc: "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
 ENG_revolutionary_admiralty: "Review the Republican Navy"
 ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc: "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
 ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves: "Britannia Rules the Waves"
 ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc: "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

 ENG_republican_air_force: "The Republican Air Force"
 ENG_republican_air_force_desc: "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
 ENG_new_pilot_training: "New Pilot Training"
 ENG_new_pilot_training_desc: "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
 ENG_flying_women: "Women's Flying Corps"
 ENG_flying_women_desc: "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
 ENG_aviation_unions: "Aviation Unions"
 ENG_aviation_unions_desc: "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
 ENG_aviation_fuel_administration: "Aviation Fuel Administration"
 ENG_aviation_fuel_administration_desc: "Without fuel, it does not matter how skilled our pilots are. It is likely that when war comes our fuel imports will be cut-off so we must work towards domestics sources of fuel; for the safety of the revolution we mustn't be depended on capitalist suppliers of oil. They can't be trusted."
 ENG_air_observer_corps: "Air Observer Corps"
 ENG_air_observer_corps_desc: "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to forewarn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
 ENG_expand_air_unions: "Expand Air Unions"
 ENG_expand_air_unions_desc: "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the air force now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

 ENG_international: "Britain Within the International"
 ENG_international_desc: "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches. With the turbulent 1936 special session of the TUC at an end, Britain's place in the world, and especially its relationship with its socialist comrades of the Third Internationale, must be reassessed."
 ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation: "Norwegian Comrades"
 ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation_desc: "A more equitable Norway has arisen, and we will stand arm in arm with our socialist brethren there. The Norwegian and British people have much to offer each other, and as a gesture of our goodwill, we shall offer Norway generous economic assistance in exchange simply for future cooperation."
 ENG_anglo_irish_friendship: "Irish Comrades"
 ENG_anglo_irish_friendship_desc: "With the light of socialism at last shining upon the Emerald Isle, the time for reconciliation between our historically closely linked peoples has come. Not only should we send diplomats and politicians to Dublin, but also representatives of the most successful British syndicates to help Ireland along the path of progress."
 ENG_class_warfare: "Class Warfare"
 ENG_class_warfare_desc: "War is upon us, and to preserve our great nation and secure our liberty, all working men must now unite for victory. We should promote the spirit of unity, self-sacrifice, and most of all, renewed class consciousness, to augment our war effort."
 ENG_bletchley_park: "Bletchley Park"
 ENG_bletchley_park_desc: "In the north of Buckinghamshire, a crack team of military intelligence researchers has emerged. Despite minimal funding, the Bletchley Park Electrician's Union, in coordination with our foreign intelligence service, has produced singular results. We should expand Bletchley Park's facilities and provide them with substantial state funding."
 ENG_support_comrades: "Support Foreign Comrades"
 ENG_support_comrades_desc: "If socialism is to survive, all socialist nations must thrive. It is our duty as socialists to assist the formerly downtrodden peoples around the globe who now valiantly rise up against their oppressors."
 ENG_american_comrades: "American Comrades"
 ENG_american_comrades_desc: "From America's manufacturing belt has come forth a redoubt of socialism. This new bastion of liberation, however, could easily be destroyed by the reactionaries it defies. We must assist the courageous workers of America any way that we can."
 ENG_mexican_comrades: "Mexican Comrades"
 ENG_mexican_comrades_desc: "The people of Mexico were among the first to cast off the chains of capitalist exploitation. Mexico remains, however, quite underdeveloped. We possess the means to help the Mexicans better their lot, and such assistance would surely foster closer ties between our nations."
 ENG_further_cooperation: "Further Cooperation"
 ENG_further_cooperation_desc: "We must do even more assist our North American allies. The relationship we are building there will surely be the start of something far greater."
 ENG_mission_to_australasia: "Mission to Australasia"
 ENG_mission_to_australasia_desc: "Socialism down-under is in dire straits. If our comrades are to fight capitalist tyranny successfully, they must have assistance."
 ENG_australasian_comrades: "Australasian Comrades"
 ENG_australasian_comrades_desc: "Now that socialism down-under has stabilised, we much give them what support we can to avoid them slipping back into their old ways."
 ENG_indian_comrades: "Indian Comrades"
 ENG_indian_comrades_desc: "Britain was once the oppressor of the Indian people. However, the strength of the relationship between our two peoples, regardless of the unfortunate circumstance in which it was built, is undeniable. Through economic assistance to Bharatiya Commune, we can begin to put right the injustices of history, and in the process, strengthen the socialist cause."
 ENG_liberation_of_canada: "Liberation of Canada"
 ENG_liberation_of_canada_desc: "Across the Atlantic Ocean in the frigid north, the devil himself seemingly lies in wait. Canada and its lackeys will surely strike us with even the smallest opportunity. We cannot wait to be attacked; we are as ready now to liberate the people of Canada as we ever will be."

 ENG_tuc: "The 1936 Congress of the Trade Unions"
 ENG_tuc_desc: "This year's TUC will probably be a bit special - long-time Chairman Philip Snowden has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralisationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley) and status quo Federationists (Arthur Horner) with his egalitarian & pacifist running mate Sylvia Pankhurst are all vying for superiority. These will be nights to remember..."
 ENG_tuc_economy: "Economic Policy"
 ENG_tuc_economy_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
 ENG_tuc_internal: "Internal Policy"
 ENG_tuc_internal_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
 ENG_tuc_military: "Military Affairs"
 ENG_tuc_military_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
 ENG_tuc_foreign: "Foreign Policy"
 ENG_tuc_foreign_desc: "We must now consider the debate in the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The congress listened casually to every candidate until the suggestion of the Autonomists were heard, when a slow, shocked murmur ran through the hall."
 ENG_central_industry_research: "Central Industry Research"
 ENG_central_industry_research_desc: "To prepare our Syndicalist industry for the fight against the Capitalists, we should establish the Department for Central Industry Research. This office will help us overcome inefficiency."
 ENG_local_help: "Local Help Initiative"
 ENG_local_help_desc: "Many Comrades in the Union of Britain are still living in great poverty. The bureaucracy has done little to help them. If we extended our support of the local councils, these suffering people would finally feel the blessings of the revolution."
 ENG_expand_industry_1: "Expand Industry: Wales and the Midlands"
 ENG_expand_industry_1_desc: "The capitalist regime of old neglected Wales and the Midlands for centuries, and allowed, if not outright encouraged, the gradual depopulation of the region as its labourers migrated to England's southern cities for menial jobs. The great economic potential of these regions and its people thus remains largely untapped; for the benefit of all, we must invest!"
 ENG_militarized_industry: "Militarised Industry"
 ENG_militarized_industry_desc: "Only through relentless efficiency and discipline, even in the most mundane of tasks, will we be able to beat the capitalists."
 ENG_expand_industry_2: "Expand Industry: Scotland"
 ENG_expand_industry_2_desc: "Scotland to has been left behind, had its people neglected and its wealth stolen by the capitalist pigs. No more; today investment will flow north!"
 ENG_british_rail_reform: "Renovation of the Motorways"
 ENG_british_rail_reform_desc: "The large roadway networks linking the Great British cities are in a horrid state. By investing into our infrastructure, we will assure flawless cooperation between Syndicates all over the island."
 ENG_local_industry: "Local Industry Initiative"
 ENG_local_industry_desc: "The Syndicalist economy does not only consist of steel factories but also of small non-centralised manufactures. By supporting these independent Syndicates, we will ensure versatile and flexible production."
 ENG_local_talent: "Local Talent Initiative"
 ENG_local_talent_desc: "We cannot afford to waste innovative talent just because it is not centred in the metropolitan areas. We need to support local talent."
 ENG_local_initiative: "Expand Local Initiative"
 ENG_local_initiative_desc: "While we have granted much power to the local communes, they continue to deal primarily with the central government. We should make reaching the central government harder so that our workers will work with each other for true socialist progress."
 ENG_political_commissars: "The Central Intelligence Committee"
 ENG_political_commissars_desc: "Sometimes, even the most diligent Syndicalist needs a small reminder of his duties. Sometimes, that reminder should be given from behind a revolvers' sights."
 ENG_defend_the_revolution: "Federationists: Defend the Revolution"
 ENG_defend_the_revolution_desc: "The Revolution must be defended from the attacks from Autonomists and Maximists! The only way forward is the orthodox one!"
 ENG_new_capital: "A New Capital"
 ENG_new_capital_desc: "London has long held a privileged place in Britain, and has become swamped by Centralism and bureaucracy; the TUC's current location reinforces this. Only by moving to a smaller city, one at the heart of Britain, and thus within reach of all its people, will we able to guarantee fair representation for all. This city will be Birmingham."
 ENG_home_rule: "Home Rule"
 ENG_home_rule_desc: "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
 ENG_dissolve_tuc: "Dissolve the National TUC"
 ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc: "The Trade Union Congress has served its purpose. While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many. With the success of our initial decentralisation efforts, the time has come to make the People's Palace the seat of a new, English TUC. The remains of the Union will be dealt with shortly."
 ENG_devolution: "Devolution"
 ENG_devolution_desc: "With the establishment of TUCs in Cardiff and Edinburgh, the process of Devolution will come to a successful end."
 ENG_turn_the_other_cheek: "Compromise with Maximists"
 ENG_turn_the_other_cheek_desc: "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We cannot throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
 ENG_city_upon_a_hill: "Compromise with Autonomists"
 ENG_city_upon_a_hill_desc: "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We cannot throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
 ENG_evolution: "Evolution"
 ENG_evolution_desc: "Both the Autonomists and the Maximists are trying to change an already working machine. British Syndicalism is fine as it is; If only they would understand that..."
 ENG_merge: "The Grand Protector"
 ENG_merge_desc: "While it is unconstitutional, unifying the offices of General Secretary and Chairman of the Trade Union Congress in the new office of Grand Protector of the Union of Britain will give us much more power to push through our reforms."
 ENG_revolution: "Revolution"
 ENG_revolution_desc: "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political programme a reality. This will be risky, though."

 ENG_centralise_officers: "Centralised Planning"
 ENG_centralise_officers_desc: "The Republican Army is at the pinnacle of professionalism in the Internationale's military forces but not yet able to take on Germany the Exiles. While the lower officers might not like it, all decision making must be centralised and well organised."
 ENG_officer_autonomy: "Maintain Officer Autonomy"
 ENG_officer_autonomy_desc: "The Republican Army was built on the principle that the officer on the ground knows his men and the situation best allowing swifter planning and better morale. Why fix what isn't broken?"
 ENG_improve_army: "Reinforce the Republican Army"
 ENG_improve_army_desc: "As storm clouds gather over Europe, we can no longer watch idly by as the world changes. The Republican Army, the protectors of Britain and our revolution, must stand firm and ready to face the storm lest we be washed away by the tide of history."
 ENG_revolutionary_command: "Create the Republican Integrated Command"
 ENG_revolutionary_command_desc: "The current high command is prone to petty bickering, cliquishness and all manner of silly arguing. By creating one efficient and integrated command structure, we can vastly improve the capabilities of the army."
 ENG_on_foreign_shores: "On Foreign Shores"

 ENG_women_soldiers: "Expand Female Auxillary Service"
 ENG_women_soldiers_desc: "Currently the women's auxillary service allows women to serve in varying army and support roles but it is in poor shape and mired in bureaucracy. Frankly it should be more integrated into the army and expanded, to free more men up for the fight and let women do their service for Britain."
 ENG_three_armies: "Three Armies"
 ENG_three_armies_desc: "Now that the home countries have at least partly gained their autonomy that same autonomy should go to the Worker's Militias.

### 0 - 100: TUC and Show of Force ###
 uob.0.t: "The New Britain"
 uob.0.d: "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany would not last long - the exhausted Great Powers soon agreed to a formal peace in the Treaty of Versailles in late 1919, which came to be informally known in Britain as Lloyd-George's \"Peace with Honour\". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, having built up a socialist dream, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos and its continental allies clamouring for war, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union forever..."
 uob.0.a: "Fascinating."

 uob.1.t: "The 1936 Trade Union Council Begins"
 uob.1.d: "After weeks of preliminary meetings and preparation, today the main part of the Trade Union Congress of 1936 has begun. The various factions of the congress have sent their delegates and their leaders to London to argue for their position. We shall see what shall happen."
 uob.1.a: "Let the Congress Begin!"

 uob.2.t: "Economic Policy Vote"
 uob.2.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
 uob.2.a: "Max.: The economy must be expanded, centralised and streamlined."
 uob.2.b: "Fed.: The economy must be expanded and centralised."
 uob.2.c: "Aut.: Greater economic autonomy must be given to the Home Nations."

 uob.3.t: "Internal Policy Vote"
 uob.3.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
 uob.3.a: "Max.: The local governments must be brought in line with the TUC."
 uob.3.b: "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory."
 uob.3.c: "Aut.: Decentralisation - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations."

 uob.4.t: "Foreign Policy Vote"
 uob.4.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy specifically what should the Union of Britain's role within the International be. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions."

 uob.4.b: "Fed.: Canada is our mortal enemy, and France is our good friend."
 uob.4.c: "Aut.: European Socialism - A Thousand flowers must bloom forth within the International."

 uob.5.t: "Military Policy Vote"
 uob.5.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
 uob.5.a: "Max.: The military must be expanded and the local militias placed under TUC control."
 uob.5.b: "Fed.: The army must be expanded but only in self-defence."
 uob.5.c: "Aut.: A Scottish, English, and Welsh national army."

 uob.6.t: "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
 uob.6.d: "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post immediately and have an interim committee take his place until the final ballots are cast. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
 uob.6.a: "Shocking, to say the least."

 uob.7.t: "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"
 uob.7.d: "The TUC has decided to vote for Oswald Mosley's Maximists with an overwhelming majority. Oswald Mosley will become the new Chairman of the TUC."

 uob.8.t: "Chairman Election - Feds & Cons Secure a Majority"

 uob.9.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Glais."

 uob.10.t: "Chairman Election - Draw"

 uob.11.t: "Chairman Election - Autonomists Secure no Majority"
 uob.11.d: "The TUC has decided to vote for Niclas y Glais' Autonomists - but not with any great majority. Niclas y Glais will become the new Chairman of the TUC but he will have to compromise with other factions."
 uob.11.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Glais."

 uob.12.t: "Chairman Election - Feds & Cons Secure no Majority"
 uob.12.d: "The TUC has decided to vote for Arthur Horner's Federationists and Sylvia Pankhurst's Congregationists - but not with any great majority.

 uob.14.ab: "Congratulations, Comrade Glais."
 uob.14.ac: "Congratulations, Comrade Pankhurst."
 uob.14.ad: "Congratulations, Comrade Horner."

 uob.15.t: "Show of Force"
 uob.15.d: "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
 uob.15.a: "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters."
 uob.15.b: "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland."
 uob.15.c: "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland."

 uob.16.t: "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
 uob.16.d: "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island. In face of this grave situation many politicians suggest that Ireland should find someone to guarantee its independence. The most reasonable option would be Germany - but there are even some advocating a return to Windsor protection."
 uob.16.d.return: "[refuse_country.GetNameDefCap] has abandoned us, and refuses to do anything about our predicament. What shall we do now?"
 uob.16.a: "Maintain our neutrality"
 uob.16.b: "Ask the Kaiser for protection"
 uob.16.c: "Ask the Canadian king for protection"

 uob.17.t: "Ireland Requests Canadian Support"
 uob.17.d: "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violations of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
 uob.17.a: "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Entente."
 uob.17.b: "Announce our support for Ireland."
 uob.17.c: "We are not ready for such involvement in the Old World."

 uob.18.t: "Canada Protects Ireland"
 uob.18.d: "The Canadian government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Windsor influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
 uob.18.a: "Most splendid!"
 uob.18.b: "Bloody hell!"

 uob.19.t: "Canada Supports Ireland"
 uob.19.d: "The Canadian government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Canadians are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."
 uob.19.a: "At least we're not alone..."
 uob.19.b: "It may actually be quite wise to do so..."

 uob.20.t: "Canada Abandons Ireland"
 uob.20.d: "The Canadian government has ignored the Irish call for help. Whatever comes next, they must be prepared for the worst, as this gives the British a free hand in choosing their next step towards the Emerald Isle."

 uob.20.b: "Rule Britannia!"

 uob.21.t: "Ireland Requests German Support"
 uob.21.d: "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violation of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
 uob.21.a: "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Reichspakt."
 uob.21.b: "Announce our support for Ireland."
 uob.21.c: "We are not ready for such involvement."

 uob.22.t: "Germany Protects Ireland"
 uob.22.d: "The German government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Hohenzollern influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
 uob.22.a: "Most splendid!"
 uob.22.b: "Bloody hell!"

 uob.23.t: "Germany Supports Ireland"
 uob.23.d: "The German government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain.

 uob.24.a: "Oh no!"
 uob.24.b: "Rule Britannia!"

 uob.25.t: "Union of Britain Threatens Iceland and the Azores"
 uob.25.d: "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Royal Navy but this is opposed by many Canadians who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."
 uob.25.a: "Demonstrate our own power."
 uob.25.b: "Spend our resources on further buildup."

 uob.26.t: "The Royal Navy on the Atlantic"
 uob.26.d: "The King has ordered the Royal Navy to enter the Atlantic in a show of force roughly matching ours. Although the Entente is far too weak for another war we should keep this act in mind should we attempt another demonstration."
 uob.26.a: "Bloody hell!"
 uob.26.b: "Merde!"

 uob.27.t: "The Canadians Cower"
 uob.27.d: "The Canadians did not dare to send their fleet into the Atlantic allowing our force to operate freely. This has shown the power of socialism and weakness of the Imperialist 'great powers'."
 uob.27.a: "Rule Britannia!"
 uob.27.b: "Vive le Socialisme!"

 uob.28.t: "Union of Britain Threatens Iceland and the Azores"
 uob.28.d: "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Reichspakt but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Hochseeflotte but this is opposed by many Germans who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."
 uob.28.a: "Demonstrate our own power."
 uob.28.b: "Spend our resources on further buildup."

 uob.29.t: "The Hochseeflotte on the North Sea"
 uob.29.d: "The Kaiser has ordered the Hochseeflotte to enter the North Sea in a show of force fairly matching ours. Although the Reichspakt is far too weak for another war we should keep this act in mind should we attempt another demonstration."
 uob.29.a: "Bloody hell!"
 uob.29.b: "Merde!"

 uob.30.t: "The Germans Cower"
 uob.30.d: "The Germans did not dare to send their fleet into the North Sea allowing our force to operate freely. This has shown the power of socialism and weakness of the Imperialist 'great powers'."
 uob.30.a: "Rule Britannia!"
 uob.30.b: "Vive le Socialisme!"

 uob.31.t: "Union of Britain Attacks Ireland"
 uob.31.d: "The Union of Britain has declared war on Ireland. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Irish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Ireland?"
 uob.31.a: "Warn them to turn back or face Canadian arms!"
 uob.31.b: "Back down! We've changed our minds!"

 uob.32.t: "The Royalists Send an Ultimatum over Ireland"
 uob.32.d: "The Royalists in Canada have sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Ireland and declare a ceasefire or Canada will come to Ireland's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the island and secure our vulnerable flank in the event of future conflict, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
 uob.32.a: "We will not risk war with Canada over this."
 uob.32.b: "We answer to no monarchy! Continue on to Dublin!"

 uob.33.t: "Britain Ignores Our Ireland Ultimatum"
 uob.33.d: "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Irish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Ireland into our alliance or we can stand down and let Ireland fall, strengthening their position in the Atlantic."
 uob.33.a: "We stand with Ireland!"
 uob.33.b: "Back down! We've changed our minds!"

 uob.34.t: "Ottawa Warns London"
 uob.34.d: "Canada has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain. They will either fall back to the British mainland or risk annihilation."
 uob.34.a: "We knew they'd pull through for us!"

 uob.35.t: "Britain Backs Down Over Ireland"
 uob.35.d: "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. Ireland's independence will be kept and our pride remains intact."
 uob.35.a: "We couldn't have done it without Canada!"
 uob.35.b: "Those Socialist eejits were in dire need of that!"

 uob.37.d: "The Union of Britain has declared war on Ireland. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Irish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Ireland?"
 uob.37.a: "We stand with Ireland!"

 uob.42.t: "Germany Betrays Us!"

 uob.42.a: "Never surrender!"

 uob.43.t: "The Syndicalist British Attack Ireland"
 uob.43.d: "The Union of Britain, those despicable usurpers, has declared war on the Irish state. So far we have only given diplomatic support to Ireland and do not have to intervene. We could still bring our forces into action - but after our lenient policy so far such a reaction would most likely raise protests here among those who support the Ulster cause and see the Irish Republicans as traitors to the Empire."

 uob.43.b: "Send a strong-worded letter..."

 uob.44.t: "Union of Britain Attacks Ireland"
 uob.44.d: "The Union of Britain, that nest of vipers, has declared war on the Irish state.

 uob.45.t: "Diplomatic Moves in Ireland"

 uob.47.ad: "War will resolve this!"

 uob.48.t: "The Syndicalist British Ignore Our Demands"
 uob.48.d: "The 'British' ambassador has ignored our demands. While we could just pull out of this whole affair we could also announce to the world how these Syndicalist rowdies cannot be reasoned with - it will make us seem a little childish but will have consequences for them as well.

 uob.50.d: "After the letter was received by the Union of Britain's ambassador they quickly reserved places at one of the biggest places in town and hosted an - actually quite enjoyable - dinner party to apologise for their impoliteness. Our pride is intact."
 uob.50.a: "We couldn't have done it without Canada!"
 uob.50.b: "Those Syndicalist eejits were in dire need of that! Good whisky though!"

 uob.51.t: "Canada Betrays Us"
 uob.51.d: "The Canadians have now pulled back on their promises to protect us against the Syndicalists. We stand alone against their diplomatic advances."

 uob.64.b: "We'll make them pay for every inch they take!"

 uob.65.t: "Britain Demands a Syndicalist Government!"
 uob.65.d: "The British have decided to spread their so-called syndicalist 'revolution' and have demanded that we step down and put a socialist government into power, no doubt puppets of the British.

 uob.66.t: "Britain Demands Influence and Bases in Ireland!"

 uob.220.d: "Yesterday British Republican Army units tried to arrest many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley.

There are also as-of-yet unconfirmed reports of many of them openly marching into the assembly hall of the Trade Union Congress under the massive cheers of anti-Mosley demonstrators, only leaving after being handcuffed at the speakers table to the "boos" of the assembly. This day will leave a clear mark on Maximist prestige."

 uob.221.d: "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman.

 uob.223.b: "Unexpected, but not unwelcome!"

 uob.224.t: "Maximist Putsch!"
 uob.224.d: "This morning the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat. Accompanying them were Maximist officials. This is obviously an attempt by the Maximists to seize power - We must take action now or risk losing control over the country!"

 uob.225.t: "General Strike is Successful"

 uob.226.t: "General Strike Continues"

 uob.227.d: "After we called for a nation-wide General Strike to resist the unlawful coup the streets of the Union soon filled with workers carrying banners and singing syndicalist songs peacefully protesting for Syndicalism. The soldiers did not give in and finally a brawl in Manchester seemingly convinced the coup leaders to authorise deadly force.

 uob.228.d: "After we called for our soldiers to protect the Syndicalist order and not obey the orders of their officers many soon remembered the traditions of the old, disbanded, worker's militias. They formed Soldier Councils and decided to stand down. The scare is over."

 uob.229.t: "Republican Forces Stand Idle"
 uob.229.d: "The soldiers sitting on their tanks and guarding public squares seem to be not doing anything. For whatever reason, the hours pass, and nothing happens. The people peering out of their windows are waiting..."

 uob.229.b: "Let's wait this out..."

 uob.230.t: "Republican Forces Side With the Maximists"
 uob.230.d: "Our call to the common soldier has gone unanswered. After some uncertainty the putsching soldiers are now systematically rounding up members of our government. They have taken control of the telephone lines and we have lost our means of communication to the rest of the Union."
 uob.230.a: "We have failed."

 uob.231.t: "Mending the Wounds"
 uob.231.d: "The coup has been averted peacefully, but it should never have happened in the first place. In the aftermath, the people have been left wondering what could make them turn against their own countrymen. The general spirit among the populace, however, is one of reconciliation, as we once again stand together as a true Union of Britain."
 uob.231.a: "We must forgive, but not forget."

 uob.232.t: "A New Course for the Union"
 uob.232.d: "The coup was successful, but has left some serious rifts in our national identity. It will take time to convince the people of our new way for Britain."

 uob.352.c: "Barbara Castle, to protect Britain's families from poverty!"

 uob.356.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 uob.356.d: "Comrade Mosley saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Maximism has led us well through this war and is still popular - but the people are growing tired of authoritarianism, and elements in the Maximists and the Congregationalists are seeking to propose a new liberal way forward."
 uob.356.a: "Chairman-for-Life! Rule per decree!"
 uob.356.b: "Maximist liberals John Strachey and Phil Piratin defeat Mosley!"

 uob.357.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 uob.357.d: "Our inimitable chairwoman has shown mettle like that of Elizabeth I as she led us reluctantly through this war. Today, however, she looks tired and unlikely to win re-election. Perhaps she can, though, if she looks to more unconventional allies..."

 uob.357.b: "She turns to Radical Socialist Clem Attlee for support!"

 uob.358.d: "It has been quite some time since Chairman Glais oversaw the de-federalisation of our Union, the creation of communal leadership and the autonomy of Wales and Scotland.

But while this promise has quite the following in the halls of London and other British cities, protests and demonstrations have been staged by our enemies already - and they will only grow stronger if we follow through..."
 uob.360.a: "It shall be done!"
 uob.360.b: "Maybe this wasn't the best idea..."

 uob.361.t: "A Cold, Wet Day for Eric Blair"
 uob.361.d: "Comrade Eric Blair, once an ally of Grand Protector Mosley, cannot stand it any longer. For too long the evil Mosley had perverted the constitution and made the Union of Britain his plaything. A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."
 uob.361.a: "His Populist coup is successful!"
 uob.361.b: "He brings in the military!"

 uob.362.t: "A Cold, Wet Day"
 uob.362.d: "Early this morning, the popular writer and skilled militia commander Eric Blair was found dead in his home after obviously having committed suicide. While officially no testament has been found, it is an open secret that Blair was no longer an ally of Grand Protector Mosley.\n\nAs the 'improvised' demonstration in his honour slowly and quietly travelled through the streets of London, ever more people joined, many with tears in their eyes. Some wept for the man, some for the last hope against Mosley's dictatorship."
 uob.362.a: "Finally he's gone..."

 uob.363.t: "The Oil Question"
 uob.363.d: "It has been decades since we forced the capitalists out, yet we can't rest. Not until they are all defeated will we be safe, but to defeat them the workers spirit will not be enough. There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."
 uob.363.a: "It will have to be enough..."

 uob.364.t: "Support from the Union of Britain"
 uob.364.d: "Today an envoy from the Union of Britain arrived. He brought with him promises of industrial assistance, naval advice and technological support, along with kinda words of admiration for our struggle. The capitalists may be strong and fighting us at every turn, but with allies such as these, we will best them regardless."
 uob.364.a: "Truly workers solidarity is shining out from Britain."

 uob.365.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 uob.365.d: "The Chairman has saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Federationism saved us from Mosley's Tyranny, has led us well through this war and is still popular - but Mosley-disciple John Strachey is challenging him for the Chair, as is the up-and-coming Congregationalist Ellen Wilkinson. Federationists may have to rely on an old ally to win the day..."
 uob.365.a: "The Chairman elevates G.D.H. Cole to General Secretary."
 uob.365.b: "An Attlee-Cole Alliance will win the day!"

 uob.1000.d: "Our Railway Syndicates have a tradition of giving out ridiculously difficult crossword puzzles in their newspapers. Only a few people manage to actually solve these puzzles. Now, however, the Mid-England Rail Syndicate has reported that for the past few months, anonymous letters have started arriving, always containing the correct solutions to the last crossword puzzle. Whoever is writing these letters must be some sort of genius - and could probably be of help to us..."

 uob.1001.t: "Wrapped in a Mystery"
 uob.1001.d: "It took quite some time, but our intelligence services finally managed to find the man who still regularly solves the hardest crossword puzzles in the country with ease. His name is Alan Turing, a math professor before the revolution, currently living in London. He first tried to evade our men, but after some time, calmed down. And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."
 uob.1001.a: "Grant the funds!"

 uob.1002.t: "Inside an Enigma"
 uob.1002.d_1: "'He did it, the (expletive), he did it!' our leading scientists are cited in today's papers. The small project of this Turing, over time grown into a whole village near the former cottage at Bletchley Park, has finally seen success. He has constructed a strange machine, called 'Pudding' after the Yorkshire pudding Turing was enjoying when he had the idea, that has revolutionised cryptography. For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."
 uob.1002.d_2: "'He did it, the (expletive), he did it!' our leading scientists are cited in today's papers. The once small project of Alan Turing, grown massively since we provided handsome funding to the operation in Bletchley Park, has finally seen success.

Wells has, with funding of the Union of Britain, gone through with his plan of the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being.

She was constructed in 1935 as a propaganda tool, intended to show the world the achievements of the Union of Britain. In 1936, she made her maiden voyage, and soon started making regular traffic to Paris. Today, as she was about to dock at a Paris airfield, she burst into flames and crashed to the ground. 35 people out of 97 (plus one of the ground crew) died."

 uob.1025.t: "The Union of Arts"
 uob.1025.d: "For a few years now, a group of artists led by a German emigrant by the name of Hannes Meyer have pushed for their idea of a unified Union of Arts. They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set. Should we establish one Union for all our artists, or leave things as they are?"
 uob.1025.a: "The way forward is together!"
 uob.1025.b: "We don't need centralisation for centralisation's sake..."

 uob.1026.d: "Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1844, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

 uob.1027.a: "Huzzah!"

 uob.1033.t: "A Dinner party with a twist"
 uob.1033.d: "After the recent developments in Ireland the British ambassador in Dublin has invited his German counterpart and his attachés for a dinner party to finally alleviate the tension - or at least that's what the German delegation thought. Instead, they found themselves in a Dublin gin joint being served grumpy stew. As they finally left the embarrassing meeting they had to parade through a street filled with Irish socialists cheering on the British delegation. With this spiteful parting gesture however the British campaign against Ireland seems to have come to an end."
 uob.1033.a: "How very much worth it!"
 uob.1033.b: "How embarrassing..."
 uob.1033.c: "I'm sorry, what?"

 uob.1034.t: "A Modern Day Witch?"
 uob.1034.d: "In an unusual turn of events, the government has today announced that the Witchcraft Act of 1735 is to be repealed and that all those currently tried under the law are to have their sentences halved. Under normal circumstances this would not raise eyebrows as many old laws were imported in the creation of the new constitution and progressively rescinded though this one has stuck out.\n\nOne week ago, a Scottish medium by the name Helen Duncan was arrested on the grounds of falsely claiming to procure spirit and obtaining money under false pretences before being sentenced to nine months in prison. Duncan will no doubt go down in history as the last person to be tried and arrested under the Witchcraft Act."
 uob.1034.a: "What a strange tale."

 uob.1035.t: "Arson At RAF Penrhos"
 uob.1035.d: "The Republican Air Force base at Penrhos was burned down last night in what seemed like a random arson attack. However, this morning the three culprits; Saunders Lewis; Lewis Valentine and DJ Williams turned themselves in at the Pwllheli Police Station. In an eloquent defence, Saunders Lewis referred to the construction of the airbase at such a historic cultural monument 'a crime against Wales' and that this was simply the act of a 'downtrodden people lashing out.' The Maximists of the TUC have called for the alleged ringleader Williams to be executed and his co-conspirators imprisoned. In a more calm tone, the Federationists have called for the three men to be arrested and finally the Autonomists and Congregationists have called for them to be acquitted."
 uob.1035.a: "Life imprisonment for the lot of them!"
 uob.1035.b: "A short stint in prison shall set these men right."
 uob.1035.c: "Y Glais is right, let them walk as free men!"

### Characters ###
 ENG_oswald_mosley: "Oswald Mosley"
 ENG_oswald_mosley_leader_desc: "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."

 ENG_rajani_palme_dutt: "Rajani Palme Dutt"

 ENG_philip_snowden: "Philip Snowden"
 ENG_philip_snowden_leader_desc: "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."

 ENG_arthur_horner: "Arthur Horner"
 ENG_arthur_horner_leader_desc: "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"

 ENG_sylvia_pankhurst: "Sylvia Pankhurst"
 ENG_sylvia_pankhurst_leader_desc: "Sylvia Pankhurst, the daughter of Dr. Richard Pankhurst and Emmeline Pankhurst, was born in Old Trafford, Manchester on 5th May, 1882. Her father was a committed socialist and a strong advocate of women's suffrage. In 1906, Sylvia Pankhurst started to work full-time for the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with her sister Christabel and their mother. She applied her artistic talents on behalf of the WSPU, devising its logo and various leaflets, banners, and posters as well as the decoration of its meeting halls. In 1907 she toured industrial towns in England and Scotland, painting portraits of working-class women in their working environments. During the First World War Sylvia Pankhurst was horrified to see her mother Emmeline and her sister Christabel become enthusiastic supporters of the war drive and campaign in favour of military conscription. She was opposed to the war, and was publicly attacked in the newly renamed WSPU newspaper Britannia. Sylvia's antiwar activities lead her to become the leader of the British Section of the Third Internationale. By 1922 the British Section had submitted to the Syndicalist ideology, thereby moving from an antiwar position to a pro General Strike position."

 ENG_tom_mann: "Tom Mann"
 ENG_tom_mann_leader_desc: "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. A veteran activist, Mann has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."

 ENG_willie_gallacher: "Willie Gallacher"
 ENG_willie_gallacher_leader_desc: "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nNow in charge of the Union, he will no doubt pursue the status quo course."

 ENG_ellen_wilkinson: "Ellen Wilkinson"

 ENG_clement_attlee: "Clement Attlee"
 ENG_clement_attlee_leader_desc: "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instil in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."

 ENG_central_committee_communal_leader_desc: "With Y Glais finally being able to fulfil his dream of transforming the Union, the last reform is to abolish the position of Chairman and instead replace it with a communal presidency headed by a committee elected by the regional TUCs."

 ENG_niclas_y_glais: "Niclas y Glais"
 ENG_niclas_y_glais_leader_desc: "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural labourers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
 ENG_niclas_y_glais_WLS_leader_desc: "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural labourers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nAs Wales's newfound political independence is still recent, and few socialists deny the enormous contributions of Niclas for the proletariat of Cymru. Hoping to correct what he saw as overcentralising policies during the time of the Union of Britain, Charmain Glais's main objective is to revitalize the culture and conciousness of the Welsh proletariat, something that is seen is positive abroad as to foster a notion of nationhood in the small country"

 ENG_eric_blair: "Eric Blair"
 ENG_eric_blair_leader_desc: "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."

 gbp.1.t: "Restoration of the [GBP.GetAdjective] Throne?"
 gbp.1.d: "With the Union of Britain thoroughly defeated, the time has come to establish a new administration for the isles. The most natural choice would be to establish a client republic to make the transition from syndicalism to orderly governance less painful. However, it has been proposed by some that we install Carl-Eduard of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the British throne. The so-called 'traitor prince' himself is open to the position and has previously expressed an interest in ruling over his birth country, though our new collaboators have warned he will be a liability and his mere presence could badly antagonise the British. Regardless England shall raise its fist against the Vaterland no more!"
 gbp.1.a: "A German king shall sit on St. Edward's Throne!"
 gbp.1.b: "Look what they did to the last king, a republic is more preferable."

 gbp.2.t: "A New Order in Britain"
 gbp.2.d: "Following the defeat of the Union of Britain, the occupation will now officially come to an end following the imposition of new borders. After three centuries of Union, England and Scotland have at last been divided once more. Our armies will continue to remain heavily involved, helping prop up the new English and Scottish governments, until at some point we may deem them more trustworthy. Loyal collaboators seeking to remake these lands anew will take over much of the day-to-day running, particularly in suppressing the ongoing 'continuation' insurgencies of Union loyalists. While the British may yet resist, in time the republics of England and Scotland will cement their place in the world and the concept of the 'British' nation will be relegated to the dustbin of history."
 gbp.2.a: "The natural order of the isles has been restored."

 gbp.3.t: "A New Order in Britain"
 gbp.3.d: "Following the defeat of the Union of Britain, the occupation will now officially come to an end following the imposition of new borders. After half a millenia of union, England, Scotland and Wales have been divided once more. Our armies will continue to remain heavily involved, helping prop up the new English, Scottish and Welsh governments, until at some point we may deem them more trustworthy. Loyal collaboators seeking to remake these lands anew and revive once lost national identities will take over much of the day-to-day running, particularly in suppressing the ongoing 'continuation' insurgencies of Union loyalists. While the British may yet resist, in time the republics of England, Scotland and Wales will cement their place in the world and the concept of the 'British' nation will be relegated to the dustbin of history, once and for all."
 gbp.3.a: "An isle once whole, shattered forever."

 gbp.4.t: "A Little Gift from Zim"
 gbp.4.d: "Not really sure how you got here but to whoever's playing their puppets, here's a little top up for your manpower, guns and factories. Enjoy being a German lackey."
 gbp.4.a: "I promise I will!"

 gbp.5.t: "Another Little Gift from Zim"
 gbp.5.d: "... Uh you're not supposed to see this."
 gbp.5.a: "Yeah whatever"

 gbp.6.t: "Hidden Event #3"
 gbp.6.d: "...\n\nAre you seriously playing puppet Wales?"
 gbp.6.a: "Yes."

 gbp.7.t: "A New Order in Britain"
 gbp.7.d: "Following the defeat of the Union of Britain, the occupation will now officially come to an end following the imposition of a new administration. After centuries of imperial hegemony and international power, Great Britain lies in tatters, a shadow of what once was. Our armies will continue to remain heavily involved, helping prop up the new British government, until at some point we may deem them more trustworthy. Loyal collaboators seeking to remake the nation anew will take over much of the day-to-day running, particularly in suppressing the ongoing 'continuation' insurgencies of Union loyalists. While the British may yet resist, in time the new republic will cement its place in the world and England shall rattle its sword no more."
 gbp.7.a: "May we never experience the same fate."
