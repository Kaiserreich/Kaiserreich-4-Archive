 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi: "Aisin-Gioro Puyi"
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_leader_desc: "'His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor’ - while Puyi holds many titles, the young Emperor has little power and has never really possessed any since his birth in 1906. Deposed in the Xinhai Revolution at the age of 5, he was returned to the throne as a condition of the German intervention in China, a move detested by the general population. With day-to-day governance largely handled by the civil government in Beijing, he has spent the last decade idly sitting in the Forbidden City, occupying his days with tennis matches and calligraphy. But the Xuantong Emperor may secretly harbour ambitions to restore China and his dynasty to the greatness they enjoyed centuries ago..."
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_manchu_leader_desc: "Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Restoration, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clean of warlord influences. While some observers feared a return to traditional courtly intrigues, the new Qing government has opted to present a much more modern outlook. Puyi still lacks much power, but this is of calculated design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislation and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can exemplify what it means to be a modern monarch."
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_yiguandao_leader_desc: "While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Restoration would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."

 QIE_wu_peifu: "Wu Peifu"
 QIE_wu_peifu_leader_desc: "Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili Clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his country. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and may soon transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
 QIE_wu_peifu_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 22nd, 1874\nPenglai, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in Shandong to a merchant family, Wu entered the Baoding military academy and quickly rose through the ranks of the new Beiyang army. Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili Clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 rose to dominate the clique. In 1928 he lead it to victory over its main rival, the Fengtian clique, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the National Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Qing monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili Clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the monarchists and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of the state. A token opposition is allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nWu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim.\nHe was once renowned for hanging a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck. 'A great political thinker, just like Washington', Wu said to a visiting journalist, ignoring any questions about his relationship with Germany."

 QIE_hu_shih: "Hu Shih"
 QIE_hu_shih_leader_desc: "A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the aristocracy's treachery revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili Clique."

 QIE_wellington_koo: "Vi Kyuin Wellington Koo"
 QIE_wellington_koo_leader_desc: "V. K. Wellington Koo, or Gu Weijun as he is known in China, is one of the nation’s foremost diplomats and statesmen. Influential in the negotiations surrounding the end of the Weltkrieg, during the Imperial restoration he served as ambassador to the United States. Recalled due to escalating political tensions, Wu has now appointed him president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’, hoping his diplomatic skills can help in achieving international legitimacy and recognition."

 QIE_jiang_baili: "Jiang Baili"
 QIE_jiang_baili_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nHaining, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a relatively prosperous family, Jiang entered the Qing civil service in his youth and attended Tsinghua University, graduating in 1901. He studied in Japan, returning in 1910 for a brief stint in governance before going abroad again, this time to Germany. He served in Yuan Shikai’s government before he declared himself emperor, a decision Jiang strongly opposed. Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928. He has remained a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nSkilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though some have accused him of stealing ideas from his subordinates."

 QIE_wang_huaiqing: "Wang Huaiqing"
 QIE_wang_huaiqing_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nNingjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhile Wang was born into an upper-middle class family of bureaucrats in 1875, his father’s alcoholism and gambling drove the family into poverty. Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili Clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops' garrisons.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nKnown affectionately as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique monnicker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campaign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, rallying his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and seize the bastion. Furthermore, he apparently even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal."

 QIE_aisin_gioro_zaitao: "Aisin-Gioro Zaitao"
 QIE_aisin_gioro_zaitao_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJune 23rd, 1887\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAisin-Gioro Zaitao, uncle of Puyi, was born into a life of privilege and wealth enjoyed by few in China. The younger brother of the Guangxu Emperor, he was acquainted with a baby Puyi while he was a teenager. Rising through the ranks of the Manchu nobility due to his family ties, he was promoted to Inspector General in 1909 before embarking on a tour of the world in 1910, and attended the funeral of King George V in 1911. Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Zongshe Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth. An excellent horsemen, he has become interested in armoured warfare in recent years due to its potential battlefield applications.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn his spare time he enjoys horse riding, martial arts, and Beijing-style opera."

 QIE_aisin_gioro_pujie: "Aisin-Gioro Pujie"
 QIE_aisin_gioro_pujie_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 16th, 1907\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe brother of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, Pujie spent his childhood as a playmate to his brother, who was notorious for his temper tantrums and pampered nature. A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili Clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile."

 QIE_cai_chengxun: "Cai Chengxun"
 QIE_cai_chengxun_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1871\nTianjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of the Tianjin Wubei Academy, Cai Chengxun has served in the military since 1900, including a brief stint as military governor of Gansu, where he aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. Since the fourth Zhifeng war he has mainly concerned himself with guarding the northern frontier against Fengtian incursions.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nOnce built a residence and an ancestral hall in Tianjin and engaged in real estate, industrial investment and charity during his dismissal."

 QIE_liu_menggeng: "Liu Menggeng"
 QIE_liu_menggeng_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1881\nFuning, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of the Qing's Army Military Medical School, Liu grew close to many in the Zhili Clique while serving in a variety of medical and health offices, culminating with him serving as dean of the Baoding Academy's Medical Academy. He has served as 'Minister of Health' in Beijing since 1931, and has proposed an ambitious and far-reaching military reform plan that encompasses a variety of medical reforms.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHas close family ties to many in the Zhili Clique, being a cousin of Cao Kun.\nHe is also the intelligence minister of Cao Kun and Zhili Clique."

 QIE_wang_chengbin: "Wang Chengbin"
 QIE_wang_chengbin_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 21st, 1874\nFengtian, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an ethnically Manchu family, Wang was one of Wu’s earliest allies, helping him suppress Zhang Xun’s abortive Qing restoration in 1917. In 1923, he led the troops to surround the president Li Yuanhong at the Tianjin Railway Station. He took the presidential seal to helped Cao Kun become the president. In failing health, Chengbin has largely secluded himself from other Zhili generals, and many are concerned his death will expose deep divisions within the internal workings of the Clique and the Harmony Association.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe was the founder of Tianjing Clique, which belonged to the early branches of Zhili Clique with Wu Peifu's Luoyang Clique and Cao Kun's Baoding Clique."

 QIE_gobulo_runqi: "Gobulo Runqi"
 QIE_gobulo_runqi_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJuly 8th, 1912\nBeijing, Republic of China\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a Manchu noble family with long ties to the Aisin-Gioro clan, Gobulo Runqi was born just after the Qing were overthrown for the first time. Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attachés that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armoured warfare and mechanisation, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu nobles, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early '30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.\nHas quite the media presence, and his dalliances with various Beijing opera singers have made him a favourite of tabloids."

 QIE_zhang_qihuang: "Zhang Qihuang"
 QIE_zhang_qihuang_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nYongfu, Guangxi, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang Qihuang started his military career in Republican forces in the south of China, rising quickly through the ranks, culminating with him serving as governor of Guangdong. Once Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor, however, he resigned in disgust and went to Shanghai. His brother introduced him to Wu Peifu, and the two quickly became close allies. He served as a dedicated advisor to Wu, and eventually was promoted to several independent army commands.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA master fortune-teller and astrologer, known as "Iron Mouth." Wu Peifu rarely does anything without the advice of Zhang first."

 QIE_lu_xiangting: "Lu Xiangting"
 QIE_lu_xiangting_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1880\nHejian, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of both the Baoding Academy and the Japanese Army Sergeant School, Lu was originally a subordinate governor in Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces, but Lu’s open disdain for Sun's cooperation with Germany and his hatred of foreign concessions lead to his dismissal by Sun. He instead chose to work with Wu Peifu instead. He has worked closely with Jiang Baili in drafting plans to deal with a Japanese invasion, as the only thing he despises more than the Germans is Japanese domination over Manchuria.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nStill maintains contact with many former subordinates in the League. Information gained from them is passed onto Wu and the rest of the Northern Zhili, giving them an inside look into Sun's government."

 QIE_xiao_yaonan: "Xiao Yaonan"
 QIE_xiao_yaonan_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an impoverished family of the rural gentry, Xiao was forced to turn away from his dreams of becoming an imperial official due to a lack of funds. Instead, he was selected by Zhang Zhidong to join his new Hubei Military Academy. Xiao graduated in 1909, and used connections to Cao Kun’s family to stay adrift in the turmoil of the Xinhai revolution, then using them to become governor of Hubei. He consolidated his rule over the province, and helped organise the ‘Hubei Generals’, an informal group of textile manufacturers, the main industry of Hubei. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 1926 carried out by enemies of Cao Kun, and was drawn further and further into the Zhili sphere during and after the German intervention. He still maintains his hold over Hubei, modernising the province while still working with Beijing.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHis connections within the 'Hubei Generals' give him a large amount of clout within Beijing, as Hubei is one of the few provinces that are industrially profitable."

 QIE_li_bingzhi: "Li Bingzhi"
 QIE_li_bingzhi_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nZhengding, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLi Bingzhi had a relatively normal military career for the period, attending and graduating from the Baoding academy in 1908. There became acquainted with several future Zhili Clique members, and following the unrest in 1917 and 1918 he joined Wu Peifu’s circle as a chief of staff to Wu's ally Zhang Fulai. Rising quickly through the ranks, Li is seen as a competent officer.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHas well-known monarchist leanings, which alienated him from many former 'Republican' Zhili generals."

 QIE_aisin_gioro_xiqia: "Aisin-Gioro Xiqia"
 QIE_aisin_gioro_xiqia_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 18th, 1883\nFengtian, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA distant cousin of Puyi, Aisin-Gioro Xiqia was educated in Japan and served the Fengtian clique before the Restoration in 1927. Deserting with his mainly Manchu Kirin Provincial Army, he joined the Qing empire. One of the few Manchu generals to command large numbers of soldiers directly, he has an uneasy relationship with Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique, and is largely loyal to the Zongshe party.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nOne of the more traditionalist members of the Zongshe Party."

 QIE_cao_shijie: "Cao Shijie"
 QIE_cao_shijie_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nTianjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nNephew to Cao Kun, Cao Shijie grew up in one of the most prominent and well-connected families in China. These ties helped him gain entrance to the Baoding military academy, and was selected to lead an elite group of troops picked out by Yuan Shikai. Following the 1917 uprising, Cao Shijie joined the Zhili Clique, and served as president of his uncle’s Presidential Guard after he bribed his way to the presidency in 1923. The scandal surrounding the Beijing Coup of 1924 pushed Shijie out of power, but in recent years he has regained prominence among Zhili generals.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nLike his uncle, he turned to heavy drinking following the shame associated with the Beijing Coup."

 QIE_zhang_shaozeng: "Zhang Shaozeng"
 QIE_zhang_shaozeng_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 9th, 1879\nDacheng, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1899 to learn artillery tactics and strategy, and after returning to China, he joined Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Army. In 1906 he was transferred to Fengtian Province, during which he secretly joined the Tongmenghui. In the 1911 revolution, he did not obey orders to suppress the rebellion, and instead pushed for a constitutional monarchy. After the revolution, he was appointed by Yuan Shikai as Governor of Suiyuan. In 1917, he participated in the activities of Duan Qirui against Zhang Xun. In 1920, he joined the Zhili Clique because he was a relative with Wu Peifu and Feng Yuxiang, and his close personal friendship with Cao Kun. He served in a variety of ministerial positions throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, and narrowly dodged an assassination attempt in 1928 ordered by Zhang Zuolin.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe is good at acupuncture and likes to practice martial arts.\nHe is well-known as an eccentric and strange figure. Frequently, he has been heard to mutter 'I am a reincarnation of a Buddha. Most people are the reincarnation of my subordinates. But there are also some demons in this world, I hope that the gods can give me an axe, which I will use to destroy the demons.'"

 QIE_du_xijun: "Du Xijun"
 QIE_du_xijun_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nHejian, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nDu was one of many Chinese students sent abroad to study Japanese military tactics as part of the Qing Dynasty's attempted modernising reforms prior to the revolution. Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organising the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei Province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilising the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."

 QIE_wang_lingyun: "Wang Lingyun"
 QIE_wang_lingyun_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 27th, 1899\nLuoyang, Henan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWang Lingyun joined Wu Peifu’s engineer battalion in 1920, however not long after that he enrolled in the Yiyang academy. After his graduation in 1924, he joined the Zhensong Army led by Liu Zhenhua. During the Northern Expedition, the Zhensong Army aligned with Zhili Clique and fought against NRA, subsequently participating in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War. For his outstanding performance Wang was integrated into Zhili Clique and entered Wu Peifu's personal circle, serving as an advisor for engineering and fortification matters. Following the reforms enacted by Wu and other senior Zhili generals, he was promoted to Brigadier General, the youngest ever in the Imperial Army. Skilled in fortification and defensive tactics, he has supported Jiang Baili's Plan to defend China from Japanese invasion."

 QIE_guo_jijiao_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 15th, 1902\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter Guo Jiyu’s primary school graduation, he was admitted to the county’s middle school, but he eventually had to stop because of his brother’s high school fees and instead transferred to the Beijing Military Academy. In 1917, Guo Jiyu entered the Qinghe Army's First Preparatory Officer School. Two years later, he was assigned to the First Division of the Frontier Defence Artillery Corps and the Northwest Frontier Defence Second Mixed Brigade. In 1921, Guo transferred to the Baoding Army Military Academy, and graduated with full honours in 1923. There, he became involved with the Zhili Clique, though his young aged prevented rapid promotion. He became allies with Liu Menggeng during this period as well, and with Liu being chosen to spearhead his national defence plan, Guo was promoted to full General status.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA secretary once told a visiting author an anecdote about Guo's hectic work ethic: '... (At his table) there are four or five telephones as well as telegrams and official documents. Guo went to work every morning at 8:00 A.M., retired in the afternoon to go home to eat two meals, then returned, and worked furiously until 11:00 in the evening, holding a telephone in one hand to listen to battlefield reports, while holding a pen in other. Documents he approved are thrown onto the ground, where a junior officer respectfully picks them up and sends them off.'"

In 1921, he joined the Fengtian Clique and served as the head of the 39th Regiment, switching over to teaching in 1923, when he served as the instructor of the Northeast Army, and later served as the chief of staff of the 27th Division of the Northeast Army, as well as a variety of other commands throughout the early 1920s. In May 1926, however, he deserted the Fengtian and joined Wu Peifu’s Zhili Clique. A capable officer, Wei ingratiated himself with Liu Menggeng in the early 1930s, and when his defence plan was selected for China Wei was promoted to full General rank."

He graduated from the Nanjing Jiangnan Naval Academy in 1902, before going on to further education in the United Kingdom. This was followed by a career in the modernising Qing navy, where Du served on and captained some of the largest ships under Chinese control. During the Wuchang uprising, he deserted the Qing Empire, and aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. During the Zhili-dominated government of 1923/1924 he served as Minister of the Navy. During the KMT’s Northern Expedition a large number of his sailors nearly convinced him to desert, but the presence of German warships kept him in line, and he supported the German Navy in their coastal bombardment missions. Restored to his position of Minister of the Navy, Du has little time left for active ship command.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHad an extensive opium and drinking habit in his youth. Though he largely recovered, the upheaval of the 1920s has pushed him back into heavy drinking."

He held a variety of teaching positions at the Baoding military academy throughout the 1910s, including as a teacher of both French and English. Here, he became acquainted with many future Zhili Clique generals. Quickly promoted through the ranks, Wu stayed largely isolated from many of the political turmoils that ensnared fellow naval officers, and has a reputation of being somewhat ‘apolitical’ - or the closest to apolitical one can get in this period in Chinese history. A competent officer, Wu has served with distinction throughout the 1920s and 1930s."

 QIE_sa_zhenbing_admiral_desc: "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 30th, 1859\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nBorn into a family of Qarluk descent, Sa attended the Fuzhou Naval Academy, graduating 1872. After this, he attended the Royal Naval College in the United Kingdom, where he came face to face with modern naval innovations. Returning home, he participated in the Sino-Japanese war, where as the youngest commander in the Qing Navy he was forced to surrender to the Japanese after the Battle of Weihawei after all his commanding officers committed suicide. Leading the naval reforms after the peace treaty was signed, Sa was largely oblivious to the larger political maelstrom brewing in China. During the Wuchang uprising he faced a full-scale mutiny, and retired to Shanghai rather than either fire on his own men, or betray his country. He briefly served as Acting Premier in 1920, before taking the largely ceremonial position of the Governor of Fujian in 1922, where he essentially planned to retire. Here, he became acquainted with the Zhili Clique and began to advise Wu and other, junior members of the Navy on modernising the ageing fleet. Following the Qing Restoration in 1927, Sa formally re-joined naval high command to help spearhead the adoption of new German tactics and ships."

 QIE_aisin_gioro_zaixun_admiral_desc: "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 20th, 1885\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nZaixun was adopted into the lineage of his relative, Yizhi (1827–1850), because Yizhi had no son to succeed him. In 1887, he was made a buru bafen fuguo gong, and was subsequently promoted to feng'en fuguo gong in 1889 and feng'en zhenguo gong in 1890. In 1900, Zaixun's predecessor, Zaiyi, who succeeded Yizhi as 'Prince Rui of the Second Rank' (later renamed to 'Prince Duan of the Second Rank'), was stripped off his title of nobility and exiled to Xinjiang for his role in the Boxer Rebellion. Two years later, Zaixun succeeded Zaiyi as a beile of the Prince Rui peerage. In 1908, he was made an acting junwang (Prince of the Second Rank) but remained nominally a beile. In 1909, Zaixun was appointed as an acting Navy Minister in the Imperial Cabinet headed by Prince Qing. Later, he was sent to Europe and the United States to study the navies of the Western powers. After returning to China, in 1911, he became a full Navy Minister. Following Puyi's autocoup, he has come out of retirement to serve again as Navy minister. Despite never holding a battle command in his life he has been granted an admiralship. It is yet to be seen if he can competently command a warship in battle."

 QIE_ling_bin: "Ling Bin"
 QIE_ling_bin_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 17th, 1910\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an upper-middle class merchant family, Ling grew up in the most cutting-edge academic circles in Beijing, with his parents being members of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, the predecessor of the NCERA. Only 17 during Puyi's restoration, the corruption and scandal that plagued the new empire greatly dismayed the impressionable young man, and on the suggestion of a friend he attended clandestine meetings of the Young China Party. From those meetings he attended the Baoding military academy, where he quickly stood out as both politically and militarily shrewd. Along with Fang Zhejian he assembled a group of young cadets dedicated to reforming the Empire. Interestingly, Ling was not a rabid anti-monarchist, and quickly appreciated how Wu Peifu and the Zhili had manipulated Puyi to serve as a legitimising symbol of the regime."

 QIE_fang_zhijian: "Fang Zhijian"
 QIE_fang_zhijian_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 1st, 1909\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nHailing from a poor peasant family, Fang's teachers in the village school noticed the young boy excelled in all of his lessons. Cobbling together a small sum of money, they sent the young boy to the local provincial secondary school. Unfortunately for Fang, warlord soldiers arrived in the provincial capital and burned the school, nearly killing Fang. The young man was left with a scar running down his leg and a burning hatred for warlords and the chaos they inflicted on the poor of China. After taking the entrance exams to Baoding Military Academy, he joined the Young China Party branch at the campus, though his sympathies lay more with the NCERA. He led one of the squads that arrested and executed senior Zhili leadership during the coup, and the command experience he picked up there made him stand out so much to Li Bingzhi that he promoted the young man on the spot."

### Focuses ###
 QIE_manchu: "Qing Manchu Focus Tree"
 QIE_zhili: "Qing Zhili Focus Tree"

 QIE_yearofrat: "Year of the Rat"
 QIE_yearofrat_desc: "As the nation prepares to begin celebrating Chinese New Year on January 24th, Assembly President Cao Kun and Wu Peifu have begun drafting a speech to mark the fourth year of concerted anti-trade debt efforts. The largest issue currently facing the central government, the Zhili Clique hopes to tackle this problem even as whispers of unrest emerge from the League of Eight Provinces."

 QIE_taxes1: "New Taxes"
 QIE_taxes1_desc: "Tax collection in the warlord era ranged from semi-organised to completely ad-hoc. Even though most people will resent the new taxes, enacting them through an established legislative body will hopefully mitigate some the unpopularity, as a tax-man is better than a horde of rapacious soldiers."

 QIE_subsistancefarming1: "Encourage Export Farming"
 QIE_subsistancefarming1_desc: "We do not have the industrial base required to enact large-scale industrial reform. What we do not lack, however, is a large number of peasant farmers. By carefully granting out subsidies to farmers, we can start to nurture a food-export system that can alleviate our trade debt."

 QIE_emergencysession: "Emergency Meeting of Senior Zhili Members"
 QIE_emergencysession_desc: "The unrest in the south has exploded into full-blown chaos. Rioting and looting are widespread, and civil authority has broken down. Wu Peifu must call a meeting of the senior Zhili generals and bureaucrats, in order to properly respond to this developing situation."

 QIE_capitalize_politics: "New Elections"
 QIE_capitalize_politics_desc: "Previous elections have seen the Harmony Association win by razor-thin margins. With our recent anti-concession turn, however, we can exploit our newfound popularity to bolster the legitimacy of our regime."

 QIE_meetwithassembly: "Meet with Assembly Parties"
 QIE_meetwithassembly_desc: "The dissent generated by our decision to remain loyal to the Germans has not reached down to the lower classes yet. By meeting with leaders from the major parties in the Assembly, we can placate them and ensure that they at least pretend to support our regime."

 QIE_futureofzhili: "Future of the Zhili Clique"
 QIE_futureofzhili_desc: "The upheaval of the last few months has shown that the Zhili Clique must reform itself if it is to survive the next few years, let alone the next few decades. We need to create a (reasonably) meritocratic promotion system in our military, and eliminate some of the most egregious corruption from our government, or we too will fade into obscurity."

 QIE_default_debt: "Default on Debt"
 QIE_default_debt_desc: "All other options have failed. The withdraw of German financial support means a full-scale international default on our debt is the only option to solve our financial crisis. It will certainly harm us in the short-term, but with any luck this will pay off in the long term."

 QIE_nationalize_germans: "Nationalise German Industry"
 QIE_nationalize_germans_desc: "A great deal of companies were wholly or partly owned by German financial concerns prior to their withdrawal of financial support for our regime. We can move in and nationalise these industries, helping our domestic production. Germany, crippled by Black Monday, cannot retaliate beyond some angry telegrams."

 QIE_locallogistics: "Local Logistics"
 QIE_locallogistics_desc: "Germany had promised to supply us with trucks and other logistical equipment for our future conflict with Japan. With their military mission's withdrawal, however, we need to turn to more traditional logistical methods to supply our army. In the end, this might be good news for us, as the infrastructure of our country cannot really support large amounts of motorised vehicles anyway."

 QIE_buyforeignguns: "Purchase Foreign Arms"
 QIE_buyforeignguns_desc: "Our anti-concession stance prevents us from dealing with the countries that have carved out pieces of our nation, but there are many countries in the world that have more or less respected our territorial integrity. Scandinavia, Bohemia, and others have military equipment that could be useful to our nation."

 QIE_siciliyships: "Commission Ships from Sicily"
 QIE_siciliyships_desc: "Although the Kingdom of Italy participated in the suppression of the Boxer movement, the Two Sicilies did not, and their dockyards are some of the largest in the world. Our navy will never be able to stand up to Japan's in a head-to-head showdown, but escorts for coastal defence and submarines for light raiding could help us in our upcoming conflicts."

 QIE_stealplanedesigns: "'Acquire' Foreign Airplane Designs"
 QIE_stealplanedesigns_desc: "We lack designs for domestic aircraft production, and promises of German designs never came to fruition for obvious reasons. Some of the more salacious Zhili generals have suggested sending infiltrators to the airfields of the Legation Cities with the hopes of finding schematics in the repair hangers there. It's an audacious plan, but we don't have many other options."

 QIE_chinesenavalacademy: "Create a Zhili Naval Academy"
 QIE_chinesenavalacademy_desc: "Many of our junior naval staff received training from the German naval academy, and their loyalty to our clique remains unclear at best. We need to divert funds to create our own naval academy, where promising cadets can be trained to be both skilled tacticians and loyal to our government."

 QIE_expatairtraining: "Expat Air Training Scheme"
 QIE_expatairtraining_desc: "While a fledgling domestic air training industry exists, it may be more prudent to hire some of the various exiles and expatriates that wash up in the Legations to train our pilots. They may need to sober up before teaching any of our cadets to fly, but crashing is part of the training process too, right?"

 QIE_supportcompanies: "Develop Zhili Engineer Corps"
 QIE_supportcompanies_desc: "China's rugged terrain necessitates any military force having a strong engineering corps to support it. Unfortunately, the ad-hoc and amateur quality of many of our divisions prevents engineering support from being truly effective. We must develop our own military engineering schools, in order to ensure our troops have adequate support."

 QIE_reorganise_divisions: "Re-Organise Warlord Divisions"
 QIE_reorganise_divisions_desc: "Any warlord worth anything has his own personal militia to control the territory he rules. Unfortunately, these troops vary wildly in quality from semi-professional troops to mobs more used to robbing and burning the villages they theoretically protect. By devoting considerable resources to standardising and modernising these divisions, we can turn them into valuable assets on the battlefield."

 QIE_zhili_flood_dams: "Prepare to Breach Dams"
 QIE_zhili_flood_dams_desc: "A shocking plan has been developed by senior Zhili strategists - the breaching of major dams along the Yellow River. This would cause widespread flooding, and halt any enemy advances. The civilian casualties and economic cost, however, would be immense."

 QIE_studywars: "Old Methods, New Designs"
 QIE_studywars_desc: "While generals in Europe experiment with 'armoured warfare' and other cutting-edge ideas, our strategists have learned one lesson from the last decade of internecine warfare - artillery is king. By modernising our artillery stockpiles, we can ensure they go into battle with the best fire support available."

 QIE_work_with_manchu: "Work with Manchu Generals"
 QIE_work_with_manchu_desc: "While some of the younger Manchu generals are little more than jumped-up noblemen, the old guard like Aisin-Gioro Xiqia can impart valuable lessons on cavalry tactics to the Zhili. At the same time, Zhili generals can teach these new noble officers the skills they learned over the last few decades of strife and warfare."

 QIE_expand_peking_uni: "Expand Peking University"
 QIE_expand_peking_uni_desc: "Peking (Beijing) University has a large focus on literature, art, and culture. While important, these things do not win wars. We can divert funding to Peking University with the purpose of building new research and development labs for computer, radio, and chemical advancement, all of which will help our military."

 QIE_zhili_mercs: "Hire Foreign Advisors"
 QIE_zhili_mercs_desc: "Our anti-concession stance keeps us from taking military aid from most European governments, but individual, independent advisors are fair game. The turmoil and conflict of the last twenty years has generated no shortage of men willing to sell their talents and advice to the highest bidder."

 QIE_jiangbailiplan: "Jiang Baili's Plan"
 QIE_jiangbailiplan_desc: "General Jiang Baili's plan is focused on static fortifications, defensive tactics, and preparing for Japanese naval invasions at the coast. While some have criticised him for stealing ideas from his subordinates, this is still a solid plan to defend our country."

 QIE_hubeigenerals: "Court Hubei Generals"
 QIE_hubeigenerals_desc: "The 'Hubei Generals' are an informal association of the leading manufacturers and industrialists in Hubei Province. Jiang Baili's close family friend, General Xiao Yaonan, is governor of the province, and has graciously volunteered to use his industrial contacts for the construction of many of the fortifications required for Jiang's plan."

 QIE_gongxianarsenal: "Expand Gongxian Arsenal"
 QIE_gongxianarsenal_desc: "The Gongxian Arsenal has normally played second fiddle to the much larger Hanyang weapons foundry. By expanding its manufacturing capabilities, we can sufficiently spread out our industrial base in case one arsenal falls into the hands of invaders."

 QIE_modern_contracts: "Modernise Armament Contracts"
 QIE_modern_contracts_desc: "Previously, contracts for the production of weapons were handed out on an ad-hoc basis, rife with corruption. By exerting considerable political willpower, we can modernise and clean up these systems, bringing our arms industry up to western standards."

 QIE_fallout_of_northwest_conflict: "Fallout of the Northwest Conflict"
 QIE_fallout_of_northwest_conflict_desc: "While not as important as the coastal areas in our upcoming struggle, the interior of China still contains valuable riches that we must secure for our upcoming conflict. The Northwest Conflict has concluded, and we should start looking to make the best of its aftermath."

 QIE_destroy_isolated_warlords: "Destroy Isolated Warlords"
 QIE_destroy_isolated_warlords_desc: "While we are mainly focusing on building up a defensive capability against Fengtian and Japan, there are also numerous small, isolated warlords around us without much protection. We should destroy these scattered groups and integrate their territory directly into ours."

 QIE_rebuild_alliance: "Rebuild Zhili Coalition"
 QIE_rebuild_alliance_desc: "Before the League Collapse, we were the undisputed masters of China. Many of our former allies have not completely deserted us, and we should reach out to them to build a strong bulwark against Japanese and Fengtian encroachment."

 QIE_jinghanRR: "Improve the Jinghan Railroad"
 QIE_jinghanRR_desc: "The Jinghan Railway links all the major industrial and agricultural heartlands of our state. We should upgrade its capacity, in order to more efficiently move soldiers and war matériel."

 QIE_liumenggengplan: "Liu Menggeng's Plan"
 QIE_liumenggengplan_desc: "General Liu Menggeng's plan focuses on improving logistics and support networks for our troops, so they can be better able to fight. The trade off for this, however, is less industrial capacity dedicated to building defensive fortifications."

 QIE_expandmines: "Reorganise the Kailuan Mining Bureau"
 QIE_expandmines_desc: "The Kailuan Mining Bureau was founded in 1878 as a joint venture between the Qing government and a variety of British business interests. Largely destroyed during the fighting of the warlord era, we must rebuild and reorganise the mines to fuel our war efforts."

 QIE_develop_tangshan_steel_decision: "Rebuild [614.GetName] Mines"
 QIE_develop_tangshan_steel_decision_desc: "Largely destroyed during the fighting of the warlord era, we must rebuild and reorganise the Kailuan Mining Bureau mines to fuel our war efforts."

 QIE_develop_hebei_steel_decision: "Rebuild [1060.GetName] Mines"
 QIE_develop_hebei_steel_decision_desc: "Largely destroyed during the fighting of the warlord era, we must rebuild and reorganise the Kailuan Mining Bureau mines to fuel our war efforts."

 QIE_devscheme: "Daye-Hanyang Development Scheme"
 QIE_devscheme_desc: "The Daye-Hanyang corridor houses the majority of our industrial capacity outside of Beijing, yet the infrastructure and urban planning in the region leaves much to be desired. By investing into clearing new land for factories, and building additional civilian industry to support military arsenals, we can modernise the region."

 QIE_shanxicoal: "Expand Shanxi Coal Fields"
 QIE_shanxicoal_desc: "Seized from Yan Xishan at the end of the last Zhifeng war, the coal fields of Shanxi are some of the most prosperous in China. We should invest in these coal fields, in order to fuel our growing industry. This may provoke Yan though, so we must tread with caution."

 QIE_baodingarsenal: "Expand Baoding Arsenal"
 QIE_baodingarsenal_desc: "The Baoding Arsenal, attached to the military academy, is somewhat less developed than the Gongxian foundry. Yet with enough investments, we can turn it into one of China's main military manufacturers. Its proximity to the Academy is also a plus, as it allows us to test new equipment designs both practically and theoretically."

 QIE_warofnationalresistance: "War of National Resistance"
 QIE_warofnationalresistance_desc: "At last, the moment has come. Japanese troops, seeking to turn our great nation into little more than a resource extraction colony, have invaded. Any lingering doubts about the legitimacy of our government have been put to rest as we unite to destroy the invaders!"

 QIE_looseends: "Tying up Loose Ends"
 QIE_looseends_desc: "We have triumphed over the Japanese menace! Now all that remains is to secure the territory we claim outside of the heartland of China. Mongolia, Tibet, and other far-flung provinces must be brought to heel!"

 QIE_endconcessions: "Eradicate the Concessions"
 QIE_endconcessions_desc: "The concessions, long a stain on Chinese sovereignty, have remained in existence for too long! Macau, the Legation Cities, and the remnants of German colonialism must be brought under our direct control, either through negotiation or direct action!"

 QIE_unitedchina: "China, United!"
 QIE_unitedchina_desc: "At last - the dream of a united China has been fulfilled! The century of humiliation has been reversed, and now we must chart our path forward into this brave new world."

 QIE_salvage_german_industry: "Salvage German Designs"
 QIE_salvage_german_industry_desc: "In their haste to flee back to their concessions, the Peking-Kommission and German investors left large amounts of industrial machinery behind. We should salvage these designs, and attempt to retro-engineer them for our own purposes."

 QIE_leverage_new_pop: "Attract Anti-Concession Intellectuals"
 QIE_leverage_new_pop_desc: "Our intervention in favour of Governor Chen has bolstered the legitimacy of our government by margins previously thought impossible for a 'warlord government'. By recruiting former NCERA intellectuals into our government, we can further legitimise our regime."

 QIE_on_our_own: "On Our Own"
 QIE_on_our_own_desc: "Our decision to take an anti-concession stance has robbed us of German military support. No matter! We shall turn to our other resources and the will of the people to defend ourselves."

 QIE_hire_republican_officers: "Hire Former Republican Officers"
 QIE_hire_republican_officers_desc: "Many former Republican officers and NCOs were disgusted by our support of the Qing restoration. With the Qing dynasty overthrown and our new anti-concessionist stance, however, we may be able to recruit them back into our military, bringing with them their considerable experience."

 QIE_open_up_to_investment: "Simplify International Investment Laws"
 QIE_open_up_to_investment_desc: "Despite German influence, our international investment laws remain a byzantine web of red tape, restrictions, and loopholes. By simplifying these laws, we can attract additional international investment to build up our industry and military."

 QIE_harmonious_balance: "Harmonious Balance"
 QIE_harmonious_balance_desc: "Few thought it possible, but we have managed to build a delicate balance between intellectuals, Manchu nobles, the Zhili Clique, and the Emperor himself. The common person now regards our government as a legitimate entity, and is willing to support it, at least most of the time."

 QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation: "Encourage Baoding-Zhili Cooperation"
 QIE_baoding_zhili_cooperation_desc: "The cadets at the Boading Military Academy, most of which joined the YCP, long resented the continued influence of Germany and other foreign powers over our government. With our new anti-concession stance, however, they have started to support our regime. By drawing them into the Zhili command structure, we can ensure their loyalty for years to come."

 QIE_guardian_of_emperor: "Spread Pro-Imperial Propaganda"
 QIE_guardian_of_emperor_desc: "Many in the Zongshe Party have long accused the Zhili Clique of sidelining Puyi. By spreading propaganda promoting the Emperor to our troops, however, we can both increase their fervour to fight and placate the royalist nobles."

 QIE_lesson_of_intervention: "Lessons of the Intervention"
 QIE_lesson_of_intervention_desc: "The intervention in the League collapse has taught us many valuable lessons about modern warfare. We should put these to use before we deal with any larger conflicts."

 QIE_lesson_of_coup: "Lessons of the Coup Attempt"
 QIE_lesson_of_coup_desc: "The traitorous Zongshe attempt to overthrow the Zhili Clique has failed, but it revealed worrying problems with our internal security systems. We must rebuild our domestic intelligence apparatus, and ensure it can prevent future insurrections."

 QIE_placateassembly: "Placate the Assembly"
 QIE_placateassembly_desc: "Our decisions to deepen ties with Germany generated some unrest, but more importantly it drove a wedge between us and the opposition in the National Assembly. They have no real power, but having a loud opposition certainly won't help us in the long run. We need to placate these groups through whatever means necessary to ensure their loyalty."

 QIE_future_relationship: "Future Relationships"
 QIE_future_relationship_desc: "The defeat of Japan and the Fengtian Government raises new questions for us on the international stage. Should we draw closer to Germany, or instead turn inwards and focus on developing our nation?"

 QIE_request_german_bailout: "Request German Bailout"
 QIE_request_german_bailout_desc: "Our continued international trade debt continues to prevent us from making any meaningful industrial progress as a nation. While it may enrage die-hard nationalists, asking Germany for an international bailout will solve the problem of our debt and allow us to modernise."

 QIE_germanarsenal: "Loyalty has its Own Rewards..."
 QIE_germanarsenal_desc: "German weapons and technology has its own set of benefits, despite the drawbacks associated with closer ties to Germany. Panzers, aircraft and more lie at our disposal, provided we are able to give concessions to the Peking-Kommission, of course."

 QIE_germandesigns: "Purchase German Production Licenses"
 QIE_germandesigns_desc: "German weapon designs won them the Weltkrieg, and we have a long history of using German designs in domestic Chinese arsenals. We should try and purchase licences to build the newest German designs and give us an edge on our enemies."

 QIE_germanradio: "Study German Support Company Doctrine"
 QIE_germanradio_desc: "German divisions are innovative in incorporating the newest radios, engineering equipment and other support equipment. We should study their doctrine and seek to emulate it with our own military units."

 QIE_kriegsmarine: "Purchase Surplus German Ships"
 QIE_kriegsmarine_desc: "The German navy underwent a rapid expansion and modernisation program after the Weltkrieg, and a huge number of German ships currently sit in mothball doing nothing. We should reach out to Germany and inquire about purchasing these old ships for our own use."

 QIE_luftwaffe: "License Luftstreitkräfte Airplanes"
 QIE_luftwaffe_desc: "While they might be hesitant to sell us their newest designs, Germany needs to keep Japan at bay. What better way of doing that then giving some of their planes to us?"

 QIE_motorized_armor: "Import Panzers and Trucks"
 QIE_motorized_armor_desc: "German Panzers and trucks are some of the most feared fighting machines in the world, and some of our younger officers are enthusiastic about their combat potential. We should see about licensing some from German factories and using them in our battles against the Japanese."

 QIE_buymauser: "Import German Small Arms"
 QIE_buymauser_desc: "German small arms designs are some of the most cutting-edge in the world. We should seek to directly import some to better equip our soldiers."

 QIE_germanattache: "German Attaché"
 QIE_germanattache_desc: "While German weapons are welcome, what we really need are German soldiers to help train our troops. The Peking-Kommission has just informed us that a crack group of elite German soldiers can be dispatched from Berlin, as soon as we divert some funding their way."

 QIE_seek_german_civ_investments: "Partner with German Manufacturing Firms"
 QIE_seek_german_civ_investments_desc: "German businesses frequently run into issues like unions and worker's rights at home. We can offer them land to build factories here and provide a workforce that will have no such complaints."

 QIE_grant_foreign_licenses: "Purchase German Tooling Equipment"
 QIE_grant_foreign_licenses_desc: "While we can build our own factories easily, what we really need is high-quality German tooling equipment. If acquired in enough numbers, we can jump-start our industry and allow it to quickly rise to a Western level."

 QIE_seek_german_RR_capital: "Hire German Rail Engineers"
 QIE_seek_german_RR_capital_desc: "Much of our rail network was constructed by European firms. While some might bristle at continuing to use them to build our railroads, they are the undisputed masters of the craft. We should seek out German railroad engineers and directly hire them to improve our infrastructure."

 QIE_krupp: "Import Krupp Steel"
 QIE_krupp_desc: "While most domestically produced steel is lacking in quality, Krupp is the international byword for quality. We should import large amounts of it to build our industrial network instead of relying on lower-quality domestic material."

 QIE_siemens: "Purchase Siemens Radios"
 QIE_siemens_desc: "Radios are a godsend in an enormous country like China, and ensuring our troops can coordinate their battle tactics is key. Siemens is the German king of radios, and we should import some to equip our troops."

 QIE_IGfarben: "Procure BASF Synthetic Formulas"
 QIE_IGfarben_desc: "China lacks much oil and rubber production, but with new German chemical formulas we can synthetically produce some."

 QIE_germanresearch: "University Exchange Program"
 QIE_germanresearch_desc: "The best way to learn is to experience other cultures. By sending some Chinese students to German universities, they can return home with the latest knowledge and information. One hopes the Germans students who study here will learn something of our culture, and take it home to share with their countrymen."

 QIE_debt_issue: "Solving the Debt Issue"
 QIE_debt_issue_desc: "The debt issue that plagued the empire still plagues our new republic. While we could ask Germany for help, that would most likely cause our already unstable regime to collapse under public pressure. Instead, let's default and take an anti-concession stance, providing our government with legitimacy. It's not like the Germans ever liked us much beyond Puyi..."

 QIE_restoration: "The Manchu Restoration"
 QIE_restoration_desc: "In an almost unthinkable turn of events, strategic blunders made by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu have destroyed their own regime, with some of their former allies betraying them alongside the Qing aristocracy. The future of the new regime is uncertain, to say the least..."

 QIE_wu_constitution: "A New Constitution"
 QIE_wu_constitution_desc: "With the Qing dynasty overthrown, we must now set about building a new constitution for our regime. While it will still be 'guided' by the Zhili, many are hopeful for the return of republican rule to Beijing."

 QIE_unrest: "Deal with Unrest"
 QIE_unrest_desc: "Our decision to stay neutral in the League collapse has pleased nobody and angered everyone. We need to quickly suppress unrest before the situation becomes untenable."

 QIE_president_hu: "Implement President Hu's Reforms"
 QIE_president_hu_desc: "President Hu is a world-renowned political philosopher, and his writings have inspired many. We should work to implement some of his more practical thoughts, in order to better bolster the functioning of our new government."

 QIE_president_koo: "Implement President Koo's Reforms"
 QIE_president_koo_desc: "President Koo is a grey eminence, one of the world's most paramount diplomatic minds. We should put his expertise to work building international legitimacy for our regime and seeking new trade deals."

 QIE_pragmatism: "Pragmatism"
 QIE_pragmatism_desc: "Pragmatism, the philosophy espoused by Hu Shih, encourages cooperation with potentially unsavoury elements of the political environment in order to bring about the most productive changes. We should apply this theory to the workings of our government to better legitimise the 'warlord' elements of our government."

 QIE_diplomacy: "Diplomatic Genius"
 QIE_diplomacy_desc: "Wellington Koo served our nation as ambassador to both the United States and the Copenhagen Conference. We should ensure his diplomatic ideals are transferred down to a new foreign service that can create international trade deals with the nations of the world."

 QIE_eradicate_manchu: "Eradicate Manchu Loyalist Remnants"
 QIE_eradicate_manchu_desc: "While we may have destroyed the largest concentration of Manchu nobles, some fled Beijing and are hiding outside the city. We must send police to arrest these traitors, and confiscate their wealth and use it for the benefit of the Republic."

 QIE_elimiate_baoding: "Destroy Baoding Cliques"
 QIE_elimiate_baoding_desc: "The treacherous Baoding cadets that planned the failed coup attempt must be suppressed through any means necessary, in order to safeguard the future of our young republic."

 QIE_deligitimize_oppo: "Delegitimise Opposition Parties"
 QIE_deligitimize_oppo_desc: "While the Assembly was a powerless body, it still forced us to pay lip service to the whims of nobles and out of touch urban elites. We should de-legitimise these aristocratic groups, and instead focus on the true needs of the people of our great republic."

 QIE_placate_intellectuals: "Placate Intellectuals"
 QIE_placate_intellectuals_desc: "The NCERA holds a great degree of popularity among the intellectuals of Beijing. With our new anti-concession stance, however, we can try and integrate them into the republican government, unifying them behind our new ideology."

 QIE_rebuild_arsenals: "Rebuild Arsenals"
 QIE_rebuild_arsenals_desc: "Fighting outside the Baoding Military Academy in the wake of the coup attempt left the arsenal damaged. We should rip out the destroyed parts of the foundry and put in new machinery instead, upgrading our production capacity."

 QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind: "Rebuild Civilian Industry"
 QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind_desc: "The riots and violence that engulfed Beijing destroyed large parts of the city, including some industry. We should clear the rubble and build larger, more advanced factories on top of the ruins."

 QIE_stable_republic: "The Republic Triumphant"
 QIE_stable_republic_desc: "The Zhili Clique has repeated its triumph of 1927, defeating all other 'republican' governments in China. Without Germany to impose a puppet emperor on us, we can truly begin to foster democracy in China. Long live the Republic!"

 QIE_purge_zhili: "Secure the North China Plain"
 QIE_purge_zhili_desc: "While the forces loyal to the coup control Beijing and the areas surrounding the Baoding Military Academy, the rest of our territory remains under the control of traitorous Zhili warlords. We need to first secure the northern frontier, eliminating the Zhili garrisons there before turning our eyes south."

 QIE_coup_backer: "Our New Benefactor"
 QIE_coup_backer_desc: "The coup that destroyed the Zhili Clique was not accomplished alone. Like it or not, in order to reclaim our country from the despotic warlords we had to cut a deal with local powers in the region. Now we must invite them to Beijing and see what they want in exchange for their support."

 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer: "Zhang Tianran"
 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer_desc: "The Honoured Master of the Yiguandao sect, Zhang Tianran commands an enormous amount of clout among the followers of his religion. His desired position in our government is unclear, but it appears that he is willing to lend us the support of the Yiguandao in return for unknown concessions..."

 QIE_qu_yingguang_backer: "Qu Yingguang"
 QIE_qu_yingguang_backer_desc: "The governor of Shandong, Qu Yingguang has long been a respectful religious man. While he wants to see the monarchy modernised, he also emphasises tradition and maintaining continuity with our past."

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer: "Yan Xishan"
 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_desc: "Governor Yan Xishan was an unexpected ally in our coup. Previously an anti-monarchist, his shrewd political mind realised that the Emperor is now a powerful political tool. He primarily desires to work with the existing establishment parties in modernising China and spreading his personalised ideology - a nebulous political philosophy that encompasses traditionalism, liberalism, nationalism, and syndicalism."

 QIE_yiguandao: "Invite Yiguandao Influences"
 QIE_yiguandao_desc: "With his new position in our government, Zhang Tianran has begun to expand the Yiguandao's power and influence within our country. While this has bolstered our legitimacy and popularity among followers of the faith, it is not clear who they are more loyal to - our government or Zhang's faith."

 QIE_gather_dynasties: "Gather the Dynasties"
 QIE_gather_dynasties_desc: "A major part of our benefactor's reform plans involve gathering the former ruling dynasties of China together to legitimise Puyi's rule. He has begun to send out invitations, and over the next few weeks the royals will arrive in Beijing."

 QIE_ceremonial_rites: "Restore the Ceremonial Rites"
 QIE_ceremonial_rites_desc: "During the Zhili regime, the Emperor's ceremonial rituals were largely sidelined and ignored. Court officials have proposed reintroducing these rites to the forefront of the Imperial Government, instilling patriotic fervour in the population."

 QIE_bolster_legitimacy: "Bolster Imperial Government"
 QIE_bolster_legitimacy_desc: "During the decade-long Zhili regime few thought the Emperor was any more than a puppet locked away in the Forbidden City. Now, however, with the backing of a new constitutional system and the Yiguandao faith, people are starting to see the Emperor as an important figure unifying the government in it's struggle to restore order."

 QIE_legitimate_emperor: "The Legitimate Emperor"
 QIE_legitimate_emperor_desc: "Our efforts have been successful. Puyi is now regarded as the legitimate ruler of China by every peasant and farmer! Zhang Tianran, having consolidated power in Shandong, has declared the province is to be fully integrated into our nation."

 QIE_modernize_monarchy: "Modernise the Monarchy"
 QIE_modernize_monarchy_desc: "While the Governor of Shandong is a Qing loyalist, he also realises the position of the Emperor needs to change to suit modern notions of government. He plans to push the Emperor to act more like a Western-style constitutional monarch, serving as an apolitical uniting figure and potential mediator in case of severe conflict."

 QIE_reinforce_confucianism: "Reinforce Confucian Values"
 QIE_reinforce_confucianism_desc: "Despite the modernising front the Assembly has put up since the restoration, plans have been drawn up to reinforce traditional values through government-funded education programs and seminars. Primarily designed for young adults and uneducated peasants, mass education on the Confucian classics will bolster our regime's popularity."

 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka: "Revise The Chinese Tripitaka"
 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka_desc: "The Chinese Buddhist canon has long been subject to debate but under Master Qu’s leadership we will create a revised “Tripitaka”, or collection of texts, that emphasises the conservative and esoteric elements of the “Red Hat Sects”, especially the Kagyu School, as a political cornerstone of our new government. We will then promote these ideals both to our government officials, as well as to the Emperor himself, who has proven amenable to Red Hat teachings."

 QIE_move_industry: "Move Industry to the Interior"
 QIE_move_industry_desc: "With the threat of foreign invasion looming, our new benefactor has offered to use some of their soldiers to help move industry near the coasts inland. In the event of foreign naval invasion, this will ensure we are still able to supply our troops."

 QIE_train_civil_servants: "Train Civil Servants"
 QIE_train_civil_servants_desc: "The Zhili bureaucracy relied on nepotism, cronyism and endemic, widespread corruption. This left the civil administration of China sorely lacking, with most positions filled by unqualified individuals. Governor Qu has proposed implementing a modernised version of the old civil service exams, to ensure that these positions are filled with qualified men."

 QIE_prepare_coast: "Prepare the Coast"
 QIE_prepare_coast_desc: "Shandong Province suffered greatly under the warlord rule of Zhang Zongchang, and currently stands vulnerable to foreign invasion. Following our substantial administrative reforms Shandong is ready to submit to direct Imperial rule of the province, opening the region up to military and industrial development."

 QIE_end_shanxi_isolation: "End Shanxi's Isolation"
 QIE_end_shanxi_isolation_desc: "Shanxi Province, though rich in mineral wealth, is mountainous and isolated. If it is ever to be re-integrated into the larger national government, we need to invest in roads, rail lines, and other infrastructure projects to connect it with the rest of China."

 QIE_prepare_shanxi: "Prepare Shanxi for Refugees"
 QIE_prepare_shanxi_desc: "Governor Yan has signalled that in the event of a refugee crisis in the wake of a foreign invasion he is prepared to accept those fleeing the enemy armies in coastal regions. No doubt this will inevitably bolster the province's economy in the long run, but it also means Yan is ready to submit to full Imperial authority."

 QIE_replace_corrupt_govs: "Replace Corrupt Governors"
 QIE_replace_corrupt_govs_desc: "Following the success of the coup many in the Assembly have begun expressing disgust with many of the former mid-level Zhili administrators we left in positions of authority in the wake of the civil war. Outspoken members of the [QIE.GetRulingParty] have proposed firing all of these men, and replacing them with more qualified and loyal candidates."

 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot: "Nationalizing the Words of Yan Xishan"
 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot_desc: "Since his ascension to the Shanxi governorship, Yan has devoted enormous amounts of time to developing his personal ideology, an eclectic mix of federalism, Confucianism, Christianity, and even syndicalism. With his new position of national power, Yan has started to spread his ideas throughout China."

 QIE_vigor_modernization: "Vigorous Modernisation"
 QIE_vigor_modernization_desc: "Yan Xishan has long been a proponent of industrial modernisation, turning the backwater province of Shanxi into a small yet vibrant hub of mining and industry. Now with a position of national prominence, he has begun to urge those lessons of modernisation and industrialisation be applied at a national level."

 QIE_prepare_for_storm: "Prepare for the Storm"
 QIE_prepare_for_storm_desc: "Though we were initially sceptical of their influence, our benefactor has brought us an enormous number of benefits over the last few months. With his help, we are now more than ready to stand up to whatever threatens us."

 QIE_form_emergency_govt: "Form an Emergency Government"
 QIE_form_emergency_govt_desc: "Now that we have destroyed the remnants of the Zhili Clique, it is time for the Emperor to pick which of the three parties that formed the coalition will rule China."

 QIE_pick_NCERA: "Utilise the NCERA"
 QIE_pick_NCERA_desc: "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association, or NCERA for short, is a powerful party that controls the loyalty of both rural peasants and some urban intellectuals. Though less focused on industrial modernisation, their emphasis on helping the great mass of the population make them extremely popular."

 QIE_pick_YCP: "Utilise the YCP"
 QIE_pick_YCP_desc: "The Young China Party, or YCP, is made up of young Baoding Academy cadets, with some urban intellectuals providing the funding and organisation. Focused on centralising the country and urbanisation, they lack the broad popular appeal of the NCERA - though their modernising focus makes them a good choice for quick development."

 QIE_pick_MP: "Utilise the Zongshe"
 QIE_pick_MP_desc: "The Zongshe Party is, obviously, dominated by the Manchu nobility in Beijing. While this may appear an odd choice for a ruling party, over the last ten years the nobles used the relative freedom afforded to them by the Zhili to build up large industrial fortunes, investing in the few factories in Beijing not owned by German firms, giving them significant clout."

 QIE_rural_reform: "Institutionalise the Rural Reform Movement"
 QIE_rural_reform_desc: "The chaos and destruction of the Warlord Era left large swaths of rural China devastated and destroyed. The Rural Reconstruction Movement, half of the NCERA, has attempted to fix these problems independent of government support for the last few years. With proper funding, however, they can make a real difference in rebuilding China."

 QIE_ncera_industry: "Invest in Rural Industry"
 QIE_ncera_industry_desc: "While the little industry China has is currently concentrated in its cities, they are vulnerable to military attack and unrest. Instead, the NCERA has proposed spreading out industry to rural villages. This will encourage their growth and make our industry less vulnerable to foreign attack or incursion."

 QIE_kang_youwei: "The Legacy of Kang Youwei"
 QIE_kang_youwei_desc: "Kang Youwei was one of the founders of the NCERA, though he passed away soon after its inception in 1927. A brilliant scholar and legal reformer, Kang spent half a century arguing for a constitutional monarchy with an Emperor who truly looked out for his people. With the Zhili overthrown and the NCERA empowered, this dream is close to being a reality."

 QIE_rural_infrastructure: "Modernise Rural Infrastructure"
 QIE_rural_infrastructure_desc: "China's rural infrastructure is shockingly lacking, with some calling it the worst in the world after Africa. Concerted government investment must be made into improving rural transportation networks if we are ever going to lift China's peasantry out of poverty."

 QIE_benevolent_emperor: "A Benevolent Emperor"
 QIE_benevolent_emperor_desc: "While most in the West think the Emperor of China is some sort of despotic warlord straight out of the Middle Ages, we know that the Emperor is a benevolent and kind soul who wants the best for his subjects. Concerted propaganda efforts must be made to ensure that everyone sees our vision as the truth."

 QIE_rural_loyalty: "Rural Loyalty Ensured"
 QIE_rural_loyalty_desc: "The NCERA has completed its major rural reform plan and secured its hold on government. Even in areas of China we do not directly control, the people clamour out for our benevolent leadership! When our enemies enter our land they will not find the population easy to overcome as well - the peasantry are ready to lay down their lives to defend China!"

 QIE_reform_criminal_justice: "Reform the Criminal Justice System"
 QIE_reform_criminal_justice_desc: "Like many other areas of their government, the Zhili Clique blatantly ignored what little civil laws they bothered to write, preferring to rule via the might of their arms. Now, however, we have the opportunity to completely overhaul China's legal system and create a benevolent system that punishes the guilty while sparing the innocent."

 QIE_military_state: "Militarise the State"
 QIE_military_state_desc: "The Zhili Clique, while a military organisation, left large parts of the Qing military completely inefficient and underfunded. In order to rectify this problem, we have begun a whole-sale militarisation of the nation. Youth training leagues, a modernised conscription system, and other reforms will ensure we are ready to stand up to what ever enemy we face."

 QIE_centralize_state: "Centralise the State"
 QIE_centralize_state_desc: "The last two decades of internecine warlord conflict left China divided and decentralised. From our new position of power in Beijing we must now begin the long, arduous task of centralising this divided nation, for only then can its people enjoy true peace and prosperity."

 QIE_YCP_arsenals: "Modernise Arsenals"
 QIE_YCP_arsenals_desc: "The arsenals that are to supply are war machine are sorely out of date and underfunded. Concerted investment must be made into weapons and ammunition production if we are to stand any chance of victory over our foes."

 QIE_destroy_leftists: "Destroy Leftists"
 QIE_destroy_leftists_desc: "While there are few actual leftists within the territory we directly control, the recent KMT uprising to the south has sparked something of a 'Red Scare' within the elite. We can use this to our advantage, drumming up claims of 'socialist infiltration' to bolster our regime and encourage the people to support us."

 QIE_emperor_unifier: "A Unifying Emperor"
 QIE_emperor_unifier_desc: "While some may see the Emperor as anachronistic to our modernising, centralising vision, he can serve as a useful tool - a rallying point around which the formally disparate, decentralised country can unify. Propaganda can be employed to make sure every Chinese - from a farmer on the Yellow River to a goat herder in the steppes of Xinjiang knows they are part of the same nation."

 QIE_YCP_modernization: "Modernise Civilian Industry"
 QIE_YCP_modernization_desc: "The few civilian industries not formerly run by the Germans are laughable by Western standards. With the German industrial withdrawal, we can take their designs and apply them to our own factories, modernising them and significantly increasing our industrial output."

 QIE_cult_of_progress: "The Bureau of Progress"
 QIE_cult_of_progress_desc: "Unsatisfied with the meandering debates of the Assembly the YCP have taken it upon themselves to create a new 'Bureau of Progress' to oversee much needed reform to the armed forces and state industries. Under the auspices of Yan Xishan, the Young China Party hopes to overshadow the Assembly with organisations of its own design, completely bypassing legislative oversight."

 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare: "The Needs of Modern Warfare"
 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare_desc: "The tumult of the last decade has taught all officers the importance of fine artillery. None more so than the clique making up the core of the Young China Party. Many having been educated in Germany, have seen first-hand the power of modern armaments. The state cannot let up for even the briefest of moments our drive towards modernity."

 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state: "Trappings of a Party State"
 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state_desc: "Hand in hand, the Young China Party and Yan Xishan have worked towards a new China bereft of the chronic illnesses the old nobility and warlords birthed so many years ago. The world has moved quickly these last few years, it is the duty of the party to take these lessons to heart and mould the future of China accordingly."

 QIE_chinese_century: "The Chinese Century"
 QIE_chinese_century_desc: "With our sweeping reforms complete we enter the world as a rising power, ready to take on our foes and prove to the world once and for all that China is the true master of the East."

 QIE_appoint_viceroys: "Appoint New Viceroys"
 QIE_appoint_viceroys_desc: "The provincial governors employed by the Zhili Clique were corrupt, inefficient, and, worst of all, disloyal to the Emperor. With our new-found power we can instead appoint viceroys from good, reputable noble families with long and successful histories of provincial government."

 QIE_new_coronation: "A New Coronation?"
 QIE_new_coronation_desc: "A controversial idea has floated around the Qing nobility ever since the anti-Zhili coup - a second coronation for Puyi. While expensive, this could signal to China and the world we have formally cast off the shackles of warlordism and have entered a new stage of growth and renewal."

 QIE_imperial_arsenals: "Construct New Imperial Arsenals"
 QIE_imperial_arsenals_desc: "Much wealth is concentrated in the hands of Qing nobility. By appealing to their sense of patriotism and loyalty to the Emperor, we can convince them to invest these funds in the construction of new arsenals."

 QIE_noble_factories: "Grant Factory Licenses to Noble Families"
 QIE_noble_factories_desc: "With the expulsion of all German industrialists in the wake of the coup, many factories that they formerly ran now lie vacant. We should grant licenses to run these factories to Manchu noble clans that stood by us in the dark days of the Zhili government, to both reward them and ensure our industry is in the hands of those we trust."

 QIE_raise_banners: "Raise the Banners"
 QIE_raise_banners_desc: "While the Eight Banners were mostly dissolved in the wake of the Taiping Rebellion, some Qing generals are now suggesting we create a modern version of the system. While largely adhering to Western divisional organisational structures, we will apply Qing history and legacy to make them truly our own."

 QIE_imperial_roads: "Imperial Road Project"
 QIE_imperial_roads_desc: "The road network left by the Zhili bureaucracy is inefficient and poorly maintained. Through contracts with various local dignitaries and the wealth of the imperial treasury, we can set out building a road network worthy of the imperial name!"

 QIE_mandate_heaven: "The Mandate of Heaven"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_desc: "Some might claim it an outdated term, but what is the Mandate of Heaven but not a popular expression of the legitimate will of the government? Our scholars will need to update some texts, but with some work we can distribute propaganda that shows that Puyi is the true and legitimate Emperor of China."

 QIE_manchu_default_debt: "Default on Debt"
 QIE_manchu_default_debt_desc: "While we have created a new government, international creditors do not see things the same way. Our overwhelming international debt will continue to hinder our economic growth unless we default on it, harming us in the short term but allowing us to develop in the long run."

 QIE_imperial_consolidation: "Pacify the Nation"
 QIE_imperial_consolidation_desc: "The majority of China is ruled by warlord cliques, leftists, and even worse - republicans. These traitors must be destroyed! Soon, our armies will march out to destroy these rats and unify China behind the banner of the Emperor!"

 QIE_demand_fealty: "Demand Warlords Bend the Knee"
 QIE_demand_fealty_desc: "While we must seek out and destroy the leftists and republicans that infest large parts of our country, the more ideologically nebulous warlords may be brought to heel by the threat of our supreme army. If not, then we will simply destroy them."

 QIE_destroy_concessions: "Eradicate the Concessions"
 QIE_destroy_concessions_desc: "The Legation Cities are a stain on China's sovereignty and independence. While trade with the West is permissible, the cities are relics of the Century of Humiliation and have no place in our modern government. With the rest of the world embroiled in chaos now is the perfect moment to strike and reclaim our lost cities!"

 QIE_false_republic: "Dealing with the Northern Traitors"
 QIE_false_republic_desc: "The fools to the north claim to be the 'last bastion' of China's legitimate government. In reality they are little more than Japanese lapdogs. While they slavishly serve their masters we should strike and reclaim our homeland!"

 QIE_we_win: "The Dragon Rises from the Ashes"
 QIE_we_win_desc: "Few thought it possible, but we have triumphed over all of our foes! We now stand undisputed as the true masters of China, with the Emperor ready to lead the nation into this brave new world."

 QIE_rebuild_command_structure: "Rebuild our Command Structure"
 QIE_rebuild_command_structure_desc: "The civil war against the Zhili remnants left our high command in tatters. Few of those who remain have much loyalty, and divisions exist independent of the overall order of battle. We must immediately reorganise our forces if we wish to avoid inviting an attack."

 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner: "Foreigner Against Foreigner"
 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc: "While the German scum polluted our nation with their delusional ideas of racial 'superiority', few denied their military prowess. We should seek out non-aligned foreign agents to help train our military, even if this slightly contradicts our new anti-concession stance. A prepared military is worth a few angry intellectuals."

 QIE_look_to_our_past: "Look to Our Past"
 QIE_look_to_our_past_desc: "Instead of turning to the foreigners, let us instead look to the past for inspiration on how to reform our military. The tried and true methods of the Warlord Era are still effective, and will allow us to destroy our enemies."

 QIE_assess_doctrines: "Assess Doctrines"
 QIE_assess_doctrines_desc: "The rapidly changing face of modern warfare has necessitated us to take a long hard look at our military doctrine. Should we continue to use plans drawn up by the Zhili, or attempt to devise plans of our own?"

 QIE_uneasy_coalition: "The Uneasy Coalition"
 QIE_uneasy_coalition_desc: "Each of the political groups that helped overthrow the Zhili Clique have much to offer the military. The NCERA brings the loyalty of the peasantry, the YCP is made up of Baoding cadets, and the Qing nobility control some of the finest cavalrymen in the nation. While we must all work together to defeat the Japanese, each group may want concessions if they are not in power."

 QIE_rural_defense_force: "Found the Rural Defence Forces"
 QIE_rural_defense_force_desc: "For too long the peasantry of China have been terrorised by roving warbands of looters and bandits. The NCERA has proposed enacting a system whereby each village will have its own defence force equipped with obsolete rifles. While of dubious military use, they will be useful at harassing enemies and making our territory costly to occupy."

 QIE_prepare_dikes: "Prepare the Dikes"
 QIE_prepare_dikes_desc: "The dikes along the Yellow River present a possibility for a drastic strike against the Japanese. Should we open them while enemy forces are advancing, the floodwaters will slow their progress immensely and may give our forces a better chance at defending the area."

 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts: "Exploit Baoding Contacts"
 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy has contracts with military academies and arsenals all around China, even in areas controlled by ostensible enemies. With enough funding, these contractors could be persuaded to join our side, bringing with them their experience and technical expertise."

 QIE_reinstate_baojia: "Reinstate the Baojia System"
 QIE_reinstate_baojia_desc: "Founded during the Song Dynasty, the Baojia system was created maintain local order, collect taxes, and organise civil projects. By recreating a modern version of this system we can more effectively recruit and train soldiers."

 QIE_best_money_can_buy: "The Best Money Can Buy"
 QIE_best_money_can_buy_desc: "The Qing nobility grew rich over the last decade of idleness. We should 'encourage' that this money instead be spent on hiring military advisors from the other war colleges in China, many of which can be encouraged to join our side with a large bag of cash."

 QIE_imperial_propaganda: "Imperial Propaganda"
 QIE_imperial_propaganda_desc: "In order to defeat our foes, we must instill complete loyalty to the Emperor in our troops. They must be willing to lay down their lives if necessary to protect their sovereign and the promise and future he represents for China."

 QIE_manchu_naval_academy: "Found the Imperial Naval Academy"
 QIE_manchu_naval_academy_desc: "The Qing Navy was largely trained by European schools. While it is a secondary or tertiary concern at the moment, we should still devote some funding to training our naval cadets here rather than overseas."

 QIE_manchu_air_warfare: "Study European Air Tactics"
 QIE_manchu_air_warfare_desc: "While we would like to take as little as possible from the foreign devils, there is no debate that their mastery over aerial warfare is undisputed. We should study their doctrine and tactics, so that we may apply them to our own air force."

 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd: "Found Baoding Military Research Department"
 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd_desc: "With our military fully reformed along modern lines, we should set out to create an institution that allows our forces to keep abreast of the latest technological innovations. By creating a fully independent Baoding Military Research Department, our forces will have the technical backing to go toe-to-toe with any army in the world."

 QIE_commisars: "Political Commissars"
 QIE_commisars_desc: "Liu Menggeng has proposed an interesting idea - adding a dedicated ideological commissar to each military formation. While costly, these men will inspire our forces to fight with even greater patriotic fervour!"

 QIE_integration_harsh: "Integration by Force"
 QIE_integration_harsh_desc: "The foul traitors who rebelled against our benevolent rule deserve no mercy! Their rogue lands shall be re-integrated into our great nation by force!"

 QIE_integration_nice: "Benevolent Integration"
 QIE_integration_nice_desc: "While the rebel rulers who seized power over much of China must be punished, the peasantry the oppressed should not face the same fate. Instead, we should peaceably integrate former rebel lands into our government, so that all in China may live under our benevolent rule."

### National Spirits / Ideas ###
 QIE_fractured_empire: "Fractured Empire"
 QIE_fractured_empire_desc: "The Qing Empire theoretically controls all of China outside of Manchuria, Tibet, and Mongolia. In reality, the Emperor’s power barely extends outside the walls of the Forbidden City, while President Cao Kun is largely powerless beyond the assembly floor. Wu Peifu, the real power behind the throne, is more interested in consolidating his power base in Luoyang and balancing military cliques against each other than improving his country in any meaningful way."
 QIE_fractured_empire_removed_tt: "§YFractured Empire§! is removed"

 QIE_fractured_empire_manchu: "Fractured Empire"
 QIE_fractured_empire_manchu_desc: "The Qing Empire theoretically controls all of China outside of Manchuria, Tibet, and Mongolia. In reality, the Emperor’s power barely extends outside the Yellow River Basin. Although the tyrannical Zhili clique have been ousted, disorder still reigns across the land. It will still take mindful steps to mend the divisions even within our own limited grasp of China."

 QIE_big_debt: "Overwhelming National Debt"
 QIE_big_debt_desc: "China’s struggle to develop its national economy has resulted in an enormous trade debt fronted by the Beijing government. Industrial machinery is imported at a staggering cost, and what little domestic manufacturing does exist lacks the quality and quantity to compete on the world market. China’s main exports are thus mostly agricultural, and even cash crops fetch low prices compared to widely imported foreign luxuries like cigarettes and radios. This problem is only exacerbated by widespread institutionalised corruption and a thriving opium trade."

 QIE_black_monday: "Black Monday"
 QIE_black_monday_desc: "While most of China has escaped extensive economic fallout stemming from Black Monday, the intertwining of our economy with Germany's has caused a slight hit to economic production."

 QIE_leadership_crisis: "Zhili Leadership Crisis"
 QIE_leadership_crisis_desc: "The advanced age of many senior Zhili commanders is a worrying trend that must be rectified soon, lest our army be entirely controlled by old men."

 QIE_leadership_crisis_bad: "Deepening Leadership Crisis"
 QIE_leadership_crisis_bad_desc: "The death of several senior Zhili generals has further exacerbated our already dangerous lack of young (or even middle-aged) faces in our high command."

 QIE_outraged_parties: "Outraged Assembly"
 QIE_outraged_parties_desc: "Following our decision to support the League of Eight Provinces, the National Assembly erupted into outraged protest. The average peasant does not care too much, but we still need to act quickly to restore stability to our government."

 QIE_popular_warlord_idea: "Popular Support for Wu Peifu"
 QIE_popular_warlord_idea_desc: "Following Wu Peifu’s decision to intervene in favour of the anti-concessionist Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, he has seen a marked increase in popular support. While still viewed with some suspicion in some intellectual circles, he has gained a fair bit of legitimacy."

 QIE_defaulted_debt: "Defaulted Foreign Debt"
 QIE_defaulted_debt_desc: "In a move to bolster domestic legitimacy, we have defaulted on our international debts. The economic ramifications of this plan will ripple for months, and affect nearly every sector of our economy."

 QIE_harmonious_balance_idea: "A Harmonious Balance"
 QIE_harmonious_balance_idea_desc: "Our government has achieved a rare goal - forming and maintaining a harmonious balance between the spiritual power of Emperor and the temporal power of the Zhili Clique."

 QIE_local_logistics: "Traditional Logistics"
 QIE_local_logistics_desc: "While we may have been cut off from Western innovations like motorised logistics, China never had the infrastructure to support them anyway. Relying on traditional logistics may not win us any technological awards, but a mule can cross the rugged terrain of this nation easier than a truck."

 QIE_german_bailout: "German Bailout"
 QIE_german_bailout_desc: "In our most dire time of need we were forced to turn to our ‘friends’ in Germany one final time. German banks have taken over our enormous trade debt, re-packaged it, and sold it to unsuspecting customers in Germany as ‘stable government bonds’. While this solves our financial problems, it has created a whole new set of political ones."

 QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea: "New Diplomatic Corps"
 QIE_diplomatic_genius_idea_desc: "Wellington Koo, a diplomatic mastermind, is spearheading the creation of a new diplomatic corps for the republic. With his skill and expertise, these new diplomats should help reinforce our legitimacy."

 QIE_pragmatism_idea: "Pragmatism"
 QIE_pragmatism_idea_desc: "Writer Hu Shih, now President, is famous for his theory of ‘pragmatism’ - instead of uncompromising ideology, it stresses cooperation and conciliation, even with former enemies. It should help our government establish control over the fractured nation."

 QIE_unprepared_military: "Unprepared Military"
 QIE_unprepared_military_desc: "With our inability to prepare for the Japanese invasion, our army now lies unprepared for the coming storm."

 QIE_legitimate_emperor_idea: "Defending the Emperor"
 QIE_legitimate_emperor_idea_desc: "Zhang Tianran has successfully elevated the Emperor above the petty political struggles that defined the first decade of his restored rule. People now look to him as a bulwark of Chinese identity."

 QIE_rooting_out_corruption: "Rooting Out Corruption"
 QIE_rooting_out_corruption_desc: "Corruption has been endemic to China for the last few centuries. Now, with our new government, we can appoint men loyal to us who will surely make a concerted effort in rooting out corruption."

 QIE_intervention_idea: "Intervention in the LEP Collapse"
 QIE_intervention_idea_desc: "Our government’s decision to intervene in the LEP collapse has allowed us to send clandestine ‘volunteer units to support our interests in the League."

 QIE_rural_reform_idea: "Rural Reform Movement"
 QIE_rural_reform_idea_desc: "The leaders of the NCERA have allocated government support and funding to their Rural Reform Movement, turning the formerly charitable organisation into another arm of the government, aimed at strengthening the civic power of village life in China."

 QIE_rural_insurgency_idea: "Rural Loyalty"
 QIE_rural_insurgency_idea_desc: "Through the success of the Rural Reform Movement many peasants have been wholly won over to our cause, ready to die for the Emperor."

 QIE_mandate_heaven_idea: "Mandate of Heaven"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_idea_desc: "While some might claim it an outdated notion, the Zongshe Party has successfully re-branded the concept of the ‘Mandate of Heaven’ for a more modern framework of political theory. Instead of emphasising divine right, new propaganda emphasises how the Emperor acts as a manifestation of the civic forces of China."

 QIE_banner_idea: "Modern Banner System"
 QIE_banner_idea_desc: "In an effort to modernise the ad-hoc military left over from the Zhili Clique, the Zongshe party has attempted to bring back the banner system of the old Qing emperors. This is really just a bit of historical flavour added on top of a modern army organisational structure, but this historical allegory helps give the military more legitimacy."

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_idea_desc: "A republican warlord, few thought Yan Xishan would want to have anything to do with the new Qing state. Yet with Fengtian currently under the Japanese heel and the south engulfed in chaos, the Model Governor has decided to throw in his hat with the new constitutional system.

 QIE_zhang_tianran_backer_idea_desc: "Zhang Tianran, leader of the esoteric Yiguandao cult, has formally joined our government as 'spiritual advisor' as a condition of his support during the intervention, a nebulous position that grants him unclear authority.

 QIE_nationalized_yan_xishan_thought_desc: "Governor Yan Xishan has begun to spread his personal political philosophy throughout the Qing Empire, adopting a nationalised, homegrown, and defensive characteristic.

His once peculiar philosophy has now aggregated into a defining element of our new regime. Throughout the land, people have begun to see the effects of our uncompromising stance on looking forward.

 QIE_manage_german_influence_desc: "Following the restoration of Puyi, German companies have held disproportionate influence in our country.

 QIE_hire_bandits_desc: "A time-honoured tradition in the Warlord Era, hiring 'soldiers of the forest' is a cheap if immoral way of increasing the size of our military.

 QIE_attack_warlord_desc_SHX_yan: "Governor Yan Xishan has long had ties with the Fengtian government, and supported them during the last ZhiFeng war. If we attack him Fengtian is likely to join on their side. Some of the more hawkish generals, however, have created a plan that would allow us to launch a surprise attack on Yan, catching him and [FNG.GetLeader] off-guard and giving us a few months to destroy Shanxi before Fengtian could respond. Other generals have expressed doubts about this plan, saying their troops are unprepared for such a sudden attack. Still, if this succeeds we can destroy Xishan and his forces before they have a chance to formally align with Fengtian."

Favouring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasises the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century. The second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. Following the restoration of Puyi, his works have come back into prominence, and are popular among middle-class urban intellectuals.

While not overtly hostile to Wu’s ambitions, the PL mainly acts as a lobbying group, pushing for increased free trade, relaxed government regulations, and industrial stimulus - nominally for the interests of the elite - but truly for the Peking-Kommission.

Opposed to Wu’s Zhili Clique, they favour a return to Qing control over all of China. Unlike more radical factions, they are willing to tolerate warlords and some degree of factionalism - as long as they swear complete and utter loyalty to the Emperor.

The first is the Rural Reconstruction Movement, lead by Liang Shuming and the Harvard and Princeton educated J.C. 'Jimmy' Yen. Favouring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasises the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century. The second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. With full reunification of the empire a new cascade of problems presents itself to the NCERA demanding a full reorganization of the Qing Empire from the bottom up.

### Events ###
 qiedom.1.t: "The Great Qing"
 qiedom.1.d: "The internationally mediated end of the last Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928 brought an end to nearly four years of chaos and instability and began the longest period of peace enjoyed by some parts of China since the Xinhai Revolution of 1911. Though Wu Peifu and his Northern Zhili Clique accepted the return of the Qing dynasty, further German concessions were refused, leading to a cooling of relations. Germany continues to maintain support for the Qing Government, but mainly with the aim of ensuring consistent competition with the also-supported Southern Zhili as part of a larger divide and conquer strategy in China as a whole, as well as in the hopes of gradually building a Chinese bulwark against Japan.\n\nThough the spectre of Japanese domination looms across much of Northern and Eastern China, the country is nonetheless far more divided than most in Beijing would prefer, and Qing finds its authority contested on all sides, from the defiant Fengtian Government in the Northeast, to the various ostensible allies across the remainder of China; nominal components of the Empire granted near-total autonomy by grace of geography and regionalist sentiment. As a result, Qing enters 1936 largely contained to the North China Plain, and at the head of a faltering national order."
 qiedom.1.a: "Long Live the Emperor!"

 qiedom.2.t: "The Political Situation"
 qiedom.2.d: "1936 finds the powerless Assembly on the brink. Five groups dominate the body, and although they have no power in the chamber, the groups that support them are not to be trifled with. The most powerful of these is the Harmony Association, nominally led by President Cao Kun. A depressed alcoholic, true power in the group resides with Wu Peifu, who founded the Association as a legitimising movement to ensure Zhili representation in the Assembly. While nominally an independent political party, the Harmony Association's deputies are all former Zhili officers, and following Cao Kun's legally dubious re-election few believe the group is anything more than a front for Wu to control the country.\n\nThe Prosperity League occupies a similar position, and while it claims to be a political party few see it as any more than a lobbying group for German interests in Beijing.\n\nThis leaves three parties in the opposition: The Zongshe Party, comprised of Qing princes and former royal hangers-on, the Young China Party, a clique of young officers at the Baoding academy styling themselves after the Young Turk Party, and the New Chinese Empire Reformation Association, a fusion of two reform groups that, while loyal to the Emperor, favour a structural reorganisation of China back to the traditional model of the rural village, and the end to warlord cliques. While these three groups are in opposition to Wu, he allows them seats in the powerless assembly as a way to legitimise his unpopular regime."
 qiedom.2.a: "Interesting"

 qiedom.3.t: "Restructuring Our Debt"
 qiedom.3.d: "For the last few years Wu and Cao have spent most of their political capital attempting to restructure and reduce the enormous debt of the Qing Empire. While theoretically possible, this plan has run into numerous challenges, the chief being a lack of support from the provincial governors. Rumours of instability in the south have further complicated these plans, and Cao Kun is expected to deliver a speech on reducing the national debt to the Assembly after the New Year Celebrations later this month."
 qiedom.3.a: "We will await the speech..."

 qiedom.4.t: "Death of Wang Chengbin"
 qiedom.4.d: "Earlier this morning Wang Chengbin, a senior member of the Zhili Clique and major ally of Cao Kun, passed away due to old age. While his death in and of itself is a blow to our command structure, it reveals a worrying trend. Many senior Zhili military officials are of old age, poor health, or both, and the corruption endemic in our military prevents younger officers from advancing through the ranks. Unless a serious effort is made, our high command will soon consist solely of doddering, senile old men terrified of adapting new technologies and doctrines."
 qiedom.4.a: "What happened to age bringing wisdom?"

 qiedom.5.t: "Ripples of Black Monday"
 qiedom.5.d: "While in the weeks following Black Monday it appeared that we had escaped the worst of the damage, over the last few days German affiliated businesses have been hit with supply chain issues and increased prices. While the economic disruption is nowhere near the scale experienced in Europe and the Americas, this is still a blow to our economy."
 qiedom.5.a: "Damn it!"

 qiedom.13.t: "Election Results - Victory!"
 qiedom.13.d: "Results are in from the parts of China still stable enough to hold elections. Turnout was (as expected) quite low, but in cities like Beijing we received record numbers of votes from intellectuals, reformers, and others previously opposed to our rule. It appears the intervention, while robbing us of German support, has given us a large deal of political legitimacy and local support.\n\nIn the aftermath of the victory, president Cao Kun announced he was stepping down, to be replaced by Yan Huiqing. It unclear how much of an influence Wu Peifu had on this decision, but it is clear the Jade Marshal did not want any of Cao's drunken antics impacting the new government."
 qiedom.13.a: "We didn't even have to rig this one!"

 qiedom.14.t: "Meeting with the Zongshe"
 qiedom.14.d: "Following the announcement of our attack on Anqing Province, nearly every delegate to the Assembly outside the Harmony League reacted by walking out of the building. President Cao Kun has now been tasked with meeting with senior members of the Zongshe Party to ensure their continued loyalty following the speech.\n\n'You have to understand, sirs, that Japanese invasion is not a matter of if - it is a matter of when. Continued German support is required to ensure our national safety!'\n\nCao was initially successful at persuading many Manchu nobles, but some of the younger hotshots like Gobulo Runqi reacted poorly to the President's overtures. Several hours of negotiation later, they agreed on a 'noble pension' paid out to senior Manchu royalty with the express purpose of preserving 'Imperial culture'. It's little more than a bribe but it will keep the peace."
 qiedom.14.a: "President Cao is no stranger to bribery..."

 qiedom.15.t: "Meeting with the YCP"
 qiedom.15.d: "The Young China Party, an alliance of young idealistic Baoding cadets and urban reformers, reacted with the most hostility to Cao Kun's intervention speech. Claiming that the intervention was 'capitulation to foreign interests', they were the first to storm out of the assembly chamber in protest. President Cao is now tasked with ensuring their loyalty.\n\nInitially, they stubbornly resisted all attempts at negotiation, but eventually a deal was hammered out. They will maintain their loyalty in exchange for increased military autonomy and the end to supervision of the Baoding curriculum. This will hamper our efforts to ensure they stay loyal in the future, but we need their loyalty now."
 qiedom.15.a: "Let's hope this keeps them in check"

 qiedom.16.t: "Meeting with the NCERA"
 qiedom.16.d: "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association was the last to leave the Assembly in protest, and almost certainly will be the hardest to convince to rejoin. Primarily representing the peasants and rural farmers in China, the leaders take a paternalistic approach to their constituents. President Cao is sceptical of their devotion to the reformist cause, but nonetheless met with Y. C. James Yen, one of their leaders. Yen was initially hesitant, but eventually they were able to reach a compromise. Government controlled industries in Beijing will begin producing farming implements and other rural aid to help impoverished peasants."
 qiedom.16.a: "Easy enough"

 qiedom.17.t: "The Assembly Returns to Normal"
 qiedom.17.d: "Following President Cao's negotiations and 'gift giving' the delegates have all returned to the Assembly. Still powerless, the body can once again begin to rubber-stamp the President and Wu's agenda."
 qiedom.17.a: "Excellent"

 qiedom.18.t: "German Mining Companies Increase Their Operations in Eastern Shanxi"
 qiedom.18.d: "The Shanxi region has always been a good source of coal and useful metals for the Empire. Following the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War, we gained direct control of Eastern Shanxi, a slim area of land that used to belong to Yan Xishan’s Shanxi Clique. Our ownership of Eastern Shanxi has been the cause of tensions between us and the Shanxi Clique, but for now they are unable to compete with our military strength. Much like the rest of Shanxi, this area is rich with coal and iron. Multiple German companies took an interest in Eastern Shanxi, and so purchased the coal and iron mines there. These mines sit very close to the border with the Shanxi Clique, but this has not yet been a problem.\n\nHowever, news just came in that these Eastern Shanxi companies are going to increase their mining operations, and have presented plans that show some of their mines falling into Shanxi controlled territory. We personally do not need to worry about this, but it is likely to cause some problems in the Shanxi Clique, with many peasants feeling robbed that these German companies are taking their mines."
 qiedom.18.a: "We wish them good luck with their business ventures."

 qiedom.19.t: "Scandal!"
 qiedom.19.d: "Assembly President Cao Kun was just found passed out in his office, slumped over his desk and a bottle of liquor. Cao's alcoholism has been a matter of public knowledge, but until now he has mostly kept it under wraps. It seems the stress of managing the discontent following our intervention in favour of the Nanjing Clique has finally caused him to snap. Wu Peifu has 'persuaded' Cao to resign, and has promoted veteran diplomat and civil servant Yan Huiqing to fill the position."
 qiedom.19.a: "Alright"

 qiedom.20.t: "Resignation from the Legation Council!"
 qiedom.20.d: "With our new anti-Concession stance, we have formally resigned from the perfidious Legation Council! No more will we answer to the foreign scum who exploit our country for their own financial gain!"
 qiedom.20.a: "China for the Chinese!"

 qiedom.21.t: "[QIE.GetName] Quits the Legation Council!"
 qiedom.21.d: "Following their recent adoption of an anti-Concession stance, the [QIE.GetName] have formally quit the Legation Council, denouncing it as a 'tool of imperialism'! While they only held observer status, this is still a worrying development..."
 qiedom.21.a: "Disconcerting"

##LEP collapse##

 qielepcollapse.1.t: "The Sale of the Zhegan Railroad"
 qielepcollapse.1.d: "The past few weeks have seen a great deal of economic activity in the League of Eight Provinces, the southern conglomerate of provinces ruled by our nominal subordinate, Sun Chuanfang. Even more heavily influenced by German economic support than we are, the League just finished construction on a major railroad, the Zhegan line. Though funded by the Germans, it was largely built by Chinese labour, leading many to hope for a more equitable relationship between German and Chinese in the League, at least in economic affairs.\n\nA few days ago, in a surprising move, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of their subsidiary group, the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft - including this new Zhegan route.\n\nThis move angered many native Chinese residents of the League, who saw the Zhegan line as a potential building block in an equal relationship between Europeans and Asians. Widespread protests have broken out, inflamed by conspiracies of fraud and embezzlement on the part of Sun’s cronies."
 qielepcollapse.1.a: "We need to keep an eye on this"

 qielepcollapse.2.t: "Widespread Attacks on Foreigners"
 qielepcollapse.2.d: "Following the unrest surrounding the Zhegan railroad, a number of German investors and businessmen have been savagely attacked by rabid anti-foreign mobs. To make matters worse, widespread boycotts of German goods have began in the South, and this morning reports reached Beijing of bombings of railway stations in Hangzhou and other cities on the Central China Railway. Transportation has ground to a halt in many regions of the League, and KMT guerrillas have used this opportunity to stage increasingly daring attacks on isolated League garrisons.\n\nThe German ambassador is demanding accountability, and while the League is largely autonomous from our control we still need to do something. Jiang Baili and other Zhili officials have long pushed to exert greater control over the League, and are urging Wu to use this crisis to leverage greater control over the south. Wu is personally uncertain of this, but is currently drafting a telegram to demand accountability from Sun and offer our help should he need it. Unsaid, of course, is the demand for increased control over League affairs should he accept our help."
 qielepcollapse.2.a: "Let's see what Sun has to say..."

 qielepcollapse.3.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
 qielepcollapse.3.d: "Troubling information reached Luoyang and Beijing this morning. While reports are somewhat contradictory, it appears there was some sort of a massacre of peaceful protesters by League and German troops in the city of Wuhu. Some claim German troops simply mowed down the protesters, while others claim a group of KMT radicals attacked the Germans and League troops first. Whatever the cause, the city has fallen into anarchy and protests have sprung up all over the League.\n\nIronically, at the same time as we received this information we received a report from Sun claiming he has the situation under control. Some Zhili generals are pushing for a major intervention in the south should the situation deteriorate further, but Wu has yet to take a clear position on the issue.\n\nFurther exasperating our problems, an informant we have placed within the NCERA claims they have somehow received information on the situation, and are planning to give a scathing speech later in the assembly today. HA officials are attempting to rouse Cao Kun from a drunken stupor and write a counterspeech, but we’ve been caught off guard."
 qielepcollapse.3.a: "'Under control' my ass..."

 qielepcollapse.4.t: "Anhui Breaks Free"
 qielepcollapse.4.d: "The province of Anhui, long chafing under Sun’s rule, essentially declared independence from the League this week. In a widely-distributed pamphlet, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan claimed that the Wuhu incident ‘shows that Sun cannot manage this crisis, and essentially abrogates him from any responsibility in Anhui.’\n\nSome Zhili generals have unilaterally begun to mobilise their troops against ‘KMT incursions’, though Wu rightly suspects their true intention is territorial expansion. Seeking to undercut their opportunity to invade, he declared a ‘national state of readiness’ this morning to all Zhili and Manchu generals, urging them to ready their troops for ‘any possible armed conflict’. Confused Zhili troops have largely fallen into line with Wu and any premature attack south was effectively ended before it began."
 qielepcollapse.4.a: "Let's hope this keeps them in line"

 qielepcollapse.5.t: "A Telegram from Nanjing"
 qielepcollapse.5.d: "Minister Wu Peifu was woken from a restless sleep.\n\n'Sun Chuanfang shot 8:55 AM STOP\nPerpetrator unknown STOP\nIn coma STOP\nUnlikely to wake STOP\nRiots widespread STOP\nFleeing with gold and documents STOP'\n\nTwo hours later, Luoyang has become a frenzied hub of activity. Documents concerning Sun’s more salacious dealings with Beijing burn in the furnaces, while a group of senior Zhili officials confer with one another. In an unprecedented move, Wu has invited several Manchu nobles, notably the Emperor's brother Pujie, to be present for the drafting of some form of unified statement in response to the assassination."
 qielepcollapse.5.a: "What will come next?"

 qielepcollapse.6.t: "Imperial Navy Flees North!"
 qielepcollapse.6.d: "Lacking any suitable ports in the north, the Imperial Fleet has been based out of Nantong since the end of the 1927 conflict. With rioting, civil unrest, and general chaos enveloping the city, Admiral Wu Renli has ordered the fleet to leave the city, and head north for the small ports we control outside Tianjin. The fall of the Nanjing docks also means we have lost what limited naval manufacturing capabilities we had."
 qielepcollapse.6.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.7.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Sends a Telegram"
 qielepcollapse.7.d: "‘To the eminent President Cao Kun, and Imperial Minister Wu Peifu,\n\nI, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, humbly ask for funding for my troops. As outlined in the constitution of our great nation, it is the responsibility of the national government to provide funds to provincial governors to suppress unrest. With the situation of League-Marshal Sun in Nanjing unclear, I have taken the responsibility of protecting the province of Anhui against bandits and leftist agitators.’\n\nThis telegram was delivered to Wu Peifu this morning from the Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, of the Anqing Clique. While the tone of the letter was very bold, it appears Chen has restored order to his province.\n\nWu is faced with a choice - Chen would be a powerful ally, but he has a firm anti-concessions stance. Supporting him in the long-term would alienate Germany, whose support will be essential in the inevitable war against Japan. At the same time, taking a stance against Germany would undoubtedly endear Wu with the population."
 qielepcollapse.7.a: "Send the gold. We need stability on our borders."
 qielepcollapse.7.b: "Refuse. No funds for rebels!"
 qie_anti_concessions_decision_warning: "§RChoosing to support Chen Tiaoyuan will lead Qing on a firmly Anti-Concessionist path, meaning it cannot support the League of Eight Provinces and will take Anqing's side in the conflict. It will also guarantee alienating Germany. If Anqing loses the conflict, Qing will be very alone.§!\n"

 qielepcollapse.8.t: "An Offer from Marshal Qi"
 qielepcollapse.8.d: "Following our refusal of Governor Chen's telegram, a message has arrived from Qi Xieyuan - who has declared himself the new League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces, succeeding Sun Chuanfang.\n\n'To the most auspicious Marshal Wu - I, Qi Xieyuan, request your aid in suppressing the rebellion in Anhui. As you are my liege and commander it is only proper that you assist me in my times of need.'\n\nThe tone of the request leaves many suspicious, as theoretically Qi should be able to easily crush Anqing and the KMT rebellion to the south with German aid."
 qielepcollapse.8.a: "Let's hear him out - we could gain some leverage here."
 qielepcollapse.8.b: "He can handle this on his own."

 qielepcollapse.9.t: "Wu Accepts!"
 qielepcollapse.9.d: "Marshal Wu Peifu has accepted our request for help. We should send him another request asking on how he plans to intervene."
 qielepcollapse.9.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.10.t: "Wu Refuses!"
 qielepcollapse.10.d: "Marshal Wu Peifu has refused our request for aid! We are on our own now..."
 qielepcollapse.10.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.11.t: "Another Offer to Chen?"
 qielepcollapse.11.d: "Following our refusal of aid to Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique, worrying reports have begun to emerge that he has reached out to Zhang Zuolin, leader of the rogue Fengtian government in the Northeast. Even more worrying is his use of a Japanese interlocutor to facilitate the conversation. Several of Wu's advisors are suggesting the Marshal reach out again to Chen with an offer of direct support in his rebellion, lest we end up with a Japanese lapdog right on our doorstep.\n\nBeyond just Japanese support for Chen, however, it also seems that non-intervention could lead to widespread domestic unrest. Many in both the opposition parties and the Zhili Clique itself are itching for an opportunity to extend our control in the chaos of the collapse, and already small protests in favour of Governor Chen's anti-concessions stance have broken out across urban areas. Staying silent could result in these protests escalating, further destabilising our already unpopular regime."
 qielepcollapse.11.a: "Let's see what he has to say."
 qielepcollapse.11.b: "This is too risky."

 qielepcollapse.12.t: "Marshal Qi's Offer"
 qielepcollapse.12.d: "Following our acceptance of Governor Chen's request for aid, a message has arrived from Qi Xieyuan - who has declared himself as the new League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces, succeeding Sun Chuanfang.\n\n'To the most auspicious Marshal Wu - I, Qi Xieyuan, request your aid in suppressing the rebellion in Anhui. As you are my liege and commander it is only proper that you assist me in my times of need.'\n\nUnfortunately for Marshal Qi, our commitment to Governor Chen forces us to refuse this request."
 qielepcollapse.12.a: "The die is already cast"

 qielepcollapse.13.t: "The Moment of Truth"
 qielepcollapse.13.d: "Skirmishes between Chen Tiaoyuan's troops and forces loyal to Qi Xieyuan's Nanjing Clique have escalated into open battle. It now comes time to honour our commitment to Governor Chen, and launch our intervention in support of his regime."

 qielepcollapse.14.d: "Skirmishes between Chen Tiaoyuan's troops and forces loyal to Qi Xieyuan's Nanjing Clique have escalated into open battle. It now comes time to honour our commitment to Qi Xieyuan, and launch our intervention in support of his regime."
 qielepcollapse.14.a: "We march to war!"

 qielepcollapse.15.t: "Chen Accepts Our Offer"
 qielepcollapse.15.d: "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique has accepted our offer of support in the League conflict. He also promises that any previous interactions he had with Fengtian or Japanese agents were conducted 'without his express consent' and those who met with the foreigners and traitors have been summarily punished."
 qielepcollapse.15.a: "Prepare the troops!"
 qielepcollapse.15.b: "This is a stupid idea..."

 qielepcollapse.17.t: "Popular Support for Wu Peifu"
 qielepcollapse.17.d: "Following Marshal Wu’s decision to attack the Nanjing government, he ordered President Cao Kun to make a public statement regarding the plan. Broadcast from a balcony in the Forbidden City to a large crowd gathered below, it was also transmitted over the radio - a first in China.\n\n‘Citizens! - For a century we have suffered under foreign oppression! For too long we have been lapdogs to the whims of the British, Germans, and Americans. But no more! Today - we stand independent! The armies of the Son of Heaven march south to destroy the traitor Marshal Qi and his German lackeys. We will no longer be subservient to the whims of Berlin. We cast of the shackles of the Century of Humiliation and say to the world - China is free once again!’\n\nThe speech is met with resounding applause and cheers, and soon sections of it are transcribed to pamphlets and passed around China."
 qielepcollapse.17.a: "Maybe people won't hate us now?"

 qielepcollapse.18.t: "The Peking-Kommission Withdraws from Beijing!"
 qielepcollapse.18.d: "Immediately following President Cao’s incendiary speech, plumes of smoke began to emerge from the streets outside the German embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission. A vast mob had formed outside the gates, chanting anti-concession slogans and burning German-made clothes, furniture, and even a hastily-constructed effigy of the Kaiser. Police and Zhili-aligned military units quickly arrived to prevent the scene from turning ugly, but by nightfall most German officials and their Chinese hangers-on had fled to Tianjin."
 qielepcollapse.18.a: "Get out, foreign scum!"

 qielepcollapse.19.t: "Drama in the Assembly"
 qielepcollapse.19.d: "Following Wu’s decision to intervene in favour of the LEP, President Cao Kun was given the somewhat unenviable job of delivering the news to the Assembly. ‘Cherished friends - today I bring you important news concerning the unrest to the south. Marshal Wu, in his eminent wisdom, has elected to support Marshal Qi in his struggles against the traitorous Governor Chen Tiaoyuan. Imperial troops march south to quell the unrest, and we expect a quick and decisi-’\n\nCao trailed off as members of the Young China Party stood up and silently started to march out. Soon after, they were followed by members of the NCERA and Zongshe Party. Soon, only the Harmony Association and Prosperity League members are left. A stunned Cao finishes his speech.\n\n\"a quick and decisive victory. Long live the Emperor!\" It does not take a political genius to see that only the Prosperity League members applaud with any enthusiasm."
 qielepcollapse.19.a: "Bastards!"

 qielepcollapse.20.t: "German Support"
 qielepcollapse.20.d: "Prosperity League members were quick to congratulate President Cao after his speech, and in the reception afterwards bottles of Rhenish wine, Cuban cigars, and other foreign treats were on offer to anyone willing to partake. In the place of the dour-faced Manchu nobles who normally attended these receptions, representatives from the German embassy and the Peking-Kommission stood around in the latest Berlin suits, offering exorbitant gifts to HA lawmakers and some Zhili generals who were also in attendance."
 qielepcollapse.20.a: "At least somebody likes us..."

 qielepcollapse.21.t: "Widespread Rioting Breaks Out"
 qielepcollapse.21.d: "Following Wu and Cao’s silence on LEP-related affairs, small protests began to emerge, clamouring for intervention. As the silence continued, these gatherings quickly grew into large street protests. With Cao finally announcing that he would support neither Qi nor Chen, the protests erupted into riots. Beijing and other major cities are paralysed by the unrest, and nearly everyone, from the richest intellectual to the poorest street vendor, are in the streets denouncing the government. Adding fuel to the fire are wild conspiracy theories that Wu was paid off by the German legation not to intervene, leading many demonstrators to carry anti-German slogans and burn German-made goods. In one instance crude effigies of the Kaiser, Wu, and Cao were all burned outside the Forbidden City before the perpetrators were hauled away in chains."
 qielepcollapse.21.a: "Damn it!"

 qielepcollapse.22.t: "Anqing Is Victorious!"
 qielepcollapse.22.d: "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan's troops, supported by our valiant forces, have entered Nanjing! While Marshal Qi and his German lackeys have fled, Chen has secured control over some of the territories peripheral to Anhui province. Our support in the war has also firmly aligned him within our sphere, and over the next few months we can fully bring him into our alliance."
 qielepcollapse.22.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.23.t: "Nanjing Is Victorious!"
 qielepcollapse.23.d: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan's troops, supported by our valiant forces, have entered Anqing! While Governor Chen and his Fengtian lackeys have fled, Qi has re-asserted control over Anhui Province. Our support in the war has also aligned him within our sphere, and over the next few months we can fully bring him into our alliance, though we also have to manage Germany's influence over his regime."
 qielepcollapse.23.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.24.t: "Refugees Flee League Chaos"
 qielepcollapse.24.d: "With widespread unrest sweeping the League of Eight Provinces, Governors Jin Yun'e of Henan and Xiao Yaonan of Hubei have reported increasing numbers of refugees flooding into their provinces. Although it started as a trickle, over the course of the last few days the flow dramatically increased, with whole families fleeing an explosion of violence and banditry. The governors have sent worrying telegrams after some of their men interviewed some of the refugees, indicating central authority within League has collapsed far more than previously thought. Furthermore, they have requested additional food and supplies to deal with the refugees."
 qielepcollapse.24.a: "Terrible news. Send the supplies."
 qielepcollapse.24.b: "Who cares?"

 qielepcollapse.25.t: "Bloodbath on the Yangtze!"
 qielepcollapse.25.d: "Despite their best efforts to deal with the influx of refugees, the governors of our southern provinces are overwhelmed. Following a province-wide declaration of martial law made in Hubei, Governor Xiao Yaonan ordered his troops to shut down all bridges and roads leading into the province from League territory, and denying entry to all refugees. A large number of them, however, began to mass at a bridge over the Yangtze River, demanding entry.\n\nWhile this started peacefully, it quickly escalated into a full-scale riot, as refugees began to pelt Xiao's troops with rocks, bottles, and other debris. Eventually, a group of men who had somehow armed themselves with stolen weapons began shooting at Xiao's troops, who responded by opening fire with machine-guns. Those not hit by the storm of bullets fled, stampeding other refugees and leaving their friends and family dead or dying on the bridge. This grisly scene is being repeated up and down our border with the League, as mobs of refugees have started to force their way into our territory."
 qielepcollapse.25.a: "Unfortunate news."

 qielepcollapse.26.t: "Southern Governors Cut Contact"
 qielepcollapse.26.d: "With violence in the League escalating daily, the governors of Yunnan and Guangdong, [YUN.GetLeader] and Chen Jiongming, have stopped responding to official government requests for information and updates on what is happening in their territory. They have long despised our government, and while this move is not unexpected, it represents a complete change in their official demeanour to our government. Many in Wu's inner circle fear that this heralds a complete collapse of our authority, and this morning news out of Shanxi confirms these worries.\n\nYan Xishan, governor of Shanxi, has formally denounced the actions of our government in what is now being termed the 'Yangtze Incident' earlier this week, when Governor Wang Huaiqing's forces fired upon a mob of refugees, and proclaimed that the Qing no longer had the 'capacity to rule China'. He stopped just short of recognising the Fengtian Government, but it is clear the national order is breaking down."
 qielepcollapse.26.a: "Damnation!"

 qielepcollapse.27.t: "A Letter Of Thanks From Chen"
 qielepcollapse.27.d: "Governor Chen has written his sincere thanks to Marshal Wu Peifu, complimenting his Ministry in their dedication to Chinese solidarity. Governor Chen promises that his defence of Chinese sovereignty signals the end of Western interference in the Yellow River Valley, and lavishly affirmed Wu Peifu's belief in Chinese superiority over the AOG forces they face."
 qielepcollapse.27.a: "He is most welcome."

 qielepcollapse.28.t: "We Were Betrayed By Chen"
 qielepcollapse.28.d: "Despite Wu's best attempt to calm Governor Chen diplomatically, he now appears to be out of our reach. A border guard discovered refugees arriving in Qing lands carrying pamphlets from the infamous Japanese paramilitary Black Dragon Society. Now in the vacuum of silence from Anqing's leaders come more disturbing impressions. Governor Chen Yi, infamous for his association with the Black Dragons, has been spotted in Anqing by other refugees. It is highly likely that Governor Chen has betrayed not only Marshal Wu and Puyi, but the Chinese nation itself by allowing Japanese spies to enter his city."
 qielepcollapse.28.a: "Damn Japanese!"

 qielepcollapse.29.t: "Anqing Is Defeated!"
 qielepcollapse.29.d: "The valorous forces of Chen Tiaoyuan have been defeated in Anqing, and his provincial government destroyed. This is a dark day for our government, as many had pinned their hopes on."

 qielepcollapse.30.t: "Nanjing Is Defeated!"
 qielepcollapse.30.d: "We had all hoped that Qi Xieyuan would prove a valuable ally and would win the League War. However, disaster has struck and his government has collapsed, leaving our control and influence over the region in shambles. This is a dark day for our government."

 qielepcollapse.31.t: "Descent Into Anarchy!"
 qielepcollapse.31.d: "It would seem that the war situation has become untenable, and over a year of fighting has caused our forces to utterly collapse into anarchic bands, the central government in Beijing means therefore to sweep in and restore order!"

 qiecoup.1.t: "Whispers of Discontent"
 qiecoup.1.d: "In the weeks following Wu’s decision not to intervene in the LEP collapse, small groups from across the political spectrum began to gather in secret. Initially limited to criticising Wu’s inaction, the worsening violence in the streets led many to bring up revolt. Social networks between these groups have allowed a shaky coalition to develop. Comprised of Manchu nobles, cadets at the Baoding academy, reformers in the NCERA, and some Zhili generals annoyed at Wu’s inaction, this loose group has begun to speak clandestinely with one another and plot to overthrow Wu and restore the Emperor to some degree of power."

 qiecoup.2.t: "A Clandestine Meeting"
 qiecoup.2.d: "In the basement of a shady Beijing bar, traditionally used as a cover for revolutionary activities, a strange coalition of individuals dedicated to overthrowing Wu Peifu and his rule over China has gathered. First is Pujie, the emperor's brother and a general in the Army, one of the few non-Zhili generals allowed to command significant numbers of troops. Next to him sits Y. C. James Yen, a leading intellectual and head of the NCERA. Across from him sit Fang Zhijian and Ling Bin, two Baoding cadets, scarcely older than 25. The final member of this meeting is Zhili general Li Bingzhi. A monarchist, Bingzhi claims to have assembled a coalition of Zhili generals disgruntled with Wu’s inaction over the last few months.\n\nRealising that they are unable to beat the Zhili Clique on their own with their limited military resources, the plotters decide they must ask the leader of a neighbouring warlord clique for assistance.

 qiecoup.8.d: "The plotters have returned our request, promising they will take a firmly-anti concession stance while also attempting to modernise Chinese industry, infrastructure, and medicine. This is what the Marshal was looking for!"
 qiecoup.8.a: "Excellent! Let's hope they can deliver!"

 qiecoup.9.t: "Our Request was Refused!"
 qiecoup.9.d_yan: "Marshal Yan has refused the coup plotters request, saying that he was not interested in wealth or power. Furthermore, it appears Wu Peifu has caught wind of these attempts through a disheartened plotter, who tipped off the Marshal following Yan’s refusal."
 qiecoup.9.d_qu: "Governor Qu has refused our request! You should never see this unless you’re playing MP and your friend is being a dick. Tough break buddy."
 qiecoup.9.d_zhang: "Honoured Teacher Zhang has refused our request! You should never see this unless you’re playing MP and your friend is being a dick. Tough break buddy."
 qiecoup.9.a: "Damn it! We blew our one shot! Our one opportunity!"

 qiecoup.10.t: "Yan Accepts"
 qiecoup.10.d: "Marshal Yan has accepted the coup plotters request for aid. He agrees he will deploy his troops should the Zhili Clique not be fully destroyed in the coup. At the same time, however, he will probably demand concessions once Puyi has been restored to his proper position."
 qiecoup.10.a: "Excellent!"

 qiecoup.11.t: "Qu Accepts"
 qiecoup.11.d: "Governor Qu has accepted the coup plotters request for aid. He agrees he will deploy his troops should the Zhili Clique not be fully destroyed in the coup. At the same time, however, he will probably demand concessions once Puyi has been restored to his proper position."
 qiecoup.11.a: "Excellent!"

 qiecoup.12.t: "Zhang Accepts"
 qiecoup.12.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang has accepted the coup plotters request for aid. He agrees to deploy his troops should the Zhili Clique not be fully destroyed in the coup. At the same time, however, he will probably demand concessions once Puyi has been restored to his proper position."
 qiecoup.12.a: "Excellent!"

 qiecoup.13.t: "A Plot is Uncovered!"
 qiecoup.13.d: "A bizarre conspiracy has been revealed to Wu Peifu! Apparently a group of disgruntled Manchu princes, reformers, and Zhili generals have been clandestinely plotting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and restore Puyi to a position of power! A member of this plot grew disgruntled once their foreign backer reneged his support, and instead came to Wu, betraying his erstwhile allies.\n\nWu has already dispatched police to raid the safehouses where the plotters have been meeting, and arrested a confused Puyi, who was apparently unaware of any plot in the first place! President Cao Kun went before a stunned assembly where he announced the charges, before announcing his resignation in shame for failing to discover the plot. With the end of the Qing dynasty, Marshal Wu Peifu will act as a temporary "National Protector" until a new government can be assembled."
 qiecoup.13.a: "Long Live the National Protector!"

 qiecoup.14.t: "Purging Traitors"
 qiecoup.14.d: "With the Manchu aristocracy removed as a political force, the question now remains what to be done with the Manchu generals in our military. The obvious answer is imprisoning them, but then what about all the Zhili generals that sided with them? Several are quite skilled, and removing them from our officer pool would have consequences. Still, it would ensure loyalty going forward."
 qiecoup.14.a: "Only purge the Manchu nobles. The rest can be rehabilitated."
 qiecoup.14.b: "Purge them all!"

 qiecoup.15.t: "The Aftermath"
 qiecoup.15.d: "With the Manchu royalist plotters dealt with, we now need to turn our eyes to reconstructing our government. It won’t be easy, but a new set of laws needs to be drafted that rectifies the errors of the Beiyang Constitution, and ensures China will be properly guided through these turbulent years."
 qiecoup.15.a: "We need to create a legitimate government!"

 qiecoup.16.t: "Ominous Troop Movements"
 qiecoup.16.d_yan: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shanxi Province over the last few days. It appears the troops are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of Shanxi. Governor Yan Xishan was our enemy just a few years ago during the Fourth Zhifeng War and an attack from him in these turbulent times to try and regain his lost lands would not be out of character."
 qiecoup.16.d_qu: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shandong Province over the last few days. It appears that large formations of troops are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of the peninsula. Governor Qu technically swore fealty to us, but backstabbing is not unusual among warlords..."
 qiecoup.16.d_zhang: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shandong Province over the last few days. It appears that large mobs of Yiguandao militiamen are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of the peninsula. Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran of the Yiguandao certainly is no ally of the Zhili Clique, and an attack on our territory would not be out of the question for him."
 qiecoup.16.a: "What's going on here? Dispatch more spies to investigate this."
 qiecoup.16.b: "We have more pressing matters to attend to."

 qiecoup.17.t: "Devious Machinations!"
 qiecoup.17.d_yan: "Our informants have discovered a dangerous plot! It appears Yan Xishan and several Manchu princes, reformers, and traitorous generals are attempting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and restore Puyi! We must deal with this quickly!"
 qiecoup.17.d_qu: "Our informants have discovered a dangerous plot! It appears Qu Yingguang and several Manchu princes, reformers, and traitorous generals are attempting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and restore Puyi! We must deal with this quickly!"
 qiecoup.17.d_zhang: "Our informants have discovered a dangerous plot! It appears Zhang Tianran and several Manchu princes, reformers, and traitorous generals are attempting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and restore Puyi! We must deal with this quickly!"
 qiecoup.17.a: "Arrest these plotters and prepare to invade Shandong!"
 qiecoup.17.b: "Arrest these plotters and prepare to invade Shanxi!"

 qiecoup.18.t: "Mysterious Occurrences"
 qiecoup.18.d: "Worrying news! It appears over the last few days anti-Zhili and anti-German pamphlets have been discovered distributed amongst some of our troops! When asked where they received this from, none were able to give a straight answer, with most saying it just appeared overnight.\n\nEven more worrying, several Zhili generals have dropped out of contact with Luoyang over the last few hours, notably including Li Bingzhi, whose monarchist sympathies are well-known. Even worse, Baoding Military Academy appears to have been abandoned overnight, and communications with far-flung parts of the empire have been interrupted due to widespread radio and telephone outages."
 qiecoup.18.a: "What's going on here?"

 qiecoup.19.t: "A Summons to Beijing"
 qiecoup.19.d: "While Wu is attempting to process the alarming developments that have occurred over the last few days, an urgent telegram arrived from Beijing. Cao Kun and Wu have been summoned to a meeting with the Emperor over the state of the country. Widespread riots are still a daily occurrence, and while the Emperor technically has the constitutional prerogative to summon his President, this has never occurred. While Wu may sense a trap, Cao Kun has already informed the Emperor that himself and Wu will present themselves to His Imperial Majesty later that week."
 qiecoup.19.a: "Damn you Cao Kun!"

 qiecoup.20.t: "Wu and Cao Prepare to Meet Puyi"
 qiecoup.20.d: "After arriving from Luoyang, Wu berated Cao for essentially inviting themselves into a trap. Still, the Jade Marshal is not one to go into a meeting like this without a trump card up his sleeve. As the two men prepare to enter the hall, Wu orders his bodyguards to wait outside the entrance to the chambers. The ceremonial bodyguards outside are unarmed except for traditional swords, and the Zhili soldiers have hidden pistols within their pockets..."
 qiecoup.20.a: "They enter the hall..."

 qiecoup.21.t: "Guards Rush into the Hall!"
 qiecoup.21.d: "As the two men enter and kneel before the emperor, around a dozen heavily armed Royal guards rush into the room! Surrounding the emperor, they move forward and attempt to arrest the two men, while Puyi flees the room! Upon hearing the commotion, Wu’s bodyguards outside quickly dispatch the ceremonial guards and rush in, while Wu and Cao duck behind pillars to avoid getting hit. Bullets fly back and forth among the ancient pillars of the hall, smashing priceless artefacts and wounding Cao Kun. When the bullets stop, however, one side emerges victorious."
 qiecoup.21.a: "Wu and Cao are killed! The coup succeeds!"
 qiecoup.21.b: "The Royal bodyguards lie dead on the ground!"

 qiecoup.22.t: "The Emperor Asserts Himself"
 qiecoup.22.d: "Puyi nervously re-enters the room, gazing down at the bullet-riddled bodies of the former Jade Marshal and his mentor, President Cao Kun. Pujie and another small group of Manchu loyalist guardsmen enter as well, all carrying submachine guns. ‘Dearest brother - I believe it’s time for you to make a speech.’ Puyi turns from the corpses and looks at Pujie. ‘I-’ he begins, his voice uncertain. ‘I am not sure if I can do that.’ Pujie is about to say something when General Li Bingzhi, the leader of the Zhili deserters, bursts into the room.\n\n'My lord! The city is secure!’ He says, kowtowing almost to the ground facing Puyi. ‘But Jiang Baili and several other Zhili generals have retreated to Luoyang! They are planning to launch a campaign to destroy us and liberate Beijing!’ Pujie moves over to Puyi, and whispers in his ear. ‘You are the Emperor now - you must act like one!’ Puyi nervously attempts to gather himself. ‘I - the Xuantong Emperor, Son of Heaven, formally proclaim any members of the Zhili Clique who do not swear fealty to me by tomorrow no-’ His voice cracks, and he is forced to steady himself. ‘Who do not do so by tomorrow noon to be traitors to the Great Qing!’"
 qiecoup.22.a: "Death to Traitors!"

 qiecoup.23.t: "Honouring Our Obligation"
 qiecoup.23.d: "We have received word from Beijing that the coup plan has gone off without a hitch! Wu Peifu and Cao Kun were killed in a shootout in the Forbidden City, and Manchu generals and some Zhili who deserted are mobilising their forces to destroy those loyal to the old regime. It’s time to honour our obligation to the Emperor and destroy these traitors!"
 qiecoup.23.a: "Destroy the traitors!"

 qiecoup.24.t: "The Countercoup"
 qiecoup.24.d: "Following Cao and Wu’s narrow escape from death in the Throne Room, Wu’s bodyguards dispersed throughout the palace, gunshots echoing throughout the halls as they encounter sporadic Manchu loyalist resistance. A few minutes later, they burst back into the throne room, dragging a terrified Puyi with them. Wu, standing above the prostrated Puyi, gestures to a bodyguard. Drawing a pistol, he grabs Puyi behind him and leads him to the door. Outside, a small group of courtiers and hangers on have gathered, along with the Emperor’s brother, Pujie, and several other Qing nobles. Opening the door to the audience chamber, Wu steps forward, flanked by the Emperor and his captor.\n\n’Your plot has failed, traitors.’ He twists his mouth into a smirk, before gesturing the bodyguard to pull the emperor back into the room. ‘One step forward - and the Son of Heaven dies.’\n\nSecretly, Wu is terrified. But this will not be the first time he has cheated death. ‘You will all enter the throne room, where my guards will ensure you are watched over well. President Cao!’ he turns to the head of the Assembly, who at this point has retreated into the room himself. ‘Take some guards and get over to the Assembly chamber as fast as you can!’ He glances back at Puyi. ‘The time has come to end the Empire. China shall be a Republic once more.’\n\nA few hours later, once Zhili troops have raided the plotting rooms, documents are found implicating neighbouring warlords. Wu is quick to immediately declare them traitors, and mobilise his troops for war."
 qiecoup.24.a: "Death to Traitors!"

 qiecoup.25.t: "Victory!"
 qiecoup.25.d: "Reports have returned to the Imperial Palace that our troops have reached the Yellow River. The scattered Zhili garrisons around Beijing proved to be little match for the Baoding-led armies, and General Zaitao's Manchu loyalists assisted in harrying retreating Zhili troops as they attempted to flee to Luoyang. Many troops simply deserted to our forces, as the thought of serving a leaderless army with little concentrated political backing was unappealing.\n\nOur forces are now ready to begin an assault on Luoyang, Wu Peifu's old stronghold, currently being defended by forces under General Jiang Baili, Wu's second in command. Securing this fortress will be the beginning of the end for the Zhili Clique."
 qiecoup.25.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.26.t: "Victory in Luoyang!"
 qiecoup.26.d: "A telegram arrived this morning from Luoyang, confirming that our troops were victorious in storming the walls of the fortified city. Following hours of concentrated artillery bombardment, loyal troops crossed the river in impromptu barges, sustaining heavy fire. Once ashore, however, they quickly secured control over a beachhead, allowing more and more of our troops to land and begin attacking Zhili units garrisoned in the city. Fighting among the ancient grotto and temples that dot the city, our troops eventually stormed the Zhili headquarters, killing Jiang Baili. Other generals managed to escape, and Zhili troops have scattered throughout the surrounding countryside looting and pillaging even as they flee our forces."
 qiecoup.26.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.27.t: "Victory in the South!"
 qiecoup.27.d: "The last few weeks have seen intense fighting across the southern reaches of our territory, as the die-hard supporters of Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique were hunted down and destroyed. Especially vicious was the fighting on all routes leading in to Wuhan, as the last remnants of the Zhili Command prepare to organise a desperate last-stand in the ancient city. With the isolated garrisons destroyed, we can turn our eyes on securing this city and destroying the Zhili once and for all."
 qiecoup.27.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.28.t: "Victory in Wuchang!"
 qiecoup.28.d: "In a final all-out assault our forces, bolstered by ranks of Zhili deserters, finally stormed Wuhan, destroying the remaining Zhili forces and capturing or killing many senior Zhili generals. With victory finally secured, we can now start to focus on rebuilding our country, and rearing it from both the ravages of the conflict we just endured and the decades of rampant corruption we were subjected to under the Zhili."
 qiecoup.28.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.29.t: "Prosperity League Dissolves!"
 qiecoup.29.d: "Following our recent upheavals, the Prosperity League has abruptly dissolved, citing a 'hostile atmosphere', with many of their prominent lobbyists leaving for Tianjin. While the German legation remains in Beijing, they have cut themselves off from any government contact, robbing us of German military and industrial support. The people, however are overwhelmingly in favour of this move, and are praising the new government for ridding itself of foreign influences."
 qiecoup.29.a: "We don't need them!"

 qiecoup.30.t: "Sending aid to the Qing?"
 qiecoup.30.d: "Now that we have helped the Qing overthrow the despotic Wu Peifu, should we aid them in their campaign to destroy the Zhili remnants?"
 qiecoup.30.a: "Yes. Send the funds."
 qiecoup.30.b: "No."

 qiecoup.31.t: "Our Allies Send Aid!"
 qiecoup.31.d: "Our noble ally has sent us a great deal of money to help defeat the traitorous Zhili remnants hiding in the south!"
 qiecoup.31.a: "Thank you!"

 qiecoup.32.t: "The Qing Elections of [GetYear]"
 qiecoup.32.d: "The time has come for the long-promised elections, since the turmoil of the provisional government following the Manchu Coup has finally eased into political stability. While there are of course multiple political parties running, the only real contender is the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], in light of their clear successes in reforming Chinese politics and restoring our nation's greatness. While there might be a few accusations of corruption, that'd hardly be a novelty for China, and can anyone deny that the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] deserve another victory?"
 qiecoup.32.a: "The peasants prevail once again!"
 qiecoup.32.b: "The YCP still has the best interests of China at heart."
 qiecoup.32.c: "The Aristocracy is clearly capable."
 qiecoup.32.e: "Let's see the results of our years of preparations."

 qiecoup.33.t: "The Last Qing Elections?"
 qiecoup.33.d: "Clearly, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has proved triumphant over all obstacles in its path to reunite, reform and re-assert China's greatness. They only needed one more election to consolidate their power over the renewed Qing Empire!"
 qiecoup.33.a: "China requires a firmer hand before democracy can truly blossom."
 qiecoup.33.b: "Only the party can lead the nation!"
 qiecoup.33.c: "The nobles will continue to guide China for centuries more!"
 qiecoup.33.e: "The NCERA and Yiguandao bring about a benevolent Empire!"
 qiecoup.33.f: "Nobility and Peasantry restore harmony to the Empire!"

 qiecoup.34.t: "The New Order"
 qiecoup.34.d: "With the regime solidified we find ourselves not a party to be compromised and haggled with, but obeyed and groveled to. This has not gone unnoticed in the Assembly either; already, party officials outside the [QIE.GetRulingParty] have either been cowed into silence or brought on board into the new ruling order of the day."
 qiecoup.34.a: "The NCERA already bend the knee."
 qiecoup.34.b: "The YCP are wise to respect our guiding hand."
 qiecoup.34.c: "The Zongshe know working with us is their only way to maintain relevance."
 qiecoup.34.e: "As the Assembly submits to our authority, so too does the Middle Kingdom!"

 qieelection.1.t: "Elections shake up the Assembly!"#Zongshe were allied prior
 qieelection.1.d: "After years of preparations due to the diligent efforts of Qu Yingguang and James Yen the Assembly swells with newly elected members after nearly 4 years of being a rump political body and decades without a true popular mandate. As the newly elected Assemblymen take their seats in Beijing a new governing coalition may need to take shape to more accurately reflect the will of the people. While the NCERA has a clear electoral victory compared to their competitors a broader coalition could still be in the cards in hopes to secure a stable transition for this newborn democracy.\n\nAmong the victorious members of the NCERA there is a consensus forming that they may in fact be the only force keeping democratic values alive in the empire and wish to close ranks to keep out any authoritarian tendencies in the ruling government.\n\nThe Zongshe, meanwhile, contend that they would make for a steady right hand as the country is brought into the broader world. Emphasising both their private and foreign connections as well as the burgeoning growth of a homegrown industrial class under their auspices; the Zongshe promise that a level of cooperation with industrialists and the old guard will ensure a smooth transition into orderliness and prosperity across the empire.\n\nSurprisingly the Young China Party had a surge in the polls as the election drew near, clearly showing their message of a stronger more centralised China focused on more radical modernisation and centralisation has a growing appeal in the war-torn provinces weary of warlords and division."
 qieelection.1.a: "The NCERA pulls away from the right establishing a constitutional front!"
 qieelection.1.b: "Form a coalition with the Zongshe and declare a mandate for economic growth."

 qieelection.2.t: "Elections shake up the Assembly!"#YCP or no one was allied prior

As China embraces modernity the nobility find themselves increasingly stripped of influence in a true democracy.\n\nSurprisingly the Young China Party had a surge in the polls as the election drew near, clearly showing their message of a stronger more centralised China focused on more radical modernisation and centralisation has a growing appeal in the war-torn provinces weary of warlords and division. They seek to legitimise their gains by formally joining a ruling coalition if it means the Chinese state can more closely align with their beliefs."
 qieelection.2.a: "The NCERA pulls away from the right establishing a constitutional front!"
 qieelection.2.b: "A deal is struck with the YCP promising greater centralisation for the vast empire."

 qieelection.3.t: "The Qing Elections of [GetYear] A New Era in Politics"
 qieelection.3.d: "Constitutional reform has been met with approval by many progressives lauding the expansion of rights and improving the efficiency of the government while also satisfying the Manchu nobility for preserving the institutional authority of the Emperor. In the countryside, Yan Yangchu and Liang Shuming have launched successful literacy campaigns among the peasantry that has improved access to education and rebuild village connections across the Empire. Reforms in the countryside have also significantly reduced the strain on Imperial bureaucracy by promoting local autonomy. Somewhat ironically, this strategy of political decentralization has seemingly improved the cohesion of the Empire.\n\nThis democratic renaissance has caused the influence of the Zongshe to dwindle to the point of political irrelevance. As calls for reform grow louder the old guard conservatives find themselves increasingly out of touch and incapable of providing meaningful policy. Constantly undermined and quieted in any political discourse; their light clearly no longer illuminates the halls of power.\n\nThe last four years have also given rise to different voices in politics. One of the loudest is the Chinese Youth Party. The YCP are politically conservative with an emphasis on Chinese tradition, but stress the need for mass mobilisation and class collaboration, with the citizen as the foundation of a new Chinese society. Their literature and party branches have started cropping up in nearly every corner of the Empire, with particular focus in major cities and universities. Since the restoration of Imperial authority they have made significant inroads among many urban intellectuals, student organizations, and even high profile military officers. They are now poised to make their way into the Government. Allowing them into our Coalition can certainly prove useful in expanding our appeal to the urban masses and military. Though we might consider as well maintaining our focus in the countryside as the basis of our national reconstruction efforts."
 qieelection.3.a: "The Empire is committed to our present strategy in the countryside"
 qieelection.3.b: "The Youths will help inspire and reforge the Empire with their bold vision!"

 qieelection.4.t: "[GetYear] Elections - Choosing a vision for a New China"
 qieelection.4.d: "The last four years have proven to be quite productive for all members of the ruling coalition. Together in the Assembly a series of reforms have been passed with the term 'New China' characterising these efforts - a vision of rebirth, prosperity, and healing in contrast to the devastation of the last century. Meanwhile, the governing parties began to fissure in pursuit of their own agendas throughout Chinese society.\n\nIn the countryside, Liang Shuming's rural reconstruction efforts have begun to pay dividends;  the new schools are producing many graduates who take what they've learned back to their villages and greatly heightening the quality of peasant life in the process. Schools and economic cooperatives are proving much more successful than previous state-run efforts. Furthermore, rural militia training and reorganization has led to successful defenses against ever-decreasing numbers of bandit attacks. Vast improvements to the welfare of the peasantry are expected if these programs continue.\n\nThe China Youth Party has also taken the initiative to spread their platform of mass mobilisation to the towns and cities. Rallies and student organizations promote the YCP's 'Plebiscitarian Politics' nationwide; drawing in intellectuals, university students, and even the urban working class. Party Membership has also soared among National Army officers ever since the YCP put together new patriotic curricula at the Dongbei military academy. Altogether this has greatly enhanced the YCP's efforts in creating a new socially and politically mobilised Chinese citizen.\n\nWith a New China being born and the coalition drifting apart, the electorate must now decide between these two visions of the future. Will the NCERA prevail, rebirthing China anew from the traditional villages and country towns? Or will the YCP's methods of political and ideological mobilisation in the cities, universities, and army provide new lifeblood for the Chinese nation in the form of the citizen?"
 qieelection.4.a: "The NCERA will birth the Chinese nation anew in the countryside"
 qieelection.4.b: "The YCP's new Chinese citizen will be the foundation of our revived nation"

 qieelection.5.t: "Mapping out the Electorate"
 qieelection.5.d: "In any democratic state the importantance of representation cannot be understated. Where exactly these representatives come from and what blocs of people end up electin them into office is a very important detail though. We will have to direct the Assembly to meticulously revise the voting districts if we want to move forward with our reforms."
 qieelection.5.a: "The Assembly will have to hash this out detail by detail."
 qieelection.5.b: "Gerrymandering is a very normal part of the democratic process!"

 qieelection.6.t: "Polling Infrastructure Needs"
 qieelection.6.d: "The actual mechanics of a functioning democracy are quite demanding for a nation as large as China. Across the land people have to be informed of their rights, the election parameters, the candidates running, the actual election locations themselves, and of course, we will have to collect the votes to be counted. Such a massive undertaking will require the government to invest a substantial amount of time and money to turn these lofty ideals into something that can actually be useful to the state."
 qieelection.6.a: "The people need access to the levers of power."
 qieelection.6.b: "Our limited treasury should be focused on military matters."
 qieelection.6.c: "The polling stations will be party strongholds."

 qieelection.7.t: "Empowering the Local Assemblies"
 qieelection.7.d: "As it stands, the local assemblies serve no function other than figureheads the populace can elect. If given more relevant power in their jurisdictions they could prove to be a vector of relief for the overburdened bureaucracy in Beijing.\n\nIf we have secured the loyalty of the rural villages we can rest assured in the knowledge that local democracy won't crop up subversive elements into the national government."
 qieelection.7.a: "Elections are called in regional governments within our territory"
 qieelection.7.b: "Appoint competent candidates from the capital for an eventual smooth transition."

 qieelection.8.t: "Results of Electoral Reforms"
 qieelection.8.d: "For decades China has had multiple attempts at implementing democracy across the country. Both Republican and Imperial attempts at implementing such reforms have descended into palpable corruption, bloody insurrection, or toothless rubber-stamps for their lords on high. After more than a year of concerted government attention on reforming the process of electoral politics, Qu Yingguang oversees the last touches to his revision of democracy in the heartland. Now he can only look on to see if his own efforts for Chinese democracy will prove to be the beginning of something greater or just another folly attempt in service of a corrupt authoritarian regime."
 qieelection.8.a: "The work of a lifetime still lies ahead of us."
 qieelection.8.b: "What seeds have we sown for our people."

 qiefocus.1.t: "Chinese New Year: Rat"
 qiefocus.1.d: "In a long, somewhat rambling speech to mark the Chinese New Year, Assembly President Cao Kun addressed the need to restore the glory of the Qing Empire, unite the country, and repay the debt burdening the economy. He laid out a three point plan: Government subsidies and tax cuts would be given to light manufacturing industries, farmers would be granted tax cuts to grow edible plants instead of cash crops, and an increased tax on provincial governors."
 qiefocus.1.a: "The speech is met with polite applause"

 qiefocus.2.t: "Emergency Meeting of the Zhili"
 qiefocus.2.d: "Following the collapse of the League to the south we have gathered nearly all senior Zhili-aligned military officers in Luoyang. As the meeting starts, Marshal Wu Peifu opens with a short statement.\n\n'Fellow soldiers - the time has come. With the collapse of the League we are - for the first time since the Zhifeng war - in a precarious situation. Every choice we make over the next few weeks will determine the outcome of China for decades to come.'\n\n'I would like to remind some' he says, glancing at the more hawkish members of the assembly 'that intervention is not necessarily the most sound course of action. We need to weigh our options first before committing.'\n\nThe various generals nod in agreement, and begin a series of discussions on the best course of action."
 qiefocus.2.a: "We need to be careful..."

 qiefocus.3.t: "New Elections"
 qiefocus.3.d: "Our decision to support the Anqing government has been met with great support and approval from the population. In response, Marshal Wu has 'persuaded' Assembly President Cao Kun to declare a national election to capitalise on our new support. Theoretically all literate men in China are eligible to participate, but local warlords, widespread chaos in the League, and other issues means that we only expect results from areas under our direct control. Previous elections have seen razor-thin margins, and while the body is largely powerless a buffer in the number of seats under our control will bolster our legitimacy in the long run."
 qiefocus.3.a: "Schedule the elections"

 qiefocus.4.t: "Drafting a New Constitution"
 qiefocus.4.d: "Following the overthrow of the Qing Empire, Wu Peifu assembled a group of constitutional and legal scholars to help him create a new government for China. Holding the city of Beijing gave him some level of legitimacy, and the military power he possesses gives any document he chooses to adopt force behind it.\n\nWith the question of legitimacy solved, the pressing question Wu has to answer is the form of the constitution. In order to save time and expedite the centralisation of China, he could simply adopt the last non-monarchist constitution of China, the 1923 one created by President Cao Kun. This, however, is rife with loopholes, opportunities for executive abuse, and other problems. Wu and the scholars he has assembled could draft their own constitution, though this would take time and political capital."
 qiefocus.4.a: "Re-adopt Cao Kun's old constitution"
 qiefocus.4.b: "Draft a new constitution"

 qiefocus.5.t: "Power of the Executive"
 qiefocus.5.d: "The first issue confronting Wu's constitutional scholars is the level of power the executive should possess. It is unsaid, of course, that Wu and the Zhili Clique will guide the executive through these trying times, but once China is unified there is a general understanding that Wu's government will (gradually) transition into some form of democracy.\n\nWith that being said, a strong executive guarantees stability, while an empowered legislative body is better at generating political capital and clout."

 qiefocus.6.d: "The next issue facing Wu's constitutional assembly is the level of autonomy for the provinces. Previous republican governments often came into conflict with the provincial administrations, and this - in part - lead to the current situation in China. Strong centralisation, on the other hand, ensures that orders issued by Beijing are followed better."
 qiefocus.6.a: "Allow the provinces some autonomy"
 qiefocus.6.b: "Keep it centralised"

 qiefocus.7.t: "Drafting Is Complete!"
 qiefocus.7.d: "After many hours spent hunched over desks writing and arguing over the legal minutia, we have a new constitution! Wu and the Zhili Clique will ensure that the new government is stable for the first few years of its existence, but once China is reunified many scholars are hopeful China can begin a transition into a real democracy."
 qiefocus.7.a: "Now all we need is a president!"

 qiefocus.8.t: "Selecting a President"
 qiefocus.8.d: "Despite being one of the foremost military minds in China, Wu Peifu's skills are not well-suited to the halls of government. Already, he fears military matters are falling to the wayside due to his duties as 'National Protector', and has ordered that the scholars drafting the constitution come up with a list of potential new presidents for the Republic. Two candidates have emerged: Scholar and intellectual Hu Shih, and diplomat and (briefly) former president V. K. Wellington Ku (Gu Weijun).\n\nHu is well-known for his theory of 'pragmatism' (shíyànzhuyì), a concept first originating in the United States in the 1870s and 80s. In Hu's writings, he advocates for cooperation with warlords and working to change the Chinese government from the inside-out, instead of ripping it down and rebuilding it like many in the KMT. Following the failure of the Northern Expedition this theory has gained many adherents, and is quite popular in academic circles.\n\nWellington Koo, on the other hand, is a diplomatic genius and politician, who attended the Versailles conference in 1919 as an observer, and helped negotiate several deals with American, German, and British diplomats, giving him a dearth of diplomatic experience that will no doubt be useful in legitimising our government."
 qiefocus.8.a: "Wu selects Hu Shih"
 qiefocus.8.b: "Wu selects Wellington Koo"

 qiefocus.9.t: "Inaugurating the New Republic"
 qiefocus.9.d: "In an elaborate ceremony today, Wu Peifu oversaw the swearing in of the new President of the Republic to adoring cheers. The assembly remains firmly in the hands of the Harmony Association, and many still question the legitimacy of this new regime. Still, Wu no longer has to contend with the Qing aristocracy as a potential opponent, and can instead concentrate on fixing the massive debt issues facing China, and starting to re-unify the fractured country.\n\nAdditionally, despite our best efforts to present our government as the legitimate government of China, few see us that way. We will need to either destroy or coerce the groups that oppose our regime, and convince the general population we are the true government of China!"
 qiefocus.9.a: "Congratulations, Mr. President!"

 qiefocus.10.t: "Debt and Legitimacy"
 qiefocus.10.d: "The debt issue continues to interfere with our economic efforts, and impedes our attempts to reinforce the legitimacy of our new government. While we could ask Germany for support, it is likely that this will cause our already unpopular government to collapse under public pressure. The much more shrewd plan is to take an anti-concession stance, defaulting on our debt but earning us the loyalty of our population."
 qiefocus.10.a: "Default. It's the only choice."

 qiefocus.11.t: "The Future of the Zhili Clique"
 qiefocus.11.d: "The Zhili Clique, like every other warlord clique in China, operates primarily on a basis of seniority and on mentor-mentee relationships. While (usually) providing stability and helping reduce the possibility of back-stabbing, also stifles meritocracy and promotions based on skill. With the recent deaths and advancing age of many senior generals, however, we may be forced to take drastic action, and promote younger officers to the forefront of our military.\n\nFour candidates have emerged for elevation to the full general corps: Guo Jijiao, Wang Lingyun, Du Xijun and Wei Yisan."
 qiefocus.11.a: "Promote these promising young men! Now to start our defence plan."

 qiefocus.12.t: "A Defence Plan for China"
 qiefocus.12.d: "Following Wu Peifu’s call for a meeting of senior Zhili generals, a large number have arrived in Luoyang, leaving their subordinates in charge of front-line duties. The first pressing concern is picking a centralised defence strategy for the inevitable war with Japan and the Fengtian government. The northern traitor’s growing boldness in the wake of the League collapse has alarmed many senior commanders, including Jiang Baili and Liu Menggeng. The two men have spent the last few weeks codifying plans they have been developing over the last two years and have presented them to the assembled Zhili commanders. Jiang’s focuses on large-scale defensive fortifications, moving industry to the interior of China, and rousing the ‘fighting spirit’ of China in order to defeat Japan.\n\nWhile not a direct opposite to Jiang’s plan, Liu’s plan focuses more on improving the fighting capability of Zhili troops. Improved morale, drill standards, and logistical support are key, at least in his eyes, of ensuring Chinese victory. Updated medical care also plays a crucial part of the strategy. Both are compelling plans, but it is up to Wu Peifu to ultimately decide."
 qiefocus.12.a: "Pick Jiang Baili's plan"
 qiefocus.12.b: "Pick Liu Menggeng's plan"

 qiefocus.13.t: "Position of the Emperor"
 qiefocus.13.d: "As we begin to reorganise the state following the fall of the vile Zhili clique, the rump Assembly is calling for the monarchy's role to be enshrined more directly in the legal framework. There is general consensus among many in court that the Emperor's position can only be maintained with a strict adherence to non-intervention in matters of state policy. However, there is also a small but vocal minority, particularly among idealogues of the late Kang Youwei, calling for the safeguarding of Imperial prerogative if the Assembly finds itself deadlocked in a state of crisis."
 qiefocus.13.a: "We need a ruler above the fray of politics."
 qiefocus.13.b: "The Assembly should have a guiding hand if the need arises."

 qiefocus.14.t: "Rebuilding our Command Structure"
 qiefocus.14.d: "Following the purge of many senior members of the Zhili Clique, our army has been left without much of a command structure. It has fallen on Li Bingzhi, one of the few Zhili deserters, and two Aisin-Gioro princes, the Emperor's uncle Zaitao and his younger brother Pujie, to reform the Imperial command structure. This will not be an easy task, as Wu and his cronies essentially did away with a modern divisional structure based on meritocratic promotion in favour of cronyism and nepotism. While their reforms will take time to implement, they have decided to fill out the thin roster of senior commanders with Fang Zhijian and Liang Bin, two young Baoding cadets who helped overthrow the Zhili. Though inexperienced, with any luck they will learn quickly."
 qiefocus.14.a: "Excellent"

 qiefocus.16.t: "The Uneasy Coalition"
 qiefocus.16.d: "While all of the reformist parties were formally united in their desire to overthrow the Zhili, now that the dust has settled following the coup they find themselves in an uneasy position. Japan and the Fengtian loom large, and they must work together in order to avoid annihilation. Yet at the same time the different reform groups have differing goals and objectives, and varying things they can contribute to the military. Puyi and his advisors need the support of each of the parties and their military wings to win the eventual war with Japan, but doing so will come at a cost..."
 qiefocus.16.a: "This is still better than the Zhili."

 qiefocus.17.t: "The Yellow Sand Society"
 qiefocus.17.d: "In addition to the Rural Defence Forces employed by the NCERA, the Yellow Sands Society, an esoteric sect with connections to the Yiguandao, have offered to join our army. They are fierce fighters, and relatively loyal given our new anti-concession stance, but some fear accepting their offer to join our army will allow the Yiguandao yet another opportunity to infiltrate as well."
 qiefocus.17.a: "Offer them a place in the army."
 qiefocus.17.b: "No, this is too risky."

 qiefocus.18.t: "The Emergency Government"
 qiefocus.18.d.zhang: "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Complicating matters, however, is the fact that Zhang Tianran has stated his outright refusal to work with the YCP, pushing instead for the NCERA and Zongshe to carry the torch of tradition and rural reform. Zhang Tianran hopes to guide China into a more harmonious future. We cannot hope to overrule his suggestion, we have only begun to find an accord with the Honoured Master."
 qiefocus.18.d.qu: "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Qu Yingguang has already sent word ahead of his arrival advising for a unified response by the new emerging government. Traditionally minded, the Society of Restoring Benevolence is pushing for the Zongshe Party to be picked, owing to their conservative agenda. However the new Governor has made it clear that we must act resolutely if we are to secure our new position, regardless of who takes the leading role in immediate affairs."
 qiefocus.18.d.yan: "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Yan Xishan, for his part, sends word to the capital ahead of his formal welcoming demanding decisive and swift political action. The new man of the hour seems intent on driving a wedge between the surviving parties in Beijing. Each party has received word privately encouraging the drafting of new plans from which the Model Governor can choose to implement. It appears we may have traded one strongman for another."
 qiefocus.18.a: "Favour the Zongshe Party."
 qiefocus.18.b: "Favour the YCP."
 qiefocus.18.c: "Favour the NCERA."

 qiefocus.19.t: "Fall of the Zongshe"
 qiefocus.19.d: "Whether by imprecise political maneuver or sheer incompetence the Zongshe party has found itself completely stripped of all influence from government proceedings. Time and again we have been overruled and outmaneuvered in administrative policy to the point that our positions are held in name-only. With this embarrassing demise just about complete, it's clear a new party will need to take over stewardship of the empire- if only to save it from the folly of aristocratic machinations."
 qiefocus.19.a: "The New Chinese Empire Reform Association will take the reins of power more seriously."
 qiefocus.19.b: "The Young China Party will surely be less incompetent."

 qiefocus.20.t: "Kuomintang Sympathies Suspected"
 qiefocus.20.d: "As the guerillas turned National Revolutionary Army campaign in the south a steadily rising fear has begun to grip the Assembly in Beijing. With the regime still being in it's infancy many among the YCP and Zongshe have openly called for a crackdown on suspected leftists in the empire. Thousands of miles away from any Kuomintang heartland it's clear the real target of this vitriol is the NCERA, more specifically, the Rural Reconstruction Movement which makes up half of the NCERA coalition. Certainly it is true the organization existed before the restoration of the Qing and there were ties between it and many republicans, but it's clear that this move towards punitive action is a dagger pointed towards domestic opponents."
 qiefocus.20.a: "Keep tabs on anyone with suspected ties."
 qiefocus.20.b: "Investigate the Rural Reconstruction Movement thoroughly."
 qiefocus.20.c: "A thorough purge will safeguard the Empire."

 qiefocus.21.t: "Yiguandao Contributions"
 qiefocus.21.d: "In the wake of the Honored Master the Qing dynasty is finding its standing with the people renewed and reaffirmed. Recently Zhang Tianran has become further emboldened in his attempts to bind the court to the Yiguandao ever closer. In return for more Imperial appointments of the faithful the Yiguandao will perform ever grander service to the Emperor as a sign of their submission. While the state comes to rely on the Yiguandao, perhaps so shall the Yiguandao come to rely on the state."
 qiefocus.21.a: "Expanding the Imperial Road Network would be incredibly helpful."
 qiefocus.21.b: "We should have a second coronation to show the people our own commitment to renewal."
 qiefocus.21.c: "Deputise the militias as a permament irregular force within the military."
 qiefocus.21.e: "The People should rest easy knowing the Emperor will protect them."

 qiefocus.22.t: "A New Coronation?"
 qiefocus.22.d: "An unusual idea has been circulating among the Qing nobility over the last few weeks - organising a second coronation for Puyi. They claim that since the Restoration of 1927 was carried out under the supervision of the Zhili Clique it was not really 'proper' and that a new reinstating ceremony must be carried out in order to appease the traditions of the empire. The cost for this would be staggeringly high, but it may give us some legitimacy, and will earn us further support from the nobles."
 qiefocus.22.a: "Organise the ceremony!"
 qiefocus.22.b: "We will make it a massive celebration for the capital!"
 qiefocus.22.c: "This is a waste of money..."

 qiefocus.23.t: "The Dynasties Arrive"
 qiefocus.23.d: "Over the last few days the Marquis of Extended Grace, Duke Minsheng, and other various descendants of old Imperial dynasties have arrived in Beijing. One by one they file past the Emperor, silently bowing to pay their respects. In a novel first, a court photographer has been tasked with capturing each of these submissions, and they will be distributed as propaganda to both prove the legitimacy of the Emperor, and erode any support for a non-Aisin Gioro ruling family."
 qiefocus.23.a: "Excellent!"

 qiefocus.24.t: "Our New Benefactor"
 qiefocus.24.d: "Ever since the coup that toppled the Zhili Clique, the future of our government remained uncertain. Now, however, the warlord that helped overthrow Wu is set to depart for Beijing, where we expect much of their agenda to be revealed..."
 qiefocus.24.a: "Welcome Governor Yan to Beijing!"
 qiefocus.24.b: "Welcome Governor Qu to Beijing!"
 qiefocus.24.c: "Welcome Honoured Teacher Zhang to Beijing!"

 qiefocus.25.t: "Our Future Relationship with Germany"
 qiefocus.25.d: "Following our victory over Fengtian and the Japanese, senior Zhili diplomats are now considering the best course of action in regards to our continued relationship with [GER.GetName]. While we are too far from Europe to join the Reichspakt, we may still be able to negotiate a treaty of cooperation and protection. However, other senior officials are arguing we should focus inward on rebuilding our war-ravaged nation."
 qiefocus.25.a: "Request a guarantee of independence."
 qiefocus.25.b: "Focus on rebuilding China instead."

 qiefocus.26.t: "A Request from Beijing"
 qiefocus.26.d: "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested to join the Reichspakt. This is an interesting opportunity - they could be a powerful ally in the East, having already bested the Fengtian Government and the Japanese Empire. At the same time though, they could drag us into wars far from home we care little about."
 qiefocus.26.a: "Grant them entry."
 qiefocus.26.b: "Refuse. They are a liability."

 qiefocus.27.t: "A Request from Beijing"
 qiefocus.27.d: "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested a guarantee of independence from us. This is an interesting opportunity - they were instrumental in defeating Japan, and this would not be binding for any of their aggressive wars."
 qiefocus.27.a: "Sign the guarantee."
 qiefocus.27.b: "Refuse. They are a liability."

 qiefocus.28.t: "Reorganisation of Warlord Divisions"
 qiefocus.28.d: "Many Zhili warlords possess personal armies that they use to guard the provinces they govern. The fighting capabilities of these troops, however, are sub-par at best. They lack standardisation and are more used to shaking down peasant farmers for cash than fighting pitched battles. Wu Peifu, as part of his overall plan to prepare the Zhili military for the inevitable conflict with Japan, has proposed reorganising retraining these personal divisions according to the national division standards. This plan has met with considerable opposition from Zhili generals, but we can overrule their concerns with significant political capital.\n\nIf we proceed with the reorganisation, the new divisions should be ready in three months. If not, we can reorganise them at our own leisure, but it will be difficult to procure enough equipment."
 qiefocus.28.a: "Begin the reorganisation."
 qiefocus.28.b: "We have better things to worry about."

 qiefocus.29.t: "Reorganised Divisions Complete Training"
 qiefocus.29.d: "The private militias, with considerable effort and training, have finished their reorganisation, and are now equipped with the best supplies we have. This should significantly help us in our fight against Japan."
 qiefocus.29.a: "Great!"

 qiefocus.30.t: "Converting Baoding Military Cadets"
 qiefocus.30.d: "Our men have managed to infiltrate the various military academies within our lands, seeking to bring the promising upcoming generation of young Chinese to the rightful path of the Yiguandao."
 qiefocus.30.a: "Promote the promising candidates."

 qiefor.1.t: "A Request from Beijing"
 qiefor.1.d: "The newly-established 'Beijing Government', under [QIE.GetLeader] has requested we formally acknowledge their legitimate rule of China. We have yet to firmly align ourselves with Fengtian, and they have taken an anti-concession stance, making their government attractive to many in our country wary of Japanese and German influence. Should we refuse, we can expect a reprisal..."

We would have the ability to appoint a governor of our choosing, with many suggesting Aisin-Gioro Pugong, Puyi's Muslim cousin, as a candidate. Accepting would allow us to focus on more important areas for our reconquest, while refusal of the deal may lead them to seek Fengtian assistance."

Although we are not recognized by all as the legitimate government of China, bringing new lands and new leaders under our protection can be major steps toward that end.\n\nStill, our protection should not be taken advantage of. We must not see ourselves drawn into a conflict beyond our means for the betterment of some petty figure of regional stature. We should also avoid political deals we may later come to regret.\n\nUnsuprisingly, [XSM.GetLeader] demands the retention of his clan's western fifedoms, along with a degree of autonomy."

We have just received a request from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government, requesting we formally submit to their rule, giving us protection from Japan. We would still have a large degree of autonomy, but the expectation is that we would be directly integrated into the [FROM.GetAdjective] government once the war with Japan has concluded. The [FROM.GetAdjective] have made it clear we can still reach out to our German backers and ask for assistance, in order to sweeten the deal."

 qiefor.19.d.decision: "The traitorous rats in Beijing have launched a sneak attack on our former ally in Shanxi! Governor Yan Xishan has asked for our assistance in defeating [QIE.GetNameDef], but we cannot simply pivot to attacking them. Many of our generals fear our forces are unready for such a large conflict, and our Japanese backers have not yet signed off on such a quick attack. We can either override these generals at the cost of some political power, or wait the three months they say they need to prepare their troops, and inform Yan we will assist then.\n\nOf course, we could also refuse to get involved at all."
 qiefor.19.d_postcoup: "While reports are unclear of how exactly this occurred, it appears that Yan Xishan, governor of Shanxi and our former ally, was somehow involved in a coup attempt against the Zhili. We don't know the exact details, but the coup appears to have failed and now Zhili forces are mustering to attack Shanxi. While we want to defend our former ally, our forces have been caught off-guard. We can intervene immediately, though overruling our top generals will cost significant political power. Or, however, we can wait a few months to prepare our forces adequately, and hope that Governor Yan can hold on for that long.\n\nOf course, we could also refuse to get involved at all."

 qiefor.21.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has confessed that his forces were also caught off-guard by this sneak attack, but if we can hold on for three months, his troops will launch an attack on the Zhili positions. We will do what we can to resist!"
 qiefor.21.a: "Prepare our defences!"

 qiefor.211.t: "Fengtian Refuses Our Call for Aid"
 qiefor.211.d: "In an act of utter cowardice, Zhang Zuolin has chosen to refuse our call for aid, and now cowers beyond the Great Wall."
 qiefor.211.a: "Then we are on our own."

 qiefor.2111.t: "Fengtian Begins to Mobilise"
 qiefor.2111.d: "Our agents in Shenyang have reported growing signs that Fengtian is mobilising, and preparing to march its armies south against our defences at Shanhaiguan. Fortunately, our attack on Shanxi seems to have caught Zhang Zuolin by surprise, and it could take several months for his forces to move decisively."
 qiefor.2111.a: "At least we know he's coming."

 qiefor.22.t: "Qi Accepts Our Request!"
 qiefor.22.d: "Governor Qi has accepted our request for aid, and promises to send his troops north to destroy [FNG.GetNameDef]"
 qiefor.22.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.23.t: "Qi Refuses Our Request!"
 qiefor.23.d: "Governor Qi has refused our request, claiming matters 'internal security' took precedent. While this is unfortunate, our contacts within the Peking-Kommission told us they would begin to put pressure on Qi and 'encourage' him to intervene."
 qiefor.23.a: "So much for the help..."

 qiefor.24.t: "Rich Vein Discovered!"
 qiefor.24.d: "Following our recent focus on mining in the Shanxi region we have uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth. It is truly fortuitous we seized this area from Governor Yan during the last Zhifeng war! Our engineers have just discovered a new vein full of coal and iron ore. The only problem, however, is that it extends underground into Yan's territory. While we could mine this, Yan's engineers will no doubt notice the incursion.\n\nEver since the League Collapse, Yan has drawn closer and closer to Zhang Zuolin in Fengtian, who he was formerly allied with. Wu's advisors are warning him that this could very well escalate tensions between us and the Fengtian government."
 qiefor.24.a: "Dig deeply and greedily!"
 qiefor.24.b: "This is too risky..."

 qiefor.25.t: "[QIE.GetAdjectiveCap] Miners Approach Territory!"
 qiefor.25.d: "Governor! We have grave news! Our miners have discovered [QIE.GetName] tunnels extending into our territory! No doubt they are trying to secure the rich mineral wealth of our province for their own nefarious ends. We must protest this immediately!"
 qiefor.25.a: "Lodge a formal complaint."
 qiefor.25.b: "Our pact with Beijing is too important to risk."

 qiefor.26.t: "[SHX.GetNameDefCap] Protests our Miners!"
 qiefor.26.d: "Governor Yan Xishan has lodged a formal protest with the Bureau of Mines, claiming that our miners have violated his provinces' boundaries. Normally, we would simply ignore this, but Yan has also noted that should Beijing fail to act accordingly, he will seek out 'responsible government to address the problem' - a reference many are interpreting to mean [FNG.GetLeader] in Fengtian."
 qiefor.26.a: "Who cares? Keep mining!"
 qiefor.26.b: "Back down, this is getting risky."

 qiefor.27.t: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] Ignored Us!"
 qiefor.27.d: "Unsurprisingly, the [QIE.GetName] ignored our request. Their perfidious miners continue to extend their grasp into our vast mineral wealth, leaving us little other option than turning to the Fengtian government."
 qiefor.27.a: "Reach out to [FNG.GetLeader]"
 qiefor.27.b: "Fengtian can't help us. Back down."

 qiefor.28.t: "[QIE.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Backs Down!"
 qiefor.28.d: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] have quietly backed down! Their miners have left our territory, leaving us victorious."
 qiefor.28.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.29.t: "Shanxi Back Down!"
 qiefor.29.d: "Shanxi has backed down, letting our miners access the veins! This is a great victory, as our war machine can use these materials to gear up for the eventual conflict with Japan."
 qiefor.29.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.30.t: "Mining Disputes in Shanxi!"
 qiefor.30.d1: "Mining disputes on the Shanxi-[QIE.GetName] border have escalated over the last few months, and now Governor [SHX.GetLeader] is asking us to step in and guarantee his provincial borders. He was a staunch ally of ours during the last Zhifeng war, and his province controls valuable mineral resources we could use. Should we promise to protect him against the perfidious Zhili?"
 qiefor.30.d2: "Mining disputes on the Shanxi-[QIE.GetName] border have escalated over the last few months, and now Governor [SHX.GetLeader] is asking us to step in and guarantee his provincial borders. He was a staunch ally of ours during the last Zhifeng war, and his province controls valuable mineral resources we could use. However, we have already decided upon a strategy to combat the [QIE.GetName] together with Anqing. Going back on that might make them decide to not join our war."
 qiefor.30.a: "Time to step in!"
 qiefor.30.b: "Let's not do this."

 qiefor.31.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Steps In"
 qiefor.31.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has promised to guarantee our provincial borders against the Zhili! If Zhili miners continue to 'violate the boundaries of our province', he claims he will come to our aid."
 qiefor.31.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.32.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Protect Shanxi!"
 qiefor.32.d: "It appears that Yan was serious in his threat to reach out to the Fengtian - [FNG.GetLeader] has just announced he will protect the 'provincial integrity' of Shanxi against any 'rebel incursions'. This is a betrayal of the highest order and another sign that our national order has crumbled. We can either attempt to call Yan and Zhang's bluff if we feel strong enough, or back down, though that will cost us prestige."
 qiefor.32.a: "Call their bluff - move troops into the area!"
 qiefor.32.b: "This is too risky. Stand down."

 qiefor.33.t: "Skirmishes on the Border!"
 qiefor.33.d: "It appears the fools in Beijing did not listen! They have begun to move troops into the disputed mining areas! Already we are hearing reports of isolated skirmishes between border guards and Zhili troops! We must reach out to [FNG.GetLeader] for help at once!"
 qiefor.33.a: "Call [FNG.GetLeader] for aid!"

 qiefor.34.t: "Skirmishes on Shanxi-[QIE.GetNonIdeologyName] Border!"
 qiefor.34.d: "It appears that the [QIE.GetAdjective] have ignored our threats! Reports from Governor Yan indicate that Zhili advance forces moved into the disputed territories over the last week, and have begun to attack border garrisons. This could be the opportunity we have waited for - a chance to reverse the humiliation of 1927!"
 qiefor.34.a: "Honour our commitment. To war!"
 qiefor.34.b: "Back down. We can't beat them yet..."

 qiefor.35.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Attacks!"
 qiefor.35.d: "Our attempts to call Zhang Zuolin's bluff failed - he has begun mobilise his troops and formally declared war on us! We must ready our forces at once to destroy the Fengtian once and for all, and recreate our victory of 1927!"
 qiefor.35.a: "Ready the troops!"

 qiefor.36.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Back Down!"
 qiefor.36.d: "Our plan to call [FNG.GetLeader]'s bluff has succeeded! We have heard nothing from his government after we sent our troops into the disputed areas and we can now safely assume that we have free reign to do whatever we want with the Shanxi province! Let's destroy the traitorous Governor Yan and integrate the area directly!"
 qiefor.36.a: "Easy pickings!"
 qiefor.36.b: "We have bigger things to worry about."

 qiefor.37.t: "The [FNG.GetName] Back Down!"
 qiefor.37.d: "The traitorous [FNG.GetLeader] has let us down! Despite our request for assistance he has ignored us in the face of the [QIE.GetName]!"
 qiefor.37.a: "Damnation!"

 qiefor.38.t: "The Monarchists Demand We Submit!"
 qiefor.38.d: "It appears our attempts at isolation and rebuilding are in vain. The new Royalist government in Beijing is demanding we officially recognise their authority and submit to their rule. Our recent work with the NCERA, an integral part of the new imperial coalition, probably has something to do with this. Resisting would not be a smart move, as they can easily overpower and destroy us."
 qiefor.38.a: "We don't have much choice. Submit."
 qiefor.38.b: "Refuse! Our independence is too valuable."

 qiefor.39.t: "The Qing Demand We Submit!"
 qiefor.39.d: "The new Manchu royalist regime in Beijing is demanding that we formally submit to their authority and recognise Puyi as Emperor of China! Even worse, they demand that we cede all 'temporal control' to the Emperor's Muslim cousin, Pugong. We can always refuse this request, though a war against the central government will be challenging to win..."
 qiefor.39.a: "Submit, we don't have much choice."
 qiefor.39.b: "We will destroy them!"

 qiefor.40.t: "The Emperor Invites Us to Swear Fealty"
 qiefor.40.d: "While we did not help the Emperor orchestrate the coup that destroyed the Zhili Clique, we were overwhelmingly supportive of this change of events. Now, the Emperor is formally inviting Governor Qu to swear fealty to him and officially recognise him as Emperor of China!"
 qiefor.40.a: "Pack our bags, we're heading to Beijing!"
 qiefor.40.b: "Tell the Emperor we're... busy or something..."

 qiefor.41.t: "Tibet Offers to Swear Fealty"
 qiefor.41.d: "Tibet has recently sworn in a new governing party, the 'Young Tibet Party'. They have taken a pro-Monarchy stance and have decided to reach out to us for aid and support. While Tibet is certainly far-flung, collaboration with their regime certainly would not be harmful."
 qiefor.41.a: "Sure. Send them some token of our appreciation."
 qiefor.41.b: "Who cares about Tibet?"

 qiefor.42.t: "The Qing Accept!"
 qiefor.42.d: "The Qing have accepted our request, and sent us some financial aid."
 qiefor.42.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.43.t: "The Qing Refuse!"
 qiefor.43.d: "The Qing have refused our request, claiming Tibet is an integral part of China!"
 qiefor.43.a: "Damn!"

 qiefor.44.t: "How to Approach Tibet?"
 qiefor.44.d: "With our victory over Japan and our new centralisation efforts, we must now decide how to approach Tibet. Do we demand they join our country fully, or leave them independent and autonomous, albeit under our 'supervision'?"
 qiefor.44.a: "Keep them autonomous"
 qiefor.44.b: "Direct rule!"

 qiefor.45.t: "The Qing Demand We Surrender Some Autonomy!"
 qiefor.45.d: "Beijing has demanded that we submit fully to their rule, though we will still remain somewhat autonomous. This is probably the best deal we can hope to get."
 qiefor.45.a: "Submit, we have no choice."
 qiefor.45.b: "We will destroy them!"

 qiefor.46.t: "Qing Demands We Join the Empire!"
 qiefor.46.d: "The Qing, citing our past cooperation, have demanded we officially join the Empire, and submit to direct rule from Beijing!"
 qiefor.46.a: "We have no choice, accept."
 qiefor.46.b: "We will destroy them!"

 qiefor.47.t: "Tibet Accepts"
 qiefor.47.d: "Tibet has accepted our demand, and we have begun to carry out integrating Tibet."
 qiefor.47.a: "Great!"
 qiefor.47.b: "Great!"

 qiefor.48.t: "Tibet Refuses!"
 qiefor.48.d: "Tibet has refused our generous request! We must destroy these insolent yak herders!"
 qiefor.48.a: "Crush them!"

 qiefor.49.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Our Integration!"
 qiefor.49.d: "The rulers of Beijing have demanded that [ROOT.GetLeader] directly integrate his administration into the larger [From.GetAdjective] administration. We can accept, try and negotiate our autonomy, or refuse outright - though this will carry grave consequences."
 qiefor.49.a: "Submit and play as [From.GetName]."
 qiefor.49.b: "Try and negotiate for autonomy."
 qiefor.49.c: "Refuse!"

 qiefor.50.t: "[From.GetName] Attack Macau!"
 qiefor.50.d: "Early this morning [From.GetAdjective] troops began an attack on the outer fortifications of Macau, flagrantly violating our territorial integrity and international law! No doubt they are taking advantage of our current conflict to expand their influence. What should we do?"
 qiefor.50.a: "Put up a token resistance, then surrender."
 qiefor.50.b: "We will fight them!"

 qiefor.51.t: "Portugal Surrenders Macau!"
 qiefor.51.d: "Excellent news! Portuguese forces, facing our overwhelming superiority, surrendered control of Macau soon after our attack began. We allowed them to return home unmolested, and now the city is ours!"
 qiefor.51.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.52.t: "The Qing Prepare to Launch Reunification Campaign!"
 qiefor.52.d: "The backwards ingrates in Beijing have announced that within a few months they will embark on a 'National Pacification Campaign'! This is a worrying development, and many are concerned that our allies scattered across China will be destroyed unless we act. [FNG.GetLeader] has announced that he will aid any governor across China who promises to swear fealty to us once we have destroyed the Qing and secured Beijing."
 qiefor.52.a: "Send the telegrams!"

 qiefor.53.t: "The [FNG.GetName] Promises to Protect Us!"
 qiefor.53.d: "In the wake of [QIE.GetLeader]'s proclamation of the 'National Reunification Campaign', [FNG.GetLeader] has announced that he will protect any vulnerable warlords as long as they swear loyalty to him once the war has ended in his victory. We can either accept this deal, or try and weather out the storm on our own."
 qiefor.53.a: "We need the protection"
 qiefor.53.b: "We can beat those monarchists on our own!"

 qiefor.54.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Promises to Protect Warlords!"
 qiefor.54.d: "The traitorous [FNG.GetLeader] followed our announcement of the National Reunification Campaign with a proclamation of his own - that he will protect any warlords against our aggression! While this may make our war more challenging, already people are beginning to see this conflict as not just a reunification war but a struggle against Japan as well, and have begun to enthusiastically support the war effort."
 qiefor.54.a: "We will crush them!"

 qiefor.55.t: "The Qing Prepare their Campaign"
 qiefor.55.d: "Our erstwhile allies in Beijing have announced that they will soon embark on a 'National Pacification Campaign' - targeting [LEP.GetLeader]'s regime in the process. Should we send him aid in order to resist the Aisin-Gioro Clan's attacks attacks?"
 qiefor.55.a: "Send some supplies"
 qiefor.55.b: "They can beat some nomadic savages..."

 qiefor.56.t: "Singapur sends Aid!"
 qiefor.56.d: "Following the Qing proclamation of the 'National Pacification Campaign', [GEA.GetLeader] has directed his agents to supply us with large caches of weapons - with none of the usual promises for repayment demanded. It appears they greatly fear the resurgent Qing dynasty, and are going to use us as a bulwark against them."
 qiefor.56.a: "Thanks!"

#Anqing events
 qiefor.57.t: "Wuchang-Anqing Development"
 qiefor.57.d: "Following a suggestion by one of our officials in the China Council in the Anqing Clique, work has begun on developing the Wuchang-Anqing region, which serves as the interior of both our nations. Previous development and cooperation usually revolved around the Beijing-Nanjing axis, but at last there is now progress on developing other areas."
 qiefor.57.a: "Let them do most of the work"
 qiefor.57.b: "Invest ourselves"

 qiefor.58.t: "New Offices for the Beijing Liaison Council"
 qiefor.58.d: "The Anqing Clique has emerged victorious with our support. We recently installed the Beijing Liaison Council as our official representative organisation in the new Anqing capital of Nanjing. They will be working towards achieving eventual unification. However, they have now requested that in order to make a statement and show the glory of the Emperor to the public in Nanjing, we should fund the construction of very large offices for them."
 qiefor.58.a: "No, it's not worth it"
 qiefor.58.b: "Fund construction"

 qiefor.59.t: "Resource Development with Anqing"
 qiefor.59.d: "We have recently struck a deal with Anqing to stimulate Qing enterprises to aid in the prospecting and development of resources in their territory. We of course indirectly benefit from these resources as we can trade with Anqing, but shouldn't we get some direct benefits as well? We could ask for control over one of their iron mines in Wuhu. Maybe they will be willing to accommodate us."
 qiefor.59.a: "No, this doesn't cost us anything"
 qiefor.59.b: "Yes, ask them for steel from Wuhu"

 qiefor.60.t: "Anqing Refuses Special Treatment"
 qiefor.60.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has been hard at work to improve the ability of Qing enterprises to do business in the Anqing Clique. Due to the backwards nature and governance of the Anqing Clique, this is sometimes quite difficult. However, when the Liaison Council recently requested the Anqing Clique to do something about this, they outright refused! This is unacceptable. We should send them another offer. One they can't refuse."
 qiefor.60.a: "Send the offer"

 qiefor.61.t: "Anqing Still Refuses"
 qiefor.61.d: "Somehow, they refused an offer they weren't supposed to refuse. As a result, through coordination with the Beijing Liaison Council, we have temporarily implemented extremely far-reaching restrictions for Anqing companies operating within our borders. While we will make sure our own economy is not hit, we will prevent any kind of profit flowing to Anqing for at least the next few months. This will surely make them unhappy, but it should teach them for next time."
 qiefor.61.a: "Do it"

 qiefor.62.t: "Puyi Receives Warm Welcome in Nanjing"
 qiefor.62.d: "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, who made sure that he received an incredibly warm welcome. In fact, Puyi has been so delighted that he has asked Chen Tiaoyuan if an extensive renovation and rebuilding project for the city's ruined Ming Palace would be possible."
 qiefor.62.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.63.t: "Puyi Shocked by Protests in Nanjing"
 qiefor.63.d: "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique. However, to both the Emperor's and Wu's dismay, the streets were crowded with protestors. It was obvious that either Chen did not have things under control or he simply didn't care to provide a proper welcome for Puyi. Both scenarios are scandalous and require correction. The Beijing Liaison Council has received orders to make sure that Chen pays for this."
 qiefor.63.a: "Bad manners"

 qiefor.64.t: "Chen Agrees with Intellectuals"
 qiefor.64.d: "The intellectual gathering organised by the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing was a great success. Such a success even, that Chen Tiaoyuan himself announced that he agrees with their sentiment and will do all he can to accelerate their timeline. Hopefully he isn't lying."
 qiefor.64.a: "Good news"

 qiefor.65.t: "Chen Stresses His Autonomy"
 qiefor.65.d: "Recently, the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing organised a meeting of various famous Chinese intellectuals. They all came to the same conclusion: China must unite immediately. However, Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of Anqing, has spoken out against the urgency of their call. Instead, he says that local autonomy is more important than unification. What he says is practically a renunciation of his recognition of the Qing as sole national government! We cannot let him get away with such words and must speak against it immediately."
 qiefor.65.a: "Prepare a counter-message"

 qiefor.66.t: "The Qing Reach Out"
 qiefor.66.d: "Tensions are mounting in the north, with Qing afraid that it might be attacked by Fengtian, or even Japan. They are looking for allies and as we have not forgotten their help in the League war, have now come to us. Will we accept their request and enter into an alliance with them?"
 qiefor.66.a: "Of course"
 qiefor.66.b: "No!"

 qiefor.67.t: "The Qing Reach Out"
 qiefor.67.d: "Now that Qing is under attack from the outside, they have requested us to enter into an alliance with them and participate in the defence of China. If we don't help, China might be overrun. We really have no choice."
 qiefor.67.a: "Of course"
 qiefor.67.b: "No!"

 qiefor.68.t: "The Qing Reach Out"
 qiefor.68.d: "So far, we have evaded being integrated by Qing. However, now they have emerged victorious in their other major conflict, meaning that we are most likely next."
 qiefor.68.a: "Of course"
 qiefor.68.b: "No!"

 qiefor.69.t: "Chen Refuses Alliance"
 qiefor.69.d1: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we do not wish to blow up our relationship, but we will make sure he accepts next time."
 qiefor.69.d2: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we are at war, but we will make sure he bends the knee after we have emerged victorious."
 qiefor.69.d3: "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This even after we have defeated China's greatest enemy and shown that we are the rightful government! We cannot show weakness."
 qiefor.69.a: "He will pay for this"

 qiefor.70.t: "Anqing Canal Cooperation"
 qiefor.70.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has again been successful. It noticed that Anqing had recently completed significant dike and canal work, including the completion of the massive Subei Canal. It has now secured Anqing cooperation in dike works in Hebei and Kaifeng. Work can begin as soon as we want."
 qiefor.70.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.71.t: "Army Cooperation with Anqing"
 qiefor.71.d: "Anqing are now part of our alliance, and the next move must be closer army cooperation. We have already taken the first step, as the Beijing Liaison Council has set up an Army Cooperation Commission. Now we must decide if we want to expend resources to improve the Anqing armies, as they are quite outdated and based around age-old warlord tactics. The benefits are clear, as not only would it improve their fighting capabilities in war, it would also afford us valuable influence over them."
 qiefor.71.a: "We'll help them"
 qiefor.71.b: "They'll have to manage on their own"

 qiefor.72.t: "Anqing Refuses Further Army Cooperation"
 qiefor.72.d: "Unfortunately, Anqing has refused further army cooperation for now. However, they must eventually realise that this cooperation is critical if a strong defence is to be mounted against our common enemies. We can try again in the future."
 qiefor.72.a: "Alright"

 qiefor.73.t: "Army Cooperation Concluded"
 qiefor.73.d: "The projects of the Army Cooperation Commission that sought to intensify coordination and communication between the Qing and Anqing forces have now concluded. While more would always be preferable, we can be satisfied with the results and the improvements to the Anqing armies."
 qiefor.73.a: "That's good"

 qiefor.74.t: "Anqing Refuses Conference"
 qiefor.74.d: "Strangely, Chen Tiaoyuan has outright refused to hold a conference to discuss our country's future. This is quite outrageous and not something we expected from a man like Chen. We have to make sure he stays in our orbit. We won't forget he did this."
 qiefor.74.a: "Damn him!"

 qiefor.75.t: "End of the Conference"
 qiefor.75.d1: "The conference was a complete success! Chen was very willing on multiple fronts and the progress made has been tremendous. This event will most definitely be remembered as critical in China's history, as it marked the beginning of accelerated integration between the Northern and Southern Zhili."
 qiefor.75.d2: "The conference was a success, although maybe not as much as we had hoped for. Chen Tiaoyuan and other delegation members were willing to accept some of our proposals, but refused even more. This is unfortunate, but we still made some significant progress."
 qiefor.75.d3: "Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, most of our actual proposals have been refused by the Anqing delegation. This entire conference is a complete political failure. This is frustrating, as it seemed that Chen was willing to continue integration talks!"
 qiefor.75.a: "Good news"
 qiefor.75.b: "Damn!"

 qiefor.76.t: "Dalu Yinhang and Anqing"
 qiefor.76.d: "Dalu Yinhang, the Continental Bank, is one of our major commercial banks. Recently, through an initiative coordinated by the Beijing Liaison Council, they have made significant investments into the Anqing Clique to aid them with expanding their industry. We could potentially leverage this to increase our influence with Anqing. First of all, we could offer additional loans through other banks. This might strain our own resources, however. We could also decide to let them repay the loan on more favourable terms. Dalu Yinhang should be able to manage this, but they might not be happy. What will we do?"
 qiefor.76.a: "Offer more loans"
 qiefor.76.b: "Improve the terms"
 qiefor.76.c: "Nothing"

 qiefor.77.t: "Anqing Responds to Our Offer"
 qiefor.77.d1: "The offer concerning the Dalu Yinhang loans we made Anqing must have been very sweet indeed. They have accepted and also committed themselves to taking additional steps concerning further integration. That should definitely help make a united China a reality."
 qiefor.77.d2: "Unfortunately, what we offered was not enough for Anqing, and they have utterly rejected it. Again Chen Tiaoyuan has decided to frustrate our efforts, even when it is obvious that it is to the benefit of all of China!"
 qiefor.77.a: "Good news!"
 qiefor.77.b: "Unfortunate"

 qiefor.78.t: "Wu Meets Anqing Anti-Concessionists"
 qiefor.78.d: "In order to increase support in Anqing for unification with the Qing without having to go through Chen Tiaoyuan, Wu has decided to meet up with a number of leaders of the Anti-Concessions League, the largest organisation representing the usually disorganised Anti-Concessionist Movement. The League itself is split up into two factions, one of which is pro-republican and in bed with the Vermillion Society. The other is more to Wu's taste as it supports the Qing monarchy and believes that unification is necessary as soon as possible. The pro-Vermillion group has been somewhat an obstacle to unification, and so Wu has insisted they also be part of the meeting.\n\nThe leaders were impressed by the Marshal's words and his recent actions and policies within the Qing government. He also secretly confided in them that he also preferred a China without an Emperor, but a constitutional monarchy meant that both camps could have what they want. He swore to them that he would never allow Puyi to harm China. Wu's words reassured many and even convinced some who had previously been passively pro-republican to support immediate unification."
 qiefor.78.a: "Excellent"

 qiefor.79.t: "Anqing Reconstruction Aid"
 qiefor.79.d: "The Anqing Clique has decided to take a cooperative approach to tackling the great reconstruction required to get their country back on its feet. Through smaller initiatives, Qing is already helping and providing significant aid. We could escalate this to the national level and provide more aid there. However, this would constrain us for at least a short while."
 qiefor.79.a: "Help them more"
 qiefor.79.b: "Enough is being done"

 qiefor.80.t: "Qing Requests Integration!"
 qiefor.80.d: "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unification. While a united China is nice, it would mean an almost certain end to our prized autonomy. Will we agree, for the sake of China?"
 qiefor.80.a: "Yes, unification is urgent"
 qiefor.80.b: "No, autonomy matters more now"

 qiefor.81.t: "Eastern China United!"
 qiefor.81.d: "Anqing has agreed, meaning that Eastern China is finally united!"
 qiefor.81.a: "United we are strong"

 qiefor.82.t: "Anqing Refuses!"
 qiefor.82.d: "Anqing has refused integration! They dare stand against unification, even when it is so necessary in our coming battles. Unfortunately, there is little we can do right now."
 qiefor.82.a: "They'll come around"

 qiefor.83.t: "Qing Requests Integration!"
 qiefor.83.d: "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unification. Fengtian lies defeated and China has shown it can even keep out Japan. It is most likely time that we now unite."
 qiefor.83.a: "Yes, the time has come"
 qiefor.83.b: "No, it will never be time"

 qiefor.84.t: "Anqing Refuses!"
 qiefor.84.d: "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification. This even when we defeated Fengtian and kept out Japan. We can wait and ask again, but they won't come off so easy next time."
 qiefor.84.a: "We'll have to try again"

 qiefor.85.t: "Anqing Refuses Again!"
 qiefor.85.d: "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification for the second time. It is clear now that they are traitors to the cause."
 qiefor.85.a: "War is our only option"

 qiefor.86.t: "Wu Peifu Turns on Us!"
 qiefor.86.d: "Following the death of League Marshal Sun Chuanfang, we had hoped that our 'ally' in Beijing, Wu Peifu, would remain loyal to our interests. However it seems that he has decided to turn on us and take an publicly anti-concession stance. While this has bolstered support for his unpopular regime, it means that he has demanded that the Peking-Kommission, our lobbying arm in Beijing, leave the city. Facing massive riots outside the gates of their offices, most members have fled to Tianjin! Our ambassador has sent all non-essential staff to Tianjin as well, leaving a skeleton group of consular officials closely watched by Wu's forces."
 qiefor.86.a: "Damn him!"

 qiefor.87.t: "Riots in Beijing!"
 qiefor.87.d: "Ever since Marshal Wu Peifu refused to intervene in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, our agents in Beijing have reported an aura of tension and unease, with Wu's inaction offending every single major power bloc in his own government. These tensions exploded into open strife this morning, when a group of dissatisfied Zhili generals, allied with a clique of young radical officers and the Manchu nobility, murdered Wu and President Cao Kun and 'restored' the Emperor Puyi! Even worse, they used this coup as an opportunity to attack Germany, leveraging our unpopularity within the country to bolster their shaky new regime. Massive riots have erupted outside of our embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission, and our ambassador has ordered all non-essential staff to leave the city for the relative safety of Tianjin."
 qiefor.87.a: "Curses!"

 qiefor.101.t: "Yang Sen Holds On"
 qiefor.101.d: "Our ally in Sichuan, Governor Yang Sen, has emerged victorious in his province's civil war! This is great news for both Sichuan and our government, as once Yang stabilises control over the region we can have him re-join our alliance."
 qiefor.101.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.102.t: "[SZC.GetLeader] Takes Control of Sichuan!"
 qiefor.102.d: "Grave news sire! It appears [SZC.GetLeader] has defeated our ally Yang Sen in Sichuan! While this is a major loss to the Zhili Clique, the province is industrially poor and militarily overstretched. Should they join any opposing faction we will crush them!"
 qiefor.102.a: "Damn!"

 qiefor.103.t: "Uprisings in Fujian!"
 qiefor.103.d: "While most of China and the world assumed that the Kuomintang were destroyed in 1927, League Marshal Sun had been fighting a low-intensity guerrilla conflict with remnants of the KMT in the Fujian area since that time. Reports were censored from the press, and even Wu Peifu remained largely unaware of the true scope of the conflict, with Sun keeping all details tightly under wraps.\n\nWith the current chaos in the League, however, the remnants of the KMT have re-emerged and declared a new campaign of national reunification! They have denounced our rightful government as illegitimate, calling us 'little more than a German puppet, slave to the whims of Berlin'! We can only hope that the remnants of Sun's forces can put these traitors down."
 qiefor.103.a: "Despicable traitors!"

 qiefor.104.t: "Hunan Secedes from the League!"
 qiefor.104.d: "Hunan Province had fallen under the sway of Sun Chuanfang during the chaos following the 1927 Northern Expedition, with Governor Zhao Hengti re-assuming control of the province after a brief period of KMT rule. A long time ally of Wu, Zhao has been governor of the region since 1920. However, he also has ties to the Federalist 'government' in Guangdong, tacitly supporting the federal model. As of now he has taken a strictly neutral stance, torn between his personal friendship to Wu and his political loyalties to Chen Jiongming. His neutrality cannot last long, however, as already clouds are beginning to circle around his rule of the province."
 qiefor.104.a: "Hopefully Wu's old friend remains loyal..."

 qiefor.105.t: "Yiguandao Take Over Shandong!"
 qiefor.105.d: "The esoteric, millenarian sect known as the Yiguandao have reportedly taken over Shandong Province, ousting our erstwhile governor Zhang Zongchang! While initially concern ran high that this sect would create chaos in our lands, level heads prevailed, pointing out Zhang's well-documented Fengtian loyalties. The cult is isolated, and once the chaos to the south has stabilised we may able to attack them, though this could cause unrest with the sizeable number of adherents the religion has within our territory."
 qiefor.105.a: "Interesting..."

 qiefor.106.t: "Zhang Zongchang Severs Ties with Beijing!"
 qiefor.106.d: "The position of Shandong Governor Zhang Zongchang had always been tenuous at best. An erratic, violent man, Zhang previously held close ties to Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian Government, though he had been kept loyal to Beijing through bribery and lavish commissions. It appears he has used the chaos enveloping the south to cast us aside. This morning a number of our tax-collectors were halted at the provincial border, and spies within the province report he has carried out mass purges of Qing loyalists. Even worse, they report him making contact with Zhang Zuolin and the Japanese!"
 qiefor.106.a: "Damn you, Dogmeat General!"

 qiefor.107.t: "Zhang Zongchang Arrested!"
 qiefor.107.d: "Earlier today Governor Zhang Zongchang of Shandong was arrested by magistrates reporting to Qu Yingguang, an outspoken Qing loyalist and Confucian scholar within the province. While normally the arrest of a governor would be a cause for concern, Zhang had well-documented ties to the Fengtian regime and Japan, and many in Wu's circle feared that he would use the chaos currently enveloping the south to sever ties with our government and declare his loyalty to Zhang Zuolin. These fears have been laid to rest, as newly minted Governor Qu promises that he will uphold our government in the province."
 qiefor.107.a: "Finally some good news!"

 qiefor.108.t: "Civil War in Sichuan!"
 qiefor.108.d: "Sichuan Province, long plagued by overpopulation and food shortages, has erupted into civil war! Ever since the 1927 Restoration, Yang Sen, a close personal friend and ally of Wu Peifu, has ruled the province, but in the last few years his control began to slip. Various other factions loyal to the Fengtian regime, Kuomintang remnants, and isolationists loyal only to themselves began to consolidate power, and used the collapse of the League as the perfect moment to launch attacks on Yang's now-shaky government. Yang has yet to reach out to us for direct aid, preferring to hide the scope of the unrest, but Wu expects his old friend to come knocking for help any day."
 qiefor.108.a: "Terrible news"

 qiefor.109.t: "Liangguang Breaks Free!"
 qiefor.109.d: "Liangguang, a coalition of two of the former eight provinces of the eponymous League, seceded from both that agglomeration and our regime as a whole this morning. Under the command of scholar-bureaucrat Chen Jiongming, backed up by the warlord Lu Rongting, the provinces declared our government 'wholly illegitimate' and promised a 'swift end to the autocratic and anachronistic monarchy'."
 qiefor.109.a: "Rebel scum!"

 qiefor.110.t: "Zhao Hengti Wins Hunan Elections"
 qiefor.110.d: "Wu Peifu's old friend, Zhao Hengti, has just won the recent provincial elections in Hunan. While this initially might seem good for us, Zhao's electoral victory also means that he has reaffirmed his commitment to his federal values, placing what he thinks are the best interests of the nation over his true loyalties to Wu."
 qiefor.110.a: "Following your principles? Really!?"

 qiefor.111.t: "The Buddhist General Seizes Power!"
 qiefor.111.d.zhili: "Tang Shengzhi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed Wu's old friend Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan! Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he is certainly no friend of ours. This is bad news for us, as our southern flank is now held by an enemy of our regime!"
 qiefor.111.d.manchu: "Tang Shengzhi, the 'Buddhist General' of Hunan, has deposed the Zhili lapdog Zhao Hengti and formally claimed rulership over Hunan! Tang is a stringent republican, and while his loyalties are at the moment are unclear, he is certainly no friend of ours. This is bad news for us, as our southern flank is now held by an enemy of our regime!"
 qiefor.111.a: "Damn!"

 qiefor.112.t: "Kuomintang Seize Power in Hunan!"
 qiefor.112.d: "[HNN.GetLeader], a Kuomintang rebel leader in Hunan, has seized control over the province, and formally declared his allegiance to the ideals of Dr. Sun! This is a concerning development, as our southern flank now lies exposed to the foul leftists!"
 qiefor.112.a: "Damnation!"

 qiefor.113.t: "Zhao Hengti Clings On in Hunan"
 qiefor.113.d.zhili: "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Despite his claims of loyalty to the Federalists to the south, Wu Peifu hopes that his old friend will take this experience as an example of why democracy simply doesn't work."
 qiefor.113.d.manchu: "Zhao Hengti, the Governor of Hunan, has held onto power after an election many in the province and around China are decrying as rigged and unfair. Decrying the 'barbarity' of the Zongshe Coup, Zhao has refused to swear loyalty to us, instead declaring his autonomy. With the governor now hostile to our regime, it seems another threat has appeared on our southern flank."
 qiefor.113.a: "Hopefully Governor Zhao remembers his loyalties..."
 qiefor.113.b: "Damnation!"

 qiefor.114.t: "[From.GetName] pushes for Integration!"
 qiefor.114.d: "[From.GetName], in their new position of power, is pushing for us to join their government as an autonomous region! [LEC.GetName]'s policies have drawn the Cities close to Beijing, so this is hardly a surprise."

 qiefor.114.b: "This is pointless"

 qiefor.115.t: "Negotiations Start"
 qiefor.115.d: "Negotiations between our government and [From.GetName] have begun. Already, discussions are being held on the integration of the finer matters of our government, though this is expected to take time."
 qiefor.115.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.116.t: "The [From.GetName] Refuse to Negotiate!"
 qiefor.116.d: "The cowardly government of [From.GetName] have refused to enter into negotiations with our government, despite our overwhelming military strength. We could invade them, though this is likely to spark international condemnation."

 qiefor.116.b: "This isn't worth it..."

 qiefor.117.t: "The [From.From.GetName] Accept!"
 qiefor.117.d: "The [From.From.GetName], overwhelmed by the intelligence of our diplomats, have agreed to integrate with our government! While they are still autonomous, within a few months we will be able to integrate them directly."
 qiefor.117.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.118.t: "[LEC.GetNameDefCap] are Ready to Integrate!"
 qiefor.118.d: "[LEC.GetNameDefCap] are ready to integrate into our great nation, having proven to be loyal subjects."
 qiefor.118.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.119.t: "[From.GetName] Threaten Our Treaty Ports!"
 qiefor.119.d: "[From.GetName] has threatened to invade our treaty ports, claiming they are integral parts of China! This is a blatant violation of our territorial sovereignty and the 99-year lease we signed with the Qing!"
 qiefor.119.a: "Cede them, this isn't worth a fight"
 qiefor.119.b: "Refuse these outrageous demands!"

 qiefor.120.t: "German Cities Are Ceded!"
 qiefor.120.d: "The Germans have caved into our demands, and vacated their port cities! Already, jubilant crowds across China are celebrating this great victory over imperialism!"
 qiefor.120.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.121.t: "Germany Refuses!"
 qiefor.121.d: "The cowardly Germans have refused our offer, claiming that they will defend their ports to the last man!"
 qiefor.121.a: "This is pointless!"
 qiefor.121.b: "Mobilise the troops!"

 qiefor.122.t: "[From.GetName] Want to Buy Treaty Ports!"
 qiefor.122.d: "[From.GetName] has extended us an offer to buy our treaty ports in China. They seem willing to offer large amounts of money, and with the threat of Japan eliminated their military necessity has dropped dramatically."
 qiefor.122.a: "OK, let's name our price!"
 qiefor.122.b: "They aren't for sale!"

 qiefor.123.t: "Germany Names Its Price"
 qiefor.123.d: "Germany has named its price, a significant amount of gold. This payment is high, but it will reunite our lost territories without a single life being lost."
 qiefor.123.a: "OK, send the cash"
 qiefor.123.b: "Forget it, this is too expensive"

 qiefor.124.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Back Down"

 qiefor.126.d_AST: "The [From.GetName] have long considered Hong Kong an integral part of their territory, and given Canada's current military status they have taken this opportunity to mobilise troops on our borders. We must petition Canada for help - hopefully their current conflicts are not too distracting!"
 qiefor.126.d_LEC: "The [From.GetName] have long considered our status illegitimate, and while we had hoped Canada would provide protection against any revanchist activity from Beijing, it seems they have taken Canada's current military struggles as an opportunity to attempt to try and retake the Legations. We must petition Canada for aid and hope they are not too distracted!"
 qiefor.126.a: "Telegram Ottawa at once!"

 qiefor.127.t: "[From.GetName] Threatens our Eastern Interests!"

 qiefor.127.a: "Demand Beijing back down!"
 qiefor.127.b: "We can't afford to open up another front in this war..."

 qiefor.128.t: "Canada Steps In!"
 qiefor.128.d: "The Canadian government announced today that they would take any action necessary to protect their eastern interests, including military action. It appears they have called our bluff! While their current war leaves them distracted, we are a young power, and would be facing one of the world's most formidable navies..."

 qiefor.128.b: "War will solve this!"

 qiefor.129.t: "[CAN.GetName] Announces they will Protect Us!"
 qiefor.129.d: "[CAN.GetName] formally told Beijing that they will protect us against any military incursion! While [From.GetName] has a powerful army, their navy is rather lacklustre, and most experts agree they would never dare challenge the Canadian fleet."

 qiefor.133.d: "After days of troubling reports, our spies in [QIE.Capital.GetName] are now certain: the [QIE.GetName] is preparing for war against our Manchurian allies. The extent to which we ought to support [FNG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has long been debated, but there can be no doubt that the fall of Manchuria could mean a grave threat to Korea. We may need to consider action soon."
 qiefor.133.a: "Is it time to consider an intervention?"

 qiefor.134.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Calls for Aid!"
 qiefor.134.d: "News has come by telephone straight from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], our allies in the [FROM.GetName] are about to be attacked by [QIE.GetName]! Already their forces are mobilising, but they cannot confront this foe alone."
 qiefor.134.a: "We must prepare!"

 qiefor.135.t: "The Question of Eastern Shanxi"
 qiefor.135.d: "We have maintained several garrisons in Eastern Shanxi ever since the conclusion of the last Zhifeng War, when Yan Xishan joined Zhang Zuolin and the Fengtian Clique against our restored government. In theory our control of the area provides a significant buffer and denies Yan resources should he turn on us again, but some advisors have proposed to negotiate with him. Yan might be prevented from turning against us at all, saving us any conflict to the west, if we promise to return the rest of his provice to him. So long as we only return the land following our victory over Fengtian, we would have nothing to lose.\n\nOther advisors suggest that Yan's oft-espoused 'neutrality' is nothing but a farce, as proven in the last war, and that we would only waste time in approaching him."
 qiefor.135.a: "It's worth a try"
 qiefor.135.b: "Yan cannot be trusted"

 qiefor.136.t: "An Offer from Beijing"
 qiefor.136.d: "Unexpectedly, we have received a representative from the [QIE.GetName] Government in Beijing. The man claims to offer an arrangement that would guarantee the return of Eastern Shanxi, which has been occupied by [QIE.GetName] troops since 1928. If we agree to remain neutral during [QIE.GetName]'s seemingly inevitable war with the Fengtian Government in the northeast, we will receive Eastern Shanxi in return after the conclusion of the conflict.\n\nThe offer asks very little of us, as we already claim neutrality, but it would mean accepting a [QIE.GetName] government in Beijing for the foreseeable future. We are also in a far stronger negotiating position now than we stand to be once [QIE.GetName] is victorious, and everything hinges on Wu's personal word. The Jade Marshal is known to be reliable, but equally ruthless."
 qiefor.136.a: "Accept the offer"
 qiefor.136.b: "They must give us Eastern Shanxi now, not later"
 qiefor.136.c: "We refuse, Wu cannot be trusted"

 qiefor.137.t: "Shanxi Refuses our Offer"
 qiefor.137.d: "Yan Xishan has refused our generous offer. He must now be seen as suspect, if not among our growing list of enemies."
 qiefor.137.a: "Yan cannot remain 'neutral' forever..."

 qiefor.138.t: "Shanxi has accepted our Offer"
 qiefor.138.d: "Yan Xishan has accepted our offer, securing our western flank, although at the cost of Eastern Shanxi following our eventual victory."
 qiefor.138.a: "Now we will see if Yan is a man of his word..."

 qiefor.139.t: "Yan Xishan Proposes a Counter-Offer"
 qiefor.139.d: "Apparently unwilling to trust our word alone, Yan Xishan has accepted our offer on one condition - we must hand over Eastern Shanxi immediately. This would, of course, deprive us of a valuable region and considerable strategic depth, where Yan to turn traitor.\n\nOn the other hand, Yan may have learned his lesson from the last war, and with his provice reunited he could be less inclined to join Fengtian against us."
 qiefor.139.a: "We accept, Eastern Shanxi is his"
 qiefor.139.b: "He must accept our original proposal"

 qiefor.140.t: "Beijing Accepts the Counteroffer"
 qiefor.140.d: "Wu Peifu's government in Beijing has accepted our counter-offer, and Eastern Shanxi is ours again. In the intervening years the Qing government, and the Germans in particular, have clearly done a great deal to develop the area. Now it is ours to do as we will."
 qiefor.140.a: "Excellent news!"

 qiefor.141.t: "Beijing Refuses the Counteroffer"
 qiefor.141.d: "Unfortunately Wu Peifu has rejected our counteroffer out of hand. Perhaps we over-estimated our leverage."
 qiefor.141.a: "Then we must agree to the original proposal"
 qiefor.141.b: "Call off negotiations"

 qiefor.142.t: "A Deal is Brokered between Shanxi and Beijing"
 qiefor.142.d1: "During the last days of the Fourth Zhifeng War, Qing troops occupied Eastern Shanxi, and have remained there ever since - Wu Peifu's buffer against a second 'betrayal'. Now Wu and Yan Xishan have unexpectedly signed a non-aggression pact, with the implication that Eastern Shanxi will be returned to its rightful owner some time soon. Likely anticipating an attack from the north, Wu has secured his Eastern flank— at least for now."

 qiefor.1441.d: "Thirty days have passed since our non-aggression arrangement with [QIE.GetName] ended, and any of our troops remaining in their provinces are now in hostile territory. It seems unlikely that [QIE.GetLeader] will instruct his men to fire on our own, at least for now, and we will hold to the same tenuous understanding as his own men withdraw. Still, operations in [QIE.GetNameDef] are simply no longer viable, at least for now."

 qiefor.145.d: "In the end, [QIE.GetName]'s desperate decision to relocate their capital to Wuhan made little difference, and the country looks again to Beijing as the national capital, as it has for over four centuries. However, the unification of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang under one administration, however brief, cannot be so easily undone - the three cities have already been drifting together for decades, and now seem inseparable."

 qiefor.147.t: "Wu Peifu extends an offer of alliance"
 qiefor.147.d: "In light of our ongoing agreement of non-aggression, and the prevailing situation in China, Wu Peifu has offered us an alliance. He could be a powerful ally, and this may one day guarantee us a powerful position in his regime, but in the meantime we would inevitably become entangled in his grasp for power."
 qiefor.147.a: "We accept"

#Flavour Events
 qieflavor.1.t: "Illegal Brothel Raided!"
 qieflavor.1.d: "A cold rain fell from the sky as Zhang Beijiao, head of the Beijing Police Department’s Vice Squad, ordered his men to take up positions around a shabby-looking building on the outskirts of the city. Soft music could be heard from within, and wisps of smoke rose from the windows.\n\n‘What do you reckon - drugs or girls?’ Zhang’s second-in-command asked. ‘Both, and I’ll buy your next lunch if I’m wrong.’ Zhang stamped out his cigarette as he whistled loudly. Half a dozen men burst open the front door and streamed into a dimly lit hall. ‘Police - don’t move!’ Zhang shouted, as men and women in various states of undress lurched into the hall, yelling and crying. The second-in-command frowned as Zhang held up a sack of opium. ‘Guess you’re buying your own lunch tomorrow.’\n\nThe policemen fanned out through the building, arresting the prostitutes and drug dealers. This was a good haul. Opium, hemp, and even cocaine, a German luxury, were found in droves. Just as Zhang was about to order his men to drag the prostitutes and their clients back to the station, one of his junior officers called out. ‘Sir! You’re going to want to see this!’ Zhang could barely believe his eyes - amongst the line-up of clients, a tall, blonde, white man stood out like a sore thumb. ‘The German Legation will hear about this!’ he said in poorly accented Chinese. ‘I have friends in high places!’\n\nArresting the man would give the central government some much-needed leverage in curbing German influence, but at the same time be politically costly for the government. On the other hand, who knows what could happen if Zhang let the man go..."
 qieflavor.1.a: "Zhang arrests him."
 qieflavor.1.b: "Zhang lets him go."

 qieflavor.2.t: "Scandal in Beijing!"
 qieflavor.2.d: "A few days ago, Hans Schröder, a promising young diplomat in the Peking-Kommission, was arrested on trumped-up charges of soliciting underage and illegal prostitutes. The Beijing Government used this as pretext to push back several German-supported reforms proposed by the Prosperity League, our lobbying group in the National Assembly. While ultimately a minor scandal this has still hit us harder than we’d like to admit."
 qieflavor.2.a: "Damn!"

 qieflavor.3.t: "Corruption in the Beijing Police?"
 qieflavor.3.d: "When Vice Captain Zhang Beijiao made the strategic decision to release Hans Schröder, the young diplomat from the German Legation in Beijing he found in an illegal brothel, we thought we’d heard the last of him. But now it appears one of the men on his team was enraged by the lapse in punishment, and reported the news to one of Beijing’s underground printing presses. Existing in a legal grey zone, these pamphleteers often publish scathing critiques of the Harmony Association’s government through thinly-veiled allegorical poems, historical analogies, and other ‘respectable’ topics to skirt by government censorship laws.\n\nThis time, however, they published a full-blown attack on the ‘corruption’ of the Beijing police department and compared the situation to the murder of Lin Weixi by British sailors in 1839, the spark that set off the First Opium War. While we’ve tried to shut down publication of this pamphlet, it has quickly spiralled out of control and has incited small protests and riots."
 qieflavor.3.a: "Damn!"

 qieflavor.4.t: "German in Peking Seduced by Oriental Beauty!"
 qieflavor.4.d: "Tabloids across the nation are abuzz with a story from Beijing. Hans Schröder, a young diplomatic attaché in the Peking consulate, was apprehended by police after they raided an illegal brothel that also traded in drugs. Furthermore, it appears that the chief of police decided to let Schröder off without as much as a warning, probably fearing political controversy. The city is currently gridlocked by anti-German riots, and many SPD members are questioning the continued value of our involvement in China.\n\nOtto Wels, senior SPD leader, delivered a scathing speech in the Reichstag in response to the scandal. ‘While before the Party’s position was that intervention in China was pointless, it is now clear that the intervention actively harms the Chinese people. Our continued military presence undermines Chinese rule of law, and their attempts to build a stable, functioning country we can partner with against Japan.’"
 qieflavor.4.a: "Damn!"

 qieflavor.5.t: "Media Silence"
 qieflavor.5.d: "It appears that our decision to let the young German we apprehended in a raid on a brothel off without as much as a warning turned out better than expected. The boy was transferred to Tianjin, and Zhang Beijiao, the police officer who let him go, was given a raise to reward his ‘quick political thinking’."
 qieflavor.5.a: "Finally, good news!"

 qieflavor.7.t: "Prince Rui Requests a Commission!"
 qieflavor.7.d: "Aisin-Gioro Zaixun, Prince Rui and navy minister in the cabinet of 1911, has come to us with a request. Following the promotion of the young coup backers from the Baoding academy, he requests a full naval commission! While it is true many of the admirals have lingering Zhili connections, they are mostly loyal to us. Zaixun, despite having travelled extensively to study foreign navies has never actually commanded a ship in battle, and many are sceptical of his actual naval prowess."
 qieflavor.7.a: "Promote him."
 qieflavor.7.b: "What? Of course not!"

 qieflavor.8.t: "Bandits Run Wild!"
 qieflavor.8.d: "Liu Zhenhua and the rest of the 'soldiers of the forest' we hired have gone wild! Over the last few weeks they have pillaged friendly towns and even attacked government troops over women and loot! What should we do?"
 qieflavor.8.a: "Arrest and execute them!"
 qieflavor.8.b: "Let them stay."

 qieflavor.9.t: "The Lindbergh of the East"
 qieflavor.9.d: "A young pilot named Sun Tonggang has earned great renown for flying across Eurasia in his custom self-built aircraft. With the recent upheavals within the League, he has volunteered to serve our nation as a pilot, destroying our enemies from the skies! Originally based in Nanjing, he has fled the chaos currently enveloping the city for our territory in his small plane."
 qieflavor.9.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.10.t: "A Refugee from New York"
 qieflavor.10.d: "Edith Clifford Williams, an American artist, author, and librarian, has maintained a long-running correspondence with Hu Shih after the two met in New York while Hu was studying at Columbia University in New York City. She had an immense influence in developing Hu's political thought, and it is suspected (though unconfirmed) that the two were briefly lovers.\n\nWith war ravaging America, however, Williams has written to Shih, requesting asylum and refugee status in China. Hu has accepted, and Williams is currently en route to Beijing aboard a ship."
 qieflavor.10.a: "Welcome to China!"

 qieflavor.11.t: "The Houmuwu Ding"
 qieflavor.11.d: "Archaeological excavations around Anyang, Henan Province, have unearthed a massive bronze burial vessel from the Shang Dynasty. Thought to be the largest ancient bronze in the world, its discovery has been celebrated around the world as a massive victory for Chinese culture and history. With the threat of war with Japan looming however, archaeologists have reburied the sarcophagus, hoping that once we have defeated Japan we can exhibit it safely in a museum."
 qieflavor.11.a: "A great victory for Chinese culture!"

 qieflavor.12.t: "The Clique of Strategies of the Warring States"
 qieflavor.12.d: "Following the ascension of the YCP, an organisation made up of intellectuals who studied in Germany called the 'Clique of Zhan Guo Ce' has emerged. They believe in statism, authoritarianism and Nietzsche's superhuman philosophy, but adapted to Chinese circumstances, promoting an esoteric blend of Confucianism with Nietzscheian philosophical thought. In particular, they see China's recent history, and near future, as repeat of China's historical "cyclical" warring states periods; brutal, uncompromising times, in which the weak are, one by one, consumed by the strong. Thus, they believe that forming a strong nation is paramount, but hold a pluralistic outlook on Chinese nationalism.\n\nGroups affiliated with this school of thought have started to crop up in major Chinese universities, and are lending much credence to our new government."
 qieflavor.12.a: "Interesting."

 qieflavor.13.t: "A Late-Night Card Game"
 qieflavor.13.d: "Night fell over the newly-inaugurated Presidential Palace in Beijing as President [QIE.GetLeader] and Wu Peifu played an evening game of cards. The two men discussed politics, current events, and the current state of the world. [QIE.GetLeader] played a great hand while Wu looked at him through narrow eyes.\n\n'You might relish the hand you just played.' Wu started. 'But remember - who dealt you the cards that led to you sitting in this building?'.\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] raised an eyebrow. 'The Constitutional Convention selected me, of course.'\n\n'Do you *really* believe that?' asked Wu. 'I thought you were far smarter than that.'\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] leaned back in his chair. 'The state is only as strong as its military, I suppose. Still - you are not immortal. One day we will need a true democracy once our period of guidance of the nation comes to an end.'\n\n'We will see,' said Wu, lighting a cigarette and staring out over the city."
 qieflavor.13.a: "From where does political power grow?"

 qieflavor.14.t: "An Exiled General from the Qing Arrives"
 qieflavor.14.d: "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and field marshals you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to their leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous Qing, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. The general tells us a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."
 qieflavor.14.a: "We need all the help we can get"
 qieflavor.14.b: "No, he could be a liability"

 qieflavor.15.t: "[ANQ.GetLeader] Affirms our Leadership"
 qieflavor.15.d: "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing formally re-affirmed Puyi's leadership of China today in a radio speech broadcast across his territory. While he admitted initially finding the idea of an Emperor anachronistic, he followed that up by enthusiastically endorsing our new anti-concession stance, and Puyi's devotion to the cause. He concluded his speech with admiration for the Zhili leadership. 'An apolitical figurehead can be useful in a modern state. And with Wu Peifu and Cao Kun at the helm of our great nation, we can drive out the foreign scum who have polluted our country, and restore it to greatness!'\n\nThe speech was well received by intellectuals in Beijing and other urban areas, and some have begun to desert the NCERA and YCP for the Harmony Association, bolstering our popularity and legitimacy among the general population."
 qieflavor.15.a: "Great news!"

 qieflavor.16.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan - Model Governor"
 qieflavor.16.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing, has consolidated his rule after his victory over the Nanjing Clique in the League Collapse, and while he is technically part of our government, the province enjoys a large degree of autonomy. After the League War concluded, some Zhili generals insisted on directly integrating the province into our government, but this was largely rejected due to the fragility of our own regime.\n\nIt seems now that keeping Chen's autonomy was the right move. He has just announced a massive reform project for the province, promising major industrial and legal reform. The news was greeted with enthusiasm from many business leaders in our territory, as following the German military mission's withdrawal they have sought new markets to trade with."
 qieflavor.16.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.17.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Seeks to Mend the North-South Zhili Divide"
 qieflavor.17.d: "Ever since the conclusion of the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War and the German Intervention in 1927, the Northern and Southern halves of the Zhili Clique, lead by Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang respectively, have drifted apart. Now Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing and member of the Southern Clique has begun a concerted effort to mend the divide between the two. The top levels of both groups are open to the merger, but the more junior officers may harbour grudges against the other cliques, seeing potential competitions for promotion as the cliques draw closer together. Still, this is overall a good development."
 qieflavor.17.a: "Excellent"

 qieflavor.18.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Proposes Joint Troop Training Exercises"
 qieflavor.18.d: "Following his efforts to mend the North-South Zhili divide, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing has offered to host joint training exercises between our troops outside of Anqing city. His troops have learned much in their struggles against the Nanjing clique, and we both have much to learn from each other."
 qieflavor.18.a: "Good to hear"

 qieflavor.19.t: "Former German Factories Reopen"
 qieflavor.19.d: "After announcing our intentions to nationalise German factories in Beijing, many in our government feared backlash from the German government. Yet with Black Monday absorbing most of their attention, we were able to conclude nationalisation with little consequences. We have drawn up plans to distribute factory ownership to a variety of loyal contractors but we now face a question - what should these factories produce? Previously they produced bulk consumer goods to be shipped back to Germany, and could easily be retooled to do the same for our population. Alternatively, they could easily be modified to produce military support supplies such as blankets and cooking equipment, but having them produce weapons or actual ammunition would be prohibitively expensive."
 qieflavor.19.a: "Civilian goods"
 qieflavor.19.b: "Support supplies"

 qieflavor.20.t: "Kang Tongbei Rises to Prominence"
 qieflavor.20.d: "While Kang Youwei, the reformer whose works the NCERA are primarily based around, has been dead since 1927, his daughter Kang Tongbei inherited her father's genius and political talent. A graduate of Barnard College in New York City, she returned to China in 1911 to help agitate for women's rights and feminism. As the NCERA gained prominence in the tumultuous years after the German intervention and the Restoration, Kang's ideas of women's empowerment became increasingly popular within some intellectual circles, while alienating some of the more conservative members of the party. With our recent efforts to honour her father, some have suggested elevating her to a full minister position within our government, both as a symbol of our direct inheritance of the legacy of Kang Youwei and as a symbol of our modernity. Others counter that this would be too controversial, and instead argue that she should continue to promote her work at the local level."
 qieflavor.20.a: "Appoint her to the ministry!"
 qieflavor.20.b: "Let her continue her work at the local level"

 qieflavor.21.t: "The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence"
 qieflavor.21.d: "Our recent support of anti-concession intellectual movements appears to have been remarkably successful, with more and more of Beijing's nascent intelligentsia writing papers and pamphlets in support of our government. A personal favourite of Wu Peifu's, published in a journal originating in the fiercely anti-warlord May Fourth movement, is 'The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence'. A concise tract, it holds up Wu and his clique as bastions of China's fight against foreign domination, with the Emperor as a powerful symbol of China's modernisation. Zhang Zuolin and his Fengtian government are denounced as foreign parasites, leeching Manchuria's mineral wealth and sending it back to Japan while leaving the population impoverished."
 qieflavor.21.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.22.t: "Mending the Military's Generational Divide"
 qieflavor.22.d: "There has long been a generational gap in China's officer corps. Among the older generals, born before the upheavals of 1911 and the ensuring Warlord Era, tradition and suspicion of modernisation reign supreme. Scarred by the violence and unrest that dominated most of their lives, they are politically flexible but lean conservative, hoping to restore the China of their youth. Younger officers, on the other hand, were born in or just before the Warlord Era, and tend to favour more radical political positions.\n\nOur decision to better integrate the Baoding Army cadets into the Zhili patronage and loyalty systems has paid off, with many of the younger officers abandoning their support for the YCP and joining the Harmony Association. Some of the older generals who were sceptical of Wu's about-face regarding German support have also become more supportive of his regime, owing to conversations with their new, more politically active subordinates."
 qieflavor.22.a: "Great news!"

 qieflavor.23.t: "Wu Peifu Ennobled"
 qieflavor.23.d: "Earlier this month the Emperor announced a new set of noble titles and awards. Rather than the arcane and opaque system used in the pre-restoration Qing, these new ranks followed a model similar to most western titles. The highest rank of these is 'Duke' (Gong), only to be given to those who have 'Given the Utmost Service or Sacrifice for the Emperor and China'. The first, and so far sole recipient of this honour is to be Marshal Wu Peifu - now Duke of Qi.\n\nIn a lavish ceremony Wu solemnly accepted the honorific from the Emperor, vowing to continue to protect him and the nation for 'as long as he drew breath'."
 qieflavor.23.a: "Long live the Duke!"

 qieflavor.24.t: "The General and the Emperor"
 qieflavor.24.d: "In a highly orchestrated ceremony today, Puyi invited Wu Peifu to the Forbidden city for an 'informal' luncheon. Carefully choreographed to look as 'relaxed' as possible, the two men sat together eating and discussing various matters of importance including modernising the military, reforming the bureaucracy, and other topics. After lunch, the two men were joined by the Emperor's brother, Pujie, outside the city for a brief ride on horseback. Cameras recorded the entire spectacle, and newsreel footage of the event has already been shown in cinemas in the major cities of China, as well as distributed to international agencies, which will show them that we have modernised without becoming just another Western puppet!"
 qieflavor.24.a: "I hope they had a nice lunch"

 qieflavor.25.t: "German-Owned Sweatshops Open"
 qieflavor.25.d: "Major Chinese cities have seen an explosion of German factory construction following our relaxation of international investment laws. While this no doubt helps boost our economy, a number of them have engaged in somewhat dubious business practices, no doubt motivated the practically non-existent labour laws in our country compared to those in Mitteleuropa. Earlier this morning, a minor scandal erupted when it was discovered that one German factory was forcing its employees to work 20-hour shifts for next to no pay. Even worse, the factory had cut a deal with the local police to arrest and intimidate any worker who complained or made a formal protest, making us look like little more than foreign stooges."
 qieflavor.25.a: "Oh well..."

 qieflavor.26.t: "German Railways Receive Praise"
 qieflavor.26.d: "While many protested the invitation of German railroad engineers to build our infrastructure, a few months on common people have already expressed praise for the improvements to the rail system. Maddeningly complex rail gauges have been standardised across the provinces, and corrupt local station owners who charged extortionate fees for tickets have been fired in favour of a standardised system for prices. Military benefits of a modern rail network aside, the German's reform of our rail system is earning overwhelming civilian praise as well."
 qieflavor.26.a: "You can always trust the Germans to make the trains run on time"

 qieflavor.27.t: "Imported Radios Well-Received by Troops"
 qieflavor.27.d: "Although some in the Finance Ministry balked at the exorbitant cost of importing hundreds of cutting-edge Siemens radios from Germany, our generals report them to be overwhelmingly popular with the officer corps. In a recent action to suppress bandits in the far north of our territory, groups of our soldiers were able to effectively split up and hunt down the bandits using the radios to stay in contact. These radios have immense battlefield potential, and already appear to have had a positive effect on our troops."
 qieflavor.27.a: "Great!"

 qieflavor.28.t: "The Fall of Luoyang"
 qieflavor.28.d: "After a prolonged struggle, the ancient walls of Luoyang have fallen to [FROM.GetName] forces. The city served as Wu Peifu's headquarters for many years, and only a matter of hours earlier its last government officials, still loyal to the Jade Marshal, evacuated with all manner of secret papers and war plans in their armoured cars. Much of the city's population fled too, well aware of the impending attack, while the rest hunkered down to ride out the storm.\n\nNow the city lies practically deserted and burning, a shell of its former self, and a symbol of our desperate struggle for survival."
 qieflavor.28.a: "Luoyang will be avenged!"

 qieflavor.100.t: "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu"
 qieflavor.100.d: "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu, better known in Japanese as Yoshio Kawashima, is a Manchu noblewoman and distant cousin of Puyi who has risen to great prominence in the Qing court over the last few years. Despite her young age, she has proven herself an adept schemer and intriguer, and has worked with the Zongshe Party to advance the goals of the Manchu nobility.\n\nBrought up in a Japanese family after she was given up for adoption in 1915, some around Puyi have questioned her loyalty to our nation. During the Emperor's exile in Tianjin, the young Xianyu pushed for Puyi to work with the Japanese instead of the Germans, a stance that put her at odds with many of the Emperor's closer family. Nearly a decade later, however, many are willing to forgive that as an act of youthful ignorance, and she has quickly made herself a force to be reckoned with."
 qieflavor.100.a: "Interesting"
