### Ideas ###
 KR_CHI_start_army: "Insurgent Army"
 KR_CHI_start_army_desc: "Ten years of insurgency and clandestine activities have turned the core of the new NRA into a hardened group with experience in guerrilla warfare.\n\n§YAs the NRA transitions back into a conventional mass army, this national idea will disappear.§!"

 KR_CHI_popular_support_1: "Low Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_1_desc: "The Left Kuomintang has democratic and populist ideals, but it does not have the full support of the people in its goal to unify China under its banner. It will take a long period of state-building and military successes to get the people to see the Nationalist Government as legitimate, rather than as a slightly different kind of warlord or as dangerous stooges of the Syndicalists."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_2: "Insufficient Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_2_desc: "The Left Kuomintang has democratic and populist ideals, but it must be supported by some famous Chinese. A certain number of famous people are already supporting the Kuomintang government, but the Three People's Principles have not yet penetrated the civilian population."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_3: "Growing Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_3_desc: "The Left Kuomintang has democratic and populist ideals, but it must work to have the full support of the Chinese people. A growing number of Chinese both inside and outside of their controlled territory have become sympathetic or even supporters of the goals of the National Revolution."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_4: "Plurality Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_4_desc: "The Left Kuomintang's agenda and ideology is well known and supported by the Chinese people. A sizeable portion of the country now is at least comfortable with the idea of recognising the Nationalist Regime as the sole government of China."

 KR_CHI_popular_support_5: "High Popular Support"
 KR_CHI_popular_support_5_desc: "The Nationalist Government established by the Kuomintang has paramount legitimacy in China, and patriotic Chinese citizens in all corners of the nation are supportive of their rule."

 CHI_NRA: "National Revolutionary Army"
 CHI_NRA_desc: "With the establishment of the Second National Revolutionary Army, we must deepen reforms to deal with all kinds of warlords and imperialists. This army will be accompanied by a revolutionary road that we have been through for a long time."
 CHI_EAC: "Economic Affairs Commission"

### Focuses ###
 CHI_jiangfu: "Establish JiangFu Base Government"
 CHI_jiangfu_desc: "With our uprising in full swing, the time has come to move out of the wilderness of Fujian Province and establish a provisional Nationalist government in areas under our control."

 CHI_ruijin_arsenal: "The 'Hundred Workshops' Arsenal"
 CHI_ruijin_arsenal_desc: "The centre of the Base Zone is remote and barely industrialised, which will be a problem as we switch to active warfare against the warlords. To mitigate our problems, a program establishing a highly-decentralised manufacturing base for repairing and replacing infantry equipment needs to be established."

 CHI_literacy_programs: "Rural Literacy Programs"
 CHI_literacy_programs_desc: "Much of the rural population of China is too poorly-educated to be trained for modern warfare, let alone as specialists. A Minsheng-endorsed program to provide literacy education for both adults and children should be implemented as soon as possible to counteract these problems."

 CHI_strike_AOG: "Seize German Capital"
 CHI_strike_AOG_desc: "The robber-barons and imperialists of Germany have been content to let these local warlords abuse and harvest our nation's interior, while their commissioners idly collect the dividends in their 'treaty ports.' The KMT will not stand this any longer. Any capital held by the AOG shall be immediately requisitioned and any land seized must be taken from their foreign hands."

 CHI_consolidate_control: "Consolidate Control"
 CHI_consolidate_control_desc: "With our rebellion shifting towards conventional warfare, we must begin to also change our governing style as well. It is now essential that we begin governing the base region and other liberated territories as a functional state rather than as a secret rural government."

 CHI_est_navy: "Establish Naval Presence"
 CHI_est_navy_desc: "The Nationalists are in desperate need of a merchant marine and armed escorts that can connect us to friendly trading partners. Reorganising the commandeered seaworthy ships seized by our armies will take time, but it is an important step towards creating a new Chinese navy."

 CHI_jiangxi_rail: "Control The Central China Railroad"
 CHI_jiangxi_rail_desc: "The Central China Railroad- a local name for the new lines that connect Zhejiang to the interior- are critical for our supply lines in this early period of the revolution. Up until now, the railway has operated according to the demands of foreign capital, but we can run it more efficiently and with better purposes ourselves."

 CHI_warlord_research_group: "Extra-Military Research Coordination"
 CHI_warlord_research_group_desc: "Our alliances with the pro-KMT warlords will be ineffective if we do not cooperate to some extent. By sharing and mandating technical specifications with these armies, we can make sure that our forces and logistics will be able to operate anywhere that they need us to- or that we need them to."

 CHI_provisional_code: "Provisional Legal Code"
 CHI_provisional_code_desc: "During the early stages of the revolution, Chinese territory reclaimed by the Kuomintang has to be administered in a manner much different from the later democratic republic it will become. While supporting military operations must be prioritised, the Central Committee should also begin establishing civil courts and reintroduce the old organic law code to maintain peace, stability, and most importantly, tax revenues."

 CHI_expropriate_landlords: "Expropriate Landlords"
 CHI_expropriate_landlords_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."

 CHI_land_rent_caps: "Land Rent Caps"
 CHI_land_rent_caps_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."

 CHI_land_tax: "Land Use Tax"
 CHI_land_tax_desc: "The concept of a Land Value or Land Use Tax has been a policy darling of progressive reformers worldwide and is most associated with the economic theories of Henry George. Since the earliest days of the KMT, the Land Use Tax has been unanimously approved by the party, and its legal implementation will ensure both a continual source of income and a passive means of fighting wealth accumulation."

 CHI_opium_prohibition: "Opium Prohibition"
 CHI_opium_prohibition_desc: "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."

 CHI_opium_tax: "Tax The Opium Trade"
 CHI_opium_tax_desc: "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."

 CHI_gannan_deal: "Gannan New Deal"
 CHI_gannan_deal_desc: "There are proposals within the Minquan faction to turn Gannan Province into a model region for future Chinese development. Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

 CHI_yangste_offensive: "Prepare Lower Yangtze Offensive"
 CHI_yangste_offensive_desc: "The League of Eight Provinces is shattered, but its core, the Nanjing Clique, still survives and may stabilise itself soon. To finally upend the status quo in Southern China, we need to strike at their centre of power in Jiangsu Province. Our ace in the hole is the ZhongTeJu bureau, which has filled the Clique's territory with Nationalist cells that will surely cause mass sabotage of their defences."

 CHI_contact_cells: "Reorganise Nationalist Cells"
 CHI_contact_cells_desc: "As more of China is liberated from the warlords, the KMT's structure as an underground party becomes pointless. We need loyal and competent party members to help administer the governments of the prefectures, and these local party members are the ideal candidates. Party cells in controlled regions should be reorganised into regional Party Directorates until a more formalised government is established."

 CHI_handle_SQI: "Handle The Millenarians"
 CHI_handle_SQI_desc: "The province of Shandong has been brought directly into contact with us thanks to the League War. If we are to ever take China for the people we must deal with this potential threat, preventing it from spreading through the southeast."

 CHI_VNQDD_liaisons: "Liaison with DVQDD Rebels"
 CHI_VNQDD_liaisons_desc: "The DVQDD, or 'Dai Viet Kuomintang,' is our sister organisation in Indochina and is just as devoted to the cause of democratic anti-imperialism in Asia as we are. With our borders touching the Indochinese region, we may be able to more closely aid and cooperate with them as part of their work within the wider world of native Indochinese politics."

 CHI_plan_southern: "Unite Southern China"
 CHI_plan_southern_desc: "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."

 CHI_plan_western: "Plan Western Expedition"
 CHI_plan_western_desc: "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

 CHI_mingshu: "Chen Mingshu Victorious"
 CHI_mingshu_desc: "With the KMT revolt in Fujian a failure it is now up to Chen Mingshu to ensure China is under Kuomintang rule. There are still problems facing Chen such as the powerful gentry and merchants, on top of that there is unrest in Liangguang which we will need to deal with."

 CHI_National_Plan: "The National Plan"
 CHI_National_Plan_desc: "With the National Plan we can use elements of Chen Jiongmings government to make the integration of China a lot easier. This is because his form of government was based on the American states which makes it more appealing for the governors as they can retain some autonomy for the time being."

 CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming: "Implementing Guangdong Policies"
 CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming_desc: "The lands of the potential United Provinces are under our control however that doesn't mean we can't fulfil Chen's legacy. If we fine-tune his ideals to fit with ours we could gain a large amount of wealth and support from the people."
 CHI_opium_prohibition2: "Opium Prohibition"

 CHI_opium_prohibition2_desc: "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."

 CHI_opium_tax2: "Tax The Opium Trade"
 CHI_opium_tax2_desc: "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."

 CHI_guangdong_deal: "Guangdong New Deal"
 CHI_guangdong_deal_desc: "The Guangdong Province is a true example of a model region for future Chinese development. If we try to bring Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing to other provinces in our control we may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

 CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang: "Consolidate Liangguang"
 CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang_desc: "The pressing issues that arose both before and after the civil war still need to be addressed, until they are sorted the Northern Expedition will have to wait until a later date which gives the enemy more time the prepare."

 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi: "Control the Unrest in Guangxi"
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi_desc: "Guangxi has not been spared the turmoil that has gripped large parts of China following the collapse of the League. Our new administration must tend to the unrest in this province, be it from reactionaries, bandits or Yiguandao agitators."

 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong: "Control the Unrest in Guangdong"
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong_desc: "Much of this province still bears the influence of warlord dominance that threaten the stability of the people's government. Efforts should be made to put an end to their influence."

 CHI_expropriate_landlords2: "Expropriate Landlords"
 CHI_expropriate_landlords2_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."

 CHI_land_rent_caps2: "Land Rent Caps"
 CHI_land_rent_caps2_desc: "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."

 CHI_Dealing_With_SZC: "Reconcile with KMT in Sichuan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_SZC_desc: "In the chaotic world of Sichuanese politics, the Officer Department is the only group with a favourable view of the KMT. By supporting Officer Department in their provincial power struggles, we could gain a valuable ally or even control of the entire province through them."

 CHI_Dealing_With_YUN: "Reconciliation with KMT in Yunnan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_YUN_desc: "After the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the armies controlled by the Right KMT found refuge in Yunnan province. With the victory of the Centre-Right KMT in Yunnan's recent power struggles, we may have a chance to mend the old Nationalist party together and form a powerful front to unify South China together."

 CHI_Dealing_With_HNN: "Support KMT in Hunan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_HNN_desc: "The only remaining democracy in Hunan was discovered by some members of the Kuomintang. However, Hunan Clique is still firmly controlled by non-KMT forces, and our revolutionary progress is developing very slowly there. By expanding the influence of KMT in Hunan Province, it will make it easier for us to revolutionise."

 CHI_Gentry_Concession: "Provide Gentry Concessions"
 CHI_Gentry_Concession_desc: "The gentry and their excesses are a product of a bad system. Instead of taking a heavy-handed approach, we can make concessions towards them and win their support. It'll be easier than fighting them every step of the way, allowing us to move forward with our reforms without major disruptions to the existing economic infrastructure."

 CHI_Gentry_Force: "Crack Down on the Gentry"
 CHI_Gentry_Force_desc: "The upper classes are but leeches that suck the blood out of the worker. Their excesses end here. We'll make them abide by the rules just like everyone else and work just like everyone else. There will be some inevitable transitional pains to the economy, but it's a price worth paying for justice."

 CHI_Merchants_Concession: "Provide Merchant Concessions"
 CHI_Merchants_Concession_desc: "While it's true that the merchant classes have lived off the people, we can't uproot the entire commercial system overnight. By making certain concessions to the merchant classes to have them support us and adapt to our rule, we should see a smoother transition for the people's government."

 CHI_Merchants_Force: "Crack Down on the Merchants"
 CHI_Merchants_Force_desc: "We cannot count the number of times that the merchants have squeezed every last penny out of the commoner without a care for his plight. It's time that we started to put the screws on these jackals and have them contribute to the common good for a change, even if that means that there will be a period of adjustment."

 CHI_Revoloution_Secured: "Revolution Secured"
 CHI_Revoloution_Secured_desc: "Our revolutionary brothers and sisters may have fallen, but not in vain. We shall pick up the torch of revolution where they left off and continue their work towards a better China. Through us, the Kuomintang rises again like a mighty phoenix!"

 CHI_plan_west: "Plan Western Expedition"
 CHI_plan_west_desc: "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

 CHI_plan_east: "Strike East"
 CHI_plan_east_desc: "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."

 CHI_form_army: "The 2nd NRA"
 CHI_form_army_desc: "We are now in open revolt, and as such our military forces must move from insurgency tactics back to conventional warfare against the Warlords. More units must be raised in larger formations, and in doing so we will form a Second National Revolutionary Army to finally unify China."

 CHI_regional_militias: "Regional Militias"
 CHI_regional_militias_desc: "With the collapse of League authority in Fujian and Jiangxi province, local self-defence societies have formed to maintain order. We must try to integrate them into the NRA's structure as regional militias to bolster our small core forces."

 CHI_one_army: "One-Nation-One-Army Policy"
 CHI_one_army_desc: "Local forces loyal to a general or town instead of the Party-State cannot be trusted, and relying on them is a devil's bargain. These bandits and petty warlords need to be neutralised by security sweeps before they can establish themselves. The byline of 'One-Nation-One-Army' should be taken to heart in our military planning and future expansion of the NRA."

 CHI_tigress_battalions: "Tigress Battalions"
 CHI_tigress_battalions_desc: "The NRA has seen the equal valour of women in combat, though it has not yet developed any programs to fully allow women to participate as enlisted soldiers or officers. Upon the urging of Song Qingling, the NRA has begun a formal program to train women as officers and soldiers. The program also envisions training all-female 'tigress battalions' for front line and garrison duties."

 CHI_peoples_army: "Prioritize Manpower"
 CHI_peoples_army_desc: "China has a vast population, and we should expect our enemies to have vast armies as well. Trying to outperform our enemies by investing in a quality that our industries are in no shape to supply will cause our armies to be greatly overwhelmed by the sheer size of warlords armies that have built up over time. Nothing less than turning the NRA into a mass People's Army will suffice given the foes we are up against."

 CHI_modern_divisions: "Prioritize Modernisation"
 CHI_modern_divisions_desc: "Any new Chinese army needs to be founded again from first principles as a modern force. While we should try to maximise the number of units raised for the war, our equipment procurement and plans for expansion should prioritize creating new and modern forces that are not just superior to the haphazard divisions of the warlords, but equal in quality to those of western powers."

 CHI_asymmetrical_warfare: "Asymmetrical Warfare"
 CHI_asymmetrical_warfare_desc: "As we evolve the National Revolutionary Army from a guerrilla force into a fully-fledged army, our vast experience in fighting unconventionally against the rigid formations of the warlords should be developed, not squandered. By having our training empathise this we'll be able to excel where purely conventional armies struggle."

 CHI_dare_to_die: "Dare-To-Die Corps"
 CHI_dare_to_die_desc: "It is a sad fact that in these desperate times, often all a man is able to give to a cause is his life. The concept of 'Dare-To-Die' soldiers as patriotic martyrs dates back to the Xinhai Revolution, but during the Warlord Era, the term expanded to refer to all small units tasked with suicidal attacks. As the war expands Dare-To-Die tactics and the original Xinhai spirit that accompanied it begin to show their appeal."

 CHI_airborne_corps: "Airborne Corps"
 CHI_airborne_corps_desc: "Control of the skies in the wars for China is both possible and plausible, and it is under these conditions that we can try to establish our own airborne corps similar to those of other nations. A properly-placed paradrop will allow our forces to develop new flanking manoeuvrers and keep our enemies fearful of the skies."

 CHI_conscription: "Conscription Squads"
 CHI_conscription_desc: "Unfortunately, forming an adequately-sized army on volunteers alone is not possible at this stage in the revolution. By forming special task forces to enforce conscription in liberated territories, our armies can more easily reach their projected build-up quotas."

 CHI_mechanized_warfare: "Mechanised Warfare Study Commission"
 CHI_mechanized_warfare_desc: "Armoured vehicles have been sparse in Chinese warfare, but regardless of our opinion that will not be for long. As a matter of national security, the Nationalists should be the first faction in China to study, perfect and introduce motorised vehicles and tank warfare into the Chinese theatre in mass numbers."

 CHI_stratified: "Stratified Unit Quality"
 CHI_stratified_desc: "Due to the size and scope of the NRA's forces, we cannot realistically make all of our forces trained or equipped to the same quality. Our backline and low-priority units should be de-prioritised in terms of equipment and training in order to maximise the quality of our front line troops."

 CHI_blocking_detachments: "Encirclement Detachments"
 CHI_blocking_detachments_desc: "The rugged and mountainous regions of China are far beyond the capacity of regular troops to adequately navigate. For future campaigns in China and beyond, specialised detachments of infantry need to be trained for mountain warfare against smaller local forces."

 CHI_modern_combined_arms: "Modern Combined Arms"
 CHI_modern_combined_arms_desc: "The art of synchronising artillery, infantry, and armour into a successful offence is still new, but we cannot let other powers develop the perfect implementation ahead of us. The National Revolution's wars will allow us to learn what technical specifications are needed to create ideal arms and artillery for modern wars."

 CHI_restore_whampoa: "Restore The Academy"
 CHI_restore_whampoa_desc: "The old military academy in Whampoa was officially disestablished after the German intervention in China occupied Guangdong Province in 1925, but its staff, records, and other resources all survived and are currently spread across the world. We are now in a position to re-found the Republic of China Military Academy and begin training our officer corps independent of other powers."

 CHI_nat_air_army: "National Air Army"
 CHI_nat_air_army_desc: "Up until now the NRA's doctrine and use of military aircraft has been largely hypothetical or improvisational. However, the Weltkrieg has proved that airpower in modern warfare is an undeniable factor in victory. With the growth of our industrial base and funds allowing for actual air fleets to be assembled, we can now fully commit to establishing a new branch of the NRA- the National Air Army."

 CHI_flexible_aircraft: "Flexible Aircraft Specifications"
 CHI_flexible_aircraft_desc: "China does not have the mechanical skill or industrial depth to have the best native avionic designs for each application of airpower in war. Because of these constraints, it is best to focus on producing cheap, reliable, and flexible plane designs that can work as both support craft and strategic bombers."

 CHI_heavy_airframes: "Heavy Airframes Focus"
 CHI_heavy_airframes_desc: "China is vast, and our air force will be stretched thin to cover all combat regions. Prioritising the development of long-distance, heavy-frame aircraft can allow us to let air wings be strategically flexible in their choice of targets or supporting missions."

 CHI_build_airfields: "Strategic Airfields Initiative"
 CHI_build_airfields_desc: "It is easier to build an airfield than a highway, and in the underdeveloped Chinese interior roads are scarce. Building strategic airfields at key regions in provinces will allow for both better communication with the Central Government and also allow for air support in nearby battle zones."

 CHI_naval_aviation: "Coast-to-Ship Air Support"
 CHI_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation in the sense of carrier forces is currently beyond China's capability or needs, but torpedo bombers and seaplanes are necessary for any proactive coastal defence. Anti-ship squadrons that are stationed on land will be just as useful in repelling attacks and securing littoral zones as any aircraft carrier."

 CHI_separate_naval_command: "Separate Naval Command"
 CHI_separate_naval_command_desc: "Up until now much of the Republic of China Navy has been effectively subordinated to the needs of the NRA. However, any nation that wants security on its own terms needs to have a strong navy. As victories mount on land, Admiral Chen Shaokuan has pushed for more independence for the Navy and for serious consideration of building up a navy capable of independent operations at sea."

 CHI_coastal_fleets: "Light Ship Focus"
 CHI_coastal_fleets_desc: "China's naval forces have always been reliant on foreign shipyards and designers for its fleets. The first generation of all-Chinese fleet production should focus on the development of light and heavy cruisers for the most economical and versatile results, as opposed to plunging into the more doctrinally-uncertain world of battleships and carriers."

 CHI_coastal_defenses: "Coastal Defence Stratagems"
 CHI_coastal_defenses_desc: "China's greatest naval concern is securing its coastline against the imperial powers. Coordination between all involved parties- coastal NRA garrisons, air wings, and the navy- should be enforced by the Central Government and specific mixed-service chains of command and protocols should be pre-established to prevent any operational chaos."

 CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy: "Fate of Beiyang Naval Staff"
 CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy_desc: "The Nationalist government's navy is small and lacking in trained officers. While the warlordism of the Zhili army is irredeemable, the Beiyang Navy's command structure may have enough officers of decent moral quality that it may be beneficial to review their records and offer the trustworthy a commission now that the Qing and Zhili jackals have finally been put down."

 CHI_submarine_doctrine: "Study Submarine Warfare"
 CHI_submarine_doctrine_desc: "Submarine warfare has allowed other nations with a seeming naval disadvantage to strike fear into the merchant marines of their enemies. Given the effectiveness of these forces during the Weltkrieg and afterwards, many admirals argue that the ROCN should turn towards submarine warfare as a way to leapfrog past the old paradigm of surface navies with vulnerable capital ships."

 CHI_naval_infantry: "Chinese Naval Infantry"
 CHI_naval_infantry_desc: "The modern art of coastal landings opens up not just unexpected feints across the Yellow Sea or Gulf of Hanoi, but also the retaking of Taiwan from the Japanese. A joint program by the NRA and ROCN to develop specialised naval infantry regiments will help to keep our enemies on their toes and our strategic options as open as the ocean's horizon."

 CHI_military_affairs_cmsn: "Military Affairs Commission"
 CHI_military_affairs_cmsn_desc: "With the expansion of the NRA into multiple branches in multiple front regions, a new central command overseeing all theatres of the revolution must be established. Though a formality, this commission should ensure that all decision-makers are on the same page and know our capabilities."

 CHI_sanmin_commissars: "Sanmin Political Commissars"
 CHI_sanmin_commissars_desc: "The National Revolution that we are fighting for is not just a series of military campaigns, but a social and political revolution. We must make sure that our officers make field decisions in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and our political goals. To this end, the Party has assigned political commissars to military units both for education in Sanmin ideology and to advise officers in political affairs."

 CHI_special_methods_division: "Special Methods Division"
 CHI_special_methods_division_desc: "As we liberate more and more provinces of China from the warlords and nobles, it's inevitable that the resistance from those that benefited from their regimes will resist us. To overcome this, we'll train and deploy specialised commissars to deal with reactionaries behind the lines."

 CHI_retake_taiwan: "Go Forth and Reclaim Taiwan"
 CHI_retake_taiwan_desc: "The island of Taiwan was surrendered to Japan after the First Sino-Japanese war and has suffered under their jackboot ever since. With our positions on the mainland secured and both our army and navy built up, we're finally in a position to liberate our Taiwanese comrades from the Japanese yoke once and for all."

 CHI_1st_congress: "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
 CHI_1st_congress_desc: "After a decade overseas, the Central Committee of the KMT has returned to China in triumph. Now that the initial war against the Nanjing Clique is complete, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganise and plan its future path towards national reunification."

 CHI_1st_congress_GXC: "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
 CHI_1st_congress_GXC_desc: "After the decisive defeat of the KMT in Fujian the Left Kuomintang was thought to be over for good. This changed however as Chen Mingshu managed to bring the revolution to Liangguang and prevent the fall of republicanism in China. Now that many internal issues have been put to rest, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganise and plan its future path towards national reunification."

 CHI_revive_china: "Revive China Program"
 CHI_revive_china_desc: "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast program of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West."

 CHI_national_RC: "National Reconstruction Commission"
 CHI_national_RC_desc: "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide program of capital investments and standardisations. This program will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population areas."

 CHI_1st_industrial: "First Industrialisation Phase"
 CHI_1st_industrial_desc: "The first planned phase of industrialisation for each base region will involve expanding the infrastructural capacity and heavy industries needed for future construction."

 CHI_standard_rail_gauges: "Standardised Railway Gauges"
 CHI_standard_rail_gauges_desc: "Railway development in China has been sporadic in particular the warlord governments have intentionally chosen gauges different from those of their regional rivals to prevent any easy invasion, and foreign firms would use whatever gauge was cheapest to build tunnels and bridges for. As part of our industrial programs, we must invest time and effort into converting all our railways to the standard gauge."

 CHI_2nd_industrial: "Second Industrialisation Phase"
 CHI_2nd_industrial_desc: "The second planned phase of industrialisation for each base region involves the development of factories reliant on fine toolings, such as consumer goods and military munitions."

 CHI_natl_dockyard: "National Dockyard Effort"
 CHI_natl_dockyard_desc: "As part of our larger industrialisation plans, major ports under our control should have their capabilities for shipbuilding and repair expanded."

 CHI_academica_sinica: "Academica Sinica"
 CHI_academica_sinica_desc: "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."

 CHI_bopomofo: "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
 CHI_bopomofo_desc: "The current methods for romanising Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardise the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."

 CHI_foreign_research: "Foreign Research Partnerships"
 CHI_foreign_research_desc: "Like it or not, the Nationalist Government cannot modernise the country without working with the international scientific community. By forming research and graduate training agreements with friendly foreign powers, we can start to build up China's own scientific prowess"

 CHI_proclaim_new_republic: "Assert Independence from Beijing"
 CHI_proclaim_new_republic_desc: "Our government's independence from Beijing has been self-evident for some time. Declaring an official declaration of independence, whilst only giving us some support within our government, will show our opposition to the Qing monarchists. This act will remind the world that we are not just 'The Kuomintang' but instead the Nationalist Government and the rightful heir to the Xinhai Revolution."

 CHI_choose_capital: "Choose the Republican Capital"
 CHI_choose_capital_desc: "The Nationalist Government is secure enough that we now need to put down more permanent infrastructural roots. The first step is to declare one of our politically prominent cities as a new Republican capital- the most favoured location by the KMT's membership is Nanjing, but Wuchang and Beijing also have their merits and supporters."

 CHI_build_national_mausoleum: "Build the National Mausoleum"
 CHI_build_national_mausoleum_desc: "With the capital established, it is long past due to honour those who have fallen in service of Chinese Democracy. A national mausoleum will be constructed outside of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to house the remains of Sun Yat-Sen, Chiang Kai-Shek, and other prominent revolutionaries."

 CHI_new_culture_movement: "National Culture Movement"
 CHI_new_culture_movement_desc: "Chinese civilisation can be seen as a continuous cultural tradition and identity thousands of years old, but this has not yet really translated into a 'nationalism' as strong or dynamic as that created and practised by European powers. A civic nationalism greater than any warlord's cynical appeals to federalism needs to be instilled by cultural grants, public works, and sponsored mass media."

 CHI_est_civil_service: "Establish Civil Service"
 CHI_est_civil_service_desc: "To endure in the long run, the Nationalist Government must be more than a warlord clique or a party-state. A civil service that is independent of both the Kuomintang party apparatus and the army must begin formation, even at such an early stage as this."

 CHI_provisional_legislature: "Provisional Legislative Yuan"
 CHI_provisional_legislature_desc: "While China is not anywhere ready for full elections, the Nationalist Government needs to begin forming the institutions that democracy will, one day, make its will known through. A provisional legislature, staffed by KMT representatives from both controlled and contested territories, will take over legislative responsibilities from the Central Committee."

 CHI_ethnic_autonomy: "Ethnic Autonomous Regions"
 CHI_ethnic_autonomy_desc: "Within the 18 provinces that make up China there is a myriad of ethnic groups, many of whom have painful memories of repression from the Han and Manchu. Rather than reopening these old wounds by ruling with a strong hand, we'll mend them by granting these ethnic groups a degree of self-rule within our nation."

 CHI_unitary_state: "Unitary Government"
 CHI_unitary_state_desc: "Whether it's by class or ethnicity, the last thing China needs is more division and splintering. In order the better pursue the interests of all the people of China in these turbulent times, a strong and centralised state is needed to safeguard our young republic against reactionary forces."

 CHI_rec_syndies: "Recognise Urban Syndicalists"
 CHI_rec_syndies_desc: "The support from syndicalists, be it aid from foreign states or local groups rising up to stand up for their rights, was vital in securing our revolution. In light of this, we should allow them to have a greater voice in the organisation of labour as well."

 CHI_national_labor: "All-China National Labour Syndicate"
 CHI_national_labor_desc: "While we appreciate the aid from syndicalists in our liberation struggle we must also be the ones that decide our own fate. As such, the Kuomintang will remain the only institution in China with a guiding voice on labour relations in China during the period of tutelage."

 CHI_local_democracy: "Local Democratic Government"
 CHI_local_democracy_desc: "Democracy is one of the three principles of the people. In order to fulfil the vision of Dr Sun Yat-Sen, we should embrace democratic institutions all the way down to the local level and give the people of China the voice they've been denied for millennia."

 CHI_continued_tutelage: "Continued Tutelage"
 CHI_continued_tutelage_desc: "Before we can move on to fully embrace the democratic aspect of the Three Principles of the People, a transitional period of political tutelage is required. During this period, the Kuomintang shall remain the only political party with a final say on national matters."

 CHI_legalize_parties: "Legalise Pro-Revolution Parties"
 CHI_legalize_parties_desc: "The Kuomintang has been the only legal political party during our transitional period of political tutelage. This has excluded several parties sympathetic to our revolutionary cause from having the voice they deserve to have. We should end this injustice by opening up our system to them as well."

 CHI_sanmin_study: "Sanmin Study Clubs"
 CHI_sanmin_study_desc: "Everyone in China should be encouraged to study the teachings of Dr Sun Yat-Sen. The state should therefore organise and promote study groups where people are given the opportunity to do so."

 CHI_gov_by_shadow: "Government by Shadows"
 CHI_gov_by_shadow_desc: "The Kuomintang's Central Bureau for Intelligence and Special Methods has infiltrated every facet of society, from the state bureaucracy all the way down to the most local levels of governance. Always vigilant, they'll safeguard the revolutions from all enemies on all no matter where they come from."

 CHI_consultative_conf: "Consultative Conference"
 CHI_consultative_conf_desc: "Studying Sanmin is one thing, but at the end of the day, we must also implement policies based on Dr Yat-sen's philosophy. However, as interpretations may differ, the party leadership should come together to form a more unitary vision around them."

 CHI_new_life: "New Life Movement"
 CHI_new_life_desc: "China is moving forward. While we will not uproot our past, we likewise shouldn't let ourselves be shackled to past superstitions rooted in the days of bygone empires. To encourage our young republic to move forward with the times, the state will invest into these 'New Life Movements' and promote public participation in them."

 CHI_deepen_party_state_desc: "For far too long the people of China have lived under self-serving regimes that neglected them and their needs.

 CHI_northern_expedition_desc: "With our position in the south secured, the time has come for the National Revolutionary Army to begin serious planning for a strike northwards against the Qing. This time, no foreign aid will be enough to help the Zhili warlords or their puppet emperor!"

 CHI_deal_with_north_warlords: "Diplomacy with Northern Warlords"
 CHI_deal_with_north_warlords_desc: "The war for Northern China requires careful consideration of the politics in the region. One area of particular interest is Shanxi which is known to be the neutral clique, home of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. We are presented with a choice to force them open or consider the opportunistic nature of their leader if they are aligned with another government."

 CHI_negotiate_FNG: "Negotiate with Marshal Zhang"
 CHI_negotiate_FNG_desc: "With the costs of war fresh in our minds, diplomacy with the old Beiyang government could be preferable to outright war. If a deal can be reached it might provide us with an opportunity to defeat the [QIE.GetName] once and for all."

 CHI_invade_FNG: "Cross the Dai River"
 CHI_invade_FNG_desc: "North of the Dai River lies the Fengtian government, a Japanese lapdog state that wants nothing more than to do the bidding of their imperialist masters in Tokyo. It's time that we took them down once and for all and liberated their Manchurian holdings from Tokyo's yoke."

 CHI_anti_JAP: "War of Anti-Imperialism"
 CHI_anti_JAP_desc: "The imperialists in Tokyo have ruthlessly exploited our lands and people for decades, seeking to turn us into slaves and our lands into mere resource deposits for their army.

 CHI_fate_LEC: "Fate of the Legations"
 CHI_fate_LEC_desc: "The 'concessions' to the Europeans and their fellow imperialists have been an insult to our sovereignty for far too long. One way or another, they will be freed from foreign exploitation and returned to us."

 CHI_secure_northwest: "Secure the Northwest"
 CHI_secure_northwest_desc: "The provinces of Xibei and Xinjiang have up until now largely been treated as personal fiefdoms by whichever warlords presently happen to be reigning over those lands. Bringing these provinces back into the fold should be a priority."

 CHI_authority_TIB: "Restore Sovereignty Over Tibet"
 CHI_authority_TIB_desc: "The erosion of Qing control earlier in the century meant that the province of Tibet ended up slipping into theocratic self-rule. We must figure out how to best deal with them."

 CHI_retake_MON: "Retake Outer Mongolia"
 CHI_retake_MON_desc: "Mongolia has been a haven for banditry and hostile nationalism for untold generations. Given the threat they pose to our stability, many generals and politicians are calling for the Second Northern Expedition to be expanded to include the reintegration of outer Mongolia as well."

 CHI_neutralize_RUS: "Neutralise Russian Imperialism"
 CHI_neutralize_RUS_desc: "Like many other European powers, the Russians have simply seen China as a resource deposit ripe for exploitation. Be it through puppet leaders, underhanded diplomacy or warfare, they've often acted upon this as well. It's time that we finally took a stand against their colonial ambitions in Asia."

 CHI_renounce_mcmahon: "Renounce the McMahon Lines"
 CHI_renounce_mcmahon_desc: "The product of the British colonial administrator Henry McMahon, this line infringes on Chinese sovereignty and is yet another example of European colonisers trying to dictate their will to us. Renouncing this as an illegitimate relic of the past will send a clear signal to them."

 CHI_repay_syndicalists: "Repay the Syndicalists"
 CHI_repay_syndicalists_desc: "The syndicalists have been great friends to us and their help proved invaluable to us, from the darkest days following the first Northern Expedition to the present day. We should return the favour and deepen our ties with our socialist friends in the Third Internationale."

 CHI_independent_FP: "Independent Foreign Policy"

 CHI_volunteer_army: "Chinese Expeditionary Force"
 CHI_volunteer_army_desc: "Although we may not wish to intervene directly into European wars, we cannot forget the sacrifices that our friends in the Internationale made for us.

 CHI_support_INS_independence_desc: "To our south, the colonial powers still lord over their subjects. They're treated like slaves, and their lands are seen as nothing but mere rubber plantations. Their independence is an extension of our struggle and we should stand with them."

### Events ###
 chi_dom.1.t: "Return of the Central Committee"
 chi_dom.1.d1: "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Wenzhou. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Wenzhou would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."
 chi_dom.1.d2: "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Xiamen. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Xiamen would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."
 chi_dom.1.d3: "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee arrived in small groups through the legation port of Fujian and has travelled secretly to Longyan. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. With Song Qingling present, Wang Jingwei later delivered a speech outside Longyan's City Hall, congratulating the JiangFu soldiers in holding out thus far.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates returned via Fujian's ports in small squads. A large cache of smuggled rifles and ammunition provided by the Commune is currently being distributed via backchannels."
 chi_dom.1.a: "Welcome back, Chairman Wang."

 chi_dom.2.t: "The Harvest of 1936"
 chi_dom.2.d: "Before the National Revolution began, the soldiers living in the Jiangxi-Fujian Insurgent Zone would assist local peasants in the autumn rice harvests. With the NRA back to fighting a conventional struggle, there are fewer hands than usual to help the heart of the revolution with agriculture."
 chi_dom.2.a: "They'll have to get used to these changes for the greater good."
 chi_dom.2.b: "Divert new recruits to get some moral training in the fields."

 chi_dom.3.t: "Leader of The Sanqingtuan"
 chi_dom.3.d: "Recently, Dai Chunfeng has suggested calling for more youths to participate in the revolution of Three People's Principles. The proposal of establishing the Sanqingtuan is regarded by most people as a sign of ZhongTeJu’s expansion. However, much to their surprise, it seems that Dai Chunfeng is unlikely to directly appoint a leader of the Sanqingtuan, which offers us an opportunity. Zhou Enlai proposes that the splendid Youth general\n\nXiao Ke is best qualified for this position due to his superior leadership skills, while Song Qingling suggests our “Big Sister” Cai Chang is the better choice, as her image as the “Tigress soldier” will make for excellent propaganda."
 chi_dom.3.a: "Choose Cai Chang"
 chi_dom.3.b: "Choose Xiao Ke"

 chi_dom.4.t: "Liao Zhongkai Dies"
 chi_dom.4.d1: "Earlier this morning, in the company of his family, the KMT veteran and a revolutionary hero Liao Zhongkai passed away in his sleep. Many of the leading figures in the KMT attended his funeral, including the current KMT leader Wang Jingwei. While the KMT members are mourning his death, Chen Gong bo, one of Wang Jingwei’s assistants and political allies, inherits Liao's place, and announces that he will carry on Liao’s legacy and continue the struggle of his revolutionary career."
 chi_dom.4.d2: "Earlier this morning, in the company of his family, the KMT veteran and a revolutionary hero Liao Zhongkai passed away in his sleep. Many of the leading figures in the KMT attended his funeral, including the current KMT leader [CHI.GetLeader]. While KMT members are mourning his death, [CHI.GetLeader] encourages KMT members to carry on Liao's legacy and continue the struggle of his revolutionary career."
 chi_dom.4.a: "He will be missed."

 chi_dom.5.t: "Incidents in Wenzhou"
 chi_dom.5.d: "Occupation plans for Wenzhou and the other A.O.G. ports have been severely lacking compared to the meticulous steps and lines of advance drawn around Xiamen. When NRA forces occupied the city of Wenzhou, spontaneous anti-foreign riots began all across the city, leading to the murders of numerous German residents and the looting of much of the city's uptown districts. To complicate matters, several smaller advance groups of Nationalist troops also participated in the looting until more disciplined units arrived to secure the area. Wenzhou is now significantly damaged from the civil unrest."
 chi_dom.5.a: "Another mess for our foreign secretary to sort out."

 chi_dom.6.t: "Tragedy in Nantong"
 chi_dom.6.d: "The port of Nantong had been leased by the League of Eight Provinces to the A.O.G., and its position at the mouth of the Yangzte allowed it to act as a German-exclusive alternative to the International City of Shanghai. The advancement of the NRA towards the treaty port caused mass panic and unrest among many of its residents. Widespread looting by Chinese natives combined with scorched-earth tactics by German security forces have lit up the sky above Nantong, and the ensuing fires have wiped out many of the textile factories. An exodus of ferries heading south towards Shanghai was overcrowded and unsuited to trips outside the Yangzte, leading to several of the boats capsizing with hundreds of deaths reported. Before the NRA could do anything to control the situation, it became clear that Nantong was a disaster area. Long seen as an exemplar of how Chinese cities could be modernised, Nantong has effectively been sacked."
 chi_dom.6.a: "A great loss for the country."

 chi_dom.7.t: "Fujianers in Hangzhou"
 chi_dom.7.d: "Most of the National Revolutionary Army's first units were raised in Fujian Province from local peasants and the rare urban native, and few if any of these regular troops are familiar with the standard Mandarin dialect. Yesterday a group of Fujianer soldiers on leave in Hangzhou caused a scene when language difficulties and drunkenness led to a fight with local Hangzhou residents. Despite the view of China as one nation, language difficulties and the sharp contrast between rural and urban lifestyles will make stationing most units outside of their home areas difficult."
 chi_dom.7.a: "It's an unavoidable problem of national unification."

 chi_dom.8.t: "The Zhou Fohai Affair"
 chi_dom.8.d: "The Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, but adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the Yiguandao. With the National Revolution now fighting against the forces of the Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran, the ZhongTeJu has begun extensive counter-intelligence sweeps to purge secret Yiguandao practitioners.\n\nThe most prominent secret Millenarian revealed so far has unexpectedly been Zhou Fohai, a Minquan faction member. Zhou has resigned all his posts under duress by the Central Committee and has now been expelled from the party. His accusation and arrest have caused a scandal within the Nationalist government."
 chi_dom.8.a: "This is an embarrassment..."

 chi_dom.9.t: "The Premiere of Mulan Cong Jun"
 chi_dom.9.d: "Today saw the premiere of one of the first feature films created under Nationalist China's rule. Directed by Bu Wancang and with young Chen Yunchang playing the lead, Mulan Cong Jun (Mulan Joins the Army) is a historical period drama based on the legend of Hua Mulan, who in a show of filial piety joins the army in her father's place to fight off invading nomads. Hailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and has raised patriotic feelings throughout the country, along with an inevitable flood of popular comparisons between Hua Mulan and Song Qingling."
 chi_dom.9.a: "How exciting!"

 chi_dom.10.t: "The Premiere of The Spring River Flows East"
 chi_dom.10.d: "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two-part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working class couple in Zhejiang during the trials and tribulations of the National Revolution. Portraying the corruption that greed and power hold over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the moderate parties. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."
 chi_dom.10.a: "I say, it's the stuff that dreams are made of!"

 chi_dom.11.t: "Victory in the Five Provinces"
 chi_dom.11.d: "After nearly a decade in exile, we have achieved the impossible. Driven into humiliating exile, we were forced to improvise, adapt, and overcome. While our fighting methods may be unconventional for the rest of China, our prowess and skill were displayed in our glorious victory in the League War against the imperialists and reactionaries. Now that we finally have space to breathe, we can begin inspecting our army - whether or not we will focus our efforts on our vast manpower or modernize our forces will be subject to debate at an inevitable repatriated congress of the Kuomintang. Our victory over the League is indeed glorious, now we are capable and ready to carry out Dr Sun’s legacy and bring the national revolution to China, once and for all!"
 chi_dom.11.a: "Zhonghua Minguo Wansui!"

 chi_dom.18.t: "Sun Fo Splits the Minquan Faction"
 chi_dom.18.d1: "The first Party Congress of the KMT ended with the Minsheng Faction keeping its leadership. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, blamed the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction, under Song’s leadership, for being too lax during the struggle for the KMT leadership. This led to the long-brewing conflict between them finally breaking out. After a fallout with no resolve, Sun Fo and his followers became angry and left, then declared the establishment of the Minzu faction. It seems that as the Minsheng Faction strengthens their control of central power and the tutelage, the Minquan Faction’s chances of gaining power are growing slim."
 chi_dom.18.d2: "The first Party Congress of KMT ended with the Minquan Faction overtaking the Minsheng Faction as leaders of the KMT. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, discussed with the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction their desire to become their own individual faction. Although Song Qingling tries to persuade them to stay in Minquan Faction, Sun Fo and his followers have decided to leave. It seems that if the Minquan Faction calls for an election, Sun Fo and his followers will participate as an independent faction."
 chi_dom.18.a: "A pity."

 chi_dom.19.t: "End of the First Repatriated Congress"
 chi_dom.19.d1: "Now that the congress has officially concluded we must look to reclaiming China for the people. We have a series of reconstruction plans in mind to help prepare our industry to unify China as well as the reforms proposed at the congress to complete, we have quite the task ahead of us but we must succeed."
 chi_dom.19.d2: "Now that the congress has officially concluded we must look to reclaiming China for the people. We have a series of reconstruction plans in mind to help prepare our industry to unify China as well as the reforms proposed at the congress to complete, we have quite the task ahead of us but we must succeed."
 chi_dom.19.a: "Very well."

 chi_dom.20.t: "The New Cabinet of Minquan-led KMT"
 chi_dom.20.d: "We have a choice between two prominent members of Song Qingling's Minquan faction to serve in the new revolutionary government of the Kuomintang. The first is Eugene Chen, also known as Chen Youran, an overseas Chinese lawyer from Trinidad. Having grown up far from the Chinese mainland and raised in a western setting, Chen is illiterate in Chinese, but his western mannerisms make him an ideal link between the Third Internationale and the Kuomintang. An early comrade of Dr. Sun from the early days of the Chinese Revolution, Chen's diplomatic tact, British education, and eloquence have made him an essential liaison in organizing support and advisors from the Commune of France and the Union of Britain. The second choice is newcomer Deng Yingchao, the wife of the political commissar Zhou Enlai, who was a team leader during the protests regarding the exposure of the Nishihara loans. During the insurgent period in the Jiangfu zone, Yingchao developed pulmonary tuberculosis but remained a powerful symbol for the modernisation of Chinese women in the Revolution.  "
 chi_dom.20.a: "Eugene Chen will be a fitting choice!"
 chi_dom.20.b: "Deng Yingchao shall do well!"

 chi_dom.21.t: "Two-Gun Cohen"
 chi_dom.21.d: "Morris Abraham Cohen, otherwise known as Two-Gun Cohen, served in the Canadian Railway Troops during the Weltkrieg before eventually making his way to China to conduct business with Sun Yat-Sen. After bonding with him, Morris started working for the KMT, helping train troops until he was offered to become one of Sun Yat-Sens many bodyguards. He eventually got the name Two-Gun Cohen after one battle where he was nicked by a bullet and decided to always carry two guns with him. After going back to Canada due to the disastrous campaign of the Northern Expedition he has once again visited China offering the same protection that he gave Sun Yat-Sen."
 chi_dom.21.a: "We will never need to watch our backs..."

 chi_dom.22.t: "Chiang Wei-Kuo Commissioned"
 chi_dom.22.d: "With the formation of the Mechanised Warfare Study Commission, an exiled man skilled in mechanised warfare has arrived: none other than Chiang Wei-Kuo. The alleged son of the former generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (although many within the Kuomintang suspect him of being the biological son of its leading right-wing idealogue, Dai Jitao); Chiang Wei-Kuo has just returned from the Union of Britain, where he studied under British tank advocates such as B.H. Liddel Hart and Percy Hobart. As the National Revolutionary army lacks many officers and generals who were inexperienced in armoured and mechanised warfare, Chiang Wei-Kuo eagerly accepted a new post as a freshly commissioned general in the NRA's new armoured and motorised detachments."
 chi_dom.22.a: "He will help introduce new doctrine."

 chi_dom.24.t: "Cooperation With Foreign Powers"
 chi_dom.24.d: "It is true, China needs foreign aid to industrialise and so we must look to the syndicalist power of the world and see if they are willing to help us in our reconstruction."
 chi_dom.24.a: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice"
 chi_dom.24.b: "[CSA.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice"
 chi_dom.24.c: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is the best choice"

 chi_dom.25.t: "A Request From China"
 chi_dom.25.d: "The Nationalist government in China has come to us with an offer of cooperation in building up their industry, they suggest we share new innovations with each other for mutual aid. Whilst we may not gain many new technologies from China we can at least help them modernise."
 chi_dom.25.a: "China has our support"
 chi_dom.25.b: "We will not cooperate with the Kuomintang"

 chi_dom.26.t: "Our Offer has Been Accepted"
 chi_dom.26.d: "Now that our offer has been accepted we can now enjoy the benefits of working with a foreign power, as much as it may pain us to work with syndicalists it is better than working with Germany."
 chi_dom.26.a: "A toast to our friendship"

 chi_dom.28.t: "A Mysterious Letter"
 chi_dom.28.d: "An encrypted letter was uncovered by accident by a party member. The letter is handwritten and discussed in length how the current state of the party is unstable and in need of dire reform. The letter also goes on to talk about a potential change in the management of the party. Due to the heavy encryption of both the source and the recipient we can't track the letter down to any one person so we will have to remain vigilant."
 chi_dom.28.a: "Let's hope this was a prank..."

 chi_dom.29.t: "The Source"
 chi_dom.29.d: "If the letter wasn't unsettling enough, we’ve caught the person who was the source of the letter. Even under heavy interrogation, the person was reluctant to even speak a word about the letter, which doesn't give any hope that it is a small matter. We have no choice but to continue the interrogation until the information is given to us. This could take some time."
 chi_dom.29.a: "This has to be a small conspiracy, right?"

 chi_dom.30.t: "An Innocent Meeting"
 chi_dom.30.d: "There are many people sitting around a large circular table. Many appear to be officers both old and new from Whampoa Military Academy whilst some are radicals not found in any high up positions of the party. Our spy was unable to gather anything beyond that, but he has his suspicions that there is a more sinister purpose to this meeting."
 chi_dom.30.a: "We need to keep an eye on these meetings"
 chi_dom.30.b: "This is nonsense, forget about the meeting."

 chi_dom.31.t: "A Matter of State"
 chi_dom.31.d: "The spy stayed a bit longer in the next weekly meeting of the group he has been informing us about and has come to us with urgent news. Like last time the conversation was the same until at a certain point all members of the meeting nodded slowly. After assuring each other that they were secure they began discussing in detail the depth of the infiltration. As the discussion progressed the spy was alarmed when one officer had reportedly said that the plan will commence in less than a month. The spy had to hurry out of the building to avoid being spotted but this discussion was more than enough to incriminate those attending."
 chi_dom.31.a: "Send a detachment of police to investigate."

 chi_dom.32.t: "The Conclusion of the Investigation"
 chi_dom.32.d: "The police who were sent to investigate the people attending the meeting have reported that nothing suspicious is going on and that the spy must have been lying. This is highly odd as he is one of our most trusted spies and would never lie to us, something must be going on here."
 chi_dom.32.a: "What is going on!?"

 chi_dom.33.t: "The plot is exposed"
 chi_dom.33.d: "It seems like forever since we found that letter but after many days of work we have found out the person the letter was addressed to is none other than Dai Chunfeng!"
 chi_dom.33.a: "This is a very serious matter, arrest him!"

 chi_dom.34.t: "Dai Chunfeng Takes Control"
 chi_dom.34.d: "The situation was far worse than we originally expected. Like the spy heard in the meeting the bureaucracy has been vastly infiltrated, with every element of it now loyal to Dai first and the party second. Whilst the reports are coming through the Spy knocks on the party leader’s door, after the door opens two soldiers are seen behind the spy and he whispers to us 'I am sorry'. With Dai's influence entrenched in every facet of life his coup has succeeded. Military officers like Deng Yanda who have been known to voice their opposition to Dai Li's pervasive influence throughout the party have suddenly either resigned or have gone missing."
 chi_dom.34.a: "An unexpected turn of events."

 chi_dom.35.t: "First National Elections"
 chi_dom.35.d: "There have been many unelected leaders of the Kuomintang over the years, not even Sun was elected. They realised that the unstable position of the Kuomintang meant no elected leader would have the will nor the power to come out on top. Since Wang Jingwei rose up as an insurgent state we have evolved to a fully functioning democracy so it is only right that we hold elections. There are a few parties running such as the major Minsheng and Minquan but even parties like the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Minzu are attempting to gain some support. The votes are coming through and both the Minquan and Minsheng are tied, the winner is..."
 chi_dom.35.a: "The Minsheng secure a majority."
 chi_dom.35.b: "The Minquan coalition manage to form a government."

 chi_dom.36.t: "Chen Mingshu Claims National Leadership"
 chi_dom.36.d: "Two times the Kuomintang have failed in establishing control over China, each time has been progressively worse. First, the KMT lost the Northern Expedition, then they failed to revolt... now it is our turn to secure China. With Chen Mingshu and the potential for other leaders of the KMT to remerge the future is bright. First, however, we must deal with the many problems that face Liangguang and then look outwards."
 chi_dom.36.a: "A Toast to Chen."

 chi_dom.37.t: "Song Qingling Arrives"
 chi_dom.37.d: "The infamous Song Qingling has arrived to make sure our KMT is seen as more legitimate to the rest of China and the world. With her in a position of power, we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
 chi_dom.37.a: "Welcome Back Song."

 chi_dom.38.t: "Wang Jingwei Arrives"
 chi_dom.38.d: "The Hero of the KMT, Wang Jingwei has also arrived to make sure the KMT are seen as more legitimate to the rest of China and the world. With his prominence in the politics of China, we could truly stand a chance at uniting China, for the Republic!"
 chi_dom.38.a: "A Toast to Wang."

 chi_dom.39.t: "Song and Chen Disagree"
 chi_dom.39.d: "Chen and Song whilst technically belong to a similar ideological party have various differences which are seriously disrupting the re-establishment of the KMT. Chen believes that the revolution must include elements of Chen Jiongming's government if it is to truly survive whereas Song insists that the KMT should stay with the policies of the last two versions of the KMT. Whatever comes out of these talks it is clear one of the two will have to garner support to keep their position."
 chi_dom.39.a: "We can only hope they can solve their differences."

 chi_dom.40.t: "Unrest in Guangdong"
 chi_dom.40.d: "Whilst the political side of Chen’s removal is solidly behind Chen... on paper, the peasants are rioting at the new change in government. Before when the KMT used Guangdong as staging ground for the Northern Expedition at least Jiongming was around to placate them but without him, the stability of the province is deteriorating."
 chi_dom.40.a: "We must fix this."

 chi_dom.41.t: "Song and Chen Debate Further"
 chi_dom.41.d: "Chen and Song have been subtly critical of each other since the beginning however the two are now openly discussing who should be in charge of the Kuomintang. It seems the facade of unity has been chucked out of the window and the race to become leader has begun. The comfort we can take out of this is that the other agreed to not be a threat should one of them come out on top."
 chi_dom.41.a: "We will take what little good news we can get."

 chi_dom.42.t: "Unrest in Guangxi"
 chi_dom.42.d: "The warlords in Guangxi have finally been defeated however the remnants of their clique are causing trouble in the area. Whilst they are certainly without any meaningful leadership it is perhaps best to put them out of their misery."
 chi_dom.42.a: "They will be dealt with."

 chi_dom.43.t: "Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
 chi_dom.43.d: "The battle between Song and Chen seems to have distracted us from the larger issue, the huge refugee problem to the east. Under normal conditions this would be fine however the lack of control we have risks these peasants causing trouble, already some incidents have occurred at the border. We can only watch for the time being..."
 chi_dom.43.a: "This must be kept under control."

 chi_dom.44.t: "More Peasants Flee from the Fujian Base Area"
 chi_dom.44.d: "The huge refugee problem to the east has grown significantly. Double the amount of refugees since the last report have made it into the province with some of these peasants causing more trouble than before, something must be done about this issue soon."
 chi_dom.44.a: "Something must be done!"

 chi_dom.45.t: "The Toughest Decision"
 chi_dom.45.d: "Chen has been troubled by these refugees as he feels it was our obligation to protect them during the Fujian Government however he has also recognised the issue that we face with the large influx of crime. He has a choice between trying to broker a peace with the peasants or forcing them all back to the Fujian Zone."
 chi_dom.45.a: "They have only caused trouble."
 chi_dom.45.b: "We need to appeal to the populace here."

 chi_dom.46.t: "The Leadership Crisis has Begun"
 chi_dom.46.d: "Chen and Song are now going head to head to try and become leader of the Kuomintang. They will be trying to garner enough support from the party to be elected to the role of President which will have the duty of overseeing the foundation of a KMT China."
 chi_dom.46.a: "They have only caused trouble."

 chi_dom.47.t: "Chen Makes a Statement"
 chi_dom.47.d: "Chen Mingshu has finally spoken on the issue of his continued presidency, whilst he isn't fully the President of the Republic he has been overseeing the peaceful transition from Federalism. In his speech, Chen also mentions how he is dedicated to making the KMT rule China due to the fact he restored them."
 chi_dom.47.a: "He makes a good point!"

 chi_dom.48.t: "Song Qinglings Speech"
 chi_dom.48.d: "Song starts her speech by reminding people that she was married to Sun Yat-Sen and that she was also dedicated to uniting China. She also says that this means she is committed to Sun Yat-Sens Policies and that she will realise his vision for China."
 chi_dom.48.a: "A good speech!"

 chi_dom.49.t: "Election Results Incoming"
 chi_dom.49.d: "On the eve of the election results we await the announcement of who will lead the Ktotoo greatness. People have been highly supportive of both due to each of their positions but at the end of the day, only one will make it on top. Despite their differences, Song walked up to Chen shaking his hands and wishing him 'Good Luck' which he reciprocated. This is most likely to show the unity of the government but some speculate they both genuinely respect each other part to play in China."
 chi_dom.49.a: "I just can't sleep."

 chi_dom.50.t: "The President Announced"
 chi_dom.50.d: "The results are in and with the fate of the KMT... and China in the hands of the result many are eager to hear who came out on top. People suggest Chen might have due to his determination to unite China whilst other people make a note that some party members look high upon Song due to her relationship with the Father of China, one thing for sure is that the winner is..."
 chi_dom.50.a: "Chen Mingshu!"
 chi_dom.50.b: "Song Qingling"

 chi_cng.1.t: "Call to Convene The National Congress"
 chi_cng.1.d: "Many prominent members of the party have convened to discuss all matters of the state and organise the Kuomintang into a fully-fledged government. The foundation for the congress will be the 1924 National Congress which was set up to organise the party into an official government. Subjects varying from reflection of past events to the status of syndicalist elements in our party will be discussed in length."
 chi_cng.1.a: "Excellent."

 chi_cng.2.t: "KMT votes on adopting official history of the 1st Northern Expedition"
 chi_cng.2.d: "After much build up the Revolutionary Army marched north against the Zhilli in an effort to unify the country... this failed. Many points have been brought up such as the KMT lacking the people’s support or intervention from foreign powers, specifically Germany. We should decide which of these arguments are more compelling to use as the root cause of the failure to unify the country."
 chi_cng.2.a: "Imperialists and traitors."
 chi_cng.2.b: "Lack of support from the population."

 chi_cng.3.t: "The Question of Ethnic Autonomy"
 chi_cng.3.d: "Much of China outside the 18 Provinces has effectively become independent, and there are many ethnic separatist movements. Our goal is to unite all the territory of the old Qing back into a single Chinese nation - would the adoption of federalised ethnic zones inside a greater China allow for the security and allegiance of non-Han peoples?"
 chi_cng.3.a: "No. China must be truly unified."
 chi_cng.3.b: "Yes. It is the best way to reunifying the country."

 chi_cng.4.t: "The Question of Syndicalist Parties"
 chi_cng.4.d: "The KMT's party program for developing China plans that only the KMT will be allowed to exist as a full political party for the period of Political Tutelage. As a precondition of Syndicalist aid, we have made exemptions for the Chinese Syndicalist Party and several other minor urban syndicalist groups. Should the Syndicalist parties be given an exception to the ban on public recruitment in the realm of organising urban labour?"
 chi_cng.4.a: "No. Tutelage must extend to labour relations."
 chi_cng.4.b: "Yes. Chinese labour should be able to choose to join Syndicalist-aligned unions."

 chi_cng.5.t: "Status of Whampoa Academy"
 chi_cng.5.d: "The Whampoa Military Academy is long gone however many in our government and military wish to see it brought back, it is hard to disagree with this point as our army is woefully behind many of our competitors. If we bring it back we can begin to once again have a strong army which will make our victory over China all but assured. With all the put to rest we have two questions, do we either restore it as it was before or give it a modern touch as warfare has changed since the time of the expedition."
 chi_cng.5.a: "We will simply restore the Academy."
 chi_cng.5.b: "A new academy for a new China!"

 chi_cng.6.t: "Direction of the NRA"
 chi_cng.6.d: "With our consolidation over Southern China, several ideas of how to conduct warfare have emerged. Two ideas have emerged as most prominent, with the first being the possibility of using our vast manpower as our strength. This isn't particularly unique among the armies in China, however, there is nothing wrong with using a reliable method. The second idea is the modernisation of our armies, which will ensure that when it comes to fighting, our soldiers will be far superior compared to the enemy. What shall we go with?"
 chi_cng.6.a: "Manpower is key to unifying China"
 chi_cng.6.b: "Modernisation is key to unifying China"

 chi_cng.7.t: "A Reflection of Previous Leaders"
 chi_cng.7.d: "We can all agree that both Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek did a lot for the KMT. Where it is up for interpretation is whether these figures were good for China. Of course, Sun Yat-Sen had many amazing qualities however he seemed desperate to hold onto power, this could also be interpreted as him trying to make sure the KMT survives. Chiang Kai-Shek is up for debate as he did a lot for the military however he also oversaw the disaster of the Northern Expedition."
 chi_cng.7.a: "They are both the Father and Son of China"
 chi_cng.7.b: "Both were good for China but perhaps we could downplay how much"

 chi_cng.8.t: "Report on the JiangFu Government"
 chi_cng.8.d: "Song Qingling has been the acting governor of Fujian province and the JiangFu zone for much of the last ten years. Her administration has, through creating a form of locally-run one-party democracy, created an alternative vision for how the National Revolution can be done that opposes the top-down nature of the Wang Jingwei program. Minsheng faction members criticize the idea of the JiangFu program being expanded to all of China as being impractical, but its implementation has proven economically and militarily successful and very popular with Fujian province locals."
 chi_cng.8.a: "Adopt a token resolution praising Song's administration."
 chi_cng.8.b: "Officially recognise the JiangFu experiment as a success."

 chi_cng.9.t: "Review of the War of Five Provinces"
 chi_cng.9.d: "A review of the current status of the National Liberation Zone and its recent expansion out of JiangFu after the last campaign has been drafted by the NRA. The consensus of all involved advises caution in moving north against the Zhili too soon. A majority of the NRA's old guard favours focusing on reunifying southern China before daring to cross the Huai, but the Young Guard and their allies in the Zhongteju such as He Zhonghan advise an opportunistic stance towards an inevitable war between the Zhili clique and itself or Fengtian."
 chi_cng.9.a: "Favour regional unification"
 chi_cng.9.b: "Favour opportunism in the north."
 chi_cng.9.c: "Don't interfere in the NRA's strategic planning."

 chi_cng.10.t: "Election of the new KMT Central Committee"
 chi_cng.10.d1: "After the series of debates during the Congress Wang Jingwei has secured his control over the Kuomintang and will now serve as the leader of the republic. He will begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
 chi_cng.10.d2: "After the series of debates during the Congress the Minquan faction has secured a majority and have taken over the Kuomintang to serve as the leaders of the republic. We shall begin to implement the many reforms that were proposed to modernise our nation into a force that can unify this broken country."
 chi_cng.10.a: "Chairman Wang’s policy is always right."
 chi_cng.10.b: "The Minquan will bring new energy to the Committee."

 chi_cng.11.t: "Call to Convene The Second National Congress"
 chi_cng.11.d: "With key cities such as Beijing and Nanjing under our control it is now time to convene a second congress and discuss new important issues. Many prominent members of the party have convened to discuss all matters of the state and organise the Kuomintang into the true power in China. Subjects such as our position in China and the fate of our wartime policies will be discussed in length. Many of the attendees are long-time party stalwarts, however plenty of new faces will also be arriving. All however are eager to decide the fate of the party, nation and revolution!"
 chi_cng.11.a: "Excellent."

 chi_cng.12.t: "The Question of Taxes"
 chi_cng.12.d: "The KMT has imposed some fairly high taxes since the first congress despite promising not to. This was hidden by the fact the KMT wasn't in a good position at the time, now with our capture of both Nanjing and Beijing the people have seen that they are not necessary anymore. We can either ease the taxes a little or keep them in place for the time being..."
 chi_cng.12.a: "We are still in a dangerous position?"
 chi_cng.12.b: "We must ease their burden."

 chi_cng.13.t: "Formation of a Permanent Capital"
 chi_cng.13.d: "With many key cities secured we plan a future event to discuss where the permanent capital of China should be. Many people brought this up as it is an issue of great contention with arguments to move the capital to the newly captured city of Beijing to even Wuhan, the birth of the revolution."
 chi_cng.13.a: "We will certainly put some thought into this."

 chi_cng.14.t: "The Reintegration of the North"
 chi_cng.14.d: "The KMT's influence in the North of China has always been minimal so we must make an effort to bring the various warlords there under our control and perhaps give them a show of force. Some ministers brought up the possibility of securing parts of east Asia and even Russian territories, whilst they were laughed at the idea of securing foreign territories it might be vital to make sure imperialist influence doesn't spread to any further."
 chi_cng.14.a: "The North must be pacified."

 chi_cng.15.t: "End of the Congress"
 chi_cng.15.d: "With the key cities of Beijing and Nanjing under our control we can now prove to the rest of the world that we are the legitimate government and that they should support us. Now with the Northern Expedition over it is at last our turn to play the role of Beijing Government."
 chi_cng.15.a: "The Northern Expedition has been avenged."

 chi_for.1.t: "Support from KMT Centre"
 chi_for.1.d1: "The Kuomintang Central Committee in Fujian province has expressed its willingness to support us in fighting against those traitorous Old Gui clique. Although some of our generals and officials believe that accepting their assistance will make us gradually submit to them, for us, their support will indeed bring great help in the war against Ma Ji."
 chi_for.1.d2: "The KMT Central Committee in Fujian region has unexpectedly shown their support for us against the Federalists and Merchants. Most oppose connecting with the left-wing KMT Central Committee with Wang Jingwei as its leader because they betrayed us critically during the Guangxi War. However, as we have to face the threat of Guangdong Clique as well, it would be much easier for us to win the war if we accept this aid… temporarily."
 chi_for.1.a: "Of course, welcome them."
 chi_for.1.b: "This is a trade with the devil."
 chi_for.1.c: "Those who have different beliefs could not work together."

 chi_for.2.t: "Reply from Liangguang KMT"
 chi_for.2.d1: "After a period of silence, the KMT troops in Liangguang finally showed their will to receive our support. Maybe the process of making this decision is tortuous or even arduous, but in the name of Revolution, nothing is insurmountable. And now, the good news has been spread among our soldiers and workers, which makes everyone working hard overtime and only wishing more goods could be delivered to our brothers in Liangguang safely."
 chi_for.2.d2: "\"Unbelievable!\" is the only sound that remains after a short silence and a huge, violent burst of noise in the Kuomintang Central Committee. No matter why, how could those Liangguang tsheh-laus decide to refuse our true kindness and not consider that this is about the revolution? Not only does this shock the Committee members, but it also ignites a huge wave of dissent in our population. Although there are voices demanding the expulsion of the entirety of Liangguang Kuomintang, our leader said that Liangguang Kuomintang is still our brother in the revolution and the only reason that they refuse the support is because they don't want to increase the burden on the Central Committee."
 chi_for.2.a: "Unity is strength!"
 chi_for.2.b: "As if we would have trusted that."

 chi_for.3.t: "A Provisional Capital in Nanjing?"
 chi_for.3.d: "With the conquest of Jiangsu from the remnants of the Southern Zhili, we have secured the great prize of Nanjing. The city is the historical capital of several dynasties, was the centre of the League of Eight Provinces, and the favoured permanent capital of many in the KMT. Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanjing until our final capital is determined."
 chi_for.3.a: "Yes, move the capital northwards."
 chi_for.3.b: "No, Longyan's defences are still too valuable."

 chi_for.4.t: "A Provisional Capital in Hangzhou?"
 chi_for.4.d: "With the conquest of Zhejiang from the remnants of the Southern Zhili, we have secured Hangzhou, the provincial capital and a major transport hub for both the Central China Railway and maritime trade. Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Hangzhou until our final capital is determined."
 chi_for.4.a: "Yes, move the capital northwards."
 chi_for.4.b: "No, Longyan's defences are still too valuable."

 chi_for.5.t: "A Provisional Capital in Nanchang?"
 chi_for.5.d: "With the conquest of Jiangxi from the remnants of the Southern Zhili, we have secured Nanchang, the province's capital and a strategic hard point that threatens both east and central China. Longyan is small and isolated, which helped the insurgency survive, but now this fact doesn't help the KMT's civil and military administration. It may be prudent to move our government to Nanchang until our final capital is determined."
 chi_for.5.a: "Yes, move the capital northwards."
 chi_for.5.b: "No, Longyan's defences are still too valuable."

 chi_for.6.t: "Wave of KMT Sabotage Activities"
 chi_for.6.d: "A series of explosions in [ROOT.GetName] army depots and sabotaged railway lines have disrupted our military capabilities. These partisan activities are reportedly the work of Kuomintang operatives working inside our territory, but so far our security officers have only apprehended individual agents. Disturbingly enough, these attacks are only focused on troops and resources intended for our struggle against [CHI.GetNameDef], indicating that they have a high level of intelligence about our army's daily movements.\n\nFrontline reports indicate that the Kuomintang is planning to initiate a major offensive against us."
 chi_for.6.a: "We must brace for the worst!"

 chi_for.7.t: "Kuomintang Preparing Attack Against Us"
 chi_for.7.d: "Reports from our shared border with [CHI.GetNameDef] have indicated a significant build-up of their forces on the border. Reports of suspicious activity near our military depots and propaganda leafletting near barracks may be a sign of the Kuomintang's secret agents undermining any defence. They are likely planning to invade in the very near future."

 chi_for.12.d: "Our [ANQ.GetName] allies have been overrun by [606.controller.GetNameDef], and with their defeat, the purpose of fighting in southern China has little benefit. We could continue the campaign so as to secure the Five Provinces ourselves and set up a regional government later, but our main threat is and remains [QIE.GetNameDef], whose capital borders our main territory.

If China becomes a republic without centralised control, then the victors will be whatever warlords control a province, and not the people. Federalism in actual practice is Warlordism, and only a centralised state can bring democracy and peace to the people."

 chi_for.15.d: "Thanks to Sun Fo and others’ struggle, finally Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue were called for the new revolution and have returned to China recently from the Bharatiya Commune. These hard years as attachés in the Bharatiya Commune made their will and perseverance stronger. Although some committee members think their right-wing thought may make the complicated KMT more indeterminable and even impact the progress of the revolution, their splendid military ability will greatly strengthen our forces."
 chi_for.15.a: "Welcome home, comrades."

 chi_for.16.t: "Greetings from China"
 chi_for.16.d: "When the ships of Kuomintang landed at Calcutta port, all the revolutionary forces in the east had their eyes focused on this 'red' city. And It is the first meeting between Bharatiya commune's leader and KMT's senior. Of course, it is not the first contact between the two sides, as back to when the Northern Expedition failed, several KMT senior generals came to India as advisors. During this meeting, Kuomintang also explicitly asked them to return to their homeland to join the revolution. Obviously, China needs revolutionary power more than us."

 chi_for.17.d: "Long before the resolution on the war against local forces in China was made, there was a strong opposition within our military staff, which of course was the views of our Chinese advisors on this possible war. But to our great surprise, after the relevant resolutions were made, the Chinese advisory group, who had been observing the war situation on the front line until yesterday, disappeared without saying a word. According to the investigation by our garrison forces, they seemed to climb over the border and disappeared into the rainforest of the Indochina Peninsula. So far, the search operation has been fruitless, and there is fierce high-level fighting over whether to alert the Kuomintang diplomats or not."
 chi_for.17.a: "Where are they going?"

 chi_for.18.t: "Exile of Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue"
 chi_for.18.d1: "While our army was marching this morning, one soldier made a shocking discovery: He came across Zhang Fakui and Xueyue, the generals who have been missing from the Bharatiya Commune for several months now. This extraordinary event even surprised the High Command and the Central Committee of Kuomintang. When questioned, the two Generals informed our men that upon learning there would be war between the Bharatiya Commune and Chinese forces, they decided to go into exile rather than fight against their own kind. Their patriotic story has earned them much sympathy amongst our own forces. Upon learning of the story, the Central Committee has approved the reinstatement of these two back to their previous roles, and they will be allowed to go back to the front to command if given the final go-ahead."
 chi_for.18.d2: "According to our local Kuomintang members, Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue, 2 ex-Chinese advisors who went missing in the Bharatiya Commune a few months ago, have resurfaced in our territory. The arrival of these two leaders will surely aid our current revolution, therefore a proposal for inviting them into the government has been approved with a full vote. After learning of this, Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue are now headed towards to our capital, being escorted by Kuomintang troops."

Now with the key cities under our control, they can, at last, be free from European colonialism."

Now that he has agreed we can feel safe in the west for the time being however one day we will be faced with whether Chen's or our government will unify China."
 chi_for.28.d2: "The fool in Liangguang has refused our pact, this can only mean one thing... he is planning an attack soon. We must stay wary in case he does make his move but word has passed to our ear that his armies aren't entirely loyal to his cause."

 chi_for.66.d1: "Up until now, [SQI.GetLeader]'s intervention against the Nanjing regime and our own uprising have avoided directly confronting each other. However, now our lines have met local conflicts have arisen with NRA and Shandong forces engaging each other.\n\nAs our goals of National Revolution are in direct conflict with [SQI.GetName] fanaticism, many within the central committee believe the broadening of the war in the Five Provinces is inevitable and welcome it. Some groups within the NRA have spoken against this arguing that the Yiguandao might actually be worth cooperating with but this may be falling on deaf ears."
 # Zhang Zongchang:
 chi_for.66.d2: "Up until now, [SQI.GetLeader]'s intervention against the Nanjing regime and our own uprising have avoided directly confronting each other. However, now our lines have met local conflicts have arisen with NRA and Shandong forces engaging each other.\n\nAs our goals of National Revolution are in direct conflict with [SQI.GetName] warlordry, many within the central committee believe the broadening of the war in the Five Provinces is inevitable and welcome it. Some groups within the NRA have spoken against this arguing that Zongchangs forces are superior due to Fengtian backing, still conflict with him is inevitable."
 chi_for.66.a: "We'll send them running north"
 chi_for.66.b: "Peace will prevail, for now..."

 chi_for.67.t: "War between [SQI.GetName] and [CHI.GetNameDef]"
 chi_for.67.d: "Up until now, [CHI.GetLeader]'s revolt against the Nanjing regime and our own uprising have avoided directly confronting each other. However, now our lines have met local conflicts have arisen with NRA and Shandong forces engaging each other.\n\nWith the assistance of [FNG.GetNameDef], our forces could have a slight material edge against the Nationalists, provided we are able to hold the coasts."
 chi_for.67.a: "The dogmeat general will rule the southeast!"
 chi_for.67.b: "The Yiguandao will aid the peasants once the KMT is gone!"

 chi_for.101.t: "Return of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea"
 chi_for.101.d: "As a result of the Japanese occupation of their country, various Korean guerilla armies proliferated in Manchuria, northern Korea, and the Chinese mainland throughout the 1920s. Having received military and economic support from the sympathetic Chinese Kuomintang, the leftist faction of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea appears to dominate the political scene of the newly independent revolutionary Korea.\nThe leftist faction of the PGROK led by Kim Wonbong, a Korean revolutionary in exile and Whampoa graduate, has been stationed in Shanghai since 1935. His faction, the so-called Korean National Revolutionary Party shares many political values and facets with the Chinese Kuomintang and has essentially acted as its sister party within the potential Korean state. Now with the Chinese victory over the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Wonbong has officially handed his resignation as a general of the National Revolutionary Army to oversee and administer the newly liberated Republic of Korea."
 chi_for.101.a: "Wonderful."

 chi_fng.1.a: "Let's hope Marshal Zhang will put China before himself"

 chi_fng.2.t: "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Negotiate"
 chi_fng.2.d: "While we have most certainly had our differences with the Kuomintang, we must remember that we were both founded on the same basic ideals of republicanism. While this might be true, we must also keep in mind that their form of republicanism has been corrupted by syndicalist elements. However, they could prove to be a useful ally against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. How should we reply?"
 chi_fng.2.a: "We will hear them out"
 chi_fng.2.b: "No cooperation with the syndicalists!"

 chi_fng.3.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
 chi_fng.3.d: "While we have tried our best to bring fair and reasonable options to the table, the Fengtian delegates have proven themselves to be unreasonable. Fengtian delegates today have walked out and negotiations have been stalled."
 chi_fng.3.a: "They aren't real republicans!"

 chi_fng.4.t: "Fengtian Agrees to Attend Negotiations"
 chi_fng.4.d: "The Fengtian government has agreed to our request for negotiations. They are set to take place in Nanjing shortly."
 chi_fng.4.a: "Marshal Zhang has seen reason, let us begin."

 chi_fng.5.t: "Negotiations Continue"
 chi_fng.5.d: "The negotiations are continuing, so far, with little progress. However, there is still hope that an agreement can be reached."
 chi_fng.5.a: "These things take time"

 chi_fng.6.t: "Fate of [QIE.GetNameDef]"
 chi_fng.6.d: "The pressing issue of these negotiations have been on what to do with [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. We have two options. We could propose that we along with Fengtian invade [QIE.GetNameDefCap] together, or we could propose that Fengtian not Intervene in an invasion into [QIE.GetNameDefCap]."
 chi_fng.6.a: "Propose the Kuomintang and Fengtian organise a joint invasion of [QIE.GetNameDefCap]"
 chi_fng.6.b: "Propose a Non-Intervention pact with Fengtian and have them stay out of the war"

 chi_fng.7.t: "The Kuomintang Offers an Alliance Against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]"
 chi_fng.7.d: "The delegates in Nanjing have proposed to us an alliance against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. While this would almost certainly ensure the destruction of [QIE.GetNameDefCap], we may be forced to share the spoils of war with the Kuomintang."
 chi_fng.7.a: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] must fall. We will work with the Kuomintang."
 chi_fng.7.b: "We can take out [QIE.GetNameDef] by ourselves"

 chi_fng.8.t: "The Kuomintang Suggest We Keep Out of the Upcoming War"
 chi_fng.8.d: "While in Nanjing, the Kuomintang delegates have suggested to us that we keep out of an upcoming war with [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. While this is most certainly an insult to Marshal Zhang, we must remember that the Kuomintang is one of the most powerful factions in China and our refusal could very well anger them."
 chi_fng.8.a: "They are the strongest power in China, we accept"
 chi_fng.8.b: "You have to be joking"

 chi_fng.11.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] Mobilises"
 chi_fng.11.d: "Our friends in Fengtian have begun to mobilise against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. The war to liberate China is at last upon us, republicanism will once again thrive in China, as per the deal we are required to join their war effort... if we want a share of the territory anyway."

 chi_fng.12.t: "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Government Mobilises"
 chi_fng.12.d: "Our Kuomintang friends in the south have begun to mobilise against [QIE.GetNameDefCap].

 chi_fng.13.t: "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Join the War"
 chi_fng.13.d: "This morning Kuomintang troops on our border started firing at our positions and seized key border checkpoints, it appears our worse fears have officially materialised as the Kuomintang has officially joined the war against us."

 chi_fng.15.d: "The Kuomintang has found itself to be victorious in the struggle against the enemy. However, the time has come to split up the spoils of war with Fengtian. We could stay true to our words and split the land as agreed to, or we could just take it all. What should we do?"
 chi_fng.15.a: "We will honour the deal"
 chi_fng.15.b: "There is only one China!"

 chi_fng.16.t: "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Hand Over the Land"
 chi_fng.16.d: "The Kuomintang, after a request by our government, has outrightly refused to hand over the land previously agreed on. If we are to save face we must attack them immediately otherwise many of the warlords we hope to win to our side will see us as weak."
 chi_fng.16.a: "Of course they did..."
 chi_fng.16.b: "They can play Central Government for now..."

 chi_fng.17.t: "Dividing the Spoils of War"
 chi_fng.17.d: "We have found ourselves to be victorious in the struggle against the enemy. However, the time has come to split up the spoils of war with the Kuomintang. We could stay true to our words and split the land as agreed to, or we could just take it all. What should we do?"

 chi_fng.18.b: "They can play Central Government for now..."

 chi_fng.19.t: "Uniting the Country"
 chi_fng.19.d: "The time has come to begin the process of uniting China under the Kuomintang. The only hurdle in our goal is the Fengtian Government... we should consider holding a second batch of negotiations to bring Zhang in line."
 chi_fng.19.a: "We must unite the nation"

 chi_fng.20.t: "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Offers us a Chance to Unite the Country"
 chi_fng.20.d: "The Kuomintang has recently contacted one of our delegates with what they claim is a chance to unite the nation. With the Republic of China proclaimed it was just a matter of time before a demand such as this was coming our way, How should we respond?"
 chi_fng.20.a: "We will enter talks"
 chi_fng.20.b: "They want to depose Marshal Zhang!"

 chi_fng.21.t: "Fengtian refuses to continue"
 chi_fng.21.d: "The fools in Fengtian are refusing to continue with our negotiations with Zhang citing that we are a threat to the old Beiyang Republican ideals. We are left with no other choice."

 chi_fng.22.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Meet"
 chi_fng.22.d: "The Fengtian government has agreed to meet and begin unification negotiations. This might present the possibility of a peaceful unification which was certainly not what our government had predicted."

 chi_fng.23.t: "Bring up the Unification Proposal"
 chi_fng.23.d: "The Fengtian delegates have arrived and talks have already commenced. We must propose full unification with Fengtian officially being integrated into the Republic. The chances of Zhang accepting are perhaps minimal but it is worth a try."
 chi_fng.23.a: "Perhaps we stand a chance?"

 chi_fng.24.t: "Beijing offers unification"
 chi_fng.24.d: "The Kuomintang delegates have requested unification but have graciously offered us limited autonomy under a Kuomintang-ruled China. How should we reply?"
 chi_fng.24.a: "Offer them our loyalty in return for support and autonomy"
 chi_fng.24.b: "Refuse"

 chi_fng.25.t: "Fengtian agrees, With a price"
 chi_fng.25.d: "As the glorious banner of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth flies over the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, the conference between representatives of the Fengtian Clique and the Nationalist government ended in success. The Fengtian Clique has agreed to become a subordinate clique of the Nationalist Government, guaranteeing the loyalty (in name only) of the Northwest for now while promising that the Clique remains autonomous for now of the newly proclaimed Kuomintang government.\n\n[FNG.GetLeader] declared to his army this morning that all flags of the Fengtian Clique be replaced with the banners of the Kuomintang and National Revolutionary Army. By this symbolic gesture, [FNG.GetLeader] has shown to all of China that the country shall henceforth be symbolically united. However, the unification will surely not be met well by the Empire of Japan, which has long sought to divide and exploit our glorious country through their pervasive influence of Mantetsu. The unification with the Northwest will be our bulwark in the defense of the motherland, they shall come for us but they will surely fail."
 chi_fng.25.a: "We have finally united the country!"

 chi_fng.26.t: "The North-east is Ours"
 chi_fng.26.d: "The Fengtian government having agreed to our proposal has yielded and allowed our troops to march into the Fengtian region. The North-east region has been secured for the Kuomintang."

 chi_fng.27.t: "Marshal Zhang steps down"
 chi_fng.27.d: "Following the agreement with the Kuomintang, Marshal Zhang has decided to step down thing morning. This comes as a shock to many and his legacy, while taunted, will always be remembered."
 chi_fng.27.a: "Long live Xueliang"

 chi_fng.28.t: "Fengtian falls"
 chi_fng.28.d: "We have just received news that the Fengtian government has completely given into the Kuomintang. This is a direct threat to our national security as well as our interests in Asia. The Kuomintang now controls the Fengtian region."
 chi_fng.28.a: "Outrageous!"
 chi_fng.28.b: "We can't do anything..."

 chi_fng_war.1.t: "An offer from the Kuomintang"
 chi_fng_war.1.d: "We have just received an offer from the Kuomintang. They say, that if we join them in their struggle against the Fengtian Government, they will grant us control over Eastern Shanxi. We could, however, reject this offer and see what Marshal Zhang might have to offer us..."
 chi_fng_war.1.a: "Tell them we accept"
 chi_fng_war.1.b: "Let's contact Fengtian for a counteroffer"
 chi_fng_war.1.c: "We are a neutral clique for a reason, we refuse."

 chi_fng_war.2.t: "Shanxi refuses to join us"
 chi_fng_war.2.d: "Stating that their neutrality shall not be challenged, The Shanxi government has refused to join us in our struggle against the Fengtian government."
 chi_fng_war.2.a: "At least they didn't join Marshal Zhang"

 chi_fng_war.3.t: "Shanxi accepts our offer"
 chi_fng_war.3.d: "This morning, we received word that Shanxi has agreed to our offer to attack Fengtian. Hopefully, we can rely on Yan to join the war but we should always be cautious as his opportunism has no bounds."
 chi_fng_war.3.a: "They have chosen well"

 chi_fng_war.5.t: "Shanxi proposes an offer"
 chi_fng_war.5.d: "In a recent message, the government of Shanxi has proposed a deal to us. They say that they will join us in our struggle against the Kuomintang, so long as they give us control of Eastern Shanxi. How should we reply?"
 chi_fng_war.5.a: "Yan has placed his faith in the right person, we accept"
 chi_fng_war.5.b: "We won't give away our vital land"

 chi_fng_war.6.t: "Fengtian accepts"
 chi_fng_war.6.d: "We have just received word that Marshal Zhang has agreed to our offer and will be expecting our attack within a short period of time. Let us hope that they don't fail us."
 chi_fng_war.6.a: "We are betting a lot on you Zhang"

 chi_fng_war.7.t: "Time to strike!"
 chi_fng_war.7.d: "Our troops have been deployed to the border and the time has come to begin our intervention and reclaim the eastern parts of our province for the good of the people. Let us hope we've picked the right side..."
 chi_fng_war.7.a: "This should be quite a surprise"

 chi_fng_war.8.t: "Returning Eastern Shanxi?"
 chi_fng_war.8.d: "While giving Yan Eastern Shanxi was a core part of our deal with their government, there is much debate on if we should follow our promises. If we refuse to give up Eastern Shanxi, we will most certainly have another conflict to deal with."
 chi_fng_war.8.a: "We will honour the deal with Yan, but he will have to submit"
 chi_fng_war.8.b: "He is a rebel and will be treated like one"

 chi_fng_war.9.t: "The Kuomintang returns Eastern Shanxi, for a price."
 chi_fng_war.9.d: "The Kuomintang as agreed to follow through with our previous agreement. However, they have demanded that we submit to their authority and join their government. What should we do?"
 chi_fng_war.9.a: "The Kuomintang are one step ahead of us"
 chi_fng_war.9.b: "We will bend to no traitors"

 chi_fng_war.10.t: "The Kuomintang refuse to give up land"
 chi_fng_war.10.d: "The government of the Kuomintang has blatantly refused to return our land to us after we made a pact to help them, this betrayal has shown us that no central government can be trusted. It appears we made the wrong friends..."
 chi_fng_war.10.a: "Why did we trust them!"

 chi_fng_war.11.t: "Shanxi has joined our government"
 chi_fng_war.11.d: "Shanxi has caved to our demands and has joined us. With the region under our firm control, we can look further west to securing any remaining warlords that have eluded us so far. We are one step closer to uniting China under one banner."
 chi_fng_war.11.a: "China is nearly whole again!"

 chi_fng_war.12.t: "Returning Eastern Shanxi?"
 chi_fng_war.12.d: "While giving Yan Eastern Shanxi was a core part of our deal with their government, there is much debate on if we should follow our promises. If we refuse to give up Eastern Shanxi, we will most certainly have another conflict to deal with."
 chi_fng_war.12.a: "We will honour the deal with Yan"
 chi_fng_war.12.b: "He is a rebel and will be treated like one"

 chi_fng_war.13.t: "Eastern Shanxi is ours again"
 chi_fng_war.13.d: "The Fengtian government has returned Eastern Shanxi as promised, Yan was right to place his cards on Zhang as he is true to his word. With Shanxi and Shaanxi fully under our control, we can now truly focus on developing a Model Province."
 chi_fng_war.13.a: "Marshal Zhang is but a part in the machine that is China"

 chi_fng_war.14.t: "Marshal Zhang refuse to give up land"
 chi_fng_war.14.d: "The Fengtian government has blatantly refused to return our land to us after we made a pact to help them, this betrayal has shown us that no central government can be trusted. It appears we made the wrong friends..."
 chi_fng_war.14.a: "Why did we trust them!"

 chi_fng_war.15.t: "Kuomintang incurs past the southern border"
 chi_fng_war.15.d: "We have just received a report from our military garrisons on our border with the Kuomintang. It appears that the Kuomintang has made an incursion past their sector onto our side of the border. This lasted for only a short while until the unit seemingly realised their mistake and quickly returned to their side."
 chi_fng_war.15.a: "How odd..."

 chi_fng_war.16.t: "Kuomintang incursions increase"
 chi_fng_war.16.d: "According to our military command, we have received multiple reports of Kuomintang incursions past their sector of the border. At least six incursions were reported to have happened in different locations across our southern border. We have replied by increasing our garrisons to make sure the syndicalists stay on their side of the border. We should be wary."
 chi_fng_war.16.a: "Are they planning an invasion?"

 chi_fng_war.17.t: "Locals found attacking pro-Kuomintang officials"
 chi_fng_war.17.d: "This morning, we have received word that the people of several border towns seen violently attacking pro-Kuomintang officials in their area. There have been reports of arson and at least three people have been killed."
 chi_fng_war.17.a: "Troubling"

 chi_fng_war.18.t: "Beiyang official killed!"
 chi_fng_war.18.d: "The news of a Beiyang official's death has spread quickly throughout the government. After failing to show up to a conference, he was found dead in his kitchen. While the cause of death has not been confirmed, many in the government are growing increasingly paranoid."
 chi_fng_war.18.a: "A Kuomintang assassin perhaps?"

 chi_fng_war.19.t: "The Red Scare spreading unrest throughout the north"
 chi_fng_war.19.d: "Many protests started seemingly overnight as people took to the streets to burn red flags and chant 'Death to the Reds' and 'Save our Families'. The stories are well known. The people are no fools and are aware of what has been happening. Every day, stories come in from our southern border. Mass executions, confiscation of land, families murdered. The people have seen what these bloodthirsty syndicalists have done to the land and will never allow such a thing to happen here."
 chi_fng_war.19.a: "Something needs to be done before this gets out of hand"

 chi_fng_war.20.t: "Explosion in Beijing"
 chi_fng_war.20.d: "It has just been reported that there has been a massive explosion at an industrial plant in Beijing. It happened seemingly out of nowhere and when authorities arrived at the scene, the building was completely destroyed. At this moment, the death toll appears to be around thirty-four. An investigation is being held to find out who was behind this, but as of now, the people are frightened."
 chi_fng_war.20.a: "This has to be the work of the Kuomintang"

 chi_fng_war.21.t: "The Marshal's decision"
 chi_fng_war.21.d: "After learning of the explosion, Marshal Zhang ordered a meeting of his highest generals and staff to discuss possible actions. As of now, there is much evidence that the Kuomintang was behind the attack. This, in every definition, is a declaration of war by the Kuomintang. What does Marshal Zhang decide to do? "
 chi_fng_war.21.a: "The Kuomintang behind this, they must pay!"
 chi_fng_war.21.b: "This is just fear-mongering, send the military down to quell the unrest"

 chi_fng_war.22.t: "Fengtian issue a declaration of war"
 chi_fng_war.22.d: "This evening, the Fengtian government issued us a formal declaration of war. In the declaration, they claimed that after multiple border incursions, the murder of Fengtian officials, and the aiding of terrorism, they have no other choice but to issue a declaration of war."
 chi_fng_war.22.a: "They have made a grave mistake..."

### Decisions ###
 CHI_military_expeditions_category: "The Chinese National Revolution"
 CHI_military_expeditions_category_desc: "After the disastrous failure of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang's internal unity literally and figuratively split along ideological lines. While the subordinate right-wing faction found refuge with the southern warlords, the Left KMT was reduced to an insurgency in south-east China and a government-in-exile in Paris. The last ten years have seen few openings to re-establish a rival government, but the consensus is that the next attempt must fully embrace social revolution. They may have one last chance to realise Dr Sun's vision."

 CHI_dai_chunfeng_leader_desc: "The notorious 'Hooded Chairman' of the KMT, Dai Chunfeng rose to power first as a minor protegé of the late Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek, and then through his leadership of the ZhongTeJu. Devoted to a very personal interpretation of the Kuomintang's mission to unify and revive China, Dai and his allies seized control of the Nationalist government after a long-standing period of instability made it clear that there was no alternative but the KMT's security apparatus taking the helm of state. As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."

 CHI_dai_chunfeng_desc: "§YBorn: §LMarch 28, 1897, Zhejiang, Qing Empire§L\nVarious stories explain how the silent yet ambitious protegé of Chiang Kai-shek came to the Kuomintang. Some say that he was introduced to the Whampoa Military Academy by one of its leading members of the KMT right, Dai Jitao - others say he was introduced by his friend Mao Rendang. The “laoban” of the ZhongTeju has never revealed his origins and following his shady character - most likely never will.\n\nBorn in Zhejiang, Dai lived a rough life amidst the dim lights of Shanghai’s filthiest underground quarters. Until 1923, he was mentored by the leader of the Axe Gang, Wang Yaqiao. A skilled gambler, it was here in Shanghai where he met Du Yusheng - head of the Green Gang and an associate of Chiang Kai-shek’s. From there, he entered Whampoa’s Sixth Class and became a favorite of Chiang’s, helping Chiang keep an eye on subversive elements within the party’s left-wing.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition failed, Dai fled to the Legation Cities, where he continued his underground criminal activities. As such, he was able to develop an incredibly complex intelligence organisation, due to his already established networks in the underground - some regard his intelligence agency as perhaps the largest in China. For years, he had been coordinating activities with Song Qingling’s insurgent zone, and upon the return of the Central Committee - he was ready to meet them with open arms…§!"

 CHI_chen_duxiu: "Chen Duxiu"
 CHI_chen_duxiu_leader_desc: "A lifelong experience of failing his Confucian exams taught Chen Duxiu one thing - that the old order had to go. Centuries of archaic decrepit institutions from the perfidious Manchus simply clogged the progression of mankind especially in regards to the Marxist interpretation of history.\n\nIn 1915, he would go on to found the popular journal “New Youth” and joined fellow leftist educator Cai Yuanpei in Beijing where both men lashed out against the perceived backwardness of China and the necessity for a new model, a new method to allow China to enter the modern age and reassert herself in the world once more. In Beijing, he was attracted to Li Dazhao’s Marxist study group and when word broke out of revolution in France in 1919, Chen Duxiu believed that a syndicalist model was China’s natural progression in the Marxist historical materialist model - that the workers and peasants of Chinese society would lead the revolution against the corrupt bourgeoise and feudal warlords that were leading China to ruin. As such in 1921, Chen Duxiu and other prominent socialist leaders gathered in Shanghai to proclaim the Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP).\n\nWhen the Kuomintang rose up in 1923, the Commune of France’s recognition of the Kuomintang was granted only on the condition that the Kuomintang accept the CSP as a junior partner in the national revolution. Given the CSP’s small size and lack of popular support among the rural peasantry and petit bourgeoise, Chen Duxiu naturally accepted. However, when the Northern Expedition ended in failure in 1927, the Chinese Syndicalist Party fled alongside the Kuomintang. Chen Duxiu headed for a life of secrecy and exile, changing locations frequently from friendly Guangdong to the narrow alleyways of Shanghai’s red-light districts.\n\n Against the odds, the Syndicalist Party of China has come to power and a new era dawns for the Chinese workers. As Chen Duxiu takes up the mantle of leadership, no doubt the disagreements and factionalism that have arisen in the exile will come to surface as the CSP calls to convene. And while the CSP has unified the country under the banner of syndicalism, it was only due to the aid of a foreign nation -but a victory nonetheless, as Chen Duxiu’s visions for China slowly become reality."

 CHI_wang_jingwei: "Wang Jingwei"
 CHI_wang_jingwei_leader_desc: "Wang Jingwei is a divisive figure within the KMT that has nevertheless maintained his control over the party leadership for over a decade. His rise to national prominence started shortly before the Xinhai Revolution in 1910 when he failed to assassinate the Qing Regent Zaifeng (Puyi's father), but became a sensationalised revolutionary hero while in captivity.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, Wang was released and his radical political writings became more famous. Though refusing to sign an oath of personal loyalty to Sun Yat-Sen after his refounding of the KMT, Wang would later become a member and a prominent official in the Guangdong government. Aligning himself with the growing left-radical factions of the KMT and the army’s ‘New Guard’, Wang outmanoeuvred Hu Hanmin in 1925 to become Sun Yat-Sen’s successor.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Northern Expedition and the German Intervention shattered the Guangdong Government. Wang and the other radicals were immediately attacked by Sun Fo and other moderates for the failures of the expedition, but his control over party positions and personal alliances prevented his deposition.\nWang survives to this day by these factors, but he is highly aware that his future leadership rests on what happens in the next attempt at revolution.\n\nIn terms of personality, Wang Jingwei is a flamboyant, blustery character who is a natural orator. His penchant for wearing military uniforms when acting in a position as Commander-In-Chief makes many of his opponents see him as megalomaniacal, but he usually lets actual officers take the lead when it comes to military decisions. His insistence at maintaining an alliance with the Syndicalist powers is only surpassed by his desire to avoid another intervention by Germany or Japan at all costs until China is unified and ready to fight them."

After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Song decided to stay in China as an outlaw in southern Fujian out of a strong feeling of patriotism.

While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the Minsheng program represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."

His military career began in 1904 when he entered the Liangguang Accelerated Army Academy of the Qing Army in Guangdong. After graduation, he headed north to the Beiyang Army Officers Academy in Beijing - later to become the prestigious Baoding Military Academy. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, he joined the revolutionary army in Jiangsu and returned to Beijing after the revolution to complete his studies.\n\nLi returned to Guangdong in 1922 at the invitation of his former classmate Deng Keng, who was division commander of the First Division of the Guangdong Army. This was interrupted by Deng’s assassination and Chen Jiongming’s coup in Guangdong. When Dr. Sun returned to Guangdong in 1923, Li served in the new revolutionary government and became Deputy Dean of Whampoa Military Academy under Chiang Kai-shek. When the Northern Expedition broke out, Li served as Governor of Guangdong, Military Affairs Commissioner, and acting president of Whampoa.\n\nBut when the expedition failed, he was blamed for not holding on to Guangzhou, which had fallen into German hands, and was thus blamed for costing the KMT would could have been a triumphant revolution. As much of the party fled for France, Li stayed behind - convincing a remnant of the National Revolutionary Army to remain and fight as guerrilla forces.

Chen’s views are Marxist, as shown in his recently published work "Revelations in Chinese History" and his newspaper “The People’s Vanguard.” To Chen, the Kuomintang must be the revolutionary vanguard, and its ranks must be filled with determined comrades willing to purge and “reorganise” the party along correct ideological lines. From there, the one-party state will reorganise the workers and peasants of the country into economic producers of society - with the eventual goal of utopian socialist economic cooperatives in both the agricultural and urban sectors of the country. He envisions a China-built from the ground up by the workers and for the workers, one that will finally break the chains of western imperialism by pursuing its native capital with the help of the state. As such, economically he does support the confiscation of land by force through the peasantry should the landlords not accept government intervention.

Here, he would be reunited with several of his former Whampoa classmates, such as Deng Wenyi and the sons of his former mentor Chiang. This so-called “Young Guard” of Whampoa has been studying in the Union of Britain since the early 1930s. With the return of the Central Committee, they hope to bring the same revolutionary spirit of Whampoa back to the National Revolutionary Army."

 CHI_deng_wenyi_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 18, 1905\nLiling County, Changsha, Hunan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhen he was twenty-two years old, Deng Wenyi traveled from his hometown in Hunan to attend the first class of Guangzhou’s Base Camp Army Lecture School opened by his fellow Hunnanese Cheng Qian. The school opened in 1924, but at the end of the year, the students of this first-class transferred to China’s newest military school - Sun Yat-sen’s Whampoa Military Academy. As a first-class member, he made a name for himself after being wounded in the Eastern Expedition against Chen Jiongming.\n\nWith the approval of the school’s principal Chiang Kai-shek, Deng took a year off to study at the Commune of France. However, his trip was short-lived as the Northern Expedition had broken out. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the director of the political department at Whampoa, instructing the recruits that their cause was just and that the Kuomintang was a party like none other. But the Northern Expedition failed.\n\nLike many others, Deng fled to Europe, where he met his classmates from the first class of Whampoa, such as He Zhonghan. This group shared the same radical view that the revolution had not been lost but betrayed. If it were to succeed, it would need a great leader to lead it - someone of the same caliber as the late Chiang and a stronger, reformed National Revolutionary Army. He was then appointed as chief military attaché to the Union of Britain, where he followed the rise of Maximism. When the Central Committee returned to Fujian, he would once again be one of the first to rush into battle - willing to throw his life in danger for the revolution's success."

After graduation, he served on the cruiser “Hai Rong” and when the Xinhai Revolution broke out he supported the revolutionaries. In 1921, he served as captain of the Yangtze River Patrol and by 1924, he held the title of rear admiral. When the Northern Expedition broke out in 1925, Chen Jiling chose to defect to the National Revolutionary Army. However, the revolution’s failure prompted him to follow much of the Central Committee into retreat in Europe. Since he already held the qualifications of an experienced seaman, he naturally found a home in the Union of Britain - where he has been studying the latest in naval tactics and developments with the hope that one day he will be able to bring about the creation of China’s own modern fleets."

His aggressive and dogmatic approach to furthering the Nationalist Revolution led him to first become allied with the Minsheng faction, and later the Chinese Syndicalist Party. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. Fang is a charismatic leader who acts as a bridge between the growing radical syndicalist movement and the order established by the KMT."
