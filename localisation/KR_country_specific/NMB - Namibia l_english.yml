### Events ###
 nmb.30.t: "[GetYear] Syndicalist Convention"
 nmb.30.d: "With the revolution finally being brought to Namibia, we must hold a convention like all formal Syndicalist countries. Three main parties have ended up being contenders. There is the Radical Socialist RAP, which is run by young revolutionaries who wanted to be free from Mittelafrika, the SSP which wanted to bring a revolution to the entirety of Mittelafrika, and the Internationale aligned SPI which believes a European Revolution is necessary before an African one. The victor turned out to be..."
 nmb.30.a: "The Internationale aligned SPI."
 nmb.30.b: "The revolutionary SSP"
 nmb.30.c: "The young ARP"

 nmb.31.t: "Dealing with the German-Namibians"
 nmb.31.ds: "German Namibians are a minority among normal Namibians, which migrated here when the Germans came into control in the 1880s. Unexpectedly, German Namibians have merged well with the Namibian culture and have even formed their own subculture among normal Namibians. However, some radical factions within the Congress think all German Namibians should be removed from Namibia, as they serve as a reminder of our time under imperialist German rule."
 nmb.31.da: "German Namibians are a minority among normal Namibians, which migrated here when the Germans came into control in the 1880s. Unexpectedly, German Namibians have merged well with the Namibian culture and have even formed their own subculture among normal Namibians. However, the current monarchy holds a strong grudge against German colonialism from the past uprisings against German rule and the many purges of the Namibian population."
 nmb.31.a: "German-Namibians are an imperialist construct"
 nmb.31.b: "We'll have revenge for the past"
 nmb.31.c: "They are culturally Namibian, they can stay"

 nmb.32.t: "German Namibians Resist Exportation"
 nmb.32.d: "With the official announcement of the deportation of German Namibians, we have already been met with fierce resistance. The Germans have protested in the streets that have not been gathered up yet with signs stating 'Auch wir sind Namibier!' meaning 'We are Namibians too!'. Some consider continuing or implementing harsher policies on the population to make them stop, while others suggest giving up on the project altogether."
 nmb.32.a: "Continue as normal"
 nmb.32.b: "Put those who resist at the end of our gun"
 nmb.32.c: "Maybe we should let them stay..."

 nmb.33.t: "The Germans Revolt!"
 nmb.33.s: "With our decision to react hostile to the German protests, the resistance has only grown larger, with even our own population going against us in some areas. While our guards are doing well in suppressing the areas, it has made the people lose confidence in our government."
 nmb.33.ns: "Our decision to let the protests continue has resulted in the German population in the south revolting against our government, but has failed to gain popular traction within the rest of Namibia. however, as long as this revolt continues, we can expect to have delays in the deportation process."
 nmb.33.a: "We'll have to wait it out"
 nmb.33.b: "They're leaving, by force if necessary"

 nmb.34.t: "The German Revolt Ends"
 nmb.34.d: "Due to our efforts, the German revolt has officially come to an end. The fact that it happened in the first place is less than desirable, with many lives being unnecessarily lost on both sides in the process. The Germans have begun to pack up their bags and are being exported. Hopefully, Namibia won't have a problem like this anytime in the future."
 nmb.34.a: "Surely this could've been handled better"
 nmb.34.b: "They've learned their lesson"

 nmb.35.t: "The Germans Leave Africa"
 nmb.35.d: "With the revolt over and the situation calmed, the German 'Namibians' have finally left our home. The exportation was a sad time for many Namibians who got close to the Germans, and is still left a highly unpopular decision in our government. We'll need to deal with the consequences of this into the future, for the rest of Namibia's existence."
 nmb.35.a: "Peace at last"

 nmb.36.t: "The First Namibian Elections"
 nmb.36.d: "With Namibia recently being liberated from German rule and put under a Democratic mandate, the conditions are right to host the First Namibian Elections. There are four main parties running, the Republikanische Partei which focuses on more rights for the native tribes in the area, the Otavi Minen und Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft which wants to build more railways within Namibia, the Südwestafrikanischer Nationalverein which argues for consolidation in the country and largely removing tribal rule, and the Südwestafrikanische Volksorganisation, an Ovambo based party which wants greater cooperation between tribes and an increase of Christian morals. All these parties have a chance of winning, but the party which came out on top is..."

 nmb.37.a: "Give them what they need"
 nmb.37.b: "We have our own military to worry about"

 nmb.38.t: "[From.GetName] Supplies Arrives!"
 nmb.38.sent: "[From.GetName] has been very generous and sent us what we desired! We have gotten a shipment of 2000 rifles, which is more than enough to build up our military."
 nmb.38.nosend: "[From.GetName] has realised that defending their country takes priority over defending their autonomies. We'll have to rely on the local guards we raised earlier to defend our country."
 nmb.38.a: "We must thank [From.GetName]"
 nmb.38.b: "That is a shame..."
