### Events ###
 malta.1.t: "An Union with Italy?"
 malta.1.d: "Within the last few decades, much has changed for our small nation. For over 100 years before the British Revolution, we were a colony of the British crown, serving as a vital strategic base for the Royal Navy - but when Britain fell, our overlords could no longer justify keeping forces on our islands, and requested that the Algiers government take up the role in their stead.\n\nBut now, our nation has found itself a sovereign state for the first time in over a century, even if still under the auspices of another power. While some are excited at the prospect of independence, others have become nervous with the tense state of the world - while our new protectors have pledged to defend us against all enemies, there has been traction among our government for a sort of federation with our allies in [italy.GetNameDef]. While the Maltese share a language and culture distinct from the Italians, there are enough cultural ties to place the idea within reason, at least until the world reaches a less dangerous moment - should we make the request?"
 malta.1.a: "Yes, we should ask [italy.GetNameDef] for protection."
 malta.1.b: "Yes, we should ask [ROOT.Overlord.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] to approve a union."
 malta.1.c: "No - Malta will be responsible for herself."

 malta.2.t: "Malta Seeks Union with Italy"
 malta.2.d: "Interesting things are afoot on the isles of Malta. The small island nation has spent over a century as a domain of the British Empire, owing to its immense strategic value over the Mediterranean - with the coming of the British Revolution, the Algiers government was tasked with the protection of the colony. Apparently, they didn't do an incredible job, for now Malta has been taken over and stands as a nominally independent state.\n\nItalian irredentists have long held designs upon Malta, claiming that the islands share a cultural history with them, and that its strategic position is a critical step for establishing dominance over the Mediterranean. Now that Malta has become allied to us, our diplomats have been making attempts to persuade figures within the Maltese government to request a federation with our state - a temporary measure until the global situation stabilises, of course. It seems that we've finally convinced them: Valletta has formally submitted a request for our protection. We have accomplished one of the dreams of Italian nationalists without having to fire a shot."
 malta.2.a: "We welcome Malta with open arms!"

 malta.3.t: "Malta Seeks Union with Italy"
 malta.3.d: "Interesting things are afoot on the isles of Malta. The small island nation has spent over a century as a domain of the British Empire, owing to its immense strategic value over the Mediterranean - with the coming of the British Revolution, the Algiers government was tasked with the protection of the colony. Apparently, they didn't do an incredible job, for now Malta has been taken over and stands as a nominally independent state.\n\nItalian irredentists have long held designs upon Malta, claiming that the islands share a cultural history with them, and that its strategic position is a critical step for establishing dominance over the Mediterranean. It would seem that [italy.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] diplomats have been making efforts to persuade the Maltese government to form a sort of federation with them - according to them, this arrangement would better protect Malta in the tense world climate. Their efforts must be bearing fruit, for today Valletta has asked us to approve of this federation.\n\nOur advisors tell us that Malta is far from being a natural part of Italy and retains a very distinct culture, and therefore it is far from guaranteed that the people of Malta genuinely want this union... but even so, it would consolidate resources in a way that makes the proposal worth considering. Should we approve of this idea?"
 malta.3.a: "Allow the project to go ahead."
 malta.3.b: "No, it would be better if they were separate."

 malta.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Union with Italy"
 malta.4.d: "We have received a response: [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approved of our request for a union. Preparations are already underway."
 malta.4.a: "Very well."

 malta.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Union with Italy"
 malta.5.d: "We have received a response: unfortunately, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has turned us down. It seems that they doubt that the idea would be popular among the Maltese, or have differing strategic concerns - or both."
 malta.5.a: "Tragic."
