### Characters ###
 MAF_Hermann_von_Goering: "Hermann von Göring"
 MAF_Hermann_von_Goering_leader_desc: "Von Göring rose to prominence as one of Germany's more successful fighter pilots of the Weltkrieg, scoring more than twenty victories by the end of the war and winning numerous decorations.\n\nHis ambitions soon turned political, and he became chairman of the Alldeutsche Verband - which he led to an 8% turnout in the 1928 election. He was then appointed to Mittelafrika in a move by the colonial office that many suspect was as much to rid Germany of another troublemaker as it was to ensure proper governance of its African colonies. Von Göring, meanwhile, sees his appointment as a stepping stone and his ticket to claiming the chancellery after a successful term in the colonies."

 MAF_Ernst_Juenger: "Ernst Jünger"
 MAF_Ernst_Juenger_leader_desc: "Awarded the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg, Jünger is something of a renaissance man. He is both an accomplished author, with his best-seller "Storm of Steel" and an educated entomologist, using his time in Africa to discover and document numerous species, while introducing our Askari to 'stormtrooper tactics'. Jünger broke with the German Army after a dispute carried through a series of articles published in military journals in the mid-20s.\n\nUnable to convince the General Staff to adopt his views, he took a transfer to Africa, where he was more free to implement his theories on the importance of psychology in modern warfare. A member of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Ernst Jünger will bring what he calls a "new spirit of adventure" to the colonisation of Africa, as well as help us reform our infantry tactics."

 MAF_Franz_Ritter_von_Epp: "Franz Ritter von Epp"
 MAF_Franz_Ritter_von_Epp_leader_desc: "A former General and current politician, Ritter von Epp fought in the Herero uprising and the ensuing repression, and earned the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg. After the war, Chancellor Ludendorf appointed him as the first postwar governor of Kamerun. Returning to Germany after serving as governor for three years, Ritter von Epp turned to politics, funding the creation of several patriotic newspapers, and serving in the Bavarian chamber of Imperial Counsellors. Ritter von Epp has never tried to hide his close ties to the Ludendorf dictatorship, and remains an outspoken apologist for Ludendorf. He is a controversial, almost belligerent figure, but the Kaiser has decided a fighting man is what Africa needs. A supporter of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Franz Ritter brings years of military experience and service to his post."

 MAF_Georg_Kraut: "Georg Kraut"
 MAF_Georg_Kraut_leader_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, Kraut was one of the most senior officers in East Afrika, after Generals von Lettow-Vorbeck and Wahle. He took command of the battles of Kilimanjaro, Saliata Hill and Latema Nek, leading the troops to victory each time. After the war, he took divisional command and put down rebellions in the Upper Kongo and Ruvuma Valley. In 1925, he would be the one to negotiate the entry of German troops into British East Africa and conduct the occupation. Later, he would become commander of all armed forces in Mittelafrika. To the extent that the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft has a leader, it's him. With Generaloberst Georg Kraut in command, we can expect to continue the finest German military traditions."

 MAF_Ludwig_Bockholt: "Ludwig Bockholt"
 MAF_Ludwig_Bockholt_leader_desc: "Bockholt is best known for his daring resupply of General von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg. The young commander Bockholt flew the Airship L 59 "Afrika-Schiff" from Jamboli Airstation in Bulgaria to the Mahange plateau in Ostafrika, after a gruelling 100-hour flight across the deserts of Egypt and Sudan. The voyage resupplied our armies in Afrika with new weapons, ammunition, and most critically, quinine, that helped keep our armies in good fighting order until the Treaty of Versailles. It was the only resupply of East Afrika during the war, and holds other distinctions such as the longest military flight record, and flying the first aerial resupply mission. Because the mission was a one-way trip, Buckholt served the rest of the war as a naval infantry officer in the East Afrikan Theatre. After the war, Commodore Bockholt continued to refine his aerial resupply tactics and equipment, creating air mobile and later paratrooper naval infantry units. Despite such an innovative spirit, he is one of the leading officers of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and proved to be a thorn in the side of Governor von Göring, clashing with him frequently on the direction, and command of Mittelafrika's Air Force. With Bockholt as our Governor, we can expect Mittelafrika to maintain world-class aerial infantry."

 MAF_Rudolf_Asmis: "Rudolf Asmis"
 MAF_Rudolf_Asmis_leader_desc: "Dr Asmis is a jurist with a long career in the Reichskolonialamt. He has served as a district officer in Togoland, Consul to the Belgian Congo, Counsellor to the General Government of Belgium, delegate to the Shanghai Convention, and most recently, head of the Reichskolonialamt. His most notable, and controversial work has been with his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimising and formalising local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law. This has had been tried in Samoa with some success in reducing conflict with the locals. With such a long history in Imperial and Foreign affairs, he naturally has a close relationship with the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and will favour their ideas in decision making. A gifted diplomat with global experience as the head of the Reichskolonialamt, Dr Asmis is eager to see Afrika fulfil a key role in Germany's Weltpolitik."

 MAF_Theodor_von_Hassel: "Theodor von Hassel"
 MAF_Theodor_von_Hassel_leader_desc: "The leader of the Reformgruppe and son of General Friedrich von Hassel. Theodor von Hassel came to Afrika as a Oberleutnant in the Schutztruppe, and served in the Maji Maji rebellion. In the Siege of the Mahenge, his group of sixty soldiers held off several thousand rebel attackers, winning him the Order of the Red Eagle. After the Maji Maji war, von Hassel left the Schutztruppe to found a coffee farm, but volunteered for service during the Weltkrieg. After the war, he returned to his coffee plantation, which has grown into one of the most successful in German East Africa. Dissatisfied with the way settlers like him were treated, and helped into politics by his father in law, the politician Jacob Jebsen, Theodor von Hassel spent years agitating on behalf of settlers' rights to democratic representation, as well as economic and political rights. The Kaiser has seen this man represents the will of the white and educated native population of Africa and has deemed him worthy of being Governor."

 MAF_British_Settlers: "The Mandate Question"
 MAF_British_Settlers_desc: "The formerly British colonies have been under German mandate since the collapse of the British Empire in 1925. Their governmental structures remain largely intact, though power is increasingly consolidated in the hands of a handful of rich landowners.\n\nSince we cannot directly interact with their governance, this may turn out to be a problem in the long run."

 MAF_Cut_Supply: "Cut off funding"
 MAF_Cut_Supply_desc: "In order to stave off ideas like "sovereignty", the German homeland has decided to punish Mittelafrika with a reduction in its supplies and funding.\nWithout much of the vital supply required in order to maintain the pacification of untamed areas, many areas on the dark continent are slipping away from Dar-es-Salaam's control, and are at risk of slipping into the control of local forces.\nIt's to be seen if this move manages to affect the wayward colonial authorities to come begging back for the fatherland's help, or if it is merely just another step in the gradual loss of control that has been plaguing the administration."

 MAF_border_shit_show: "Border Raids"
 MAF_border_shit_show_desc: "There are ongoing 'bandit' raids along our border; they are destroying crops, burning villages and killing our guards. While the Portuguese promise they know nothing about these 'bandits', we are sure they are behind them. Either way, the raids will continue to be a thorn in our side until we put an end to the flow of guns to these 'bandits'."
 MAF_Lost_Bushwar_Debuff: "Rising Resistance"
 MAF_Lost_Bushwar_Debuff_desc: "With the loss of Mittelafrikan troops to Portuguese forces, there has been a significant rise in the activity of anti-colonial movements as a response. With the colonial forces battered, and their reputation as an undefeated army tarnished, many are willing to take up arms and fight the German forces head-on, and colonial forces can't do much in the meantime to oppose them."

 MAF_Lost_Bushwar_Light_Debuff: "Recent Resistance"
 MAF_Lost_Bushwar_Light_Debuff_desc: "With the loss of Mittelafrikan troops to Portuguese forces, there has been a significant rise in tensions in the colony as a result. With the colonial forces battered, and their reputation as an undefeated army somewhat tarnished, some are still willing to take up arms and fight the German forces head-on, and colonial forces are in weak shape to oppose them."

 MAF_post_collapse_army: "'Unconventional' Army"
 MAF_post_collapse_army_desc: "Armies created following the collapse of Mittelafrika aren't conventional. They don't have the same ability to defend and hold the line as more standard divisions, but are better able to move and fight in the harsh conditions of Africa. Additionally, while conventional factories are few and far between there are ample opportunities to scavenge equipment, providing a steady if limited supply of arms."

 MAF_on_borrowed_time_desc: "Ever since our defeat in Europe, we have ingloriously retreated to Africa, just like the French before us. The situation is far from ideal - we lack the industry, men, and guns to match our old glory. But worse are the locals... they are eyeing our weakness, and their loyalties are shifting. Foreign powers, ambitious warlords, and internal fighting are chipping away at the fragile, rotting infrastructure our predecessors have neglected. We have to move fast, or else Germany will be lost!"

### State Modifiers ###
 MAF_british_kenya: "Colony and Protectorate of Kenya"
 MAF_british_kenya_desc: "British Kenya has been under a German mandate since 1925. However, the British insist on maintaining their own security. Troops may only enter during wartime."

 MAF_british_nigeria_desc: "British Nigeria has been under a German mandate since 1925. However, the British insist on maintaining their own security. Troops may only enter during wartime."

### Focuses ###
### Four Year Plan
 MAF_Four_Year_Plan: "Four Year Plan"
 MAF_Four_Year_Plan_desc: "Trouble is brewing in Europe and Asia: Germany's enemies are growing bolder every day while our own military has become complacent. We must set a timetable for our economic and military rearmament to ensure that we are ready to support the Fatherland in every way possible."

 MAF_Army_Reforms: "Reform the Army"
 MAF_Army_Reforms_desc: "The African Askari of 1914 was up to the standard of the contemporary European soldier. Today, he is still up to the standard of 1914. He is not ready for the kind of mechanised, artillery intensive battles we saw in Europe by the end of the war. We have to fix that."

 MAF_Heavy_Equipment: "Heavy Equipment"
 MAF_Heavy_Equipment_desc: "If our military is to match the standards of Germany, we shall need equipment: tanks, planes, artillery guns, these are the weapons of modern war!"

 MAF_Africa_Army: "The Africa Divisions"
 MAF_Africa_Army_desc: "Now that we are on our way to parity in modern warfare, it is not enough for our Askari to serve as a colonial police force. Like the Gurkhas for the British, and Senegalese for the French, the best of the native populace will serve as shock troops for the German army."

 MAF_Long_Range_Airforce: "A Long-Range Air Force"
 MAF_Long_Range_Airforce_desc: "Africa is far from the major theatres of war. In order to engage our enemies, we must construct a fleet of long-range bombers capable of even transoceanic voyages. Even if we never use it, our ability to project air power across the Indian and Atlantic oceans will greatly improve our prestige."

 MAF_War_Economy: "A War Economy"
 MAF_War_Economy_desc: "War is inevitable, and time is precious. In the Weltkrieg, we gained a great advantage by mobilising faster than the British in Africa. We must be the first to mobilise in the next war as well."

 MAF_African_War_Industries: "African War Industries"
 MAF_African_War_Industries_desc: "African labourers will work for far less than the average German, if we pay them at all. It makes sense therefore to encourage the development of simple manufacturing processes suitable to Africa instead."

 MAF_Kulturkampf: "A Second Kulturkampf"
 MAF_Kulturkampf_desc: "In the 1870s, the German Parliament passed 22 laws to curb the power of the Catholic Church. By ruthlessly enforcing these laws, we can curb foreign elements - particularly the Belgians and their lingering influence in the Congo - and also ensure the monopoly of our own secular and German education system."

 MAF_Protect_Animals: "Protected Endangered Species"
 MAF_Protect_Animals_desc: "It's incredible to think, but some of the most iconic species of Africa, particularly the lion, are in danger of being totally exterminated, as the wolf was from Europe. In 1870, the last Atlas Bear was shot by hunters. Our Governor has a particular interest in pushing laws that ensure this will not happen to our native species."

 MAF_Sovereign_State: "A Sovereign State"
 MAF_Sovereign_State_desc: "Now that von Göring's position as Sovereign Governor has been established, it is time to turn the rest of our administration toward furthering our autonomy and authority."

 MAF_Proving_Grounds: "Swakopmund Proving Grounds"
 MAF_Proving_Grounds_desc: "Flamethrowers, artillery pieces, bombs. We have it all. However, it is proven that training on them in proper facilities is more efficient than firing indiscriminately into the wilderness. As such, military training is henceforth to be conducted at the Swakopmund Proving Grounds, where we can both supervise how our equipment is handled as well as note any flaws in operation and construction."

 MAF_white_phosphorus: "Develop the Flüssigkeitsbrandbombe"
 MAF_white_phosphorus_desc: "Traditional bombing tactics have limited use in the dense foliage of Africa. The thick vegetation and jungle require a new weapon: the Flüssigkeitsbrandbombe 'the Liquid Fire Bomb'. Its effect on enemy combatants is as horrific as it is effective."

 MAF_Jet_Research: "African Jet Aircraft"
 MAF_Jet_Research_desc: "Africa is vast and we can't depend on anyone else to control it. We must develop and create the latest developments in aerial warfare; jet aircraft. With them, no one will be able to challenge us in all the continent!"

 MAF_Establish_Lion_Society: "Establish the Lion Society"
 MAF_Establish_Lion_Society_desc: "Africa has long been rumoured to harbour secret societies like the 'Leopard' and 'Crocodile' societies, who are supposedly responsible for many unsolved murders and criminal acts. We can borrow this air of mystique for our own growing body of assassins and illicit enterprises."

 MAF_sovereign_is_he: "Sovereign is he..."
 MAF_sovereign_is_he_desc: "Mittelafrika has always been a patchwork of treaties established with various African kingdoms, which retained their autonomy and royalty in exchange for acceptance of German sovereignty. It is time to end this, and have one law and one sovereign entity in Mittelafrika."

 MAF_who_decides_on_the_exception: "...who decides on the exception"
 MAF_who_decides_on_the_exception_desc: "The Governor is not merely a bureaucrat fulfilling a government role. We have already established that he is not accountable to Germany, and it is now important to establish that he is co-equal to the highest authority in Africa. The Kaiser has given the Statthalter a sacred trust. In Africa, the Statthalter's word is the same as the Kaiser's."

 MAF_british_protectorates: "The Legal Status of the British Protectorates"
 MAF_british_protectorates_desc: "The status quo surrounding the British Colonies and Protectorates satisfies no one. Let us strive to amend this as soon as possible."

 MAF_disarm_the_british: "Disband the Paramilitaries"
 MAF_disarm_the_british_desc: "Even before our arrival, the British populations of Kenya and Northern Rhodesia worked to ensure their security through 'rifle clubs', auxiliary police associations and paramilitaries. Rowdy and lacking any semblance of central leadership, these organisations do as much harm as they do good. It is time to put an end to their reign of terror."

 MAF_end_british_protectorates: "Annex The British Colonies"
 MAF_end_british_protectorates_desc: "In 1925 the Island of Britain fell to the plague of socialism. Our armies moved into British territory to prevent the revolution from reaching Africa, establishing a trusteeship over the British colonies until a 'responsible British government' could be restored. We shall end this farce, the colonies are ours by right of conquest."

### New Administration
 MAF_New_Administration: "A New Administration"
 MAF_New_Administration_desc: "In order to further assert our control over Africa, it is necessary to take inventory of our administrators and staff, and coordinate a plan of action."

 MAF_responsible_governance: "A Return to Responsible Governance"
 MAF_responsible_governance_desc: "It has been more than a decade since the British colonies and protectorates have seen an appointment of new governors and administrators. With the collapse of the government in London, the local Legislative and Executive Council have persisted. They have been sidelined long enough, and shall take up the mantle of the governance of the British Colonies."

 MAF_arm_the_british: "Reconcile the Paramilitaries"
 MAF_arm_the_british_desc: "While some may see the British settler's paramilitaries as a nuisance, we see it as an opportunity. A large armed, conservative and white population can reinforce our rule and protect against native uprisings. We should grant our official blessing to these organisations."

 MAF_integrate_the_british: "Integrate the Anglo Security Forces"
 MAF_integrate_the_british_desc: "We can reduce discontent in our British trusteeships by offering their officers commissions in our forces at an equivalent rank. They will feel less like a subject population, and we get a wealth of well-trained officers."

 MAF_british_self_rule: "Restore British Self Rule"
 MAF_british_self_rule_desc: "Attempting to integrate the British Colonies into our Colonial Union would not only be foolish - for neither Berlin nor the Brits on the ground want this to happen - but also exceedingly difficult. Still, the status quo cannot continue. We should thus instead restore some measure of self-rule to these people, as part of our trusteeship to restore responsible government to these territories."

 MAF_Bezirk: "Bezirksleiterrecht"
 MAF_Bezirk_desc: "Much of the law that ordinary Africans operate and face trial under is not German law, but local tribal laws, arbitrated by tribal leaders and elders. Rather than trying to stamp it out and flood our limited number of acceptable judges, lawyers and jurors, Rudolf Asmis has proposed we have teams of legal experts consult with the locals to put into writing and modernise their local laws."

 MAF_African_Landtag: "An African Landtag"
 MAF_African_Landtag_desc: "Rather than all power residing in the Governor, we shall have two branches of legislature, a Herrenhaus made up of German noblemen and African kings, and an Abgeordnetenhaus, decided on by mainly white voters."

 MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms: "Autonomous Kingdoms"
 MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms_desc: "Some areas of Africa are not suitable for white settlement, and our rule is particularly dependent on the goodwill of local rulers. Rather than trying to coordinate, we should grant them greater independence and autonomy, though naturally with ourselves as suzerain."

 MAF_African_Studies: "Promote African Studies in Germany"
 MAF_African_Studies_desc: "The official language of our administration is Swahili, but there are few opportunities to learn it elsewhere, not to mention the hundreds of other native languages used in Africa. To have a steady supply of competent administrators, we should encourage German universities to train specialists in African languages and cultures."

 MAF_Royal_Tours: "Royal Tours"
 MAF_Royal_Tours_desc: "In Africa, we mostly rule through local intermediaries, Kings and Chieftains whose rule we back with iron authority. We can use them to help modernise from the ground up, while also integrating them better into the empire by introducing them to the society of Kings, Dukes and other Royalty that makes up our larger empire."

 MAF_Back_To_Basics: "Back to the Basics"
 MAF_Back_To_Basics_desc: "Our administration draws from over 50 years of experience on the Dark Continent. Undefeated against impossible odds in the Weltkrieg, we understand that Africa is very different from Europe, and are aware of our limitations. This is our strength, not our weakness!"

 MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe: "Reform the Schutztruppe"
 MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe_desc: "For too long our Schutztruppe has operated in military fashion despite not being part of the German military. Though they displayed outstanding bravery during the Weltkrieg, they are a police force, not an occupying army. It's time they acted like it."

 MAF_African_Army: "An African Army"
 MAF_African_Army_desc: "We should never forget that our Askari are trained to secure and defend Africa. To this end, we require light infantry capable of operating in the brush and jungle on low supply."

 MAF_Honorary_Officers: "Honorary Officers"
 MAF_Honorary_Officers_desc: "The core of our authority are the Askari, who obey without question, and the local authorities who can effectively administrate our territories. We should blend the two by adopting Kings and Chieftains as honorary officers in our armed forces."

### Economy Tree
 MAF_African_Breadbasket: "The African Breadbasket"
 MAF_African_Breadbasket_desc: "Much of Africa has little in the way of agricultural development, but what we do have is invested in cash crops suitable only for the tropics. The last Weltkrieg showed that Germany is vulnerable to its lack of foodstuffs, and so by focusing on staples such as corn and rice, rather than tobacco and pepper, we can help ensure victory."

 MAF_Cash_Crops: "Cash Crops Exports"
 MAF_Cash_Crops_desc: "It is no secret that the quest for exotic goods has always been a driver of imperialism. Many tropical crops can grow in the Sub-Saharan environment such as coffee and cocoa. We should focus on these rather than staples, importing food from Ukraine or East Prussia to make up for any imbalances."

 MAF_Strategic_Export: "Strategic Resources Export"
 MAF_Strategic_Export_desc: "In the event of war, Mittelafrika must serve to feed the great German war machine. Expanding our production of strategic resources will ensure we can outproduce our enemies and strengthen the Fatherland."

 MAF_rail_expansion: "Rolling Stock Expansion"
 MAF_rail_expansion_desc: "While the network of tracks spanning the dark continent has seen exponential growth since the advent of colonialism, it is the trains themselves that are slowly getting obsolete. We shall rectify this by importing trains from Europe."

 MAF_Cape_Cairo: "The Cape to Cairo Railway"
 MAF_Cape_Cairo_desc: "It is time to finish what the British started, the Cape to Cairo Railroad will lead to massive economic growth across the continent. First, we must build up the infrastructure around Daressalam."

 MAF_vital_industries: "Seize Belgian Industries"
 MAF_vital_industries_desc: "For too long the Belgians have played a disproportionately large role in the economy of our colony. We should take measures to ensure only German companies have access to these opportunities.\n\nOnce we've broken the power of Belgian capital, their investors are eager to leave. We can seize upon any excuse we want to claim their industries as our own, or purchase them for a paltry sum."

 MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment: "Attract Belgian Investment"
 MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment_desc: "The Belgians have been here long before us as a colonial power, and they've never really left. We have a comfortable and working relationship with numerous mining firms that have actually expanded beyond their original holdings in the Congo. If we continue this policy, we can reap the benefits of their capital."

 MAF_Cottage_Industries: "Cottage Industries"
 MAF_Cottage_Industries_desc: "It's strange to think, but even in the 20th century a great deal of work can be done by distributing work to the vast numbers of skilled Africans throughout the continent, many of them traditionally trained blacksmiths, in order to increase our production."

 MAF_Our_Shipyards: "Our Own Shipyards"
 MAF_Our_Shipyards_desc: "Our current policy of adapting and refitting outdated ships from the Kaiserliche Marine is both costly and ineffective. The ships we receive are too slow for modern vessels and are in frequent need of costly repairs. Instead of large, rusting cruisers, we should be focusing on state-of-the-art destroyers and U-Boats to keep our operating costs low."

 MAF_East_Asian_Exports: "East Asian Exports"
 MAF_East_Asian_Exports_desc: "We are only a part of Germany's vast colonial empire. We should make sure our trade doesn't only go to the metropole, but takes advantage of opportunities in the Orient."

 MAF_Industrial_Development: "Industrial Development"
 MAF_Industrial_Development_desc: "With our new budget in place, we are able to develop the industries of Mittelafrika."

 MAF_Light_Industrial_Development: "Light Industrial Development"
 MAF_Light_Industrial_Development_desc: "To recover from our economic problems, we must develop our civilian industry."

 MAF_Continue_Industrial_Research: "Continue Industrial Research"
 MAF_Continue_Industrial_Research_desc: "It is time to research and develop new industrial technology."

 MAF_Grant_Cons_FW: "Belgian Resource Companies"
 MAF_Grant_Cons_FW_desc: "By granting the Belgian conglomerates autonomy and security rights over remote stretches of the Congo, we can ensure a more disciplined workforce."

 MAF_University_Kinshasa: "Lovanium University"
 MAF_University_Kinshasa_desc: "The Belgians have set up a trade school in the Capital of the Congo. Formally integrating it with our administration will foster technological growth."

### Military
 MAF_Military_Reforms: "Military Reforms"
 MAF_Military_Reforms_desc: "It is time to modernise our army for a new age of warfare."

 ## Air
 MAF_Establish_Airforce: "Afrikanisches Fliegerkorps"
 MAF_Establish_Airforce_desc: "It is time to establish our own dedicated air corps, separate from Germany's own air force."

 MAF_African_Pilots: "African Ground Crews"
 MAF_African_Pilots_desc: "We don't have enough white German personnel to fill our air force, so we must recruit Africans for the job."

 MAF_Merc_Pilots: "Carrying the Fight Abroad"
 MAF_Merc_Pilots_desc: "Our African air force is among the best-equipped in the world. We can afford to throw our weight behind some of some of the more agreeable parties in the ongoing conflicts around the world."

 MAF_Bomber_Aircraft: "Bomber Aircraft"
 MAF_Bomber_Aircraft_desc: "The development of bomber aircraft is of paramount importance for African warfare."

 MAF_Airfields: "Expanding our Airfields"
 MAF_Airfields_desc: "Our airfields are in terrible condition, we must improve them if we are to become an air power."

 MAF_Afrikan_Air_Industry: "African Air Industry"
 MAF_Afrikan_Air_Industry_desc: "It is time to develop our own homemade air force industry, so we are no longer reliant on hand-me-downs from Germany."

 MAF_endurance_training: "Pilot Endurance Training"
 MAF_endurance_training_desc: "Regular training for pilots will not be enough in Africa. The vast distances and extreme conditions require pilots of the highest calibre, able to operate effectively even during the longest missions. Training and preparation will be key."

 ## Land
 MAF_Sturdy_Trucks: "Sturdy Trucks"
 MAF_Sturdy_Trucks_desc: "In the rough terrain of Africa, our trucks must be as sturdy and resistant to damage as possible."

 MAF_Modern_Artillery: "Modernise our Artillery"
 MAF_Modern_Artillery_desc: "The Weltkrieg has shown artillery is an important part of warfare, and ours must be as good as any other."

 MAF_Modern_Support_Divs: "Modern Support Divisions"
 MAF_Modern_Support_Divs_desc: "We must modernise our support divisions, we cannot allow ourselves to be left behind by the world."

 MAF_Modern_Tactics: "Modern Tactics"
 MAF_Modern_Tactics_desc: "It is time to modernise our tactics for this new age of warfare, we cannot allow ourselves to be defeated by a lack of strategic power."

 MAF_Improve_Logistics: "Improve our Logistics"
 MAF_Improve_Logistics_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, we required over 200,000 porters to supply a force of only 18,000 soldiers. This drained our food supplies and reduced our mobility to the rate at which humans can carry artillery. We cannot allow this to happen again."

 MAF_Electronic_Project: "Electronic Intelligence Project"
 MAF_Electronic_Project_desc: "Mittelafrika is not suited for a large navy, our shores are too large to protect and our industry would be better spent on other things. One such other thing is an investment in electronics technology, which will give us the ability to project power from Africa and help our Fatherland through intelligence gathering."

 MAF_Light_Infantry: "Light Infantry"
 MAF_Light_Infantry_desc: "Our troops must be used to marching over rough terrain and surviving the harshest of climates."

 MAF_Airforce_Infantry: "Establish the Air Mobile Infantry"
 MAF_Airforce_Infantry_desc: "Ludwig von Bockholt, one of the main members of the DKG administration, has always been a daring innovator in air combat. His newest innovation: aerial deployment and resupply of full divisions."

 MAF_White_Graveyard: "White Man's Graveyard"
 MAF_White_Graveyard_desc: "Ours is an army prepared for Jungle Warfare on the tactical level, both in the equipment we've selected and our troops' familiarity with and resistance to tropical disease. While other armies fear the jungle, we welcome it."

 MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners: "The Königsberg Gunners"
 MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners_desc: "Aside from lake battles using improvised steamers, Africa saw little naval action during the Weltkrieg. Its largest battle was that of the Rufiji Delta, where the SMS Königsberg was severely damaged before being scuttled. Its crew, however, fought on overland, so it is no wonder that some of our naval officers, such as Richard Wenig, possess expertise in naval infantry tactics."

 MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck: "The Spirit of von Lettow-Vorbeck"
 MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck_desc: "The most important lesson of the Weltkrieg cannot be found in any technical manual. It is exemplified in the sheer determination of General von Lettow-Vorbeck to continue fighting no matter how dire the situation might have appeared. In 1916, the Entente declared the situation in Africa over. In 1919 we were still standing, and still fighting. We never gave up, and we never will!"

 ## Sea
 MAF_Port_Renovation: "Port Renovation"
 MAF_Port_Renovation_desc: "In the age of coal-fired navies, forward bases were key. An extensive network of port facilities allowed the Reich to project its power across the seas.\n\nThese days, ships no longer need to refuel every few hundred kilometres, so many of our port facilities have fallen by the wayside. It is time for some renovations."

 MAF_Our_Own_Dockyards: "Our Own Dockyards"
 MAF_Our_Own_Dockyards_desc: "With the proper investment, we can establish naval dockyards of our own, and contribute to any new naval arms race."

 MAF_Acquire_New_Blueprints: "Acquire New Blueprints"
 MAF_Acquire_New_Blueprints_desc: "By purchasing vessels from German shipyards, and purchasing antiquated vessels from the Kaiserliche Marine, we can stimulate the German economy and strengthen our own naval industry at the same time."

 MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation: "Naval Aerial Observation"
 MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation_desc: "To build on the strength of our geographic position, we should improve the observation and interdiction ability of naval aircraft. Conventional German naval aircraft are designed with the short ranges of the North Sea in mind, so we must develop facilities to modify planes for our needs."

 MAF_Strategic_Reserve: "Strategic Resources Reserve"
 MAF_Strategic_Reserve_desc: "In the last war, cut off from Germany, we had to improvise our own supplies. We found ways to manufacture torpedoes, artillery shells, dyes, liquors and foodstuffs out of practically nothing. We should perpetuate this tradition, and find ways to improvise the manufacture of goods if we are cut off from the Fatherland again."

 MAF_Sailing_With_Marine: "Sailing With the Kaiserliche Marine"
 MAF_Sailing_With_Marine_desc: "Our vessels should not simply patrol local waters. We should send them sailing from Kiel to Tsingtau on exercises with the Kaiserliche Marine."

### Exiled Germany
 MAF_darkest_hour: "Our Darkest Hour"
 MAF_darkest_hour_desc: "Forced from our homeland and made to flee like rats from the Syndicalist Hordes. This is truly the darkest hour our nation has ever experienced. Let us rally those who remain loyal to our cause, the promise of reclaiming our lands as a rallying cry."
 MAF_kili: "Der Schuss am Kilimandscharo"
 MAF_kili_desc: "When we fled our homeland we did not manage to bring much of our infrastructure or equipment. What we did manage to salvage was our vital nuclear research. We shall conduct a test at the Kilimanjaro to help us maximise the potential of these weapons to help us to retake our home."
 MAF_air: "Fünf Wochen in der Luft"
 MAF_air_desc: "Unsurprisingly, our air force was all but lost in the flight to Africa. We must retrain and drill the former MAF air force to our imperial standards or else retaking the mainland will prove to be a near-impossibility."
 MAF_exiled_eco: "What Little We Have Left..."
 MAF_exiled_eco_desc: "What little we have left we need to maximise and use to its full capability. 110% production quotas and squeezing every drop of productivity out of our workforce will go a long way towards achieving this."
 MAF_exiled_mil: "... We Need To Make Great"
 MAF_exiled_mil_desc: "Old guns, new guns, it doesn't matter. If it can kill a Frenchman we will build it and use it as effectively as we are able. We have no other choice."
 MAF_exiled_eco2: "... We Need To Make More"
 MAF_exiled_eco2_desc: "Our previous initiatives have been successful in providing us with a greater industrial base, but it is simply not enough. We must expand our industries even further if we are to take back the Fatherland."
 MAF_exiled_infra: "... We Need To Bring Together"
 MAF_exiled_infra_desc: "Our African domain is vast and hard to traverse, making it difficult to pool our limited resources together. We need to improve our infrastructure situation in order to amend this problem."
 MAF_exiled_total: "Waste Not, Want Not"
 MAF_exiled_total_desc: "While our industrial programmes have borne fruit, we are always in need of more production to help us reclaim the birthright. We shall order all factories and local officials to redouble their efforts."
 MAF_spirit_of_resistance: "The Spirit of Resistance"
 MAF_spirit_of_resistance_desc: "Our Fatherland is lost. In this time of absolute crisis, we must place our faith in Kaiser and Country. Already the people are uniting around the Lion of Africa, Lettow-Vorbeck, and many are seeing the return of a Weltkrieg-style Burgfriedenspolitik truce in party politics."
 MAF_afrikakorps: "The Afrikakorps"
 MAF_afrikakorps_desc: "Our forces are now a motley mix of Exiles and Askari, currently far too disparate in terms of both professionalism and culture to work together successfully. We must seek to re-train and re-drill our surviving forces to serve as one unified force. Our survival depends upon it."
 MAF_the_way_home: "Our Only Way Home"
 MAF_the_way_home_desc: "Attempting to restore and replenish the Kaiserliche Marine would go a long way in helping us return to Berlin. This is our only goal and all other objectives must be cast aside in pursuit of it."
 MAF_walking_over_water: "Walking Over Water"
 MAF_walking_over_water_desc: "We must travel long and far to return to the Fatherland, and as such we must plan and prepare accordingly. A determined effort to produce and requisition troop transports is an absolute must."
 MAF_old_enemies_new_allies: "Old Enemies, New allies"
 MAF_old_enemies_new_allies_desc: "We have been defeated by the Syndicalist bastards and yet the Entente still soldiers on. While it was obviously their failures in Europe that led to this mess in the first place, many say that we should put aside our differences and join with the Entente to reclaim our homeland, as unbearable as such a path may be."
 MAF_our_continent: "Our Dominion"
 MAF_our_continent_desc: "Ever since the continent's fate was decided at the Berlin Conference in 1884, we have held a certain affinity for it as part of our desire for a Place in the Sun. Now that we reside on the dark continent we shall make sure our ties to the land are borne out in practice, at both a national and local level."
 MAF_crush_france: "Crush France"
 MAF_crush_france_desc: "While there is a cruel irony in that we and the French have both been exiled from Europe, it is the only affinity that we share. We should crush them, seize their holdings and adapt their industries to better forge the way for our homecoming. There can be no mercy."
 MAF_afrikakorps2: "Museum Pieces"
 MAF_afrikakorps2_desc: "No longer can we let our old arms sit in glass cabinets to be ogled by gentlemen in their hunting lodges. Every musket and elephant gun we have must be thrust into the hands of those capable of bearing them. After all, they did help win us one Weltkrieg. They shall win us a second."
 MAF_afrikakorps3_1: "Rights For Service"
 MAF_afrikakorps3_1_desc: "We will grant our native Askaris further rights in return for their loyal service to the Vaterland in its time of despair. Hopefully, this will encourage more to sign up."
 MAF_afrikakorps3_2: "No Compromises"
 MAF_afrikakorps3_2_desc: "Though there have been calls to throw our principles to the wind in order to sign up more Askaris, they should be ignored. We will not return to Berlin by any means necessary, and extending suffrage and protections to Africans is intolerable to any good German."
 MAF_reclaim_the_birthright: "Reclaim the Birthright"
 MAF_reclaim_the_birthright_desc: "The time has come to take back what is rightfully ours. No longer shall we huddle on the dark continent stewing in our inglorious defeat. We shall show the godless Syndicalists the full fury of the Kaiser!"
 MAF_business: "Just Good Business"
 MAF_business_desc: "Canada has been a useful ally in helping us to reclaim the homeland, and for this, they have our respect. However, this does not mean that they are no longer a threat to our Empire, and realpolitik comes before all other concerns. After all, it is only business."

### Events ###
## Bush War Events ##
 bushwar.1.t: "The Mozambique Situation"
 bushwar.1.d: "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, with the Entente occupying German East Africa and us occupying Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war, we had to punish those who joined the Entente's side. Now, many of these natives have been displaced across the Mozambique border, and there are rumours that the new extremist government in Portugal is planning to arm them against us."
 bushwar.1.a: "We must prepare."

 bushwar.2.t: "The Mozambique Situation"
 bushwar.2.d: "During the Great War, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, with the Entente occupying German East Africa and the Germans occupying our Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war, the Huns led cruel reprisal attacks on the natives who had sided with us. Since then, thousands of those natives have fled over the border into Mozambique where they now live in camps. These natives are a good opportunity to sow mischief in Mittelafrika, as many of them still want revenge for what the Huns did to them."
 bushwar.2.a: "Let's draw up a plan..."

 bushwar.3.t: "A Chance For Mischief in Our Rightful Territories"
 bushwar.3.d: "There is a great opportunity for us to cause instability in Mittelafrika by arming angry displaced natives who live in camps in Mozambique. The more unstable Mittelafrika is, the better chance we have to retake our rightful territories shown on the Pink Map."
 bushwar.3.a: "Arm them as much as we can."
 bushwar.3.b: "Crack down on these hooligans."

 bushwar.4.t: "Police Shooting in Lusaka!"
 bushwar.4.d: "A Makonde tribesman has shot one of our police officers in Lusaka! The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with many supporters, is now being held for investigation by the local police. The leading theory is that he acquired the weapons from across the border, in Portugal's colonies."
 bushwar.4.a: "Terrible!"

 bushwar.5.t: "Another Police Officer Has Been Shot!"
 bushwar.5.d: "Another policeman, this time from Lilongwe, has been shot dead by a radicalised local, a member of the Makonde tribe. The cause of his radicalisation and the source of his weapons are still under investigation, but it is possible that obtained them from Portugal."
 bushwar.5.a: "This is an outrage!"

 bushwar.6.t: "A Third Police Officer Has Been Shot!"
 bushwar.6.d: "Tragedy has struck Dar-es-Salaam! For the third time, a police officer has been shot dead: this time by a member of the Makonde tribe. The Dar-es-Salaam police are now searching for the killer and the cause of the attack; Portuguese involvement is suspected."
 bushwar.6.a: "Surely this cannot continue!?"

 bushwar.7.t: "Njassaland Plantation Burnt Down!"
 bushwar.7.d: "A cashew plantation in Njassaland has been burnt down by 'bandits' operating from across the Portuguese border. They've taken as much of the recently harvested crop as they could, burned the rest and fled back to Portuguese Mozambique."
 bushwar.7.a: "Something must be done about this!"

 bushwar.8.t: "Military Depot Raided!"
 bushwar.8.d: "The 'bandits' are no longer afraid of even the famous might of our Askari! They have raided and stolen supplies from one of our military depots and escaped with the supplies back to their camp in Mozambique."
 bushwar.8.a: "Portugal must put an end to this!"

 bushwar.9.t: "The Portuguese Question"
 bushwar.9.d: "We should lodge a formal complaint against Portugal. The continued existence of these 'bandit camps' is a clear threat to our colony. If they cannot deal with a few bandits, they are clearly not fit to be a colonial power."
 bushwar.9.a: "We will take this all the way to Berlin!"

 bushwar.10.t: "The Portuguese-Mittelafrika Dispute"
 bushwar.10.d: "Our Mittelafrikan Governor has come to us with a request for aid, he speaks of Portugal supporting bandits that murder German and Afrikan police and endanger our rule in Afrika, what should we do?"
 bushwar.10.a: "We shall take up the matter with Portugal ourselves!"

 bushwar.11.t: "The Germans Come Knocking"
 bushwar.11.d: "The Germans in Dar-es-Salaam have come to their overlords in Berlin and told them about our support of rebels in their territory, now Berlin demands we produce an explanation for our actions..."
 bushwar.11.a: "Explain the situation."
 bushwar.11.b: "We do not discuss internal affairs with foreign nations."

 bushwar.12.t: "Portugal Denied Our Request"
 bushwar.12.d: "The Portuguese government refused to 'discuss internal affairs with foreign nations', this is not on at all and we have sent them a strongly worded letter reminded them of their duties to us."
 bushwar.12.a: "Unacceptable! Tell Mittelafrika they can deal with it!"

 bushwar.13.t: "An Offer From Germany"
 bushwar.13.d: "The Portuguese government has refused to 'discuss internal affairs' Germany and in retaliation, the Kaiser has given us the green light to deal with this issue as we see fit."
 bushwar.13.a: "A green light you say? Now is the time!"

 bushwar.14.t: "Portugal Offers an Explanation"
 bushwar.14.d: "The Portuguese Ambassador explained in great detail the chaotic situation in the Rumuva region..."
 bushwar.14.a: "Who knew Africa was so complicated, no matter, demand they step down immediately!"

 bushwar.15.t: "Foreign Office Declares the Matter Resolved"
 bushwar.15.d: "The Portuguese have been forced to step down by the Berlin government, looks like it was the right call to talk to them."
 bushwar.15.a: "Heil, Kaiser, Dir!"

 bushwar.16.t: "We Must Back Down"
 bushwar.16.d: "Having engaged with the German government about the issue, we have no choice but to follow their request and stand down with our attacks."
 bushwar.16.a: "We will not forget this."

 bushwar.17.t: "Mittelafrika Threatens Our Colonies"
 bushwar.17.d: "The Germans in Dar-es-Salaam have noticed our support of rebels in their territories, and are now demanding we crack down on the rebels or 'face consequences'. What should we do?"
 bushwar.17.a: "Excellent, perhaps we can avenge 1918!"
 bushwar.17.b: "We have no choice, disarm the Ruga-Ruga, by force if needed."

 bushwar.18.t: "Portugal Disarms the Rebels!"
 bushwar.18.d: "The Portuguese have disarmed the bandits they have been sending onto our territory at great cost to their own colonial stability. This matter is now truly solved."
 bushwar.18.a: "Independent action pays off."

 bushwar.19.t: "Portugal Stands Against Us!"
 bushwar.19.d: "The Portuguese have refused to disarm the bandits they've been sending into our colonies, if we wish to stop this, we will have to take real action against Portugal..."
 bushwar.19.a: "Send in the troops, if they won't or can't clear out the bandits, we will."

 bushwar.20.t: "The Germans Cross the Border"
 bushwar.20.d: "The Germans have crossed the border into Mozambique to destroy the bandits, completely wrecking our national sovereignty. We must choose what to do."
 bushwar.20.a: "Repel them!"
 bushwar.20.b: "Stand down."

 bushwar.21.t: "Portugal Caves In!"
 bushwar.21.d: "The Portuguese have decided not to resist our troops during our raid into Mozambique - we now have military control of Mozambique and must decide our next action."
 bushwar.21.a: "Only occupation will bring peace."
 bushwar.21.b: "Burn down the camps and leave."

 bushwar.22.t: "Mittelafrika Seizes Northern Mozambique"
 bushwar.22.d: "The Mittelafrikans have occupied yet another one of our rightful territories, Northern Mozambique. The colony has been seized by the Mittelafrikan soldiers that entered our territory."
 bushwar.22.a: "Damn them!"

 bushwar.23.t: "Mittelafrika Burns Down Camps!"
 bushwar.23.d: "The Mittelafrikan raid into our territory has ended, after burning down our bandit camps and slaughtering most of their inhabitants, their troops withdrew back into Mittelafrikan territory."
 bushwar.23.a: "That is the end of that."

 bushwar.24.t: "Update on Mittelafrika: Police Officer Shot"
 bushwar.24.d: "Today we learnt that a Makonde tribesman has shot a Mittelafrikan police officer in Lusaka. The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with his supporters, have been detained for investigation by the local police. It appears we are already managing to destabilise the Mittelafrikan government. It should be noted that he used a weapon supplied by us, but we are confident it won't get traced back to us."
 bushwar.24.a: "Of course it won't be."

 bushwar.25.t: "Update on Mittelafrika: Military Depot Raided"
 bushwar.25.d: "Another update; earlier today some 'bandits' raided and stole supplies from a Mittelafrikan military depot and then escaped with the supplies back to their camp in Mozambique. Those 'bandits' were of course supplied and trained by us; they are getting bold and don't even fear the Mittelafrikan Askari anymore! We have heard rumours that the Mittelafrikan government is having a meeting soon to decide what to do about these 'bandits' and the destabilising effect they are having."
 bushwar.25.a: "This might be trouble..."

 bushwar.26.t: "Defeat in Africa"
 bushwar.26.d: "The Mittelafrikans have defeated our forces in Africa, it may be time to surrender our colonies, for now. Let us see what it is Mittelafrika wants out of this war..."
 bushwar.26.a: "Send an envoy, we surrender."
 bushwar.26.b: "We shall never surrender!"

 bushwar.27.t: "The Portuguese Reach Out for Peace"
 bushwar.27.d: "We have defeated the Portuguese in Africa, and they have started negotiations to settle for a peace agreement. It is now high time for us to reach out to the authorities in the Fatherland in order to ask them to draft a formal peace agreement.\n\nSome voices however are claiming that relying on people back in Germany is a wasted effort, when the officers of Mittelafrika know the situation on the ground much better than any bureaucrat in Germany could, and thus are calling for the terms of the peace agreement to be made in Mittelafrika and only then sent for Germany as a fait accompli."
 bushwar.27.a: "We shall leave the drafting to the authorities that be in Germany."
 bushwar.27.b: "The agreement will be made in Mittelafrika, and only then sent back home."

 bushwar.28.t: "Victory in Africa"
 bushwar.28.d: "German colonial forces in Mittelafrika have managed to defeat the Portuguese army and occupy vast amounts of territory of the Portuguese colonies. Now they have decided to try to settle the matter in a peace agreement, which we have been asked to draft.\n\nwhile many in the Colonial Office would like to annex vast swathes of land from the Portuguese and incorporate it into Mittelafrika, others call for restraint, arguing that adding such a large amount of territory to the already faltering Mittelafrikan administration will bring nothing but trouble, and that the main objective of this agreement should be to take the territory needed to secure against any future threats to Mittelafrika, but nothing more."
 bushwar.28.a: "We shall take only Northern Mozambique, the war's original goal."
 bushwar.28.b: "We shall take the whole of Mozambique."
 bushwar.28.c: "We shall establish security zones both in Mozambique and in Angola."
 bushwar.28.e: "We shall take all of Mozambique and Angola, clearly the Portuguese don't deserve them."

 bushwar.29.t: "Germany Sends a Peace Proposal"
 bushwar.29.d: "The colonial office in Berlin has sent us the terms they have set for the Portuguese. They demand that [GetMAFDemands]\n\nWhile it is expected of us to send the demands over to the Portuguese in their current form, there are still voices clamouring for us to exercise the sovereignty of our administration by making different demands to the Portuguese than those specified by the colonial office."
 bushwar.29.a: "We shall follow the plans as they were sent to us from the Fatherland."
 bushwar.29.b: "We shall make our own demands from the Portuguese."

 bushwar.30.t: "A Sovereign Peace Agreement"
 bushwar.30.d: "With the defeat of the pathetic Portuguese force at the hands of our mighty army, we have been granted the moral right to exercise our sovereignty in the form of our own demands from the Portuguese - ones drafted in Dar-es-Salaam, and not by pen-pushers in Berlin.\n\nWhile many still beg the Governor to show restraint, most have begun to fear that political ambition has clouded his eyes from seeing what path will lead towards the long-term good of the colony."
 bushwar.30.a: "Exercise restraint by taking only northern Mozambique."
 bushwar.30.b: "The whole of Mozambique shall be ours to claim."
 bushwar.30.c: "We will take for ourselves zones in both Mozambique and Angola."
 bushwar.30.e: "This is our opportunity! Take all of Angola and Mozambique for the glory of the Governor."

 bushwar.31.t: "Ignored by Dar-es-Salaam"
 bushwar.31.d: "It appears that the Mittelafrikan administration in Dar-es-Salaam has decided to disobey a direct order from their superiors, and have signed an agreement with the Portuguese on their own, in an apparent effort to show its so-called "sovereignty".\n\nAs the peace agreement has been already finalised, it is a fait accompli and thus not in our power to change. However, this does not mean that we cannot respond at all. Some call on us to punish this kind of behaviour before it turns it becomes a real trend, and show our ultimate dominance by applying cuts on essential funds to the colony, while others wish for us to look over this incident, for the good of the already stretched-thin administration"
 bushwar.31.a: "We must punish this insouciance."
 bushwar.31.b: "We will overlook this incident... for now."

 bushwar.32.t: "A Harsh Response from the Fatherland"
 bushwar.32.d: "It appears that our decision to settle with the Portuguese on our own, sovereign, terms, has generated a rather harsh response from the Fatherland, which has decided to temporarily cut vital funding which is needed for the administration to normally function.\n\nIt appears that Berlin is attempting to use economic sanctions to remind us who is truly in charge."
 bushwar.32.a: "How embarrassing."

 bushwar.33.t: "The Germans Send Demands"
 bushwar.33.d: "It appears that a return to the status quo ante bellum is not likely, as the Germans seem to have other plans.\n\nThe Germans have used our momentary lapse of strength to try to make the following demands of us: they demand that [GetMAFDemands]\n\nWhile some still think that our army has the chance of defeating the Germans in this war, and as such we should reject such despicable terms, it seems highly unlikely that the Germans will consider a second attempt at an agreement should we fight on and lose to them again in battle."
 bushwar.33.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 bushwar.33.b: "We will fight on until the end!"

 bushwar.34.t: "Portugal Acquiesces"
 bushwar.34.d: "Portugal has begrudgingly agreed to sign our peace agreement, and thus both accept our demands, and destroy any remaining Portuguese threat to our administration."
 bushwar.34.a: "What a glorious day!"

 bushwar.35.t: "Portugal Refuses!"
 bushwar.35.d: "In a stunning move of sheer Iberian spite, the stubborn Portuguese refuse to accept their defeat, and thus have rejected our offers of peace as 'unreasonable'"
 bushwar.35.a: "A pointless and futile move."

 bushwar.36.t: "Defeat in Africa"
 bushwar.36.d: "The Portuguese have defeated our forces in Zambesia. Perhaps it is time to offer our surrender, for if we lose any more land it could be disastrous for our colonial stability..."
 bushwar.36.a: "We shall ask Germany to arrange a peace settlement."
 bushwar.36.b: "We shall never surrender!"

 bushwar.37.t: "The Mittelafrikan Blunder"
 bushwar.37.d: "As the colonial military's situation in Mittelafrika has gone from bad to worse, we have received reports from Dar-es-Salaam that the past defeats against the Portuguese army have made our African possessions unstable, and a continuation of the fight puts the entire colony's existence at stake.\n\nConsequently, we have been asked to mediate and reach an accord with the Portuguese government.\n\nThe Portuguese, on their part, have had their own ideas as to what a settlement to this dispute will include, and they want to use their superior military position in order to force us to cede territories for the creation of the so-called 'Pink Map'. This involves the creation of a territorial connection between the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique, and thus they demand the transfer of the former British territories of Zambesia and Nyasaland to the Portuguese colonial empire."
 bushwar.37.a: "We must concede these lands in order to achieve peace."
 bushwar.37.b: "Who are they to make such demands of us!?"

 bushwar.38.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses Peace"
 bushwar.38.d: "It appears that the foolishness of the authorities in [From.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] cannot be understated, as they have made the naive decision of refusing any form of peace agreement. Clearly, they wish only to fight to the bitter end."
 bushwar.38.a: "The war goes on."

 bushwar.39.t: "The Germans Sue for Peace"
 bushwar.39.d: "The German weakling has been defeated by our glorious armies!\n\nFearing the might of our armies, the Germans have agreed to cede to our control the territories that constitute the "Pink Map" and thus connect our holdings in Mozambique and Angola."
 bushwar.39.a: "This marks the start of a new Portuguese empire! Hoorah for Portugal!"
 bushwar.39.b: "We will fight until all of Mittelafrika is under our control!"

 bushwar.48.t: "Peace with Portugal"
 bushwar.48.d: "An agreement has been arranged with the Portuguese forces, and in exchange for their claimed territories, they have agreed for a cessation of hostilities, leaving us to our shame."
 bushwar.48.a: "A severe humiliation"

 bushwar.40.t: "Bush War - German advantage"
 bushwar.40.d: "With these last few months of the war having gone past without an overwhelming victory to either side, our high command have gone worried: they advise us that our forces in Africa could not sustain the war against Portugal for much longer, and with the current situation being in our advantage we should attempt to reach a settlement that will allow an end to the fighting."
 bushwar.40.a: "Let us make our demands for a settlement for this war."
 bushwar.40.b: "We shall ask Germany to mediate an end to the conflict."
 bushwar.40.c: "A limited peace is not an option, we shall fight to a decisive victory!"

 bushwar.41.t: "Our Demands"
 bushwar.41.d: "While we have not achieved a complete and decisive victory, our situation on the ground, as of the moment, it looking significantly better than that of the Portuguese Forces, and thus we could still demand some concessions from them, though not as many as we may have been able should we have gotten a complete victory in the field."
 bushwar.41.a: "We shall demand Northern Mozambique."
 bushwar.41.b: "We need security zones both in Northern Mozambique and in Northern Angola."

 bushwar.42.t: "The Germans demand an end to the fighting."
 bushwar.42.d: "With the war between the German forces of Mittelafrika and our army having not resolved in some months, it appears that the Germans are trying to use their current superior position in the field to force an end to the conflict, with them making a demand of a stop to the fighting and the transfer of [GetMAFDemands]\n\nWhile our army still has some ability to fight the German forces, many of our top officers are advising that it might be better to accept these conditions now, humiliating as they may be, than being forced to accept even more humiliating conditions following a complete military loss."
 bushwar.42.a: "We accept the demands, harsh as they may be."
 bushwar.42.b: "Such a humiliating peace is not an option, we fight on!"

 bushwar.43.t: "Bush War - Portuguese advantage"
 bushwar.43.d: "With these last few months of the war having gone past without an overwhelming victory to either side, but the general situation seeming in our advantage, some have advised us that it might be better to reach for a favourable settlement with the Germans now, than face a potential defeat in the field which could rob us of any gains our army have secured.\n\nAs such it has been suggested to demand of the Germans to transfer to our control the areas of Nyasaland, and the areas east of the Luangwa River, as a buffer zone to protect the new territory in our control from any attack by the dastardly Germans."
 bushwar.43.a: "Make the demand."
 bushwar.43.b: "A limited peace is not an option!"

 bushwar.44.t: "The Portuguese demand an end to the fighting."
 bushwar.44.d: "With the Portuguese forces in better current position than our own, and the war not seeming close to a decisive conclusion, they have deemed it fit to send us their demands, which include the transfer of the former British territories of Nyasaland and the land east of the Luangwa River.\n\nWhile many still have hope that a reversal of the war situation might happen, and we will come out victorious, many others implore us to consider the offer, due to the fear that the continuation of the war could have disastrous consequences on the entire colonial administration."
 bushwar.44.a: "We have no other choice, accept the demand."
 bushwar.44.b: "We shall ask the German government to consider the matter."
 bushwar.44.c: "We Germans bow to nobody, We fight on!"

 bushwar.45.t: "An end to the fighting."
 bushwar.45.d: "It appears that the [From.GetAdjective] have seen through their usual foolishness and agreed to our proposal for a peace settlement, lets us hope they will not turn back on their word."
 bushwar.45.a: "A smart choice."

 bushwar.46.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses a limited peace"
 bushwar.46.d: "It appears that the usual foolishness of the [From.GetAdjective] has gotten the better of them, with our reasonable demands for an end to the fighting in Africa, having been ignored completely, it appears that they are not willing to negotiate, at least not at this time."
 bushwar.46.a: "A very foolhardy move."

 bushwar.47.t: "A ceasefire in Africa?"
 bushwar.47.d: "With the war in Africa having no end in sight, and with no side with any seeming advantage in the field, talks have begun for a ceasefire agreement, which will follow a status quo ante bellum ante."
 bushwar.47.a: "An end to this war would be for our benefit."
 bushwar.47.b: "We will fight on!"

## Flavour Events ##
 mittel.000.t: "In the Heart of Africa"
 mittel.000.d: "Born after the absorption of French and Belgian colonies, Mittelafrika is a massive swath of land, composed of cities, chiefdoms, kingdoms, farmlands, jungles, savannah, deserts and more; for it covers half of the Dark Continent. A complex web of treaties, agreements and tacit understandings, the colony, while stable, is remarkably unprofitable; something that the new man in charge, Hermann von Göring, and his men wish to change no matter the cost. But could that cost be too great for Mittelafrika to pay? And will the Kaiser allow von Göring to take such a risk?"
 mittel.000.a: "Sounds exciting!"

 mittel.001.t: "Anniversary of Mahiwa"
 mittel.001.d: "Today is the anniversary of the Battle of Mahiwa, the most decisive battle of the East Afrika Campaign. In the battle, the King's African Rifles were encircled and surrendered by the armies of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck from the south and east, and Kurt Wahle's from the north and west. The British lost nearly 4,000 men in the operation, to a loss of less than 200 German Askari.\n\nThe battle paved the way to our invasion and conquest of Mozambique in 1918. Since 1922, it has been a state holiday in Mittelafrika. It has been celebrated throughout the colony, but especially in Dar-es-Salaam, with parades and military drills, as it reminds every citizen and subject of our need and capacity for military excellence."
 mittel.001.a: "Heia Safari!"

 mittel.002.t: "Death of Bernhard Dernburg"
 mittel.002.d: "Sad news arrived from Berlin today. Bernhard Dernburg, former head of the Imperial Colonial Office, has died. Bernhard served for only three years, from 1907 to 1910, but he had an enormous influence on the development of the colony of German East Afrika, which would eventually form the core of Mittelafrika. It was his reforms that firmly established the first fully secular education system on the Afrikan continent, a legacy we have tried, with difficulty, to spread throughout Mittelafrika. A small ceremony was held in Dar-es-Salaam in his honour, with a street being renamed Bernhard Dernburg-Straße."
 mittel.002.a: "Governor von Göring will speak of his triumphs."
 mittel.002.b: "Rudolf Asmis will speak of his expertise and caution."
 mittel.002.c: "This is no time for politics. A tasteful memorial must be held."

## Internal Events ##
 mittel.43.t: "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
 mittel.43.d: "A rather unique case has been sluggishly passed throughout our legal system for years. Now, it has reached the highest court in the German State. Anti-Colonial activist Jomo Kenyatta has brought a class-action lawsuit against former Afrikan Governor Wilhelm Solf. The case has become something of a political embarrassment: as some of the plaintiffs are veterans of the Weltkrieg, it can not be easily dismissed. They claim that Solf's administration harmed them through policies of illegal land seizures, and even abductions and torture, all done with Solf's knowledge and little legal basis.\n\nWhile the implicated party is no longer part of our administration, commentators have noted that an award by the court could potentially set a precedent as to what the permissible extent of... 'rule-bending' of our colonial administrations is."
 mittel.43.a: "We have nothing to fear."
 mittel.43.b: "... but throw everything we have at them, just in case!"

 mittel.44.t: "A Verdict"
 mittel.44.d: "Years of legal battle have come to an end earlier today when the litigation of Jomo Kenyatta ended at the highest court of Germany. The Kikuyu lawyer has skilfully defended his points, and the court has conceded: former Governor Wilhelm Solf has been found liable for 'extralegal' actions taken during his tenure as Governor. The damages are by no means ruinous to Solf, but have opened a door to theoretically limitless cases.\n\nWe will surely feel the repercussions of this decision in regards to our continuing colonial governance."
 mittel.44.a: "That will shake them up alright."
 mittel.44.b: "Oh they'll see alright!"

 mittel.45.t: "A Verdict"
 mittel.45.d: "Years of legal battle have come to an end earlier today when the litigation of Jomo Kenyatta ended at the highest court of Germany. While the Kikuyu lawyer has skilfully defended his points, Solf's side was represented by renowned political theorist Carl Schmitt. The jurist produced a novel defence that has established a new legal precedent: Solf has, allegedly, acted in the interest of the state by taking the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of our Empire in a state of exception.\n\nThe finer details of Schmitt's case were largely based on his essay on Political Theology, which gave birth to the phrase "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception". Whether Schmitt intended this or not, the phrase has become a catchphrase for the supporters of a more hardline approach to colonial governance."
 mittel.45.a: "What is this nonsense?"
 mittel.45.b: "Ausnahmezustand haben wir allemal, nicht wahr?"

 mittel.46.t: "The Black Dossier"
 mittel.46.d: "A group of anonymous officers and administrators in Mittelafrika have compiled documentation and evidence of illegal activity by Governor von Göring and presented it to the Cabinet. The evidence, if proven true, is very serious. According to what the dossier alleges, Governor von Göring has been using the generous state budget we have provided him with to buy off politicians throughout the Reichspakt in order to secure support for his administration, as well as demanding state officials pay into a slush fund. Even more darkly, it alleges with less evidence that von Göring and his loyalists gather information for blackmail against his own employees, has been involved in the kidnapping and intimidation of journalists, and even hiring assassins!"
 mittel.46.a: "A formal investigation must be conducted immediately!"
 mittel.46.b: "This implicates some powerful men in Berlin, quietly bury it."

 mittel.47.t: "The Corruption Investigation"
 mittel.47.d: "It has come to our attention that Berlin has begun investigating... certain \"financial irregularities\". It is not hard to imagine who is behind this: they would have to have access to the highest level of financial planning in the Administration, likely the Alte Kämpfer who fought under von Lettow-Vorbeck, and who have resisted every change of this administration!"
 mittel.47.a: "Quash this investigation."
 mittel.47.b: "Contain von Göring, and quietly change administration."

 mittel.48.t: "The Kaiser's Warrant"
 mittel.48.d: "Seeing von Göring fiercely resist any attempt at an official investigation, the German government has seen it fit to issue an arrest warrant for the Governor on the grounds of obstruction of justice."
 mittel.48.a: "The Sovereign is he who decides on the exception."
 mittel.48.b: "Fetch me a ship, I shall fight this battle in court!"

 mittel.49.t: "The Sovereign Governor"
 mittel.49.d: "Hermann von Göring has refused to step down. Through his intermediary Carl Schmitt, he has argued that the Governor is a sovereign office, able to step outside the law, and secure with loyal members of his army, we have no easy means of resolving the crisis. Having won the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, Schmitt argues that this situation takes precedence from the affair, and therefore should be subject to the same ruling."
 mittel.49.a: "Issue a new warrant for von Göring's arrest, for treason!"
 mittel.49.b: "von Göring has legal precedence, step down for now."

 mittel.50.t: "The German Response"
 mittel.50.d: "The German government has declared von Göring's administration finished, but he still holds the reins for now. He has ridden the tiger of this crisis this far, and now he cannot get off. Everywhere, the chain of command breaks down."
 mittel.50.a: "Gott, hilf uns!"

 mittel.51.t: "The Black Dossier"
 mittel.51.d: "Not satisfied with the Cabinet's decision, the discontented officers of Africa have leaked their evidence and allegations to the press. While we are pushing back against the more wild, and baseless speculation, it's clear to the public an investigation is necessary."
 mittel.51.a: "Damn! It was worth a try!"

 mittel.52.t: "Friends in Berlin"
 mittel.52.d: "It seems that some of our disgruntled administrators have made an appeal directly to the German Cabinet, trying to go over von Göring's head to have him removed. Fortunately, our friends in Berlin have ensured the cabinet will take no action, for now."
 mittel.52.a: "Traitors in our midst, but friends in Berlin."

 mittel.53.t: "The Muckrakers"
 mittel.53.d: "While our friends in the government dismissed the accusations presented to it, it was leaked to the press. The honour of the Governor has been impinged, and this has given strength to the numerous journalists scuttling about Africa hoping to be the 'next E.D. Morel'."
 mittel.53.a: "Damn them all!"

 mittel.54.t: "A New Governor"
 mittel.54.desc: "With von Göring gone, we must select a new Governor. While he is disgraced, there is still hope for a New Colonial Regime to bring order to the colony. Or, perhaps the old ways, advocated by the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft are best."
 mittel.54.a: "Ernst Jünger, the famous writer and soldier!"
 mittel.54.b: "Franz Ritter von Epp, the old general."
 mittel.54.c: "Georg Kraut, who was Lettow-Vorbeck's second in command!"
 mittel.54.d: "Rudolf Asmis, the famous and experienced administrator."

 mittel.55.t: "A New Governor"

 mittel.67.d: "When we seized the British holdings in Africa during the British Revolution, we did it under the legal pretence of restoring responsible government to these areas. Now, over a decade later, we can finally fulfil our promise and grant the white British settlers in these areas self-rule. This will have the benefit of dealing with the Royal Veterans Association, who has been a troublesome political force in our administration for a long time, and will make our administration ever more stable."
 mittel.67.a: "Responsible government has been restored."

 mittel.68.t: "Retaliation for the Black Dossier"
 mittel.68.d: "Our administration has maintained its now sovereign rule only by the skin of its teeth. The corruption inquiry could have seen von Göring and many of our senior officials spend the rest of their lives in jail. We now have the opportunity to return the favour. While an official retaliation would be difficult, we can use our growing criminal network, the 'Lion Society', to seek retaliation against these conspirators, and reinforce our rule of Mittelafrika."
 mittel.68.a: "Vengeance is mine!"
 mittel.68.b: "Turn the other cheek."

 mittel.69.t: "Our First Target"
 mittel.69.d: "Our first suspect for the Black Dossier is Georg Kraut, one of Von Lettow-Vorbeck's most trusted officers during the Weltkrieg. He is well respected for this reason and likely gave his blessing to the project. He is already quite old, and perhaps it will be easier and less suspicious to induce his retirement than to kill him. We can produce a 'black dossier' of our own, and blackmail him into retirement. The allegations may not be true, but the old man won't want to fight them at this point."
 mittel.69.a: "He should have retired years ago..."

 mittel.70.t: "The Hunting Accident"
 mittel.70.d: "Our next target in retaliation for the Black Dossier investigation is Ludwig Bockholt, who frequently has butted heads with von Göring over the priorities of the air force, as well as more personal matters. Since settling in Africa, Bockholt has become an avid big game hunter. One of our men was in his latest hunting expedition, and arranged for a 'hunting accident'. He swears that he thought Bockholt was a gazelle when he shot him, and the courts shall rule in his favour."
 mittel.70.a: "Another one bites the dust."

 mittel.71.t: "The Death of Rudolf Asmis"
 mittel.71.d: "The next target of our retaliation for the Black Dossier is Rudolf Asmis, a diplomat with the Foreign Office, was the one who ensured the Foreign Minister saw the accusing evidence and presented it to the cabinet. He is out of our reach often, but travels a great deal between Berlin and Dar-es-Salaam. A bit of sabotage has ensured that his aircraft crashed en route to his latest diplomatic assignment."
 mittel.71.a: "Another one down, we are almost there..."

 mittel.72.t: "The Final Target"
 mittel.72.d: "We have long known that the officer clique behind the 'black dossier' must have been someone in the highest reaches of our administration. The source of the leak is even more embarrassing than expected. Von Göring's own brother, Albert, is the source. He has been staying in Africa under the fake name 'Albert von Epstein' a name based on the Göring family's Jewish doctor and godfather. Rather than an ambitious conspirator, it seems he was motivated by a genuine crisis of conscience."
 mittel.72.a: "We can't kill him, family is family."

 mittel.73.t: "A Shady Meeting"
 mittel.73.d: "Some of the members of our 'Lion Society' have been contacted by General Doihara Kenji of Japan, and say he has an interesting proposal for us. He will sell us opium grown in Manchuria at a discount rate, which we could then smuggle back home to Germany at considerable profit."
 mittel.73.a: "It is an offer..."
 mittel.73.b: "We can refuse, actually!"

 mittel.74.t: "A Triumph of Espionage"
 mittel.74.d: "A programme created by General Doihara Kenji to distribute narcotics to our enemies has seen its greatest success yet. It appears that the German colony of Mittelafrika is rife with corruption, and its administrator has proven willing to smuggle cheap opium into Germany for us. Every morning the German newspapers are filled with the scandals of misspent youth, and the widespread drug usage is certain to weaken their army and war industry."
 mittel.74.a: "Huzzah!"

 mittel.75.t: "An Opium Epidemic"
 mittel.75.d: "Recently, the use of opium by the general populace, and even our own troops, has skyrocketed. Police are still investigating the cause of the outbreak, but it appears the street price is much lower than it used to be. We still haven't been able to find the source, but our efforts are now focused on containing the effects of the outbreak."
 mittel.75.a: "What is German society coming to?"

 mittel.86.t: "Food from Mittelafrika"
 mittel.86.d: "Thanks to the initiative of the New Colonial Administration, Mittelafrika is now producing grains and canned food in significant quantities, enough so that it relieves some of the pressure on our domestic industry. Without the New Colonial Administration, this kind of benefit would be impossible!"
 mittel.86.a: "Never another Schweinemord!"

 mittel.87.t: "Farmers Resist Our Policy"
 mittel.87.d: "Our policy of encouraging the cultivation of cheap staples for export to Germany at below-market prices has created unrest with both native farmers and white planters, giving them a rare common cause against our administration."
 mittel.87.a: "Send in the Schutztruppe!"

 mittel.88.t: "Guns from Mittelafrika"
 mittel.88.d: "Our New Colonial Administration in Africa has seen gains in light industrialisation using cheap and even forced labour for industrial production. This has significantly reduced the cost of manufacturing, and provided us with additional equipment."
 mittel.88.a: "You can never have enough guns!"

 mittel.89.t: "Resistance in the Factories"
 mittel.89.d: "Workers in our new factories are discontent, complaining about long hours, poor safety standards, stolen wages and violence against workers who speak out. It is becoming a problem in the urban centres, and some fear it may lead to the spread of syndicalism. Fortunately for now, the workers remain disorganised."
 mittel.89.a: "And violence will keep them that way."

 mittel.90.t: "Resistance to the War Economy"
 mittel.90.d: "Shifting to a war economy has pushed our colonial population and our armies to their limit. They are ready, but they are not happy with wartime restrictions in a time of peace!"
 mittel.90.a: "Come on, where's your patriotism?"

 mittel.95.t: "Mutara III Visits Göttingen University"
 mittel.95.d: "Prince Karl Mutara III of Rudahigwa has returned from a tour of the University of Göttingen in Lower Saxony. He was shown our latest discoveries in physics, spoke with the Professors of African Languages, and was shown the Göttingen State and University Library. It all made a strong impression on him, and he has urged his people to adopt the natural sciences of Europe, and provided for the creation of a library in Kigali."
 mittel.95.a: "A model to his people."

 mittel.96.t: "Sultan Khalifa II Visits Singapur"
 mittel.96.d: "Sultan Khalifa II bin Harub Al-Said has returned from a tour of the fortifications and harbours of Singapur. He spoke at length with his attaché for the tour, Captain Otto Schiewind. At the end of the tour, the two issued a report to the Admiralty comparing the similar situations of Singapur, and Zanzibar, calling it the 'Singapur of Africa'. The Islands of Zanzibar control access to our capital city of Dar-es-Salaam, and to the Mozambique Channel. Despite their strategic location, the islands are underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in Europe and Asia. In response to the report, the Admiralty has funded naval fortifications in Sansibar, and improvements to the harbour to serve as a primary base for the Kaiserliche Marine in the event of a war in the Indian Ocean."
 mittel.96.a: "And with almost no cost to ourselves!"

 mittel.97.t: "King Pedro VII Visits Cologne Cathedral"
 mittel.97.d: "King Pedro VII Afonso of Kongo has returned from a tour of Germany and Europe, where he attended mass in Cologne Cathedral, as well as St. Peter's in Rome. The result has been a renewed interest in Catholic missionary efforts in the Kongo, especially from the German and Italian states. There have already been mass conversions of entire villages. To make matters worse, the Portuguese have lodged a diplomatic complaint about our treatment of the exiled king."
 mittel.97.a: "I thought they liked when Africans were good Catholics?"

 mittel.98.t: "The Skull of Chief Mkwawa"
 mittel.98.d: "During a royal tour of Germany, the young Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe people lodged an awkward request. During our subjugation of East Africa, their tribal leader Chief Mkwavinyika Munyigumba Mwamuyinga conducted a campaign of military resistance against our rule for 8 long years. After his death, his head was cut off and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. As part of his tour, Chief Sapi requested to visit the museum and see the skull. He asks that it be returned with him to Iringa. The Wahehe have superstitions about the disposal of remains, and wish to give his skull an honourable burial."
 mittel.98.a: "What's a skull to good relations?"
 mittel.98.b: "It is the principle of the thing! It is a prize of war!"

 mittel.99.t: "Germany Returns the Skull of Chief Mkwawa"
 mittel.99.d: "In a ceremony today in Kalenga, with a festive spirit, the Governor of Ostafrika returned the skull of Chief Mkwawa to the current Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe. Mkwawa was a fierce rebel during the early part of our rule of Africa. It took years to surround him, at which point he committed suicide to avoid capture. His skull was removed, and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. It has now been returned, as a sign of goodwill, to ensure the friendliness and cooperation of the Wahehe people."
 mittel.99.a: "Let us bury the past together."

 mittel.100.t: "Germany Refuses to Return the Skull of Chief Mkwawa"
 mittel.100.d: "We've encountered a bit of a diplomatic faux pas. During one of his sponsored royal tours, Chief Adam Sepi of the Wahehe requested the return of his predecessor's skull, currently kept in the Bremen Anthropological Museum. The skull belongs to Chief Mkwawa, who was a rebel against German rule and beheaded by Commander Tom von Prince, who sent the skull to the Museum's collection. The Wahehe are very respectful of their ancestors and believe that with the skull in such a disrespectful state, it is certain to anger the spirits. Unfortunately, the German government has refused the return of the skull as a matter of principle, creating discontent even beyond the Wahehe tribe."
 mittel.100.a: "Berlin is always making trouble!"

 mittel.101.t: "The Kabaka of Buganda Visits the Prussian Military Academy."
 mittel.101.d: "The young Kabaka of Buganda, Eduard Friedrich Mutesa II has just completed a tour of the Kriegsakadamie in Prussia. Like all young men, he has a natural enthusiasm for all things martial, and the German Army is the finest in the world. Young Friedrich has decided to study at the Kriegsakadamie, and encouraged promising young men in Budanda and Uganda to do the same."
 mittel.101.a: "Gott mitt uns!"

 mittel.1000.t: "The Collapse of Mittelafrika"
 mittel.1000.d: "Because of the mismanagement of Mittelafrika, the chain of command has broken down throughout the continent. Warlords and local rulers now hold more power in most areas than the German administration. The complex network of alliances that once made up Mittelafrika has been thrown into chaos, as the entire continent heads to war. The capital of Daressalam has been seized by loyalist Askari to prevent it from falling to non-loyalist elements, while in Südwestafrika, the local German forces are holding on. Where shall we escape to?"
 mittel.1000.a: "What is still keeping us here?\nWe're marching South-West!"
 mittel.1000.b: "Let's go for something different this time!"
 mittel.1000.c: "To Katanga, where our allies are still holding on."
 #mittel.1000.e: "We will defend the capital to the last man."

 mittel.105.t: "Completion of the Cape to Cairo Railway"
 mittel.105.d: "The Germans have completed the Cape to Cairo railroad that the British attempted to complete before the Weltkrieg. While we are sure they did this for their own selfish reasons, this will nevertheless give us an advantage in trade with the rest of Africa."
 mittel.105.a: "British dreams stolen by Germany..."

 mittel.106.t: "Completion of the Cape to Cairo Railway"
 mittel.106.d: "The Germans have completed the Cape to Cairo railroad that the British attempted to complete before the Weltkrieg. While we are sure they did this for their own selfish reasons, this will nevertheless give us an advantage in trade with the rest of Africa. They have even sent manpower over to us to build the section inside our borders, improving our own infrastructure at no cost to us."
 mittel.106.a: "How generous of them!"

 mittel.107.t: "Connection of the Cape to Cairo Railway to Ethiopia"
 mittel.107.d: "The Germans have added another section to the Cape to Cairo railroad, connecting Ethiopia to the rest of Africa. While we are sure they did this for their own selfish reasons, this will nevertheless give us an advantage in trade with the rest of Africa. They have even sent manpower over to us to build the section inside our borders, improving our own infrastructure at no cost to us."
 mittel.107.a: "A doorway to the rest of Africa."

 mittel.1071.t: "Connection of the Cape to Cairo Railway to Ethiopia"
 mittel.1071.d: "The Germans have added another section to the Cape to Cairo railroad, connecting Ethiopia to the rest of Africa. While we won't see much in the way of trade benefits, they have sent manpower over to us to build the section inside our borders, improving our own infrastructure at no cost to us."
 mittel.1071.a: "These Germans are rather generous, aren't they?"

 mittel.109.t: "African Investments!"
 mittel.109.d: "While we lost our African holdings in the Weltkrieg, we still operate a large, informal economic empire in Germany's African territories. Profits from the mining, rubber and ivory trade strengthen the economy of our small yet great country."
 mittel.109.a: "Profitable!"

 mittel.110.t.blocked: "Mittelafrika Blocks Our Investments!"
 mittel.110.d.blocked: "It's no secret that the German authorities in Africa have been hostile to our interests on the continent, constantly hindering our efforts to protect our economic sphere in the region, particularly in our former colony, the Congo. However, they have taken an unprecedented and unexpected course of action recently: they have directly seized our African assets, dealing a mortal blow to our involvement on the dark continent."
 mittel.110.t.collapse: "Mittelafrika Collapses"
 mittel.110.d.collapse: "Today, we have received news from the dark continent: Mittelafrika, the administrative amalgamation of German colonies in Africa, has collapsed into anarchy. As petty warlords and tribal Kings fight for influence on the former imperial lands, one thing is certain: our investments have swiftly disappeared, and our interests in Africa have been dealt a mortal blow."
 mittel.110.a: "Damn it!"

 mittel.111.t: "New Political Parties"
 mittel.111.d: "Now that our country has elections, it is no longer fitting that our politics are made up of military factions. The people who once supported the DKG have formed the Kaiser- und Vaterlandspartei, while those who once supported the NKR now support the Afrikanische Aktionspartei. A Social Democratic party has also been formed."
 mittel.111.a: "Exciting!"

 mittel.112.t: "A Split in the Reformgruppe!"
 mittel.112.d: "Now that their reforms have been implemented, the Reformgruppe has been struggling to come up with what to do next and this has caused a split in the party! The right wing of the party, which want to limit voting rights to whites and implement reforms to make white rule easier, have formed the Weißafrikaner-Partei, while the liberal wing of the party, which want to implement more liberal reforms, have formed the Neue Reformgruppe."
 mittel.112.a: "A big development ahead of the elections."

 mittel.113.t: "The First Mittelafrikan elections"
 mittel.113.d: "Ballots have been opened in all areas where voting is allowed. White settlers, certain black chiefs, and Askari have been given the right to vote, guaranteeing an electoral victory for the pro-German parties. But which one will win the elections?"
 mittel.113.a: "The Weißafrikaner-Partei!"
 mittel.113.b: "The Kaiser- und Vaterlandspartei!"
 mittel.113.c: "The Neue Reformgruppe!"
 mittel.113.e: "The Afrikanische Aktionspartei!"

 mittel.136.t: "A Sovereign State"
 mittel.136.d: "With von Göring's recent success in the legal battle against the Kaiser, many of the NKR's former leaders have left for von Göring's new faction within the Mittelafrika administration, the 'Selbstverwalter' who argue that MAF should be a sovereign state ruled by its Governor, and are even more radical than the NKR on internal issues."
 mittel.136.a: "An interesting development."

 mittel.166.t: "Mozambique Has Fallen"
 mittel.166.d: "It appears that our efforts in Africa have proven in the end to be little more than folly, as on all fronts forces from South Africa and Mittelafrika overrun our colonies. Mozambique itself has fallen into the hands of our foes and now our position on the continent appears increasingly tenuous."
 mittel.166.a: "A complete catastrophe!"

 mittel.170.t: "Peace With [TZN.GetNameDef]?"
 mittel.170.d: "We have been thrown off the mainland! While we may be safe here, our odds of retaking the land which is rightfully ours are small; maybe a peace offering would be a smart idea..."
 mittel.170.a: "Offer peace."
 mittel.170.b: "We shall fight on!"

 mittel.171.t: "Zanzibar Offers Peace"
 mittel.171.d: "Zanzibar has come to us offering a peace deal; we shall keep their territory on the mainland in return for an end to the fighting. What do we say?"

 mittel.172.a: "That is a shame..."

 mittel.173.t: "Germany Accepts von Göring... Just"
 mittel.173.d: "Germany has begrudgingly accepted to drop the matter for now. Likely they thought it was not worth the trouble, nevertheless, many in our government are not happy and we have made enemies in Berlin this day. Still; we remain in power."
 mittel.173.a: "Of course we are!"

 mittel.181.t: "The Governor's Proclamation"
 mittel.181.d: "This evening, Hermann von Göring addressed the entirety of Mittelafrika in a broadcast speech through the radio, copies of which are quickly finding their way throughout the entire continent. What began as a formal, typical address quickly took on a different tone, as the Governor abruptly began to denounce the "damaging particularist elements" on the continent, as well as the continued "interference" of the political establishment in Berlin. The speech ended with a vow to put an end to end both by any means necessary.\n\nWhat seems to have followed the announcement was a clandestine purge of the colony's political apparatus. Political correspondents on the ground liken the current situation to a self-coup, and are eager to see how Berlin reacts to the proclamation and its aftermath."
 mittel.181.a: "It's time to instil some order, whether they like it or not!"
 mittel.181.b: "Has he finally gone mad?"
 mittel.181.c: "We cannot deal with this right now."

 mittel.182.t: "Afrika Goes Quiet"
 mittel.182.d: "Something is wrong. Very wrong. We're no longer hearing back from border garrisons. Supply convoys are being raided at an alarming rate. Many native elements of our troops are deserting, and we still haven't heard a thing from the dependencies. The atmosphere is tense like it never has been before."
 mittel.182.a: "This doesn't look good..."

 mittel.184.t: "Peace in Afrika?"
 mittel.184.d: "Somehow, von Göring's insane scheme has worked. Against all odds, the Askari of the Mittelafrikan government have crushed the rebels and enforced a harsh peace upon the colony. The damage from the chaos is severe, but the position of the Sovereign Governor has never been stronger."
 mittel.184.a: "Was there ever any doubt in von Göring's leadership?"

 mittel.186.t: "African Colonies Reclaimed"
 mittel.186.d: "Following the dramatic and total collapse of Mittelafrika, we have brought our former African colonies back into our nation. While we never got official permission to do this, the Mittelafrikan government was hardly in a position to contest. In fact, such is the chaos, we haven't received any official complaints of any kind. This is nothing but sweet justice for the theft that removed them from us in the first place."
 mittel.186.a: "Justice is served!"

 mittel.187.t: "[transferred_state.GetName] Is Ours"
 mittel.187.d: "Following the dramatic and total collapse of Mittelafrika, we have brought [transferred_state.GetName] back into our nation. While we never got official permission to do this, the German colonial government was hardly in a position to contest it. In fact, such is the chaos, we haven't received any official complaints of any kind."

## Economic Events ##
 mittel.200.t: "Black Monday!"
 mittel.200.d: "A massive breakdown has occurred yesterday on the Berlin stock exchange. The German economy is in tatters and our economy is sure to follow. We need to cut a lot of our spending and look for ways to fix our economy immediately. It could take many years to recover from this..."
 mittel.200.a: "Disastrous!"

 mittel.201.t: "The 1937 Budget"
 mittel.201.d: "As we enter 1937, we face a difficult choice. Our economy wasn't strong to begin with, and the recession wiped out what manufacturing potential we had for most of last year. Going forward, we'll have to decide whether to focus on military production or divert our limited resources to repairing the civilian economy instead."
 mittel.201.a: "Focus on military buildup."
 mittel.201.b: "A long-term investment makes more sense here."

 mittel.202.t: "The 1938 Budget"
 mittel.202.d: "It has been two years since Black Monday and yet the effects of the recession are still being felt. The economy is slowly getting back on track, but we're in the same situation as before. Should we focus on military or civilian issues in this year's budget?"
 mittel.202.a: "Germany needs our army!"
 mittel.202.b: "Put more resources into improving our infrastructure."

 mittel.203.t: "The 1939 Budget"
 mittel.203.d: "The lost growth of the last three years of depression may never be recovered, but for the present we're in a more stable position. Our economy - what's left of it, at least - now seems to be working at full capacity."
 mittel.203.a: "No compromises in production! We have a lot of lost time to make up."

 mittel.204.t: "The 1940 Budget"
 mittel.204.d: "Some say war is good for business, others say it is bad - but what cannot be disputed is that our economy is doing well! There's no denying that business is booming, and the 1940 Budget will provide resources and funding for years to come!"
 mittel.204.a: "Let's make Germany proud!"

 ## DKAEB Events ##
 DKAEB_intro: "Founded in the early 20th century, the Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) is a holding company that oversees the railway between Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, the line is now used to transport ore from the Congo Basin to Djibouti. The current economic downturn means that ore is not being bought at the same rate as before, resulting in fewer transports for the DKAEB.\n\n"

 mittel.205.t: "DKAEB on the verge of Bankruptcy"
 mittel.205.d: "$DKAEB_intro$As a result, the DKAEB is struggling financially and some board members have approached the government in Daressalam to sell their shares to the German government."
 mittel.205.a: "We shall inform Berlin of this at once."

 mittel.206.d: "$DKAEB_intro$As a result, the DKAEB is struggling financially and some board members have approached the government in Daressalam to sell their shares to the German government.\n\nSomething has to be done to prevent Ethiopia from slipping out of our grasp."
 mittel.206.a: "Prop up the company."
 mittel.206.b: "Sell the government shares to Ethiopia."
 mittel.206.c: "Isn't Mittelafrika responsible for Mittelafrikan affairs?"

 mittel.207.t: "The Colonial Office comes to a Decision"
 mittel.207.d: "The Colonial Office in Berlin has complied with our request for a decision, and they have decided to buy the shares being offered. They believe it is crucial to keep the railways running if we wish to maintain our links with Ethiopia, and tell us the rail line will eventually be profitable in the long run."
 mittel.207.a: "So be it then."

 mittel.208.t: "The Colonial Office comes to a Decision"
 mittel.208.d: "The Colonial Office in Berlin has complied with our request for a decision, and they have decided to sell the shares being offered to Ethiopia. They claim that we will be too overstretched if we attempt to keep the railroad afloat, and find Ethiopia an unsatisfactory ally to retain."
 mittel.208.a: "So be it then."

 mittel.209.t: "The Colonial Office Refuses to Engage"
 mittel.209.d: "It seems that nobody in Berlin wanted to take responsibility for making a decision on buying the DKAEB shares. They have kicked the problem back to us, telling us they trust Governor [MAF.GetLeader]'s judgement in this matter. If we were to keep control of the railroad, we would likely have to spend resources and time keeping it afloat that we could otherwise spend on improving our economic situation, but if we did nothing we would lose the Ethiopians as a possible ally."
 mittel.209.a: "We will take control of the railroad."
 mittel.209.b: "We will cut state support for the DKAEB."

 mittel.210.t: "The DKAEB Railroad Reports Profits"
 mittel.210.d: "The end of the third quarter was not generally good for Mittelafrika - the lack of any economic remedies to the ongoing recession is hitting the colony as a whole hard. However, the DKAEB has reported that the volume of military and trade cars being charged by their railroad has gone up since the first quarter, and it seems that investors are confident in the railroad once again. Governor [MAF.GetLeader]'s plan has paid off."
 mittel.210.a: "Our export link is secure."

 mittel.211.t: "The DKAEB Railroad Goes Bankrupt!"
 mittel.211.d: "The end of the third economic quarter has come and gone, but the Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn has not continued with it. We have mismanaged the project to save it, although the Ethiopians appear to have cooperated, and we now have no choice to sell our shares to the Ethiopian government. Governor [MAF.GetLeader]'s reputation has suffered accordingly - it seems increasingly unlikely he will be able to make Mittelafrika profitable without resorting to drastic measures."
 mittel.211.a: "The Ethiopians can have the tracks now!"

 mittel.212.t: "The DKAEB Stays Afloat"
 mittel.212.d: "There was a rare spot of good news today in the terrible year of 1936 - the DKAEB railroad in East Africa has reported profits for the third quarter. It seems the Ethiopians and Mittelafrikan government have cooperated to keep the trading link open. Our relationship with Ethiopia seems to be secure, and might deepen to alliance eventually."
 mittel.212.a: "Good news."

 mittel.213.t: "The DKAEB Goes Bankrupt"
 mittel.213.d: "The Mittelafrikan administration has failed yet again, as the East African DKAEB has gone under. This has ostracised our Ethiopian ally, while wasting precious German resources on saving the railway. We placed some trust in Governor [MAF.GetLeader] for this operation - something we shall never do again."
 mittel.213.a: "Incompetent fools!"

## Kenyan Events ##
 mittel.400.t: "The Kikuyu Central Association"
 mittel.400.d: "When we moved into British Territory in 1925, the British hold on the territory was dangerously weak after 7 years of warfare. In the same year, British strikes coincided with a series of protests by the natives in British East Africa; continued expropriation of the most productive land by British settlers around the Central Highlands has driven the Kikuyu to organise themselves in order to collectively bargain with the Kenyan administration. With the continued hardline stance of the Kenyan Legislative Council, their pleas have fallen on deaf ears, leading the organisation to seek other avenues to achieve their goals. Their radicalisation seems to have been increased rapidly, with clashes between them and the Anglo Security Forces occuring on the daily. The Kenyan administration has asked us to prepare to assist them if the situation escalates further."
 mittel.400.a: "Can't they deal with it themselves?"

 mittel.401.t: "The Kenyan Highlands Settlement Policy"
 mittel.401.d: "The Highlands of Kenya are one of the few areas of Africa suitable to white settlement. The rare combination of cool uplands combined with healthy soil creates a climate almost like that of Europe, and excellent for farming. It is no wonder that the land there is in high demand.\n\nUnfortunately, it's long been economically underused. The British settlers have proven more interested in establishing themselves as landholders and letting the native Kikuyu do the labour. If we opened the land up to small German farmers squeezed by the Junker estates, we could improve productivity and increase our influence on the region, but it would also make the land shortage even more intense."
 mittel.401.a: "Allow for German settlement."
 mittel.401.b: "Let us keep the British protectorates British."

 mittel.402.t: "Land Crisis in the Kenyan Highlands"
 mittel.402.d: "Allowing German settlement in the Highlands of Kenia has only exacerbated the problems in the region, as it has set off land speculation, with prices rising out of control, and conflicts and disputes breaking out over the demarcation of a few metres of land. To make matters worse, for the local Kikuyu tribes, a man is not considered an adult until he owns at least some land. There are tribal territories set aside for this, but they are massively overcrowded, with most of them owning no land and working on British plantations. Additionally, an increasing amount of land within the tribal areas is monopolised by the local chiefs. This land shortage is creating unrest on all sides."
 mittel.402.a: "Break up the less effective British plantations."
 mittel.402.b: "Withdraw the German settlers."
 mittel.402.c: "Use Kikuyu labour for land reclamation projects."

 mittel.403.t: "The Death of High Chief Waruhiu"
 mittel.403.d: "In a shocking turn of events, unknown gunmen shot and killed Senior Chief Waruhiu wa Kung'u this afternoon in broad daylight. Waruhiu was our senior collaborative official among the Kikuyu. Our security officials have been noting the rise of religious, oath based violence among the Kikuyu. Supposedly, they conduct 'magic rituals' under the cover of darkness, and swear oaths to kill white settlers. By killing Senior Chief Waruhiu, who had a bodyguard and was held in high esteem by our administration, they've demonstrated there's almost no one in the Kenyan Highlands they couldn't kill, right now."

From there, they have begun an insurgency campaign against us and the British, targeting colonial civilians and soldiers alike, and using the most barbaric and brutal tactics imaginable."
 mittel.405.a: "Send in the army."

 mittel.406.t: "The Mau Mau are Defeated"
 mittel.406.d: "After a hard-fought guerrilla war against the Mau Mau revolt in Kenya, we have finally managed to put most of the rebelling warriors down and have either arrested, killed or executed most of the rebellion's leaders. Kenya should be peaceful for a while now..."
 mittel.406.a: "Three cheers for Mittelafrika!"

 mittel.407.t: "Another Mau Mau Revolt!"
 mittel.407.d: "The Kikuyu people, who we defeated once already, have revolted again! We thought we had already dealt with the problems in Kenya... We must send in our forces again, or this time they may actually succeed at achieving more than simple massacres..."
