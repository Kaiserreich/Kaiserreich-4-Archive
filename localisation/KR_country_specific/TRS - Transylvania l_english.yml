### Events ###
 transylvania.1.t: "Union with Romania?"
 transylvania.1.d: "Finally Transylvania is independent from Hungary. We are a Romanian state and the population has since long desired to join our brethren in Romania, to form one state together. Finally, the dream of a Greater Romania can be achieved."
 transylvania.1.a: "Proclaim the Union with Romania."
 transylvania.1.b: "Petition [ROOT.Overlord.GetNameDef] to allow the union."
 transylvania.1.c: "No, we should keep our independence!"

 transylvania.2.t: "Transylvania Proclaims Union with Romania"
 transylvania.2.d: "Transylvania has managed to become independent from Hungary. Their government has unanimously declared a Union between Romania and Transylvania. Finally, we can welcome our long lost siblings into one Greater Romania."
 transylvania.2.a: "Welcome, Romanian brethren!"

 transylvania.3.t: "Transylvania Desires Union with Romania"
 transylvania.3.d: "Contrary to what some of our planners might say, [TRS.GetNameDef] is an artificial state. The state that we have established in the region is populated overwhelmingly by Romanians that may have a regional identity, but do not appear to translate this into support for permanent Transylvanian independence - indeed, many of those working with us in establishing [TRS.GetNameDef] were under the impression that it would be a stopgap measure until such time that Romania proper could be aligned, after which Transylvania would be incorporated into a Greater Romania.\n\nNow that Romania is under a friendly government, Transylvania and Romania have jointly petitioned us to be allowed to merge. As the arbiters of the peace, we are by no means required to allow this union, especially since both states are dependent on us for their security and are in no position to change this. Even so, many planners argue that attempting to prop up an artificial state in Transylvania would only serve to undermine our support in the region in the long term. However, others argue that our interests may be served better by a divided nation. Should we grant this request?"
 transylvania.3.a: "Of course."
 transylvania.3.b: "No, we prefer them kept separate."

 transylvania.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Union with Romania"
 transylvania.4.d: "We have just received word that [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approved our request to join with our Romanian bretheren! Finally, the time has come to realise the dream of Greater Romania!"
 transylvania.4.a: "Send an envoy to Bucharest!"

 transylvania.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Union with Romania"
 transylvania.5.d: "Horrible news - [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has informed us that they will not approve of any union between us and Romania, citing 'strategic concerns'. Perhaps their intentions not as altrustic as we had hoped..."
 transylvania.5.a: "Damn you!"
