### Focuses ###

### BSDP ###
 WHR_Sieradas_Report: "Sierada's Report"
 WHR_Sieradas_Report_desc: "Jan Sierada, People's Minister for Agriculture, is to submit his report on the land reform project he leads to the Sojm. It is well-known that the program has stalled in recent months, and it is hoped that the report will clear up any confusion and offer a way for the government to tackle the issue again."
 WHR_Cooperate_with_the_Bund: "Continue Bund Cooperation"
 WHR_Cooperate_with_the_Bund_desc: "The Jewish Labour Bund is a core ally of the BSDP and has cooperated with us on many things, time to continue this cooperation."
 WHR_MaAV_Opening: "Opening of the Mahilioŭ Automobile Plant"
 WHR_MaAV_Opening_desc: "Built with German help initially as an auto repair workshop, the Mahilioŭ (Mogilev) Automobile Plant is to open to great acclaim. Along with repair facilities for the army, especially for German forces in the region, the expanded Plant includes the tools and machinery to begin production of agricultural tractors, making it the cornerstone of the BSDP's industrialisation program and a symbol of German-Belarusian cooperation."
 WHR_The_Assembly: "Congress of the Hramada"
 WHR_The_Assembly_desc: "Belarus' ruling coalition, the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, or Hramada, is lead by the BDSP. However, the stalling of Plan Sierada and the collapse of the German economy has shaken its unity. An emergency congress of the Hramada has been called to tackle these issues and either reel the other parties back in, or propose a new plan to the Sojm."
 WHR_Status_Quo: "Resume Plan Sierada"
 WHR_Status_Quo_desc: "With the Hramada rallied back behind the moderates of the BSDP, Plan Sierada can continue with the support of the entire coalition. This will also then allow us to proceed with our other ambitious projects, from industrial expansion to education reform."
 WHR_Protect_Parliament: "Protecting the Sojm's Authority"
 WHR_Protect_Parliament_desc: "The Sojm is the true representative of the people. This very fact is enshrined in the BNR's constitution as the legislature represents the people's sovereignty. The threats to our parliamentary republic have eased, further cementing our young democracy against reactionaries and autocrats."
 WHR_Solidify_identity: "Solidifying our Identity"
 WHR_Solidify_identity_desc: "Lack of a common national identity is one of the worst characteristics a nation may have. We’ve been doing many things to correct this injustice in the past 20 years. Yet there’s still much work to be done. We must continue on."
 WHR_Bundist_Ties: "Leash the Bund"
 WHR_Bundist_Ties_desc: "The Bund is growing more and more worried with our programs and may cut ties with us, we must not let that happen, we must contact the moderates most pro-BSDP members of the Bund to ensure the continuation of our alliance with the Bund."
 WHR_Bund_Autonomy: "Negotiations with the Bund?"
 WHR_Bund_Autonomy_desc: "Starting chaos with our allies will achieve nothing productive, we should negotiate with the Bund leadership to hash out a deal to reinvigorate our alliance."
 WHR_Minority_Protection: "Protect Minorities"
 WHR_Minority_Protection_desc: "Despite our best efforts to bring about an equal society, the reality has been less than ideal, as even with constitutional guarantees, there remains tension between that nation's ethnic groups. We must not only have codified guarantees, but our actions must match the formalities and renew our dedication to the Personal Principle."
 WHR_Civic_Nationalism: "Promote Civic Nationalism"
 WHR_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "The formation of the Belarusian nation was not only an effort of the Belarusian people. Many minorities lent their effort to the nation building we’ve been so desperately craving for years. Therefore, we should focus on promoting a specific type of Nationalism. One that takes loyalty, freedom and equality from its citizens. Civic Nationalism."
 WHR_National_Awakening: "The National Awakening"
 WHR_National_Awakening_desc: "Our efforts bear fruit! Nowadays more people proudly identify as “Belarusian” than have at any point in history. Soon, the Belarusian nation will be recognised as a true one, equal to the Poles and Russians that once looked down on us as mere peasants and fodder for assimilation."
 WHR_Guaranteed_Liberties: "Guaranteed Liberties"
 WHR_Guaranteed_Liberties_desc: "With many threats around the world ramping up their ante, it’s quite sad to see our citizens despair about potentially losing their rights. They should fear not however, for the people of Belarus are free and they shall remain so, with all the privileges this freedom entails!"
 WHR_Expand_Rural_Education: "Expand Education to the Countryside"
 WHR_Expand_Rural_Education_desc: "Lack of education for the Peasantry has always been an incredibly potent issue for our fledgling nation. We’ve been taking steps to rectify this for years now and we shall keep doing so in the future, for education is the backbone of any modern country."
 WHR_Expand_Welfare_State: "Expand the Welfare State"
 WHR_Expand_Welfare_State_desc: "In the vein of Social Democratic ideals, we should focus on expanding the national welfare programs for both rural peasants and urban dwellers."
 WHR_Expand_Pedagogical_Institute: "Minsk Pedagogical Institute"
 WHR_Expand_Pedagogical_Institute_desc: "Founded as the Minsk Teachers' Training Institute in 1914, the Pedagogical Institute has proven to be one of the central pillars for Belarusian nation-building, training teachers to educate the people, young and old. In order to keep up with the massive expansion of our national education system, the Institute must be expanded to help fill the ever-increasing number of classrooms and continue the fight against illiteracy."
 WHR_Build_University: "Belarusian State University"
 WHR_Build_University_desc: "Founded in October of 1921 is the foremost higher education institution in Belarus. As mentioned previously, education is the backbone of any fledging, so we’ll make sure to keep the University well-funded. The next generations are key towards Belarus’ success."
 WHR_Calm_The_Left: "Calming the Left"
 WHR_Calm_The_Left_desc: "At the start of this crisis, we’ve rebuked the Left-wing of our party and kept going with our reformist ideals. Regardless however, we should reassure our comrades from the left. We’re all fighting for the same thing here: a Socialist Belarus, equal for all."
 WHR_Belarus_Proud_and_Free: "Belarus Proud and Free"
 WHR_Belarus_Proud_and_Free_desc: " We did it! In spite of the recent world crisis, we’ve managed to persevere for we are Belarusian people. We shall keep marching throughout history. Long live Belarus, proud and free!"
 WHR_BSDP_Black_Monday: "Dealing with Black Monday"
 WHR_BSDP_Black_Monday_desc: "As we are dependent on the German economy, it came to no shock that the aftershocks of Black Monday quickly reached our nation as several German firms had to close shop, leaving many Belarusians unemployed. Now that we have dealt with the land reform issue, which affects a much greater portion of our population, we can tackle this new challenge. For now, public works projects will keep our people busy as we assess the damage."
 WHR_Help_Jewish_Organizations: "Help Jewish Organisations"
 WHR_Help_Jewish_Organizations_desc: "Many urban-based Jewish organisations have been hit particularly hard by Black Monday. The Sojm should divert some funds to said associations for quicker recovery. Our Bundist allies will surely appreciate that. Two birds."
 WHR_Nationalize_Key_Industries: "Nationalise Key Industries"
 WHR_Nationalize_Key_Industries_desc: "The BSDP has always supported the nationalisation of some key sectors of the economy. With German firms bankrupt or pulling out, we have a good opportunity to pick up after their mess and strengthen our nation's economic position within our own country."
 WHR_Waiting_on_the_Germans: "Waiting on the Germans"
 WHR_Waiting_on_the_Germans_desc: "In spite of us taking the most appropriate measures to combat the economic crisis, we should be honest with ourselves. Belarus’ economy is notably weak, especially when compared to our neighbours. Our German overlord has always been paramount in our economic affairs and we can’t proceed without him. §RWe cannot recover from Black Monday until Germany does.§"

### Coup ###
 WHR_Aftermath_Of_The_Coup: "Aftermath of the Coup"
 WHR_Aftermath_Of_The_Coup_desc: "The Army has stepped in just in time to save the country from the crypto-syndicalists of the BSDP. While the dust has barely settled in Minsk, the socialists have taken up arms to continue the fight in the countryside. To secure the nation from them and ensure that we remain free from Syndicalism."
 WHR_The_New_Populist_Government: "The New Populist Government"
 WHR_The_New_Populist_Government_desc: "Formerly the opposition to the BSDP government, the Christian Democrats and Populists of the National Democratic Association have pledged their support for the military government. Seeing the true threat the socialists pose, a unity government has been formed consisting of National Democratic representatives in the Sojm and the army."
 WHR_Stop_Land_Reform: "Stop the Land Reform"
 WHR_Stop_Land_Reform_desc: "The socialists' destabilising ideological program has gone far enough. The worst excesses have long been dealt with and its continuation only serves to hurt the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and the loyal landowners of the country."
 WHR_Restore_The_Sojm: "Restructure the Sojm"
 WHR_Restore_The_Sojm_desc: "It is imperative that some form of representation is maintained in our republic, for we cannot ignore the plights of our people. The seats held by the BSDP have been, of course, forfeited, and those held by Lastouski's Kryvians are loyal to our anti-syndicalist cause, leaving us with a comfortable majority to legally enact laws and constitutional changes."
 WHR_Church_Education: "Bring the Churches in Education"
 WHR_Church_Education_desc: "The BSDP's insistence on purely secular education has proved to be a major roadblock for the struggling situation of our institutions. The Catholic and Orthodox churches are keen to help improve literacy among the poor peasants, the majority of the nation's population, and instil good values in them. We will solve the literacy issue much more easily and quickly by letting them organise schools again."
 WHR_Promote_Civic_Nationalism: "Promote Civic Nationalism"
 WHR_Promote_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "It is imperative that we do not betray the People's Republic ideals of civic nationalism, for many minorities live in White Ruthenia. While continuing to improve the national awakening of the Belarusians, we cannot abandon our Polish and Russian allies in the face of the existential threat of Syndicalism."
 WHR_Formally_Ban_BSDP: "Ban the BSDP"
 WHR_Formally_Ban_BSDP_desc: "It is not enough to merely oppose the BSDP; we must ensure that they can never threat our nation ever again. As such, their party will be formally banned along with their leftist allies in the Hramada. We cannot allow crypto-syndicalists to enter our government ever again."
 WHR_National_Revolution: "The National Revolution"
 WHR_National_Revolution_desc: "It is clear that to avoid a godless Syndicalist revolution, a National one must take place to lead the nation away from leftist agitation. This is what our government represents, and we will lead the Belarusian nation towards a future free of foreign agitators."
 WHR_Puppet_Sojm: "The New Sojm"
 WHR_Puppet_Sojm_desc: "When the People's Republic was founded, a strictly parliamentary system was put in place. However, with a Syndicalist takeover only barely averted thanks to the swift actions of the military and Sojm opposition, it is clear that such a system has failed our people. A more balanced system is required, one where the legislature does not hold complete control over the executive."
 WHR_Power_To_The_President: "Empower the Rada"
 WHR_Power_To_The_President_desc: "As part of our reforms to ensure a Syndicalist takeover can never happen, we must strengthen the Rada and the President. This will formally transform White Ruthenia into a presidential system instead of a parliamentary one."
 WHR_Military_Representation: "Military Representatives"
 WHR_Military_Representation_desc: "The military has proven to be our nation's saviour, so it is only natural that they would be guaranteed representation in our government and the Sojm. This way, there will be a more direct connection between civilian and military and will allow the latter to intervene against any Syndicalist plots in a more timely (and legal) manner in the future."
 WHR_Reichspakt_Cooperation: "Deepen Cooperation with the Reichspakt"
 WHR_Reichspakt_Cooperation_desc: "The Reichspakt is the world's last barrier against the Third Internationale and their plot for global revolution. It is imperative that we deepen our ties with Germany to help them defeat Europe's greatest threat."
 WHR_Increase_Role_In_Mitteleuropa: "Increasing our Role in Mitteleuropa"
 WHR_Increase_Role_In_Mitteleuropa_desc: "Germany cannot defend Europe from Syndicalism and Russian imperialism alone, and we have been a minor part of the Reichspakt for far too long. It is time that we increase our contributions to Mitteleuropa's common defence, especially with the rising Russian threat."
 WHR_Belarus_Pure_And_True: "Belarus Pure and True"
 WHR_Belarus_Pure_And_True_desc: "It is not enough that Belarusians have an independent nation. The nation must also protect its values and morals against godlessness and radicalism. White Ruthenia is now back on a path where it will become an example for the rest of Europe despite our size and power."

 WHR_The_Countercoup: "The Countercoup"
 WHR_The_Countercoup_desc: "While the military has stepped in to save our nation from ruin, the democrats in the Sojm have proven to be indecisive against the Syndicalist threat. Vaclau Lastouski, leader of the Kryvian movement, has stepped in to lead the nation in its time of need. Once the crypto-syndicalist and liberal traitors are out of the way, we will begin White Ruthenia's national rejuvenation. "
 WHR_Proclaim_Kryvia: "Proclaim the Kryvian State"
 WHR_Proclaim_Kryvia_desc: "Terms such as White Ruthenia and Belarus are all foreign terms forced on our people. Only Kryvia truly represents our people in its once-pure form, before it was crushed under foreign occupations. With the proclamation of the Kryvian State, we are formally announcing the rebirth of our nation as a free, independent, and pure one."
 WHR_Purge_The_Sojm: "Purge the Sojm"
 WHR_Purge_The_Sojm_desc: "The Sojm is filled with leftist degenerates, foreign nationals, and corrupt capitalists. They must be purged and replaced by true servants of the people and nation, all the while making sure that corruption and degeneration can never again seep into the halls of power."
 WHR_Control_The_State: "Controlling the State"
 WHR_Control_The_State_desc: "There are too many barriers set against our movement. If we are to see the rebirth of our nation, we must take these down and take full control of the state and its institutions to reshape it. With power concentrated in the hands of Vaclau Lastouski, we will be able to see the consolidation of the Kryvian state become reality."
 WHR_The_Kryvian_Concept: "The Kryvian Concept"
 WHR_The_Kryvian_Concept_desc: "The Kryvian Concept was developed by Vaclau Lastouski before the Weltkrieg, believing that as descendants of the Kryvich people before the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, are an Aryan people and the purest of the East Slavic nations. It is time for Belarusians to embrace and protect this identity from the Mongol Muscovites to the East and internationalists within."
 WHR_Expropriate_The_Landlords: "Expropriate the Landlords"
 WHR_Expropriate_The_Landlords_desc: "For centuries, Belarusians have been a purely peasant nation under Polish and Russian landlords. The socialists, despite their rhetoric, have failed in their promise to help the peasants, trying too hard to please the enemy. Enough is enough; we will seize the lands and give it to the people, no questions asked, no compensation! Kryvians are no longer slaves!"
 WHR_The_Agrarian_Ideal: "The Agrarian Ideal"
 WHR_The_Agrarian_Ideal_desc: "The Belarusian is, broadly speaking, a poor farmer, and has been for centuries. Even as Kryvians, we are still a people of the land, and agrarian ideals resonate within our souls. We must protect this identity not only in rhetoric, but in action, by uplifting the peasant and the farmer to the level they were always meant to be."
 WHR_Nationalist_Education: "Nationalist Education"
 WHR_Nationalist_Education_desc: "Our socialist predecessors were of the right mind in ensuring a secular and nationalist education for our people. However, they certainly haven't gone far enough with the nationalist aspect, giving far too many concessions to Jews, Poles, and Russians, while letting leftist agitation seep in. The school curriculum must instil a proud Kryvian identity and a strong character."
 WHR_Anti_Russian_Propaganda: "The Existential Enemy"
 WHR_Anti_Russian_Propaganda_desc: "While Syndicalism is a threat, there is no bigger threat than the Muscovites of the East, our old oppressors. They will return, and they will try to destroy us once again, but we cannot allow it to happen. We can never return under their boot, and we will either prevail or die in our struggle for existence."
 WHR_Nation_Above_Class: "Nation above Class"
 WHR_Nation_Above_Class_desc: "Despite their Marxist ideology, the BSDP has not only completely failed to create a classless society, but further worsened class divisions. Belarusians or Kryvians will no longer be divided by class, for we are one indivisible nation."
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Reichspakt: "Nationalism under the Reichspakt"
 WHR_Nationalism_Under_Reichspakt_desc: "There is no shame in admitting that we will need help to keep invaders out, especially with the Muscovites at our border. Germany is our only true ally here, and our nation will likely only survive as part of the Reichspakt. As we work to become a self-reliant nation, Germany will help us towards this goal, and we will remain steadfast allies in the coming storm."
 WHR_Kryvian_Orthodox_Church: "Nationalise the Churches"
 WHR_Kryvian_Orthodox_Church_desc: "Despite Lastouski's best attempts to convince the people that religion plays no part in national identity, far too many people refuse to let go. As the Catholic Church remains influenced by the Poles and the Orthodox Church by the Muscovites, we must rupture their ties with the foreign enemies. The Churches in Kryvia must be completely subservient to the state."
 WHR_Constitutional_Amendment: "Constitutional Amendments"
 WHR_Constitutional_Amendment_desc: "The Constitution, full of leftist ideas and values, simply cannot be used by our nation. However, it is not completely unsalvageable. With effort and significant amendments, we can fix it to serve the needs of the Kryvian people and its institutions."
 WHR_The_Rise_of_Kryvia: "The Rise of Kryvia"
 WHR_The_Rise_of_Kryvia_desc: "With power consolidated within the Kryvian movement, we can truly begin the rebirth of the Belarusian people into the Kryvian nation. We will never be slaves to another invader ever again, and we will not waste the opportunity the Germans have given to our people as we begin to take our place among Europe's nations."

 WHR_Entice_German_Investors: "Entice German Investors"
 WHR_Entice_German_Investors_desc: "There is currently plenty of resentment towards German companies as they pulled out of our country after Black Monday. However, we cannot let these feelings get in the way of the fact that we need the investors to return and, this time, stay. This will require some fairly generous offers to entice them back into the White Ruthenian market."
 WHR_Consolidate_State_Assets: "Consolidate State Assets"
 WHR_Consolidate_State_Assets_desc: "Because of the limited amount of capital within the country, the government has been highly active in the economy to help spur development. This means that not only does the state owns a significant portion of it, but also bloat and inefficiencies. Consolidated state enterprises and downsizing will help lower state expenses and, in the long-run, improve their efficiency."
 WHR_Loosen_Labour_Laws: "Loosen Labour Laws"
 WHR_Loosen_Labour_Laws_desc: "The BSDP government, true to their socialist rhetoric, implemented strong and comprehensive labour laws that favoured workers over owners. This makes foreign companies less eager to invest even with the relatively lower costs. Loosening these laws, despite the protests of the All-Belarusian Congress of Trade Unions, will help make investing in our country more attractive."
 WHR_Expanded_Education: "Education Reforms"
 WHR_Expanded_Education_desc: "Modernising the higher education curriculae is a key step in increasing the supply of Belarusian experts. Only through Western-style reformed school system we can stay competitive."
 WHR_Request_Bail_Out: "Request a Bail Out"
 WHR_Request_Bail_Out_desc: "Even with our best effort and decisions, our economy is simply too weak on its own to cope with the global economic downturn. We will need to make a formal request to the German government to help bail out our economy, likely involving some long-term loans from German banks. We can only hope the Germans will have generous terms for their steadfast ally in the East."

### Army ###
 WHR_Expand_Army: "Expanding the People's Army"
 WHR_Expand_Army_desc: "The formation of the Belarusian People's Army was a tumultuous affair, to say the least. With initial distrust from the German Army and a Bolshevik coup, it wouldn't be until 1919 that a formal army was created, and it faced further difficulties in securing arms and enthusiasm from either the people or government. With renewed worries about the Russian threat, there is finally interest in military reform and expansion now that the nation's very survival is at stake."
 WHR_Revive_BVZR: "Revive the Military Central Council"
 WHR_Revive_BVZR_desc: "The Belarusian Military Central Council, or Belvaiskrada, was formed in November 1917 to organise the first Belarusian military units, but was disbanded the next year as the German Army occupied Minsk, delaying the creation of the People's Army by over a year. The purpose of the revived Belvaiskrada is to transform the People's Army into a proper, modern military force that can stand up on its own as much as possible, focusing on the quality of officers, NCOs, and training."
 WHR_Create_BKA: "Creation of the Belarusian Home Guard"
 WHR_Create_BKA_desc: "Two things are clear: The People's Army will never be able to beat back a Russian or German invasion on its own, and the National Guard is too limited in scope to provide for local defence and auxiliary support. As such, the National Guard will be replaced by the Belarusian Home Guard, or BKA, which will focus on mobilising the civilian population and the army reserves for a prolonged guerrilla war against the occupier."
 WHR_Expand_Military_Schools: "Expand the Central Military School"
 WHR_Expand_Military_Schools_desc: "The Central Military School is the only institution capable of training officers for the People's Army, and they still often have to study in Germany for further instruction. The School is in dire need of expansion if we are to increase the quality of our officers, which will include new facilities and hiring foreign instructors."
 WHR_Improving_NCO: "Improving our NCOs"
 WHR_Improving_NCO_desc: "Professional officers are important, but non-commissioned officers have also seen significant professionalisation since the Weltkrieg. Their importance in maintaining the link between officers and soldiers is immense, and their role on the frontlines is impossible to overstate. Increasing their training will help increase the quality of the army as a whole, for officers rely on them and soldiers look up to them."
 WHR_Belarusian_Army_Manuals: "Belarusian Army Manuals"
 WHR_Belarusian_Army_Manuals_desc: "As embarrassing as it is to say, most of our newer manuals are in German, which few Belarusians can read, and the outdated ones in Russian. There are, of course, unofficial translations from educated officers and volunteers, but there are still no formal manuals in Belarusian. With the increasing literacy of the people, it is more than about time to compile modern army manuals in our own language."
 WHR_Formalize_Sappers: "Formalise Sappers and Assault Units"
 WHR_Formalize_Sappers_desc: "Technical troops in the People's Army remain more-or-less ad-hoc, informal organisations, with engineers often sent to train in Germany. With the growing number of educated technicians in the army, it is time to organise them into formal units. Furthermore, our assault units, also trained on the German model, will also gain formal designations."
 WHR_Motorization_Logistics: "Motorisation and Logistics"
 WHR_Motorization_Logistics_desc: "If there is one military benefit of being an agrarian nation with increasing agricultural mechanisation, it's that many of our soldiers are familiar with motor vehicles. With the increasing number of trucks and even armoured vehicles on the battlefield, we can use it to improve our logistical situation despite the less-than-ideal infrastructure of the country."
 WHR_Purchase_Heavy_Equipment: "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
 WHR_Purchase_Heavy_Equipment_desc: "It is safe to say that Belarus will not produce heavy military equipment in large numbers in the near future, making us dependent on importing them from our allies. With an increasing need for trucks, radios, and artillery on the modern battlefield, we will have to start securing a stockpile of heavy materiel before it is too late."
 WHR_Dnieper_Dvina_Line: "Dnieper-Dvina Line"
 WHR_Dnieper_Dvina_Line_desc: "While the border on the rivers Dnieper and Dvina cuts us off from well over a million Belarusians under Russian oppression, it gives us and our allies a far better defensive position when the Russians inevitably return. Despite being part of Germany's Ostwall project, the Belarusian section was seriously neglected, presenting a weakpoint in the Reichspakt. We must prepare our defences before it is too late."
 WHR_Auxillary_Battalions: "Auxiliary Battalions"
 WHR_Auxillary_Battalions_desc: "In order to mobilise as much of the population as possible, auxiliary battalions are to be formed from reservists, veterans, and civilian volunteers to support military operations. This will increase the number of available manpower for the armed forces and decrease the amount of training necessary for new formations."
 WHR_Militarize_Police: "Militarise Police Units"
 WHR_Militarize_Police_desc: "Local police units provide us with an interesting opportunity for military operations. As they are already trained to provide security and are very familiar with the local situation they serve in, they will prove invaluable in organising local resistance to the occupier and help funnel arms to partisans."
 WHR_Local_Munitions: "Local Munitions Production"
 WHR_Local_Munitions_desc: "When it came to establishing military industries, Belarus was thoroughly ignored during the Tsarist era. As such, the country lacks even the basic facilities to produce ammunition. In order to reduce our dependence on foreign imports and as an important entry-point in developing a military industrial sector, we will begin constructing facilities able to produce rifle and pistol ammunition."
 WHR_Partisan_Warfare: "Partisan Warfare"
 WHR_Partisan_Warfare_desc: "Sadly, it is very likely that in the case of an invasion, parts of our country will be overrun by the enemy. However, the Belarusian people are already experienced with partisan warfare since the Russian Civil War. It is only natural that we embrace this experience as part of our military doctrine and use every means possible to defend our homeland."
 WHR_Equipment_Standardization: "Equipment Standardisation"
 WHR_Equipment_Standardization_desc: "The People's Army's stockpile of weapons is an eclectic mess of Imperial Russian and German rifles, pistols, and even artillery pieces, all using different calibres. This creates a logistical nightmare for the Army, having to supply many types of ammo to our forces. This issue will only be solved once we streamline and standardise our equipment."
 WHR_Minsk_Arms_Plant: "[206.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Arms Plant"
 WHR_Minsk_Arms_Plant_desc: "With our steadily growing industry, we are finally able to build the [206.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Arms Plant, which will produce small arms locally for the People's Army. While this endeavour is only possible with extensive help from our allies, it will help increase our nation's economic independence."
 WHR_Aviation_Instructors: "Invite Aviation Instructors"
 WHR_Aviation_Instructors_desc: "Building an air force is a very big task and it will simply not be possible without help from foreigners. Thankfully, our stronger allies have far more experience in air warfare and can help us with instructors to train pilots and mechanics for the future Military Air Fleet."
 WHR_Military_Air_Fleet: "Form the Military Air Fleet"
 WHR_Military_Air_Fleet_desc: "While there is still a long way to go before the People's Army can protect the skies of Belarus on its own, the creation of a formal air force is an important step our people can be truly proud of. Air warfare has become an increasingly important part of modern war, and despite our late start, the Belarusian people will finally be able to fight off our enemies high above our homes."
 WHR_Baranavichy_Repair_Plant: "Baranavichy Aircraft Repair Plant"
 WHR_Baranavichy_Repair_Plant_desc: "The city of Baranavichy has been steadily industrialising and an air base was created in its outskirts along with the facilities required to repair aircraft. By expanding the air base and the repair facilities, we can jumpstart the Belarusian aeronautics industry and begin training mechanics and engineers on our own."
 WHR_Technical_Assistance: "Technical Assistance"
 WHR_Technical_Assistance_desc: "While our industrialisation steadily progresses, we continue to struggle with a lack of technical know-how in many sectors. With some help from experts from allied countries, we can overcome these hurdles and improve the pool of Belarusian skilled workers."
 WHR_Krupp_Contacts: "Krupp Contacts"
 WHR_Krupp_Contacts_desc: "There are certainly benefits to being part of the German sphere, and one of them are contacts within its largest firms. It is no secret that the People's Army lacks artillery, the queen of the battlefield. The Krupp conglomerate is well-known for its high-quality guns, and with the right words with them and the German Army, we can secure some older artillery pieces they no longer use for cheap."

 WHR_Expand_Cavalry: "Expanding the Cavalry"
 WHR_Expand_Cavalry_desc: "Despite the dwindling use of cavalry in modern warfare, in a country such as Belarus, horse cavalry still has use as support and mobile troops because of our rough terrain and lacklustre infrastructure. Until we can improve our industry and infrastructure, we cannot discard the use of light cavalry as a way to maximise the mobility of our forces and strike the enemy quickly."

As part of our doctrine of keeping our troops light, mobile, and concealed from the enemy, our cavalry force would benefit the most from motor vehicles and armour. The creation of an armoured cavalry will greatly improve the firepower of our mobile forces."

 WHR_mass_illiteracy: "Mass Illiteracy"
 WHR_mass_illiteracy_desc: "The majority of the White Ruthenian population consists of illiterate peasants. Since gaining independence, the country has invested significant resources to create and improve a national education system. This multi-generational task is only starting to bring results, slowly improving life in the countryside."

 WHR_agrarian_society: "Agrarian Society"
 WHR_agrarian_society_desc: "When White Ruthenia was fighting for its independence and national revival, the largely socialist Sojm initially outlawed private ownership of land and called for the redistribution of all large estates without compensation to landowners, largely ethnic Poles. However, this policy was quickly tempered as the Sojm sought support from the German Empire and the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party distanced themselves further from Bolshevik Russia. As such, more moderate land redistribution, which included compensation to landlords, has been in place since 1921. However, the slow pace and numerous problems encountered led to criticism within the BSDP and from its leftist coalition partners, calling for a radical policy to replace it as the Belarusian Socialist Hramada had promised back in 1917."

 WHR_agrarian_society_2: "Modernising Agrarian Society"
 WHR_agrarian_society_2_desc: "With the growth of industry in the country, the issues of rural overpopulation and unproductive agriculture is being mitigated by growing urbanisation and the redistribution of land to a growing class of smallholders. Along with the improvement of rural infrastructure and institutions, the Belarusian people is on the way to becoming a modern agrarian society and not a backwards one."

 WHR_agrarian_society_4: "Modern Agrarian Society"
 WHR_agrarian_society_4_desc: "While [WHR.GetNameDef] remains mostly agrarian, it now has a healthy industrial sector that supports both rural and urban economies of the country. Poverty and illiteracy in the countryside are diminishing as economic opportunities reach both sections of the population, bringing the nation ever closer together."

 WHR_weak_national_identity: "Weak National Identity"
 WHR_weak_national_identity_desc: "While many nations in Eastern Europe have experienced a national awakening in the second half of the 19th century, the idea of a Belarusian nation only started to appear in the early 20th century. By the time Russia fell to the Bolsheviks, very few Belarusians could even comprehend the idea of nationalism, let alone embrace it, and many even considered Belarusians to be nothing but Polonised Russians or poor, uncultured peasants unworthy of the title of "nation". Since 1917, Belarusian intellectuals have been fighting an uphill battle to bring education and, through it, national identity to the poor, illiterate peasants of the region. Even now, the majority of the population is apathetic at best or hostile at worst to the idea of Belarusian nationhood."

 WHR_Jewish_Bund_idea: "Influential Bund"
 WHR_Jewish_Bund_desc: "The Jewish Labour Bund, or simply the Bund is a Jewish labour movement prevalent through Europe, Belarus is no exception to that where the Bund has proved itself a valuable ally to the BSDP who both exist in a kind of symbiotic relationship. Though cracks are beginning to form with the ambitions of the BSDP growing larger and larger, the BSDP's plan to completely overhaul the Belarusian economy concerns the Bund leadership, this issue must be addressed soon."

 WHR_Jewish_Bund_Split_Complete: "New Bund Leadership"
 WHR_Jewish_Bund_Split_Complete_desc: "After a nationwide power struggle between the moderate and conservative factions of the Jewish Labour Bund, the government-aligned moderates emerged triumphant, now we'll have a more enthusiastic Bund on our side that may prove more supportive for our social and economic programs, though the power struggle did leave its mark on the Bund at large."

 WHR_Jewish_Bund_Negotiations: "Supportive Bund Leadership"
 WHR_Jewish_Bund_Negotiations_desc: "After an exhaustive period of negotiations with the leadership with the Jewish Labour Bund, we have finally reached an agreement, providing some level of autonomy for the Bund artisans from regulations and competition and in turn, they pledged their support for our economic and social programs."

 WHR_rural_schoolbuilding: "Rural School-building Spree"
 WHR_rural_schoolbuilding_desc: "Back during the first years of the Belarusian People's Republic, the number of schools in the country increased exponentially. This helped raise the literacy level significantly, but it still falls short compared to our neighbours and remains unacceptably low compared to the rest of Europe. The government's project includes building many more schools in the countryside, expand the existing ones, and re-introduce night classes for urban workers. This is an expensive and ambitious project, but should bear fruit in the long run."

 WHR_Quatrillingualism: "Personal Principle"
 WHR_Quatrillingualism_desc: "The Personal Principle was developed by the Austrian Social-Democratic Workers' Party as a way to tackle the question of nationalism in their multiethnic state. This involves detaching the nation (as in, the people) from the land they reside in. This is particularly useful to avoid bifurcating states that do not have clear ethnic lines. Instead, cultural and educational institutions are handled by a council representing a particular ethnicity, ensuring that they have autonomy in their national affairs."

 WHR_Hramada_Policies_desc: "The Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, or the Hramada for short, is the current ruling coalition in the country consisting of most of its progressive and leftist politicians.

Since its inception, the Plan has grown to encompass topics such as education policy, policy on unions, and the role of religion in the state. The instability within the party and ineffectiveness in implementing the land reform plan has resulted in the rise of more extreme rightist elements within [root.GetName], increasingly fuelled by fear of a Syndicalist revolution.

### Events ###
 whrpol.1.t: "White Ruthenia - Starting Situation"
 whrpol.1.d: "The troubled birth of the Belarusian People's Republic, although still commonly referred to as White Ruthenia, took place in the backdrop of the Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War. When the German Army entered Minsk in February 1918, they were largely unaware of the peoples that lived in the region, assuming the East Slavic people there were merely Russians under an old Polish aristocracy. In their defence, the Belarusian National Revival had only begun in the 1890s and was largely restricted to a small, but growing, urban intelligentsia, and the first Belarusian political party, the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, commonly called the Hramada, was only founded in 1903.\n\nNevertheless, the Germans were quick to exploit the unfolding situation as they steadily delegated powers to the Belarusian National Council, or Rada, from 1918 onwards. Having witnessed the Bolsheviks forcefully disband the All-Belarusian Congress merely two months before their arrival, the German Army saw a way to weaken Russian, and therefore Bolshevik, power in the region, and limit Polish influence in Eastern Europe by supporting the creation of a White Ruthenian state, albeit under close German supervision.\n\nThe independence of White Ruthenia would be recognised through the Treaty of Minsk in 1920, although its borders were far smaller than the Rada had hoped as the Germans favoured a more defensible border on the Dnieper and Dvina. While this was met with disappointment by Belarusian nationalists, they had no way to press their claims. Nevertheless, it curbed the BNR's ambitions to a more manageable area, for it was clear to even the staunchest nationalist that Belarusian national identity was weak and the Republic had limited popular support.\n\nIn late 1920, the Rada ceded its powers to the promised Constituent Assembly, which adopted a constitution and held elections to the Sojm, the parliament of the People's Republic. Since then, the government has been dominated by the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party, formed in 1918 as the Hramada splintered over the question of collaboration with Germany. The BSDP then reformed the Hramada as the Belarusian Peasants' and Worker's Union, a centre-left and leftist electoral bloc. Under their leadership, the new Hramada moulded the BNR as a progressive state focused on creating a more solid Belarusian national identity and combatting illiteracy by greatly expanding education and cultural institutions.\n\nThe future looked bright for Belarus, but clouds are gathering on the horizon."
 whrpol.1.a: "Žyćcio Respubliki svajej!"

 whrpol.2.t: "The Necessity of Reform"
 whrpol.2.d: "The Social-Democrats take great pride in their nation-building achievements, creating one of the most progressive nations in Eastern Europe. However, one of the main concerns in the mind of Belarusians during the foundation of the People's Republic was land reform. Belarusians were, for the most part, merely landless peasants, and most of the land was owned by Polish or, to a smaller extent, Russian aristocrats, which was seen as the greatest impediment to Belarusian nation-building and economic prosperity. Nowadays, most of the land is finally in the hands of Belarusian smallholders, but there are still many landless peasants and many hectares of land owned by \"foreign\" aristocrats or one of the two churches in the country. For many, it is clear that Plan Sierada, the informal name of the land reform program, has stalled since its first year after passing the Sojm, and many have grown frustrated by the lack of progress as the Ministry of Agriculture quickly ran out of funds as they compensate former landowners during the ownership transfer.\n\nWhile the majority of the BSDP insists that progress has been steady, there is growing internal opposition not only within the Hramada, but the leading party itself. As the party internally debates how to help finalise the Plan, it remains to be seen whether they will decide on an increased budget or something far more radical as many within the party are calling for with increasing support."
 whrpol.2.a: "Smallholding is the future of land ownership."

 whrpol.3.t: "The Sierada Report"
 whrpol.3.d: "The need for land reform in Belarus has been recognised for decades. The landowning class in the country has been overwhelmingly Polish or Russian, with the former having by far the biggest share, while the majority of ethnic Belarusians were peasants, few of them owning the land they worked. This led to considerable class tensions up to the Weltkrieg, especially as the national consciousness of the Belarusian people began to grow in the lead-up to the Weltkrieg. As such, as a way to cement the creation of Belarusian national identity, uplift the peasantry from crippling poverty, and weaken the power of the landed gentry, land reform has been part of the political programs of most political parties.\n\nHowever, it would prove easier said than done. While the radical left (and, increasingly, the radical right as well) has long preached for the seizure and redistribution of land by the government, the Social-Democratic Party has not been willing to do so without the consent or compensating the previous owners, believing it would destabilise the young country and bring the ire of our German allies. As such, after roughly a decade since it was launched, Plan Sierada, named after the People's Minister for Agriculture behind it, has been of mixed success and remains incomplete.\n\nIn his report, People's Minister Jan Sierada has highlighted the land reform's successes, especially in its first year, and has pointed to limited funding for compensations as the major hindrance, especially as an increasing amount of the government's budget moved towards its industrialisation plan. Nonetheless, Sierada concludes that the land reform program will be completed before 1939, earlier with extra funding, while emphasising that compensation to landowners have had a net positive effect as they invested in different economic sectors."
 whrpol.3.a: "Peasants are the backbone of our nation."

 whrpol.4.t: "Congress of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union"
 whrpol.4.d: "With the collapse of the German economy fresh in their minds, the delegates from the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party, the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, and the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries have assembled to discuss the future of Plan Sierada. The Socialist-Revolutionaries have long criticised the plan as reactionary and far too forgiving to the \"foreign\" landowners. Compensating for all the lands redistributed has been a massive state expense which the budget has struggled to handle, with cuts largely responsible for the Plan's slowed progress. The left-wing of the BSDP, informally led by Prime Minister Symon Rak-Mihailovski, have taken the same position as the BPS-R, and even President Taraškievič has begun to consider a radical change of plans.\n\nJan Sierada, People's Minister for Agriculture and a member of the BPS-F, has tirelessly defended his Plan both within the Hramada and at the Sojm, and believes a budget increase will be more than enough to get it back on track. Informal leader of the BSDP's right-wing, Anton Lutskevich, has warned that a radical course would alienate their German ally, already cautious of the Hramada's open socialist leaning, and fears that they would support reactionary elements in the People's Army and Sojm against them should they adopt a dangerous \"Bolshevik\" plan.\n\nThe future direction of the Hramada belongs to centrists of the BSDP, who will tip the favour between Sierada's moderate proposal, or succumb to the Socialist-Revolutionary's pressure and their populist rhetoric."
 whrpol.4.a: "The BSDP leadership resists radical pressure."
 whrpol.4.b: "No more compensation for landowners!"

 whrpol.5.t: "Illiteracy"
 whrpol.5.d: "The Belarusian lands have struggled with abysmal literacy rates ranging from 10 to 20% in the census of 1897, putting the nation at a serious disadvantage in their efforts to create a Belarusian nation. It wouldn't be until 1918, under the direction of the BNR Rada and with German support did the literacy rate of the country begin to improve through the manifold expansion of the school system. Despite the delay caused by the switch to the Latin alphabet in 1926, the People's Ministry of Education reported a 36% literacy rate that year, and this year it was approaching the 50% milestone. Despite the clear progress, illiteracy remains a clear impediment to our nation's development culturally, economically, and scientifically."
 whrpol.5.a: "Just build more schools, fool!"

 whrpol.6.t: "Sojm in Deadlock"
 whrpol.6.d: "Angered by the government's handling of Plan Sierada, the opposition in the Sojm, members of either the National Democratic Association or Lastouski's Kryvian Party, have teamed up with dissidents within the Hramada to delay further legislation. While the opposition on its own is too weak to topple the government and call for elections, their delays created a tense situation in parliament. As the session was adjourned yesterday, numerous insults had been thrown around, and there were rumours that both the BSDP and the Hramada was on the verge of collapse while many people in Minsk have witnessed increased activity at the House of the People's Army and the German embassy."
 whrpol.6.a: "Things will settle down soon enough, right?"

 whrpol.7.t: "The Coup"
 whrpol.7.d: "Many of Minsk's residents woke up this morning to soldiers patrolling the streets, ordering people to stay home. In front of Government House, where Sojm sessions are held, an armoured car and a platoon of soldiers watch over Independence Square, while the capital's radio stations were also occupied and interrupted regular transmission. Later in the morning, the First National Station broadcasted a message by Radaslau Astrouski, Sojm delegate for the BSDP. Astrouski announced that Taraškievič's government had been deposed by the army for collusion with \"foreign, syndicalist elements\", planning to subvert the deadlocked Sojm through a revolution. Furthermore, he announced that the presidency and the Council of People's Minister were replaced by a new temporary authority, the Belarusian Central Council, or Central Rada, with himself as its chairman. After the composition of the Rada was declared, he ended the message by issuing the order to arrest Taraškievič and other members of the former government for high treason.\n\nWhile all roads going in and out of Minsk had military checkpoints by noon, it was clear that all members of the former government had avoided arrest and had fled the city. White Ruthenia appeared on the path of civil war."
 whrpol.7.a: "We must save Belarus from syndicalism!"

 whrpol.8.t: "The Rump Sojm"
 whrpol.8.d: "Chairman Astrouski has found himself in an uncomfortable position. Practically no fellow members of the BSDP have accepted his call for support and national unity against the syndicalist threat despite having assured his army backers that he would rally at least the right-wing of the party behind him. At this point, his Central Rada is proving to be an embarrassing failure.\n\nThis situation has driven Astrouski to approach other parties in the Sojm, which has, thus far, not been recalled since the start of the coup. Specifically, Astrouski is hoping to gain the support of the National Democratic Association consisting of Raman Skirmunt's People's Party and Adam Stankievič's Christian Democracy. With their support, the Central Rada would gain the legitimacy it needs to function as the Hramada has entered a state of open revolt in the countryside.\n\nIn meeting with its leaders, Chairman Astrouski offered key positions to National Democrats within the Central Rada and promised the restoration of the Sojm as soon as possible- excluding \"treasonous\" Hramada members, of course- in exchange for support for a new constitution and against \"syndicalist rebels\". The Christian Democrats are particularly reluctant to cooperate, seeing the coup as illegitimate and a terrible legal precedent, but their concerns over letting the military rule alone or, perhaps worse, letting Lastouski's Kryvians gain power, may convince them to side with the Central Rada."
 whrpol.8.a: "The NDA support the Central Rada."
 whrpol.8.b: "Astrouski fails to gain their support."

 whrpol.9.t: "Sojm Passes New Budget"
 whrpol.9.d: "As agreed through the latest Hramada congress, the People's Minister of Agriculture, Jan Sierada, presented a new, expanded budget for the stalled land reform program. With the lukewarm support of the left secured at the congress, the bill passed with relative ease as it was supported by the National Democratic Association. Opposition to the bill was largely left to the Kryvians that argued, as the left-wing had within the Hramada before them, it was still too lenient towards landowners. However, their opposition proved fairly weak, and Lastouski, leader of the Kryvians, acquiesced that the new bill would help support peasants threatened by Germany's economic crisis.\n\nLeftist papers \"Bielaruskaja Dumka\" was mildly critical of the BPS-R's support of the bill, reserving their harsh judgement on Lastouski, himself a former member of that party until 1920. In their opinion, Lastouski's opposition to the bill was disingenuous and merely a ploy to co-opt leftists to his reactionary movement. Lastouski himself, though his paper \"Kryvich\", was quick to retort, accusing the BPS-R of abandoning their core support base and continuing to \"sell out\" to internationalism instead of helping develop the Belarusian-Kryvian nation.\n\nEither way, it appears the radicals on both sides are wasting their venom on each other, letting us focus on work that will actually benefit the people."
 whrpol.9.a: "Let them bicker; the people await action, not words."

 whrpol.10.t: "Battle of Borisov"
 whrpol.10.d: "Seventy-four kilometres north-east of Minsk, on the banks of the Berezina river, lay the city of Borisov, one of the largest in the region except Minsk. In order to secure the region around the capital, Borisov had to be secured, and the People's Army marched in for that purpose. There was little resistance from syndicalist rebels and the city was secured within a day."
 whrpol.10.a: "The capital is now safe."

 whrpol.11.t: "Battle of [1087.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 whrpol.11.d: "[1087.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], by the Russian border, is one of the most important and industrialised cities in White Ruthenia. As expected, syndicalist resistance there was fierce. Nevertheless, our troops successfully secured the city once the steel mill and the automobile plant were secured. Enemy partisans have fled to the countryside, but it will be a matter of time before they are mopped up."
 whrpol.11.a: "Another key city secured."

 whrpol.12.t: "Battle of [207.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 whrpol.12.d: "[207.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and its lakes lay in the northern corner of the country and, other than securing border crossings, is rather unremarkable. The army encountered little resistance in the province, and the northern border crossings will block a potential escape route into Lithuania for syndicalists."
 whrpol.12.a: "The troops are now enjoying the lakeside beaches."

 whrpol.13.t: "Battle of [95.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 whrpol.13.d: "The city of [95.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] rests at an important location at the confluence of the Pripyat and Pina rivers. The region is known for its marshes and is not only very difficult for armies to pass, but a prime location for partisans. As expected, with the city itself a stronghold of the BSDP and the Jewish Bund, resistance was particularly fierce. Once the city was secured, numerous excesses from our troops have been reported as they took out their anger at the majority-Jewish population. Punishments were quickly dealt once discipline was restored, but it is now clear that underlying ethnic tensions have reached a breaking point."
 whrpol.13.a: "We must limit violence against civilians!"

 whrpol.14.t: "Battle of [204.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 whrpol.14.d: "The region around [204.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] contains some of the few industries in the country. As expected, the syndicalists put up fierce resistance around factories and public buildings. Nevertheless, our troops eventually overpowered them and the rebels fled west, presumably into the countryside or Lithuania. Now, however, many important border crossings are in our hands, which should limit the ability for rebels to flee the country."
 whrpol.14.a: "Another key region in our hands."

 whrpol.15.t: "Battle of [194.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 whrpol.15.d: "The region around [194.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has seen rapid economic development in recent history, containing a number of food-processing and salt extraction plants. Once our troops secured the factories, the syndicalist rebels melted into the countryside, with some presumably fleeing into Ukraine."
 whrpol.15.a: "The south is secured."

 whrpol.16.t: "Approaching the Bundist Moderates"
 whrpol.16.d: "Our relationship with the Jewish Labour Bund has always been symbiotic, that said, the leadership of the Bund is afraid of sweeping changes to the existing status quo, changes that we intend to initiate. That said, the younger members of the Bund have grown up during the official political partnership between us and the Bund and as a result, are much more receptive to us and our reforms. So, to gain the support of the Bund, we intend to give our full support and endorsement to these younger moderate members of the Bund, in hopes that they'll gain more influence within the Bund and eventually take it over, ensuring a more friendly Bund as we implement our many reforms."
 whrpol.16.a: "Best of luck to these young moderates!"

 whrpol.17.t: "Moderates take over the Bund"
 whrpol.17.d: "Our gamble has paid off, under the risk of jeopardising our partnership with the Jewish Labour Bund, we endorsed an effort by young moderate members of the Bund to take over the leadership from the Old Guard. These moderates are much more closely aligned to our government and have proven to be more receptive to our ideas of reform. That said, the chaos within the Bund has undermined the work lives of many Jewish workers, though we believe that things should return to normal given enough time."
 whrpol.17.a: "Excellent"

 whrpol.18.t: "Negotiating with the Bund Leadership"
 whrpol.18.d: "The support and aid of the Jewish Labour Bund are instrumental to our hegemony over the Sojm and by extension the stability of the government, so the consensus goes that we have to reach a compromise with the Bund leadership in order to gain their support for our economics reforms and reinforce our partnership."
 whrpol.18.a: "Hopefully it all goes well..."

 whrpol.19.t: "The Bund Puts Forward Demands"
 whrpol.19.d: "The Bund, realising that they have the upper hand in the negotiations, have put forward several demands, while most are minor and can be met with no issue, one other demand has stuck out like a sore thumb upon review by the Sojm, a demand of Bundist "autonomy" within the economy, in other words, that we should exempt Bundist workers from the harshest government regulations. This caused an uproar on the left and right, with the right accusing the Jews of making the government their puppet while the left accuses the government of prioritising one labour organisation over the others. That said, we are not in the position to abandon negotiations, as doing that will practically destroy our partnership with the Bund and severely endanger our ability to govern the Sojm."
 whrpol.19.a: "Outrageous, but we can't end negotiations"

 whrpol.20.t: "Negotiations with the Bund are a Success!"
 whrpol.20.d: "What was thought to be an impossible task has become a success! Our representatives report that we have reached a conclusive agreement with the leadership of the Jewish Labour Bund regarding their support for our many reforms, while submitting to the Bund's demands was a hard pill to swallow for some, the benefits cannot be denied, as we have essentially re-enforced our alliance with the Bund going forward and their support for the government is guaranteed."
 whrpol.20.a: "Glad to have the Bund's support!"

 whrpol.21.t: "Kryvians Unrest in Minsk"
 whrpol.21.d: "With Chairman Astrouski failing to gather support from the rest of the Sojm, Lastouski's Kryvians, forming the third bloc in the Sojm, have suddenly increased their activities in Minsk. Particularly, the Union of Belarusian Youth has led numerous demonstrations across the cities and in other urban areas of the country in opposition to the coup. Lastouski himself has been gathering support from the Belarusian Scientific Society and the Academy of Sciences with the disappearance of many BSDP members of those organisations. Perhaps more worryingly, it appears that the army's support for Astrouski has already waned considerably and there are rumours they are willing to support the charismatic Lastouski instead, apparently under pressure from the German embassy."
 whrpol.21.a: "This is bad!"

 whrpol.22.t: "Lastouski's Putsch"
 whrpol.22.d: "With support for the Central Rada collapsing, Lastouski made his move. Leading a procession of supporters and members of the Union of Belarusian Youth, the head of the Kryvian movement marched into Government House in Minsk, with soldiers letting the marchers in without any resistance. With the army and the Germans abandoned him, Astrouski had already fled the building before Lastouski's arrival, and the Kryvians quickly proclaimed the Central Rada deposed and the formation of a new Council of People's Ministers. Lastouski was proclaimed interim President and Chairman of the Council through a radio address, which included promises to restore the Constitution and the Sojm, though it remains to be seen who will be allowed to sit or if elections will be held. What is known is that Lastouski has promised to rid Belarus of its \"Russian-hypnosis\" once and for all and lead the revival of the Belarusian nation into its purest form, as Kryvians."
 whrpol.22.a: "Long live the Kryvich State!"

 whrpol.23.t: "Astrouski's Government'"
 whrpol.23.d: "With negotiations with the National Democratic Association successful, Chairman Astrouski has been able to legitimise his Central Rada and ease the worries from the military. A new government has been formed, with support from both the army and the German military mission. It appears it will only be a matter of time before the remnants of the former government will be silenced and resistance in the countryside suppressed."
 whrpol.23.a: "White Ruthenia will be free of syndicalism."

 whrpol.24.t: "The General Jewish Labour Bund and the BNR"
 whrpol.24.d: "Within the current borders of the Belarusian People's Republic reside around half a million Jews, with another half a million within its claimed territory. From the revolutionary times of the Weltkrieg and since, the Jewish population of the country has been deeply involved in Belarusian nation-building, and every urban area in the country has a significant, if not majority, Jewish population. Nowadays, the dominant organisation representing Jews and Jewish interests is the General Jewish Labour Bund, or simply Bund.\n\nThe Bund is a progressive organisation heavily inspired by Austrian social-democracy. Their program of Jewish autonomism, inspired by the Austromarxist Personal Principle, hopes to achieve self-rule and cultural autonomy wherever the Diaspora resides without resorting to the creation of a Jewish state. They have been successful in making the Personal Principle enshrined into the Constitution and the adoption of Yiddish as an official language alongside Belarusian, and have been longtime partners of the Social-Democratic Party as part of the Peasants' and Workers' Union. Their opposition within the Jewish community, Labour Zionists and Folkists, have been significantly marginalised since the 1920s.\n\nThe alliance between the BSDP and the Bund has proven to be a powerful force in Belarusian politics. However, despite their best efforts, antisemitism remains rampant in the country, and the rapid growth of the far-right Kryvians has made the Bund uneasy."
 whrpol.24.a: "Together against reaction and antisemitism."

 whrpol.25.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
 whrpol.25.d: "One of the fundamentals of being a democratic state is to hold elections every couple of years to let the people express their opinion on the government and a myriad of issues. This year is no different and the elections of [GetYear] are upon us. While many parties are vying for power across the country, everyone expects the BSDP to be able to smoothly sail to yet another electoral victory."
 whrpol.25.a: "The BSDP wins again!"

 whrpol.26.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
 whrpol.26.d: "One of the fundamentals of being a democratic state is to hold elections every couple of years to let the people express their opinion on the government and a myriad of issues. This year is no different and the elections of [GetYear] are upon us. While many parties are vying for power across the country, the only blocs with a viable chance at victory are the BSDP-led Hramada and the right-wing National Democratic Association, a coalition of Christian democrats and liberals hoping to oust the BSDP led by Adam Stankievic and Raman Skirmunt. The polls have closed and the winner is..."
 whrpol.26.a: "The BSDP wins yet again!"
 whrpol.26.b: "The NDA pulls an upset!"

 whrpol.27.t: "Elections Postponed"
 whrpol.27.d: "With our country at war, the elections that were supposed to be held today have been postponed until further notice. The government has promised to hold the elections at the first opportunity after this national emergency has been dealt with."
 whrpol.27.a: "Sad, but understandable."

 whrpol.28.t: "Kanstancin Jezavitau Defects"
 whrpol.28.d: "General Jezavitau, the highest-ranking officer of the People's Army since the death of Kipryjan Kandratovič in 1932, has defected to the Hramadist rebels. As he was a long-time member of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, the moderates of the Hramada, this doesn't come as a surprise, but our inability to arrest him or convince him to stay loyal has deeply hurt the credibility of the newly-founded Central Rada. This event was not ignored by the German military mission, whose leader, Werner Kempf, has openly threatened Astrouski that if he doesn't restore control of the situation soon, then the German Army would do it instead and take direct control of all military affairs in the country."
 whrpol.28.a: "Bloody socialist."

 whrpol.29.t: "Werner Kempf Takes Control"
 whrpol.29.d: "As the Central Rada failed to defeat the rebels on their own, the German military mission began their own \"anti-partisan operation\" in White Ruthenia. In the process, however, they have taken direct control of all military forces and affairs in the country, with Werner Kempf becoming the virtual military dictator over the country with the creation of the Generalgouvernement Minsk. Astrouski's Central Rada maintains control of civilian affairs but has effectively become subordinate to Governor-General Kempf. This is a serious humiliation and White Ruthenia has lost significant sovereignty in the process."
 whrpol.29.a: "Are we truly that useless without Germany...?"

 whrpol.30.t: "Government Flees to Lithuania"
 whrpol.30.d: "With most of the country under enemy occupation, the government of [WHR.GetNameDef] have fled to the city of [GetGrodnoName] under friendly Lithuanian hands. The city has a significant Belarusian population and the government hopes that, with Lithuanian and German help, they can continue the fight from there until the country can be liberated. As it seems, the fates of Lithuanians and Belarusians are once again intertwined."
 whrpol.30.a: "This feels familiar somehow."

 whrpol.31.t: "[WHR.GetAdjective] Government Flees to [GetGrodnoName]"
 whrpol.31.d: "With most of the country under enemy occupation, the government of [WHR.GetNameDef] have fled to the city of [GetGrodnoName] under friendly Lithuanian hands. The city has a significant Belarusian population and the government hopes that, with Lithuanian and German help, they can continue the fight from there until the country can be liberated. As it seems, the fates of Lithuanians and Belarusians are once again intertwined."
 whrpol.31.a: "Together, we will repel the invaders."

 whrpol.32.t: "A Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation?"
 whrpol.32.d: "The invasion of our lands and our exile in Lithuania has only proven one thing: We cannot defend our country alone. The Lithuanian government has decided to revive an old proposal: A federation of our two nations, just as it was before the partitions of the Commonwealth. The idea had been briefly revived during the Weltkrieg, but was ultimately shelved from lack of interest in the governments of Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany. Perhaps now is the time to consolidate our efforts in order to better defend ourselves from invaders, but many decry the idea that we are trading our independence for security."
 whrpol.32.a: "Only together can we find peace."
 whrpol.32.b: "We can never give up our independence."

 whrpol.33.t: "Lithuania and [WHR.GetNameDef] Seek Unification"
 whrpol.33.d: "With the [WHR.GetAdjective] government ousted by invaders, they and the Lithuanian governments are considering an old idea: A federation of their two nations. The idea had been briefly revived during the Weltkrieg but was ultimately shelved from lack of interest. Now that everyone involved is very aware that the [WHR.GetAdjective] government cannot stand on its own, the idea is being considered once again. As the protector of both nations, we have the final say in the matter: Allow them to unify and form a more cohesive defence of our eastern frontier, or keep them divided and weak so that they cannot possibly threaten our regional hegemony in the future."
 whrpol.33.a: "Consolidating them will ease defence matters."
 whrpol.33.b: "They must remain divided."

 whrpol.34.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Federation Proposal"
 whrpol.34.d: "Just like during the Weltkrieg, the idea of a Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation has been rejected. The project will be shelved once more."
 whrpol.34.a: "Shame."

 whrpol.35.t: "Formation of the Lithuanian-Belarusian Federation"
 whrpol.35.d: "With the [WHR.GetAdjective] and German governments in agreement, we have proceeded with the revived plan to unify the two nations that once made up the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Belarusians will, of course, be granted significant autonomy in this arrangement, while the status of Lithuania itself remains unchanged. This will hopefully make us more capable of defending the region from invaders."
 whrpol.35.a: "The legacy of the Grand Duchy lives on."

 whrpol.36.t: "Łastoŭski's Speech"
 whrpol.36.d: "With the Belarusian government exiled to Lithuania as their lands are overrun by our common enemy, Belarusian politician Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski was invited to today's session of the Seimas to speak, with the hope of increasing relations between our two nations.\n\nWhile known as a radical Belarusian nationalist, Łastoŭski clearly has great sympathies towards the Lithuanian nation and, in his speech, repeatedly extolled Lithuania, its people, the shared history and culture of our nations, and, perhaps more importantly, our shared enemies. With his homeland overrun, he called for the Lithuanian nation to carry the mantle of the old Grand Duchy and help towards the liberation of Belarus. Perhaps more surprisingly, he also called for much closer ties, to the point of suggesting a union, in order to avoid Lithuania and Belarus from falling to foreign enemies once more.\n\nHis speech closed with a final cry for unity: \"Long live the brotherly union of Lithuanian and Belarusian Peoples!\""
 whrpol.36.a: "The brotherly union, hm?"

 whrpol.37.t: "Minsk Offers Peace"
 whrpol.37.d: "With the collapse of the German Empire, it is clear that our [WHR.GetAdjective] enemies have found themselves in deep trouble. Without their protector, they are now vulnerable from a counter-attack by our forces. However, an emissary from [WHR.GetNameDef] has arrived with an interesting offer: A separate peace between our nations.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume, the diplomat argues, that even though they have become diplomatically isolated, he has made it clear that his government are already approaching the Third Internationale for support, seemingly confident that his government, full of sympathisers for Paris and London, can make a convincing appeal to the Syndicalist world now that they have \"broken their chains\" from Berlin. More importantly, he is convinced that further hostilities will only create more unnecessary bloodshed and countless more thousands dead Russians and Belarusians. As such, his government offers not only peace between Belarus and Russia, but also to turn their arms against the remnants of the Reichspakt, in exchange for the formal transfer of \"rightfully Belarusian\" lands.\n\nWe have little doubt that we can crush them eventually, but the idea that we can avoid having to carve a bloody path to Minsk in exchange of some borderlands is one that we may want to consider, especially if their claims of International support is true. Depending on the situation on the front, however, we may be able to insist on a better deal. The ethnic situation in Krichev and Vitebsk are fairly clear, but much less so in Smolensk, which they also claim. Of course, we can also insist on the pre-war status quo."
 whrpol.37.a: "Very well. We can focus on more important fronts this way."
 whrpol.37.b: "We can agree with ceding Krichev and Vitebsk, but Smolensk is Russian!"
 whrpol.37.c: "We will only accept the Status Quo Ante Bellum."
 whrpol.37.e: "Reject the offer outright."

 whrpol.38.t: "The Russian Counter-Offer"
 whrpol.38.d_split: "The [RUS.GetName] has taken interest in our offer of a separate peace, but feel that our demands are too extreme. Specifically, they consider the city of Smolensk to be a core Russian city and refuse to consider ceding it. This does implicitly mean that our claims to the cities of Vitebsk and Krichev are recognised by the Russians and gives us a good chance to reclaim the majority of Belarusian-inhabited lands that were stuck under Russian rule."
 whrpol.38.d_statusquo: "The Russian response to our offer of a separate peace was lukewarm to say the least. While they are willing to accept our independence, they refuse any territorial changes and demand the return to the pre-war status quo. This would mean that the blood shed by Belarusians would be largely for naught, but it may be the only way to save our nation from a potentially-deadly Russian counter-offensive."
 whrpol.38.a: "Very well."
 whrpol.38.b: "It's all or nothing. No peace!"

 whrpol.39.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
 whrpol.39.d: "Negotiations between Belarus and Russia have broken down, unable to find a middle ground acceptable to both parties. There will be no separate peace between the two nations, making intervention from the Third Internationale unlikely."
 whrpol.39.a: "..."

 whrpol.40.t: "Negotiations Successful!"
 whrpol.40.d: "The Russians have accepted our offer; there will be peace between our nations. That is, assuming we can convince the Third Internationale that our membership in the Reichspakt was nothing but a pragmatic ploy to secure the foundations of a socialist state under Berlin's nose forced upon us by imperialist powers."
 whrpol.40.a: "Surely, President Taraškievič won't fail us."

 whrpol.41.t: "Belarus Breaks its Chains?"
 whrpol.41.d: "With the fall of the perfidious German Empire, it hasn't taken long before Eastern Europe fell into chaos without their imperialist protector. One important case is the Belarusian People's Republic, led by a string of social-democratic governments since 1925. An emissary from Minsk arrived today with not only a peace offer from his government, but for Belarus to turn their arms against the remnants of the Reichspakt.\n\nThe diplomat quickly pleaded his case: The Belarusian Social-Democratic Party has always been working towards the establishment of a socialist state in their corner of Europe, having finally freed themselves from Russian imperialism, then from the foreign, enemy class of Polish noblemen. The emissary insists that their alignment with the German Empire was never their choice and merely a pragmatic ruse to build socialism under their very noses until their poor, under-developed country was ready for a revolution, else it would be squashed by the imperialist Germans or by the reactionaries of Russia that refuse to even recognise their nationhood.\n\nIt is up to us to decide whether we can trust these supposed revolutionaries-in-disguise and offer them our support and protection. Our response here will decide if we can secure an ally in Eastern Europe or if the Russians will begin their counter-offensive against the remnants of the Reichspakt."
 whrpol.41.a: "We welcome all free peoples of Europe!"
 whrpol.41.b: "Never! These crypto-plutocrats are worse than capitalists!"

 whrpol.42.t: "Belarus Joins the International"
 whrpol.42.d: "Our offer has been accepted by the revolutionaries of Europe and we have been accepted into the Third Internationale. Of course, there are caveats in this deal, as we have to quickly prove that we are indeed a true revolutionary regime ourselves.\n\nAn emergency session of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Hramada was held, formally sanctioning the government's plan to make peace with the International and make efforts to join them. This was quickly followed by an emergency of the Sojm, rapidly passing a set of laws formally renouncing our ties with the fallen German Empire and announcing the government's intention to re-align the nation with the Syndicalist powers. Finally, a resolution was passed calling for the creation of a constitutional committee and the Sojm's dissolution."
 whrpol.42.a: "The Belarusian Revolution enters a new stage!"

 whrpol.43.t: "Denied by the Third Internationale"
 whrpol.43.d: "With the Third Internationale refusing our offer, we remain at war, humiliated and isolated diplomatically. The Belarusian People's Republic will fight to the end."
 whrpol.43.a: "This is deeply embarrassing..."

 whrpol.44.t: "Belarus Abandoned"
 whrpol.44.d: "Despite their best efforts, the illegitimate Belarusian government was unable to back their threats up once it was clear that the Third Internationale was unwilling to support them. Our agreement with them is to be considered null-and-void, with hostilities to resume immediately."
 whrpol.44.a: "We will march into Minsk after all."

 whrpol.45.t: "Peace with Belarus"
 whrpol.45.d: "As per our agreement with the Belarusian government, a peace treaty was signed, officially mediated by the Third Internationale, who also signed a treaty with the so-called Belarusian People's Republic. Belarus is now to be considered part of the Syndicalist sphere, but we will not have to sacrifice any more Russians for useless marshlands and forests."
 whrpol.45.a: "So be it."

 whrpol.46.t: "Anti-Government Protests"
 whrpol.46.d: "The response to the final resolutions adopted before the dissolution of the Sojm has been controversial. The opposition is openly decrying it as unconstitutional and consider it a blatant self-coup and there have been protests in the streets. This was followed by counter-protests by faithful workers and peasants, which has led to clashes in Minsk and Mogilev. The army has stepped in to restore order in some places, ensuring that the situation did not escalate further, but it is clear that our swift decision will take some time to be accepted by some segments of the population."
 whrpol.46.a: "They will accept the revolution soon enough."

 whrpol.47.t: "A Formal Request from [WHR.GetNameDef]"
 whrpol.47.d: "With the peace settled and our European hegemony more secured than ever, our loyal ally on what was once the eastern frontier of Mitteleuropa we usually call White Ruthenia, has made a formal request through their embassy in Berlin. For most of the interwar period, the Belarusians have been dependent on our protection and economic power to rise itself from a backwater to a nation, as they claim, equal to the rest of Europe. With their eastern claims secured and Russian threat all but destroyed, the [WHR.GetAdjective] ambassador believes that a new relationship between our nations should be considered. Specifically, one between two free nations rather than protector and vassal.\n\nIn short, the [WHR.GetAdjective] government is hoping to attain full independence within the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa, ending their unofficial status as a puppet state of the German Empire, as a reward for loyalty throughout this bloody conflict. As there is no reason for [WHR.GetNameDef] to break away from the Reichspakt, with their loyalty thoroughly proven, there really is no reason for us to maintain a leash on them, and it would make them even more grateful for our role in their liberation. On the other hand, hardliners that have the Kaiser's ear are livid that they have the gall to make such a proposition in the first place, as their very existence is due to German goodwill."
 whrpol.47.a: "Very well. Ludendorff would be happy to see this moment."
 whrpol.47.b: "Of course not. Ungrateful Slavs..."

 whrpol.48.t: "Independence!"
 whrpol.48.d: "The German government has gratefully accepted our request. While we remain in the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa, our relationship with Germany has become far less one-sided with the signature of a new commercial treaty and the shrinking in size of the German military mission. Our claims as an independent nation has never rung truer than now!"
 whrpol.48.a: "Žyćcio Respubliki svajej!"

 whrpol.49.t: "Request Denied"
 whrpol.49.d: "For some god-forsaken reason, the German government has plainly refused our request for more independence. As it seems, loyalty's rewards are far more limited than we expected."
 whrpol.49.a: "Bastards..."

 whrpol.50.t: "An Offer from Moscow"
 whrpol.50.d: "Today, a top secret message has reached the government in Minsk, in the form of an unmarked envelope delivered by a single un-uniformed courier, who left immediately after arriving. As soon as the letter and its potential consequences were comprehended, the necessity of the covert nature of its delivery was obvious.\n\nThe letter was marked with all the official seals of the [SOV.GetAdjective] government, and signed in [SOV.GetLeader]'s own hand, so there was no doubt to its veracity. Amid the carefully worded opening statements involving common socialist ideals, history and heritage, the initial subtext was made more explicit in the final words. The new Russian socialist regime has been successful in their second civil war, and have begun to look the future, and it is in our direction.\n\nWithout giving further dates and details, they infer that if the Reichspakt happened to come into a state of war with the Internationale, then they would be willing to accept us into their alliance, to fight against the Germans together. This arrangement comes with the guarantee of a high level of autonomy, greater than we have now, but would ultimately mean that we more or less remain a subject nation, albeit with the Russians as our overlords rather than the Germans. The other conditions would be that we fully adopt a socialist form of government, and, significantly, the Russians have promised us full and immediate control of the lands of [243.GetName] and [755.GetName] upon the outbreak of war.\n\nTaraškievič has shared these plans with only his most senior cabinet members, for fear of whistle-blowers. All agree that the Russians seem sincere in this offer, but the question is, would it be worth it?"
 whrpol.50.a: "An interesting proposal..."
 whrpol.50.b: "Russia should not be trusted."

 whrpol.51.t: "[WHR.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 whrpol.51.d: "In a surprisingly bluntly worded letter, [WHR.GetLeader] has promised that, if and when the time arrives, he and his people will turn on their overlords, and stand at our side against the reactionaries.\n\nThe promise of greater autonomy under us, a government with much more ideological and cultural similarities to them compared to the Germans, proved far too much for them. And all it will cost us is a couple of forests."
 whrpol.51.a: "The Ostwall has already fallen,\nand Germany doesn't know it."

 whrpol.52.t: "[WHR.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 whrpol.52.d: "[WHR.GetNameDef] has told us in no uncertain terms, that even if they believed that we would follow through with our agreement, they do not put too much hope in how successful our potential military campaign would be against the might of the Ostwall.\n\nIt appears we will have to bring socialism to our wayward brethren the old-fashioned way."
 whrpol.52.a: "It was expected."

 whrpol.53.t: "Time to Choose"
 whrpol.53.d: "As war dawns once again on Europe, Taraškievič knows that the time has come for his final decision, on whether or not to follow through on the previous agreement with the Russians.\n\nDoes he lead his country to side with the Internationale, to socialism, and to further autonomy with more of his nation united under the [WHR.GetAdjective] government? Or does he stay true to the Germans, who have tolerated and supported his rule so far?"
 whrpol.53.a: "Follow through on the secret pact."
 whrpol.53.b: "Stay loyal to Germany."

 whrpol.54.t: "Russia Occupies White Ruthenia!"
 whrpol.54.d: "The unthinkable has occurred! The White Ruthenian government, lead by [WHR.GetLeader], has formally defected from the Reichspakt, and sided with the [SOV.GetName].\n\nIt was from Russian control that we gave them their precious autonomy that they craved after the Weltkrieg, but seemingly their attempted nation-building since has been for naught, as it is back to the blasted Russians that they have crawled.\n\nThey will have an example made of them, along with the others."
 whrpol.54.a: "Traitors!"

 whrpol.55.t: "Formation of the [FROM.GetAdjective] Autonomy"
 whrpol.55.d: "The [WHR.GetAdjective] government has formally declared war on the German Empire and the Reichspakt, and joined the Third Internationale as an Autonomous region of the [SOV.GetName].\n\nThe recent onset of war has meant that the physical handover of governmental authority, and responsibility for administration of [243.GetName] and [755.GetName], was over within a matter of minutes, without ceremony. However, the fact remains that we have gained valuable and small new ally, ever closer to the heart of Germany's rotten empire."
 whrpol.55.a: "Excellent."

 whrpol.56.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Breaks the Deal"
 whrpol.56.d: "Despite his utmost assurances on the deal that we had previously brokered, long before the onset of conflict, [WHR.GetLeader] has reneged on his promise to us.\n\nWe had agreed for the [WHR.GetAdjective] people to join the Internationale, with the promise of continued autonomy, and even some of our own territory, if it meant they would leave the Reichspakt and declare war on the Germans. No such events have happened, and all communication with Minsk has been met with silence.\n\nWith this all being ignored, it seems we will have to bring them socialism the old-fashioned way."
 whrpol.56.a: "Not unexpected."

 whrpol.57.t: "Betrayal in the Reichspakt"
 whrpol.57.d: "White Ruthenia, Germany's small Ostwall puppet state, has defected to the Internationale.\n\nConservative critics of the quasi-syndicalist [WHR.GetAdjective] government, previously tolerated by Germany for their loyalty, have had their trepidations entirely vindicated, as [WHR.GetLeader] has led his people to join with [SOV.GetNameDef] as an autonomous region, and the promise of more territory.\n\nThe true intentions behind years of feigned loyalty to Germany and increasingly left-wing politics have come to light, as a fracture emerges on the eastern edges of the Reichspakt."
 whrpol.57.a: "Wonderful news!"
 whrpol.57.b: "This is a catastrophe!"
 whrpol.57.c: "Germany's empire crumbles..."

 whreco.1.t: "Black Monday Hits Belarus"
 whreco.1.d: "The shockwaves of the collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the ensuing economic turbulence have reached all corners of Mitteleuropa. Its impact on us however has been much more subdued than other members of Mitteleuropa, as our country is much less industrially developed; we have emerged out of Black Monday relatively unscathed, though we'll still need to minimise damages before the situation escalates."
 whreco.1.a: "A blessing in disguise?"

 whreco.2.t: "White Ruthenia Requests Economic Aid"
 whreco.2.d: "White Ruthenia, our small ally in the east, has a relatively undeveloped economy which was quite shaken by the economic crisis. Since the regime change is far more open to German interests and has loosened labour laws in our favour, they've requested that we give them a generous loan to finally pull them out of the crisis. Since their economy is quite small, this will barely be a dent in our accounts, but even such a small dent may be unwelcome in these trying times."

 whreco.4.t: "Germany Leaves us in the Dust"
 whreco.4.d: "Shockingly, the German government has refused, claiming they were unable to, help us in our final recovery from the economic crisis. This has soured relations with our old ally, leaving us in a slow drift towards recovery."

 whrlandreform.1.t: "Success of Plan Sierada!"
 whrlandreform.1.d: "The ambitious program by People's Minister of Agriculture Jan Sierada to revitalise the land reform program and bring Belarus to the modern era has proven success! As reports from around the country have begun trickling into the hands of the ministry reporting the increased effectiveness of Belarusian farmers across the country. With the land reform program a success, the BSDP's position as the hegemons of the Sojm is left unassailable, assuring a fair and democratic socialist country for all!"
 whrlandreform.1.a: "Three Hurrahs for Jan Sierada!"

 whrlandreform.2.t: "Land Dispute in the Countryside"
 whrlandreform.2.d: "In the vast countryside of Belarus, land is primarily owned by landlords for agricultural purposes, worked by Belarusian peasants, this status quo has existed for decades at this point, but the introduction of Plan Sierada has put the situation on its head, one landlord was attacked by a disgruntled peasant with syndicalist sympathies while touring his land together with his family, while a very rare occurrence as most of the population of the countryside is not politically involved, the scandal has reached the front pages of many newspapers across the country. With landlords lobbying the government to compensate the attacked party while the people, disgruntled with the landlords for some time now, demand that the government shouldn't favour the landlord class."
 whrlandreform.2.a: "Compensate the landlord, we can't antagonise them during this critical moment."
 whrlandreform.2.b: ""Maybe raise living standards for the workers in your estate?""

 whrlandreform.3.t: "BSDP-L Presents Demands"
 whrlandreform.3.d: "Despite lukewarm support from the left wing of the BSDP for Plan Sierada, many within it are now less than satisfied about our handling of the plan, citing us being "too soft" on landlords and the rich and "betraying the ideals" of the Hramada. In a paper signed by several key members of the BSDP-L, they have presented their letter of protest to Taraškievič , how to handle this letter of protest is a matter of debate however..."
 whrlandreform.3.a: "Ignore the letter, we are doing well our own way."
 whrlandreform.3.b: "Maybe the BSDP-L has got a point?"

 whrlandreform.4.t: "A Cabinet Meeting"
 whrlandreform.4.d: "While our intent was to handle Plan Sierada by balancing public support with general effectiveness to achieve success, some within the government cabinet still state that we don't have enough of either of the two, either the issue is that we're not listening to the people enough, or that we're listening to the people too much. This sort of confusion is hindering the implementation of Plan Sierada, so in an effort to settle the matter, Taraškievič has organised a cabinet meeting to debate the handling of Plan Sierada."
 whrlandreform.4.a: "We need to focus on effectiveness."
 whrlandreform.4.b: "We need to listen to the people."

 whrlandreform.5.t: "Bureaucratic Issues"

 whrlandreform.5.a: "We need to do something about that!"

 whrlandreform.6.t: "Minor Protest"
 whrlandreform.6.d: "Disgruntled workers have organised a minor protest in one of our cities! They claim that the government isn't doing enough for the people when handling Plan Sierada."
 whrlandreform.6.a: "We need to listen to the people!"

 whrlandreform.7.t: "Major Protest"
 whrlandreform.7.d: "Tens of thousands of disgruntled workers have rallied today in the streets of Minsk to protest the government's handling of Plan Sierada, alleging that the government has forgotten its purpose of serving the people and that it's cosying up to the elites, much like the old Tsardom of old. The latter has gotten under the skin of many nationalists in Minsk and the Sojm."
 whrlandreform.7.a: "We're doing what we can!"

 whrmisc.3.t: "Literacy Rate Improves"
 whrmisc.3.d: "[WHR.GetName] has always struggled with abysmal literacy rates. During the census of 1897, the rate was as low as 10% in some regions. With great investment during the first years of Belarusian independence, the rate steadily improved and neared 50% by the mid-30s. With the construction of additional schools in rural areas and the increasing number of qualified teachers, a good amount of the rural population can now read and write, and we should no longer need to worry about lack of literacy significantly impacting our nation anymore."
 whrmisc.3.a: "Wonderful!"

 whrmisc.4.t: "White Ruthenia Contracts German Company"
 whrmisc.4.d: "The White Ruthenian government, needing equipment for its meagre armed forces, has contracted a German firm to help them supply them with old military hardware from the Weltkrieg long retired from our stockpile. We welcome our businesses making profit in our Eastern allies and bring us some profits."
 whrmisc.4.a: "As long as they can delay the Russians in the end."

 whrmisc.5.t: "Rifles from Germany"

 whrmisc.7.t: "Old Fighters from Germany"
 whrmisc.7.d: "Our order from Germany has arrived; a hundred biplane fighters to help bolster our Air Fleet. It may not be much and they may be obsolete, but even an old warplane at all is better than none in the modern battlefield."
 whrmisc.7.a: "They better not be flying caskets."

 whrmisc.8.t: "Support Equipment from Germany"
 whrmisc.8.d: "Our order from Germany has arrived; a shipment of Support Equipment to aid our troops on the battlefield."

 whrmisc.9.a: "Keep them out of the mud."

 whrmisc.10.t: "A Very Jewish Day"
 whrmisc.10.d: "A humble, unimpressive looking Jewish man was seen touring the streets of Minsk, Pinsk and Babruysk, introducing himself in Yiddish, and sometimes in German as Berl Katznelson. A Zionist and labour activist, he'd been touring Europe for the last few weeks, going from Germany to Poland, to Lithuania, to the Baltic region, and now, to Belarus, seeking support from the local Jews for the Zionist cause. Writing for the labour newspaper 'Davar', published all the way in Palestine, Katznelson wrote a glowing report of the BSDP's commitment to equal rights for all and preservation of multiculturalism. Writing about his land of birth:\n\n\"Belorussia is seemingly a complete rejection of the status quo of Poland, where the Poles stood at the top and Jews at the bottom. In Belorussia, Jews, Poles, Belarusians and Russians all have equal rights and accommodations, a truly inspiring ideal for the Zionist movement.\" Katznelson met and argued with senior Bund members in Minsk regarding the merits of the Zionist ideal, Katznelson admitted that the success of the Jewish Bund in Eastern Europe inspired him to create a Zionist united workers front in Palestine, even if he may disagree with the \"Exilism\" of the Jewish Bund. \"I wish our boys knew how to receive an opponent so warmly.\" Katznelson is only one of several prominent Zionist activists around Eastern Europe, which sheds light on the vibrancy of Jewish life in Belarus and other countries."
 whrmisc.10.a: "Interesting!"

 whrmisc.11.t: "Completion of the Central House of Officers"
 whrmisc.11.d: "Beginning in 1934, a new building on Central Square has been completed: The Central House of Officers. Designed by none other than the most prominent Belarusian architect Iosif Langbard, the building includes many different amenities for soldiers, officers, and locals to enjoy, from a restaurant to a cinema, along with offices for the People's Army and the German Military Mission. It is planned to further expand the building to house the Central Military Library and a theatre hall."
 whrmisc.11.a: "Modern facilities for the army!"

 whrmisc.12.t: "\"Bielarusi ardenanosnaj\" by Janka Kupala"
 whrmisc.12.d: "Janka Kupala, the far more famous pen name for Iván Daminikavič Lucévič, has published a voluminous collection of his many poems entitled \"Orderly Belarus\". Kupala is already known as one of the greatest writers in the Belarusian language and as a patriot and enthusiastic supporter of Belarusian nationhood. His earlier poems had earned the ire of Tsarist authorities, while his work during the Weltkrieg was full of anti-war sentiments. After the February Revolution, his tone changed to become far more optimistic and he notably translated the Internationale into Belarusian.\n\nThis new volume is the biggest compilation of his works yet and will hopefully continue to inspire other Belarusians writers and expand the body of works in the language, helping it cement itself as more than just a \"peasants' tongue\".\n\n\"O Young Belarus, come forth, take thy place of honour and fame among nations!\""
 whrmisc.12.a: "We can all appreciate the work of the People's Poet!"

 whrmisc.13.t: "Expansion of the National Academy of Sciences"
 whrmisc.13.d: "The Belarusian National Academy of Sciences was founded in 1929 as the Institute of Belarusian Culture, Inbelcult, expanded. With this expansion grew the need to house this new institution. Iosif Langbard was commissioned to design its main building, with its curved archway, and it was just completed today. This will allow the academy to improve their research capabilities and staff of faculty and scientists."
 whrmisc.13.a: "A symbol of progress."

 whrmisc.14.t: "Opening of the State Opera"
 whrmisc.14.d: "As the limits of the National Theatre became clear, the government commissioned Iosif Langbard, [WHR.GetNameDef]'s most prominent architect, to design a building to house the National Opera and Ballet studio on the Trinity Hill district of Minsk. The large new building, another example of Langbard's constructivist style, houses 1200 seats.\n\nThe inauguration is set to premier \"Michaś Padhorny\" by Belarusian composer Jaŭhien Karlavič Cikocki. The four-act opera is set during the Weltkrieg, the Russian Revolutions, and the birth of the Belarusian People's Republic, featuring two Belarusian peasants, Michaś and Marysi, and their complicated history as lovers."
 whrmisc.14.a: "Wonderful!"

 whrmisc.15.t: "\"Bielaruskim partyzanam\" by Janka Kupala"
 whrmisc.15.d: "With the war against Russia raging, Janka Kupala has published a series of poems exalting the resistance of Belarusians against the invaders. The first of these is \"Belarusian Partisans\", featuring the leader of [RUS.GetNameDef], [RUS.GetLeader], as a bloodthirsty vampire and murderer, calling for the brave partisans of Belarus to enact vengeance on the invaders.\n\nPartisans, Partisans!\nChildren of Belarus!\nCut down the nasty Russians!\nSo they may never return!"
 whrmisc.15.a: "Kupala's contribution to the war effort."

 whrmisc.16.t: "Formation of the Belarusian State Philharmonic"
 whrmisc.16.d: "The world of the arts in [WHR.GetNameDef] is ever changing, and music is no exception. In order to pool their resources together, the State Symphony Orchestra, State Choir, National Folk Orchestra and Dance Ensemble formed the State Philharmonic. The demand for live musical performances has sharply increased since independence, and many people are willing to attend them despite the lack of modern facilities, accepting the uncomfortable seating and makeshift sets to satisfy their craving for beautiful classical and folk songs. The current main goal of the Philharmonic is to secure state support to build a proper, modern concert hall and the facilities needed for practice, for despite the symbolic importance of the National Theatre building, it has proven to be too small, uncomfortable, and with very poor acoustics for orchestral and choir music.\n\nFor the time being, however, the Philharmonic displays the growth of performance arts in [WHR.GetNameDef]. The State Symphony Orchestra has been touring neighbouring states, and their performances in Ukraine gained particular acclaim. The future is bright for the increasing number of talented Belarusian musicians."
 whrmisc.16.a: "The people deserve beautiful music."

 whrmisc.17.t: "Death of Liavon Dubiejkaŭski"
 whrmisc.17.d: "Liavon Ivanavič Dubiejkaŭski, architect, writer, and politician, passed away today at the age of 71 of stomach cancer. For his great contributions to Belarusian culture, he has been granted a state funeral and many esteemed academicians, political figures, and many other notables will be in attendance.\n\nBorn in 1864 in the village of Dubiejkava near [243.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Dubiejkaŭski was born into a small noble family that, like many, had fallen from grace after the partitions of Poland. He was interested in Belarusian culture from an early age, collecting folklore and writing down oral accounts, dabbling in writing himself with fables and poetry. Against the wishes of his parents, he moved to Warsaw to study construction and architecture. As a professional builder from the 1890s on, he worked to restore numerous Catholic churches around the Belarusian lands. In 1893, he was contracted to build the Immaculate Conception Church in [242.GetName] and, from then on, founded his own successful construction company. After the Russo-Japanese War, however, the construction industry crashed and he liquidated his business, leaving for Paris to further his studies in architecture.\n\nDubiejkaŭski became acquainted with the Belarusian national movement during the Weltkrieg as a writer for the important nationalist paper Naša Niva, meeting brothers Ivan and Anton Luckievič of the Hramada. While in Petrograd in the winter of 1916, he designed a potential national flag for Belarus, which he never submitted and the white-red-white by Klaŭdzij Duž-Dušeŭski would become the national flag. From 1917 on, he was devoted to the Belarusian national cause, eventually joining the Social-Democrats. In 1918, he was made \"chief architect\" of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR), designing national awards for the government and working on different school-building projects across the country. The next year, he went to Warsaw again, this time as head of the Belarusian consulate, and he would soon become the first ambassador to Poland, helping thaw relations after several years of anxiety from Polish attitudes towards Belarusians.\n\nWhile remaining active in politics and writing profusely for different nationalist papers, Dubiejkaŭski returned to his work in architecture. His work began to slow down in the 1930s, and after 1935, poor health forced him into retirement.\n\nThe long life of this illustrious Belarusian leaves behind a legacy that will live on with the nation, cemented in stone and concrete across the land."
 whrmisc.17.a: "The nation pays its respects"

 whrmisc.18.t: "Death of Vasil Zacharka"
 whrmisc.18.d: "Today, [WHR.GetNameDef] lost one of its founding fathers, Vasiĺ Ivanavič Zacharka. One of the leaders of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Federalists, he is to be granted a state funeral with the highest honours as one of the nation's most prominent politician.\n\nBorn in a village near [94.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in 1877, Zacharka became a teacher in 1895. Three years later, he became a cadet in the Russian Army and would serve until 1902, only to be mobilised again in 1904 to serve until 1917 as a junior officer.\n\nBy the time he had been demobilised the first time, he was already a member of the Belarusian Socialist Hramada, and on October 22, 1917, he was one of the organisers of the Congress of Belarusian Soldiers on the Western Front, soon becoming secretary of the Central Military Council. As a participant in the All-Belarusian Congress, he was briefly imprisoned by the Bolsheviks before being freed when the German Army occupied Minsk, and he began collaborating with the Germans afterwards. From February 1918, he was a member of the government of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR), serving in different treasurer and other roles in finances, even briefly People's Minister of Finance. After 1919, he requested to be transferred out of the People's Ministry of Finance into the fledgling diplomatic service instead. In June, he was sent to Berlin, heading the BNR's diplomatic mission to the German Emperor. When Germany recognised the BNR after the Russian Civil War, his mission was upgraded to an embassy, becoming the first Belarusian ambassador to the German Empire.\n\nZacharka remained in Berlin until December 1925 when he returned to Minsk. While retiring from active politics, he remained one of the leaders of the BPS-F and focused his attention on the creation of the Belarusian National Archives.\n\nThe esteemed leader leaves behind a respectable political career and the massive government archives that he has been working on for almost two decades. He will be remembered as one of the founding fathers of our nation, helping the country earn recognition from the rest of the world."
 whrmisc.18.a: "The nation loses a founding father."

 whrmisc.19.t: "Visit of Princes Waldemar and Sigismund"
 whrmisc.19.d: "As part of a concerted effort by the government to maintain good relations with the German Empire, the ambassador in Berlin secured an official visit from two princes of the Hohenzollern family. Brothers Waldemar and Sigismund, nephews of Kaiser Wilhelm II, arrived in Minsk the other day before embarking on a tour of the country tailored to their interests.\n\nUpon their arrival, they were greeted by the expected military parade, where Waldemar quietly inspected the details on the uniforms of the soldiers of the People's Army. As avid automotive enthusiasts, the princelings visited the burgeoning Minsk Automobile Plant, impressed by the ability of the small nation of White Ruthenia to even produce cars in the first place considering the image of the country as a rural backwater. The visit concluded with a ball at the National Theatre, bringing together the majority of the region's notable figures of high society.\n\nThe publicity stunt proved to be successful as it went without incidents and was presented positively in the German press, helping raise awareness and improve our image abroad. A few days later, [ROOT.GetLeader] received a letter and package from Prince Waldemar: It contained a set of tin toy soldiers made by the prince himself that looked like Belarusian soldiers, with the letter signed \"Uladzimir\", a Belarusian name he had been playfully given during the tour. Prince Sigismund's gratitude was felt more indirectly, as the more business-savvy royal returned with more than a few economic opportunities for his friends in German industry, who would happily mention that they had gotten a tip from a certain \"Prince Zygmunt\"."

 WHR_usievalad_ihnatouski_leader_desc: "Usievalad Makaravič Ihnatoŭski began his political career as a member of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1902. After getting into trouble with the Tsarist authorities and expelled from the University of Saint Petersburg, he enrolled at the Yurievsky (Dorpat/Tartu) University, graduating in 1911 before working as a teacher at the Minsk Pedagogical Institute. He would work there until 1921, and for most of the Weltkrieg, he appeared loyal to the government despite his rebellious past. Nevertheless, by 1917, he was the head of an organisation called Young Belarus, becoming a member of the Belarusian Socialist Hramada. When the Hramada split in 1918, he joined the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, opposing the government of the Belarusian People's Republic's pro-German stance. However, he also grew disillusioned by the BPS-R's anti-Bolshevik stance.\n\nWhen BPS-R co-founder Tamaš Hryb called for cooperation with the puppet republic of the Germans, Ihnatoŭski leaded a split from the BPS-R, forming the underground Belarusian Revolutionary Organisation. While he became a member of the Belarusian Institute of Culture, later the Academy of Sciences, he made contacts with émigrés in Paris and the Third Internationale. Now that the World Revolution has reached Belarus, Ihnatoŭski and his cadre of revolutionaries are at the helm of the Belarusian Workers' Socialist Republic, implementing an authoritarian left-populist program to bring socialism to his native land."

 WHR_tamas_hryb_leader_desc: "The co-founder of the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries was born from a poor peasant family. Before the Weltkrieg, he worked at the Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg and became involved in Belarusian literary circles in the city. In 1914, he was drafted into the Russian Army and remained in service until 1917. He was elected to the All-Belarusian Congress in December 1917 as one of several representatives of Belarusian soldiers fighting on the Romanian Front, and was arrested by Bolshevik authorities when it was suppressed. When he was freed, he became involved in the creation of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) as a member of the Rada (Council) of the BNR and the Central Military Council. He and the BPS-R became outspoken supporters of complete independence for Belarus, but they could not convince the Rada to change their pro-German orientation. He would be imprisoned twice in 1919 by German authorities for actively opposing the occupation and only released when the BNR was officially recognised by Germany in 1920.\n\nAs it became clear that the German presence could not be opposed any longer, Hryb called for the BPS-R to work with other leftist parties in the newly-established Sojm, causing a minor split in the party. From 1925 onward, the BPS-R maintained a presence within the successive Social-Democratic governments, representing the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada's radical wing.\n\nHryb would remain suspected by German authorities the whole time, and he remained careful about any affiliation with the Third Internationale, even if his sympathies were an open secret. With the World Revolution having spread to Belarus, however, there is no longer any reason to hold back as the BPS-R begins work at implementing their full left-populist program, with their co-founder at the head of the Belarusian Workers' Socialist Republic."

He returned to Minsk in 1917, deeply involved with the Belarusian Socialist Hramada and the foundation of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) the following year. When the Hramada split in 1918, he found himself on the side of the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party, which pursued a pragmatically pro-German path, rejected Soviet Russia and its degeneration into \"bureaucratic socialism\", and wished to create a free democratic socialist state through reforms.\n\nAfter serving in the People's Ministry of Education, Taraškievič quickly rose up the BSDP's central committee after leading grammar reforms to the Belarusian language and the adoption of the Latin script. After the fall of Raman Skirmunt's second coalition government, his party was swept into power in the 1925 election, and he became Chairman of the Council of People's Ministers, or simply prime minister, of the BNR. He would maintain this position until 1933 and his chairmanship would see the BSDP's hegemony in parliament solidified with the foundation of the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Hramada, which united centre-left and left-wing parties into a unified bloc, while his policies involved continuing Plan Sierada and enshrining progressive labour laws to the dismay of German corporations established in the country.\n\nIn 1933, Taraškievič retired from the chairmanship before ascending to the more symbolic presidency of the BNR while becoming chairman of the Hramada. A convinced socialist, he remains closer to the left-wing of the BSDP despite his efforts in maintaining unity within the Hramada. As such, he is rumoured to be not only sympathetic to the Third Internationale, but potentially their agent among the more radical opposition.

After earning a degree in engineering and economics, he was involved in the All-Belarusian Congress of Trade Unions while further splitting his time with prolific writing and reading. After 1930, he was involved with Belarusian migrant workers in Germany and, in 1932, he founded the Union of Belarusian Emigrant Workers and published the Bulletin of Belarusian Workers in Germany. There, he made his anti-communard sentiments very clear and made sure to limit the influence of the Third Internationale within the Belarusian labour movement.\n\nWhile a relatively young face in Belarusian politics, few can deny his activity within the Belarusian national and labour movements as a writer, teacher, and politician.

He became one of the leaders of the Belarusian community in Lithuania, becoming widely respected for his tireless charity work.\n\nAt the 4th Congress of the BKhD in December 1931, he was elected member of its central committee and became involved in politics in White Ruthenia. There, he helped strengthen the National-Democratic Association as Christian Democracy gained a stronger voterbase, working with the informal Orthodox wing of the movement, the Peasants' Union (not to be confused with the Peasant Party), presenting an increasingly valid opposition to the political hegemony of the Hramada.\n\nIt took many years, but the National-Democratic Association was finally able to dislodge the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada from power for the first time since 1925. In a way, this is a victory for Belarusian democracy as a proof of its health, and Stankievič played a key part.

Like many early Belarusian nationalists, he worked to secure his nation's autonomy within the Russian Republic, but loudly decried the October Revolution and became an early proponent for the independence of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR) as a delegate to the All-Belarusian Congress of December 1917.\n\nAfter volunteering for military service after the creation of the Belarusian People's Army, he worked for the People's Ministry of Education for most of the '20s, joining the Peasants' and Workers' Hramada. During this time, while initially seeming to drift towards the left-wing of the bloc, he soon found himself alienated as it grew closer to the rhetoric of the Third Internationale. By 1936, his views had shifted dramatically and he had become an outspoken member of the bloc's right-wing, criticising the growth of Syndicalist influence within the Hramada as dangerous and foreign.\n\nNow, his time in the Hramada has become irrelevant as they refused to heed his warnings. After coming into conflict with the chairman of the Hramada, Branisłaŭ Taraškievič, Astroŭski began to work against them behind the scenes, knowing that the BSDP wouldn't be dislodged by legal means, organising the group of dissident politicians and army officers that would become the Belarusian Central Rada after overthrowing the Taraškievič government. While the coup had mixed results, it has become clear that the Hramada is no longer a threat to the nation, saved from a dangerous Syndicalist plot. It remains to be seen whether the Chairman of the Central Rada can truly bring order and stability to White Ruthenia."

 WHR_vaclau_lastouski_leader_desc: "Vacłaŭ Justynavič Łastoŭski is one of the most prominent Belarusian nationalists and a long-time member of the Belarusian national movement. His involvement reaches back to 1906 when he first joined the Belarusian Socialist Hramada and was editor of the association's newspaper \"Nasha Niva\" until 1914. He was a prolific author and historian, managing the Belarusian Publishing Society since its founding in 1915, actively contributing to the cultural and national development of Belarus. As an outspoken supporter of Belarusian independence, he was a member of the Belarusian Council in Vilnius and joined the Rada of the Belarusian People's Republic (BNR). As part of the Rada, he supported the BNR's declaration of independence before, as a vocal supporter of close Lithuanian-Belarusian relations, representing Belarusian interests in the Lithuanian diplomatic mission in Berlin.\n\nIn 1919, Łastoŭski joined the Belarusian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, but would quickly come into conflict over foreign policy and tactics with its central committee and would split with them the next year. He would then support the government's pro-German orientation after joining Viačaslaŭ Adamovič's Belarusian Peasant Party (Green Oak) and would become a key member of the Belarusian Institute of Culture, Inbelcult, after its foundation in 1922, and later in 1928 when it was transformed into the Belarusian Academy of Sciences.\n\nBy 1936, Łastoŭski had become the head of Green Oak's political wing and its chief ideologue. Despite his early involvement with socialists, he had always been critical of Marxism and class warfare, and always put national interests over class. More importantly, he consistently denied the idea of any kind of Russian-Belarusian unity, seeking to deepen ties with the Baltic nations instead and to purge as much Russian influence as possible. His anti-Russian sentiments bled into his writings, considering the \"Muscovite\" people as Mongol, while Belarusians, as the descendants of the medieval Kryvich tribe, were the \"true Slavs\" and even part of the Aryan race. In his goal to purge all Russian influences, he believes the Belarusian nation and identity should be renamed to match their ancestors: Kryvian.\n\nWith a revanchist Russian state to the east, it certainly does appear that the Kryvian people will be fighting for its very survival, and it will be a bloody battle."

 WHR_werner_kempf: "Werner Kempf"
 WHR_werner_kempf_leader_desc: "Werner Kempf is neither a friend or foe of the Belarusians. He is a Prussian officer through and through, and his objective is simply: Prepare White Ruthenia for an invasion from the East. As much of the country must be mobilised for the war effort as possible before it is too late, else the Russians will punch through a weak link in the Ostwall and pour west between Polesia and the Baltic. Kempf has no concern for the people there; the Central Rada can handle internal affairs, and his priority is the military situation, and he expects the White Ruthenians to cooperate as much as possible. After all, their survival depends on the German Army; neither they nor he can afford to lose."
