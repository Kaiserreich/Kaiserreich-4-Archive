 KUM_legacy_masqud_desc: "Masqud Shah, the previous ruler of the Kumul Khanate, was one of the most autocratic leaders so far in our history. Known for being a constant drunk, raising of the tax and corvée, and complete hate for technology made him highly controversial. This led to the 07' and 12' Uprisings, trying to overthrow him and the khanate itself. Nasīr Shah is now trying to right his father's wrongs in order to get his subjects to approve of his rule, but it will require significant work into the future."

### Events ###
 kumul.0.t: "The Kumul Khanate"
 kumul.0.d: "The Kumul Khanate, directly descended from the Chagatai Khanate, has managed to live throughout the course of the Qing Dynasty, into the Republican Era, and once again back into the Qing's fold. Officially a protectorate of the Qing Empire, Kumul controls the main roadway between Xinjiang and the rest of China. The series of loyal Uyghur Khans pays tribute to both the emperor in Beijing along with the Xinjiang government itself.\n\nThe previous Khan of Kumul, Masqud Shah was known for the most authoritarian rule in the humble Khanate's history yet, leading to two uprisings against him in 1907 and 1912. This hate for the khan carried onto our new ruler, Nasīr Shah, who wishes to have at least minor reforms in the Khanate to the insane amounts of tax and the corvée to earn his people's appreciation once again. Whether or not this will work is yet to be seen, as he is still deciding to rely on either the Uyghur nobles known as Begs or his advisory of Kumul loyalist Yulbars Khan and former anti-Kumul revolutionary Hoja-Niyaz.\n\nKumul is seen as the last thing keeping the peace and prosperity within Xinjiang, as even with the various opponents of Nasīr, it shows the dream of possible self-rule into the future for the many other Uyghur inhabitants of Xinjiang. Even with our minor size, the effects of our existence ring widely within the rest of Xinjiang as the in-direct peace keepers who prevent mass revolt."
 kumul.0.a: "Maybe we are important..."

 kumul.1.t: "Growing Unrest Against Nasīr"
 kumul.1.d: "With the slow progression of Nasīr's promised reforms, the unrest only continues to expand throughout our territory. Violent protests began in Kumul’s outer city just the other day, before being quickly crushed by our advisor Yulbars Khan before it could grow into the size of 07 and 12 revolts. While the situation is contained for now, we'll need to move quickly and decide how exactly we are going to reform and when. All of the people, Begs, and Advisory wait desperately for Nasīr's to make his move deciding our future."
 kumul.1.a: "These people are so rowdy!"

 kumul.2.t: "Rumours of Unrest from the Advisory"
 kumul.2.d: "With our policies slowly beginning to lean towards the various begs which control tax flow to the government, both Yulbars and Niyaz are beginning to grow upset with Nasīr. While Yulbars is a staunch loyalist and would never truly revolt, the more worrying case is Hoja-Niyaz. His participation in both the '07 and '12 uprisings make a worrying case for betrayal if mass revolt does begin against our rule once again. We'll need to be sure to appease him and Yulbars if we want them to stay on our side in future conflicts between us and our subjects."
 kumul.2.a: "Why is governing so complex?"

 kumul.3.t: "Unrest Among the Begs"
 kumul.3.d: "The Begs are Uyghur nobles within Kumul and the rest of Xinjiang, meant to control tax flow within regions and ensure they reach the central government. Our current bias towards the advisory over them has quite obviously made them upset, and the last thing we need is our tax collectors to smuggle money away from our Khan, or even worse, side with the people in case of revolt. While they remain loyal for now, we'll need to tread carefully into the future to prevent the worst-case scenario."
 kumul.3.a: "Those Begs are always up to something"

 kumul.4.t: "Paying Tribute to Xinjiang"
 kumul.4.d: "It is our job to pay our tribute to the Xinjiang government yearly as a result of our protectorate status. This is mainly meant as symbolic gesture to show the ties between the Qing and Uyghur people, as our tribute is as simple as gifting a Kumul Melon to the governor of Xinjiang. Currently, that is [SIK.GetLeader] who has graciously accepted our tribute. Tradition is important, no matter how ludicrous it seems to outsiders as the bonds between the Uyghur and Han need to be maintained for future peace in our home."
 kumul.4.a: "Peace between people by a melon"

 kumul.5.t: "Incompetency"
 kumul.5.d: "The new cabinet in charge of Hami is... worse then anyone could have expected. These close friends of Jin Shuren are riddled with corruption, with constant smuggling of money, abuse and exploitation of the people, and general intolerance towards anyone that isn't themselves. The current Chief Minister of Hami Long Xielin is certainly no exception, having similar strategy to Jin of smuggling the money from tax towards his own personal gold-mine of wealth. While for now this has been mainly kept under wraps, the already highly corrupt officials only growing in power will most likely only hurt us into the future of this new prefecture."
 kumul.5.a: "Hami is truly under a curse"

 kumul.6.t: "Opening of Immigration"
 kumul.6.d: "Approved by Jin Shuren himself along with Long Xielin, immigration has been opened from Gansu to Hami. Hami holds the main road connecting Xinjiang to the rest of China, but the previous Khanate's ban on non-Uyghur immigration prevented many Chinese from being able to gain access to the region. For no longer however, as Jin has already sent the first batch of Hui and Han immigrants from his home province to settle within this new frontier. We can only hope this leads to a great future of our wonderful people to even the farthest reaches of Central Asia, although it will obviously take a significant amount of time."
 kumul.6.a: "To a wonderful future!"

 kumul.7.t: "Immigration Woes"
 kumul.7.d: "While the opening of immigration into Hami has undoubtedly brought vast improvements to this previously uncultured Mohammedian city, it has not been an entirely positive affair. Apparently, the local populace is enraged with our generous land reform programs, even though they were rightfully given smaller uncultivated plots to make room for more important settlers. There have been several cases of murders of Han immigrants, but so far they have been relegated to isolated affairs. It seems the Kumulilik can be tamed after all."
 kumul.7.a: "Ungrateful brats."

 kumul.8.t: "An Odd Proposal"
 kumul.8.d: "The new tax collector appointed by Jin Shuren, Zhang Mu has allegedly been enamoured by a young Muslim girl in the city and has asked her hand in marriage. While normally something like this is not of note, since Zhang is not a Muslim, the local Ulama have expressed their deep opposition to the marriage. For unknown reasons however, the girl's father has agreed to the union and a ceremony is planned a few weeks from now.\n\nKumulilik tensions have been running dangerously high since the annexation, and this brazen action is likely to further inflame the populace. Jin Shuren, however, allegedly gave his support to Zhang in the marriage, so it is unlikely to be stopped now."
 kumul.8.a: "Love knows no bounds"

 kumul.9.t: "A Sour Reception"
 kumul.9.d: "Disaster! Apparently tensions in Hami were higher than anyone could have anticipated, as last night Zhang Mu and his troupe of soldiers were massacred by Kumulilik radicals. He was apparently attending a dinner party for the upcoming feast when a large group of men ambushed him and his troops. Had it not been for their drunken state, they may have stood a chance, but they stand no longer.\n\nThis is now the least of our troubles however, as the rebels, now tenfold their previous number, have stormed the entire city. Many of our Han immigrants were massacred, with their heads lobbed off and buried in the dirt. While overrunning the outer city, the remaining Han citizens and administrators have garrisoned themselves inside the old city walls, and are now waiting for relief from Jin Shuren’s forces, if they come."
 kumul.9.a: "Perhaps it wasn’t meant to be..."

 kumul.10.t: "The Blood Tax Upon Xinjiang"
 kumul.10.d: "Remnants of Zhang Mu's garrison arrived at Jin Shuren's mansion to report an unprecedented massacre of Han people in Hami. It appears the Kumuliliks were less satisfied than Zhang Mu's reports indicated, and his garrison was surprised several nights ago to a mob of Muslim agitators. The survivors tell tale of an arranged marriage between Zhang Mu and an ulama's daughter, as well as tax resistance Zhang Mu promised to report to Jin Shuren but never did. It is obvious now that Hami is lost to Jin's men, and the lives of the Han immigrants hang in the balance should Jin fail in a reprisal."
 kumul.10.a: "Again Xinjiang will roil in pain"

 kumul.11.t: "Besieged and Beleaguered"
 kumul.11.d: "With our ongoing Jihad against the Han occupiers stalled, we have arrived at an impasse. We neither have the men nor arms to defeat the forces in the old city, but they also lack either the strength or will to counter-assault us. Our best General, Yulbars Khan, has announced his departure to recruit an army capable of vanquishing any who would oppose us. While many doubt his capability to find such a miracle, there are hushed whispers he may be conspiring with the most brutal of the Ma warlords, Ma Zhongying. Such an action would be unprecedented and draw much ire, but would also give us a much needed fighting chance."
 kumul.11.a: "Hopefully the Old Man finds what we need."

 kumul.12.t: "An Opportune Encounter"
 kumul.12.d: "As Yulbars entered Ma Zhongying’s tent, undoubtedly the largest among the war camp, he became overcome with the stench of Opium. It nearly drove him away, but he could not deviate from his god-appointed task. Bearing the musk, he approached Zhongying's striking figure at the tent's centre.\n\n‘The Tiger Prince of Kumul coming to make me his prey?' the Ma warlord chuckled.\n\n‘I am but an old man, seeking the strength of the Butcher of Gansu.’.\n\nFormalities were brief, as each knew the intention of one another. While the visit was orchestrated to seem like a surprise, much correspondence had been exchanged in the previous weeks. Zhongying had an army without a state, and Yulbars a state without an army. Once all the arrangements had been seen through, Zhongying was quick to set off with his men, and Yulbars followed. After all, how could he miss the sight of this seeming herald of death itself?"
 kumul.12.a: "The Unholiest of alliances…"

 kumul.13.t: "The Herald of Death"
 kumul.13.d: "It seems the rumours were right, Yulbars has returned with the famed Ma Zhongying. While his mere presence is a terrifying thought for many, the sudden presence of thousands more troops struck fear into the very heart of the beleaguered garrison in the Old City.\n\nAs night fell, Zhongying made his move. Hundreds of Kumulilik Horsemen charged the fortifications with a fiery spirit, but were gunned down in an instant by machine guns. This however, did not deter the warlord. Throughout the dim hours of the night, wave after wave assaulted the garrison and were progressively repelled, but not without high cost to the defenders. As ammunition ran low, men began abandoning their rifles for the sword and pike, and fought with a similarly primal intensity.\n\nHowever, it seems fortune favours the bold. In the early hours of the morning, Zhongying’s now exhausted forces finally landed a decisive blow to what remained of the Garrison. As a prize to his soldiers, the Old City was razed to the ground, with anything of any meaningful value now in the hands of his men. Even after such brutal combat, Zhongying has promised [?Root.GetLeader] that he will continue his campaign until the last of Jin Shuren’s forces are crushed under his boot."
 kumul.13.a: "A terrifying force."

 kumul.15.t: "The Great Escape"
 kumul.15.d: "In the early hours of the morning, a plan that has been prepared over the last few weeks has been put into action. Nasīr Shah, having been in prison since being taken captive by Jin Shuren, waited in his prison cell for the signal. As the door closed behind the last guard, the sound of a chirping bird echoed throughout the dungeon. There was the signal. With that, Nasīr pulled out some of the bricks on his cell wall, loosened over weeks of work. Behind it was a tunnel, leading to freedom. After crawling through he was met with two shady men, wearing cloaks over their heads. One of them threw another cloak at Nasīr, who hastily put on the disguise. With that, Nasīr was able to walk right out of Dihua, under the nose of [SIK.GetLeader].\n\nNews of Nasīr's escape has already reached Kumul, even though Nasīr will still not get here for another few days. However, his brave escape has already boosted morale."
 kumul.15.a: "Excellent."

 kumul.16.t: "Nasīr Shah Returns"
 kumul.16.d: "As Nasīr walked back into the city of Kumul, flanked by two guards either side, the crowds were packed with people. Cheers from peasants erupted across the city as he walked, a symbol of stability in these unstable times. When he was back, a feast was held, this one less dangerous than Nasīr's last. Nasīr spoke with Yulbars Khan, thanking him for his service and being briefed on all the recent happenings of the war. Afterwards, he held a speech, thanking the troops, and willing everyone to keep on fighting against the tyrants in Dihua."
 kumul.16.a: "Welcome Back."

 kumul.17.t: "Nasīr is Dead!"
 kumul.17.d: "In the early hours of the morning, a plan that has been prepared over the last few weeks has been put into action. Nasīr Shah, having been in prison since being taken captive by Jin Shuren, waited in his prison cell for the signal. As the door closed behind the last guard, the sound of a chirping bird echoed throughout the dungeon. There was the signal. With that, Nasīr pulled out some of the bricks on his cell wall, loosened over weeks of work. Behind it was a tunnel, leading to freedom. After crawling through he was met with two shady men, wearing cloaks over their heads. All seemed to be going to plan, until they showed their faces. These were not Nasīr's agents, sent to help him escape. With one quick motion, one of the men pulled a pistol from his coat, and shot Nasīr Shah in the head, killing him.\n\nNews of this reached us this morning, after one of Nasīr's agents who tried to help him escape fled Dihua after being discovered."
 kumul.17.a: "Damn them!"

 kumul.18.t: "Nasīr is Dead"
 kumul.18.d: "In the early hours of the morning, a plan that has been prepared over the last few weeks has been put into action. Nasīr Shah, having been in prison since we took him captive, waited in his prison cell for the signal. As the door closed behind the last guard, the sound of a chirping bird echoed throughout the dungeon. There was the signal. With that, Nasīr pulled out some of the bricks on his cell wall, loosened over weeks of work. Behind it was a tunnel, leading to freedom. After crawling through he was met with two shady men, wearing cloaks over their heads, whom Nasīr expected to be his own agents. However, we were able to learn of the plan days before it was to take place, so [SIK.GetLeader] was able to put his own agents there to greet Nasīr as he made his escape. As commanded, one of the agents shot Nasīr in the head, ending his trouble."
 kumul.18.a: "Good Riddance."

 kumul.19.t: "The New Leader of Kumul"
 kumul.19.d: "After the tragic death of Nasīr Shah in Dihua, it is time to continue the line of succession. Though Nasīr's son, Bashir Shah, is still very young, he is to be elevated to the role of Khan of Kumul. However, due to his age, Yulbars will remain as regent until Bashir is considered of age. Though Bashir is still stricken with grief about his father, there is no time to waste, as the war in Xinjiang heats up ever further."
 kumul.19.a: "Bashir Shah rules Kumul!"

 kumul.20.t: "What should be done with Nasīr Shah?"
 kumul.20.d: "After the Kumul Khanate declared war on us a few weeks ago, a question has been raised about Nasīr Shah, who currently resides in a prison cell in Dihua. Though for now he remains in his dungeon, rumours have echoed through Dihua, speaking of Nasīr Shah soon to attempt an escape. Nasīr making it back to Kumul would give them a massive morale boost, whereas hearing of his death can only dishearten them. Also, Nasīr's death leaves his son Bashir Shah on the throne, a young teen unfit to rule. A quick bullet to Nasīr's head could help us greatly in this war."
 kumul.20.a: "Kill him. Kill him now."
 kumul.20.b: "He can stay in his cell."

 kumul.21.t: "Ma Zhongying leaves Gansu"
 kumul.21.d: "The Butcher of Gansu, Ma Zhongying, along with his associate Ma Fushan, have left Gansu province, along with their armies. Some rumours circulated that he had been visited by Kumul general Yulbars Khan, and that perhaps he would join the Kumul rebellion that was soon to occur. It appears now, with the start of the Kumul Rebellion, this has come true, with Zhongying's forces having been seen in Xinjiang territory."
 kumul.21.a: "The people of Gansu rejoice!"

 kumul.22.t: "The Execution of Nasīr Shah"
 kumul.22.d: "As dawn rose over Dihua, a crowd gathered near the governor’s building. There up the steps stood Jin and some of his loyalists, among them ex-Chief Minister of Hami Long Xielin. After a few minutes, the crowd began to shout and boo, as Nasīr Shah, still in his prison gown, was dragged through the congregation and up the steps to Jin. Nasīr was thrown to his knees as Jin waved the crowd to quiet.\n\n\"Nasīr Shah, as governor of Xinjiang, I find you guilty of treachery and rebellion. The penalty for this is death. Do you have any last words?\"\n\n\"With this bullet, Jin, your reign comes to an end.\"\n\nWith that, Jin pulled a pistol from his cloak and shot Nasīr in the back of the head. The crowd cheered as Nasīr's body slumped on the stone floor."
 kumul.22.a: "A Traitors Death."

 kumul.23.t: "The Execution of Nasīr Shah"
 kumul.23.d: "As dawn rose over Dihua, a crowd gathered near the governor’s building. There up the steps stood Jin and some of his loyalists, among them ex-Chief Minister of Hami Long Xielin. After a few minutes, the crowd began to shout and boo, as Nasīr Shah, still in his prison gown, was dragged through the congregation and up the steps to Jin. Nasīr was thrown to his knees as Jin waved the crowd to quiet.\n\n\"Nasīr Shah, as governor of Xinjiang, I find you guilty of treachery and rebellion. The penalty for this is death. Do you have any last words?\"\n\n\"With this bullet, Jin, your reign comes to an end.\"\n\nWith that, Jin pulled a pistol from his cloak and shot Nasīr in the back of the head. The crowd cheered as Nasīr's body slumped on the stone floor. When our agent in Dihua informed us of this news, it spread quickly, and sadness has gripped the nation."
 kumul.23.a: "A Tragedy."

 kumul.26.t: "Victory in Xinjiang"
 kumul.26.d: "Finally, after months of fighting against both evil governors and rebellious Uyghurs, we have been able to restore order to Xinjiang. However, now that we have taken control of Xinjiang, we must now try to keep hold of it. We have gone from a small administration on only a small city, to controlling a massive area, far more populated than Kumul itself. Not only this, but we must be wary of those who wish to help us. Both Hoja-Niyaz, the Uyghur military leader, and Ma Zhongying, the Butcher of Gansu, have offered their help, though it is unclear whether they wish to help for the good of the people or just for their own personal gain. The Han Chinese will also have large influence in our government, with even some whispers that Fan Yaonan, the Han bureaucrat thought to be dead after his actions in the Xinjiang Clique, may still be alive. Though these groups may help, we must be sure to not allow them too much influence, or else they may try to even bring an end the Khanate."
 kumul.26.a: "Excellent."

 kumul.27.t: "[KUM.GetLeader]'s Decision"
 kumul.27.d: "With the power in the Khanate now secure from the threats of those whom wished to overthrow it, we must now look to the future. Following the despotic rule of Masqud Shah before Nasīr, reforms had begun to be implemented, to try to push Kumul further into the modern age. However, these reforms were cut short by Jin Shuren's treacherous move. Now, [KUM.GetLeader] is faced with an important decision: to move the Kumul Khanate to a more democratic rule through the Begs, or to hang onto the absolute monarchy permanently."
 kumul.27.a: "Constitutional Monarchy; power to the Begs!"
 kumul.27.b: "Autocracy; power to [KUM.GetLeader]!"

 kumul.28.t: "Xinjiang Requests Administrators"
 kumul.28.d: "As the current owners of Beijing, Fan Yaonan in Xinjiang has recognised us as the rightful government of China. In a letter he has sent to us, he has stated that as the rightful government of China, we should surely be able to help his administration in Xinjiang. Far across the nation, Fan claims that he lacks proper Han Chinese administrators who are capable of running a government without being corrupt. Therefore, he has begged us to send him some proper bureaucrats who know what they are doing. However, we could also use this as an opportunity to send away some of our less capable, slightly corrupt, administrators."
 kumul.28.a: "Send official administrators."
 kumul.28.b: "Send corrupt administrators."
 kumul.28.c: "We have no time for Fan."

 kumul.29.t: "Beijing Sends Official Administrators"
 kumul.29.d: "We have received word back from Beijing about our request. They have chosen to send over multiple Han bureaucrats and administrators, who will help run Xinjiang efficiently and without corruption."
 kumul.29.a: "Excellent."

 kumul.30.t: "Beijing Sends Corrupt Administrators"
 kumul.30.d: "We have received word back from Beijing about our request. They have chosen to send over multiple Han administrators, who will help run Xinjiang. However, Fan recognises the names of multiple people being sent over as some of the most corrupt bureaucrats in Beijing. It seems they have used our request as an excuse to send away their crooked administrators and to make them our problem."
 kumul.30.a: "They'll do."

 kumul.31.t: "The Plan"
 kumul.31.d: "The loose rebels of East Turkestan are unified by one figure: Sabit Damulla. The Bughra brothers of Hotan and the merchant noble Timur Beg are only unified by Sabit Damulla. If you remove Sabit, you remove their unity, and their coalition is likely to collapse. After finding out the location of Sabit Damulla from an interrogation, our military staff has decided that now is the time to act. The person most prepared to run this mission is our general Mahmut Muhiti. He in the past has had links to the Turkic independence movements, but has since given us his loyalty. We could send him into rebel land with a small group of professional troops, and attack Damulla's house while he sleeps. Hopefully, Muhiti will succeed."
 kumul.31.a: "Good luck to Muhiti."

 kumul.32.t: "Assassination Attempt on Sabit Damulla!"
 kumul.32.d: "A tragic event has occurred today. While Sabit Damulla slept in his house, his guards waited lazily outside, not focusing on the mountains around them. As one of the guards sat on a step, taking apart his gun, his skull was suddenly filled with lead. The gunshot rang through the valley, as the rest of the guards sprang into action. A firefight broke out as, from the peak of a nearby hill, a band of soldiers, around 18 strong, charged down the hill, led by Kumul general Mahmut Muhiti. The group were able to kill the 7 guards outside the house, but lost 3 themselves. As they approached the house, they lost 2 more to guards shooting out from the window. Muhiti himself kicked through the door and shot another guard through the head with his pistol. The group travelled through the house and killed another 3 guards, losing none themselves. Now, the only one left was Sabit Damulla. As the approached Sabit's bedroom, Muhiti reloaded his pistol, smiling at his success. However, when he bashed through the door, all he found was an empty bed and an open window. Muhiti realised his mistake of not leaving more soldiers outside to guard the perimeter, as Sabit Damulla slipped through his grasp. Within the hour hundreds of Sabit's troops got to the house, but by then Muhiti and his men had gone.\n\nThough the assassination was a failure, it will still have dire consequences. Sabit Damulla, paranoid for his life, has gone into hiding, leaving it very difficult to communicate with him. Divisions are left disorganised and are even sometimes turning against each other."
 kumul.32.a: "Damn them!"

 kumul.33.t: "Assassination failed on Sabit Damulla"
 kumul.33.d: "Mahmut Muhiti has returned, having failed his mission. He recounts a story of how his men charged down a hill towards Sabit Damulla's house, killing multiple guards on their way down. He talks of how he himself kicked down the front door and shot multiple guards with his pistol. However, by the time he got to Sabit's bedroom, he had escaped.\n\nThough Muhiti failed in his mission, this is not a total loss. Our spies in Hotan and Kashgar have told us that Sabit Damulla has gone into hiding, completely isolating himself from most other people. This has led to complete disorganisation in the East Turkestan forces."
 kumul.33.a: "Not a total loss."

 kumul.50.t: "Our Administration is Spread Very Thin"
 kumul.50.d: "As expected, our administration is currently incapable of leading the province. Multiple small scale rebellions have already broken out throughout Xinjiang for a multitude of reasons: some are still loyal to Jin, some have lived in anarchy after the total upheaval of the previous government, while most are just angry at the lack of food and supply distribution. [KUM.GetLeader] was about to send Ma Zhongying out to deal with these rebellions when news suddenly reached Kumul city: Fan Yaonan is still alive. The Han bureaucrat, after being cast away by the previous administration, went into hiding in a mountain village north of Dihua. When the previous administration was overthrown, he travelled to Kumul city, to pledge allegiance to [KUM.GetLeader], and to offer his help in organising the state. He has already been welcomed into government, being a very popular figure in the Han Chinese community of Xinjiang. However, whether he should be given such a big task so quickly is up for debate."
 kumul.50.a: "Use Fan Yaonan's administration skills to secure order."
 kumul.50.b: "Use Ma Zhongying’s military to secure order."
 kumul.50.c: "Our administration will fix itself, no need to intervene."

 kumul.51.t: "Hoja-Niyaz Begins Rallying Uyghur Leaders"
 kumul.51.d: "Hoja-Niyaz, after aiding our victory, has began to travel around the province, speaking to many of the tribal Uyghur leaders who live primarily in the south. While it is indeed good to secure these regions for our government, some worry that this may just be Hoja-Niyaz trying to gain influence for himself. If necessary, we are able to send Ma Zhongying to him to show our force and try to keep Hoja-Niyaz contained."
 kumul.51.a: "Let him do as he pleases."
 kumul.51.b: "Send Ma Zhongying to force him to stop."

 kumul.52.t: "Fan Speaks to Powerful Business Leaders"
 kumul.52.d: "The region of Xinjiang is very mountainous, sparsely populated, and backwards. However, some businessmen from China still do see it as a good place to set up a business. Recently, we have heard that Fan Yaonan has held multiple meetings with some of the major businessmen and factory owners of the region. He has even reportedly spoken to businessmen from closer to Beijing, trying to convince them to come to Xinjiang to set up factories."
 kumul.52.a: "What is he planning..."

 kumul.53.t: "Ma Zhongying Plans to Ride Out"
 kumul.53.d: "We have recently discovered that Ma Zhongying, the Butcher of Gansu, has made a plan to raid multiple villages near Dihua, likely to pillage their things and take their opium. Yulbars Khan has suggested to us a plan to stop him from doing this. We can give Ma Zhongying more power in our government and higher pay to persuade him not to leave the city. However, Hoja-Niyaz has stated that this is a terrible idea and that Ma Zhongying is too dangerous to be given more power."
 kumul.53.a: "Give him what he needs."
 kumul.53.b: "The raider must raid."

 kumul.54.t: "Fan Speaks to Beijing"
 kumul.54.d: "The bureaucrat Fan Yaonan has recently made a statement to the people in Dihua, about how he has made contact with the people in Beijing and is in open communication with them. Though this does give our government more legitimacy, it shows Fan as having far more power than he truly does. Some people are beginning to believe that Fan is the only man in our government who is legitimate enough to rule."
 kumul.54.a: "Worrying."

 kumul.55.t: "Increased Instability"
 kumul.55.d: "Since gaining control in Dihua, the main problem has been keeping control. Our small administration had to take the place of administering the whole of Xinjiang, a massive area. With this, instability has increased daily across the province, and it is reaching a breaking point. There is a solution, however: the military. It has been suggested that by giving the military far more power, then they can keep order across the region. However, that might be dangerous from a political point of view."
 kumul.55.a: "Give the military more power."
 kumul.55.b: "The instability will run its course."

 kumul.56.t: "Uyghurs in the South in Rebellion"
 kumul.56.d: "The Uyghur tribes in the south, especially those near Hotan, ever since the collapse of Jin Shuren’s administration, have lived in chaos. After being armed by the Uyghur rebellion leaders, many of the tribes have travelled around the region, raping and pillaging the villages in the area. This must, of course, be stopped. We have a choice on how to solve it, though. We could send Hoja-Niyaz to calm the groups down, perhaps even recruit them to his forces. Hoja-Niyaz is a diplomat, is flexible, and is a major Uyghur leader. His popularity with the Uyghurs is almost unmatched. However, perhaps instead of negotiating with the tribes, they should be crushed. Ma Zhongying and his opium addicted soldiers sit idly by, ready to act as we tell them. Perhaps, an iron fist is needed to deal with these rebels."
 kumul.56.a: "Hoja-Niyaz will diffuse the situation."
 kumul.56.b: "Ma Zhongying will end the situation."

 kumul.57.t: "Increasing Immigration"
 kumul.57.d: "More and more, since ending the war with the old administration, Chinese immigration has once again increased. The road through Kumul has been bustling with people, moving to the region to start a new life. However, some are questioning if we should allow this to continue."
 kumul.57.a: "Let it continue."
 kumul.57.b: "Close the border."

 kumul.58.t: "Uyghur Raid Protectors"
 kumul.58.d: "The Butcher of Gansu Ma Zhongying installs fear into anyone that has the unfortunate experience of meeting him and his army. In response to him increasing raiding across the region, Hoja-Niyaz has formed a new group called the Uyghur Protection Squad, a group focused on protecting Uyghurs from Ma Zhongying’s raids. Though this group is keeping people safe, we could be allowing Hoja-Niyaz too much power. However, by making him dissolve the group, we could be giving free reign to Ma Zhongying."
 kumul.58.a: "Hoja-Niyaz will dissolve his group."
 kumul.58.b: "Hoja-Niyaz can protect the people if he wants."

 kumul.59.t: "Funding Needed"
 kumul.59.d: "To keep order in Xinjiang, we really do need more funds. We have cashed out a lot of our reserves by expanding our administration and trying to keep the peace across the province. The main people who have the funds we need are the three most influential people in the nation right now: Hoja-Niyaz, Fan Yaonan, and Ma Zhongying. We must ask one of them to give us some of their funds."
 kumul.59.a: "Use Fan's funds."
 kumul.59.b: "Use Hoja-Niyaz's funds."
 kumul.59.c: "Use Ma Zhongying's funds."

 kumul.70.t: "Poor Tax Revenue"
 kumul.70.d: "For many centuries, while we were loyal to the regime in Dihua, we gained a large majority of our revenue through them. The actual region of Kumul is very small, so the taxes gained from it were lacking. Therefore, we gained most of our money from Xinjiang itself. The people of Kumul used to pay their taxes with livestock. Therefore, since taking direct control of Dihua, with tax collecting time of year has arrived, we have ran into a problem: we lack proper tax infrastructure. We do not have enough tax collectors, nor people to actually enforce the taxes. In many regions in the country, where infrastructure is especially poor, rogue tax collectors from the previous administration are still collecting taxes but hoarding them for themselves. We are now working on sending our tax collectors and forces under Yulbars Khan to go collect the taxes."
 kumul.70.a: "Damn!"

 kumul.71.t: "Ma Zhongying retreats to the hills"
 kumul.71.d: "Ever since we secured our reign over Xinjiang, Ma Zhongying has sat bored and tired of all the politicking. He came to Kumul originally to try to gain power, and now that he has been stopped, he has decided to retreat to the hills, to go back to his regular raiding and pillaging, promising to return should war break out. The people of Xinjiang, or at least those who don’t have to face his raiding, breathe a sigh of relief that Ma Zhongying no longer has a chance to take power across the province."
 kumul.71.a: "The Butcher has left the building."

 kumul.72.t: "Instituting Islamic Law"
 kumul.72.d: "The majority of the people in the Xinjiang region are of the Islamic faith. Our dynasty is of the Uyghur ethnicity, a Muslim ethnicity closer to the Turkic people of Central Asia than the Han of China. Therefore, it has been decided that the laws of the province will now more and more closely resemble those that are taught in Islam. However, much of the Han population who have moved to the province have been putting up large resistance against this move, saying we should be more secular."
 kumul.72.a: "They will soon learn."

 kumul.80.t: "Meeting with the Uyghur Rebels"
 kumul.80.d: "Hoja-Niyaz met with the old East Turkestan rebels, a risky gamble based on their shared ethnicity. The select few Hoja-Niyaz were recommended to him as their land was destroyed by the Xinjiang army. After several hours of communion at the Kumul madrassas, the Uyghur rebels have capitulated to Hoja-Niyaz. In return, Hoja-Niyaz will allow them into government for their help and stability."
 kumul.80.a: "Agabey!"

 kumul.81.t: "Trouble With Sharia Law"
 kumul.81.d: "Following the adoption of constitution in Kumul, the foundation is in place for the implementation Sharia law throughout Kumul. Immediately problems have arisen, as the last Mufti of Xinjiang fled to [773.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] decades ago. The appointment of a new Mufti is causing trouble as a result, because there exists no national protocol for choosing a Mufti among the Imams. To those who wearily joined Kumul, the fact that the independent East Turkestan was formulated in the Kashgar Madrassa has already discredited the future Mufti as a political tool rather than an independent jurist as required in the Quran."
 kumul.81.a: "If only we could get Shakib Arslan..."

 kumul.82.t: "Mongolian Rifle Deal"
 kumul.82.d: "It has become apparent to the administration that an exclusive trade deal with the Ottomans benefits them more than us. As a result, an intrepid agent of [KUM.GetLeader] has sought out Mongol traders. The Mongols, who are better at raiding Russia and China for weapons, are willing to trade. In return for a shipment of rifles, [KUM.GetLeader] has promised their value in fine Hotan rugs. "
 kumul.82.a: "A Good Deal."

 kumul.90.t: "Development of the Cities"
 kumul.90.d: "The centuries of political turmoil in China has bred a self-reliant generation in Kumul, one which shuns modern political thought and is made a pawn by illiteracy. In order to combat this widespread educational and ideological ignorance, [KUM.GetLeader] has lowered the price of settling in cities to an all-time low. This will hopefully encourage nomads to plant down roots in centres that [KUM.GetLeader] can more easily control."
 kumul.90.a: "Don't you dare call it westernisation!"

 kumul.91.t: "All Roads Lead to Dihua"
 kumul.91.d: "Fan Yaonan begins his plan, 'All Roads Lead to Dihua', a plan to construct roads across the nation leading to the capital of Dihua. This resolution is graciously received by the people of Kumul, who recall having to trek across the Taklamakan Desert to avoid the greedy marching armies. New roads to Dihua will also take advantage of the new oases that off the path of the roads."
 kumul.91.a: "Excellent."

 kumul.92.t: "Another Road to China"
 kumul.92.d: "The road between Kumul and Hexi was one of the most treacherous to travellers. From banditry to conmen, many traps litter this terminus of the Western Gate. To [KUM.GetLeader], the decrepit road is a major barrier to ever receiving aid from China. Therefore, [KUM.GetLeader] has called for the road to be repaved, and better security to clear out the bandits. "
 kumul.92.a: "Good Work."

 kumul.100.t: "A Feast in Kumul City"
 kumul.100.d: "For many months, ministers, bureaucrats and government officials have been working hard at securing Kumulilik control in Xinjiang. People have been working across the province, and communication has been slow. Therefore, [KUM.GetLeader] decided to call a great meeting in the city of Kumul, accompanied by an even greater feast. Though the stated intention of the gathering was to catch up on information and celebrated continued stability, it is clear this has more underlying motives. Many believe [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars Khan aim to stop the growing influence of multiple key figures in government: the renegade Uyghur Hoja-Niyaz, the Han bureaucrat Fan Yaonan, and the butcher of Gansu Ma Zhongying. Though they claim to be loyal to our government, many fear they may have other intentions...\n\nWith everyone arriving in Kumul, the city was bustling with activity. Soldiers, peasants, and bureaucrats all rushing around making preparations for the great meeting. Fan Yaonan arrived first, surrounded by a group of his Han loyalists, followed quickly by Hoja-Niyaz, arriving with a group of Uyghur soldiers from the mountains of Hotan. Finally, an hour later than expected, came Ma Zhongying, the stench of opium following his party of soldiers as they wandered through the city. They were all met by [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars, as they all went into the leaders palace. The meeting lasted hours, and many arguments were had. Hoja-Niyaz threatened to leave multiple times, and Ma Zhongying even pulled a gun right in the face of Yulbars. However, as the sun began to set, agreements were made, and peace was finally secured. Food was finally brought out for a great feast, were the men of the meeting rose a glass to stability in Xinjiang."
 kumul.100.a: "The Khanate is safe."

 kumul.101.t: "A Feast in Kumul City"
 kumul.101.d: "For many months, ministers, bureaucrats and government officials have been working hard at securing Kumulilik control in Xinjiang. People have been working across the province, and communication has been slow. Therefore, [KUM.GetLeader] decided to call a great meeting in the city of Kumul, accompanied by an even greater feast.

Soldiers, peasants, and bureaucrats all rushing around making preparations for the great meeting. Fan Yaonan arrived first, surrounded by a group of his Han loyalists. An hour later than expected, came Ma Zhongying, the stench of opium following his party of soldiers as they wandered through the city. However, someone was noticeably missing. Hoja-Niyaz, though he stated in a letter just the other day that he was to be joining, was no where to be seen. As [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars exchanged worried looks, the meeting was forced to begin without him.\n\nHowever, Hoja-Niyaz did intend to join the meeting. While he walked into the city of Kumul, behind him marched 500 loyal Uyghur soldiers. After killing the city's guards and Ma Zhongying’s soldiers, they surrounded the leaders palace, while Hoja-Niyaz walked into the meeting with 20 of his troops. Quickly they took over the meeting, arresting Fan Yaonan, Ma Zhongying, [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars Khan. It appears they most likely will not be seeing freedom again. With great influence in the government already, Hoja-Niyaz's power is already secure."
 kumul.101.a: "Hoja-Niyaz rules in Kumul."

 kumul.102.t: "A Feast in Kumul City"
 kumul.102.d: "For many months, ministers, bureaucrats and government officials have been working hard at securing Kumulilik control in Xinjiang.

As [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars exchanged worried looks, the meeting was forced to begin without him.\n\nHowever, Fan Yaonan did intend to join the meeting. While he walked into the city of Kumul, behind him marched 250 loyal Han soldiers. The city guards, instead of fighting off the force, joined Fan, having been paid off by him before he arrived. Ma Zhongying’s soldiers, distracted in an opium house, were easily dispatched. Following this, Fan's force surrounded the leaders palace, while Fan himself walked into the meeting with 20 of his troops. Quickly they took over the meeting, arresting Hoja-Niyaz, Ma Zhongying, [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars Khan. It appears they most likely will not be seeing freedom again. With great influence in the government already, Fan Yaonan's power is already secure."
 kumul.102.a: "Fan Yaonan rules in Kumul."

 kumul.103.t: "A Feast in Kumul City"
 kumul.103.d: "For many months, ministers, bureaucrats and government officials have been working hard at securing Kumulilik control in Xinjiang. People have been working across the province, and communication has been slow. Therefore, [KUM.GetLeader] decided to call a great meeting in the city of Kumul, accompanied by an even greater feast. Though the stated intention of the gathering was to catch up on information and celebrated continued stability, it is clear this has more underlying motives. Many believe [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars Khan aim to stop the growing influence of multiple key figures in government: the renegade Uyghur Hoja-Niyaz, the Han bureaucrat Fan Yaonan, and the butcher of Gansu Ma Zhongying. Though they claim to be loyal to our government, many fear they may have other intentions...\n\nWith everyone arriving in Kumul, the city was bustling with activity. Soldiers, peasants, and bureaucrats all rushing around making preparations for the great meeting. Fan Yaonan arrived first, surrounded by a group of his Han loyalists, followed quickly by Hoja-Niyaz, arriving with a group of Uyghur soldiers from the mountains of Hotan. However, someone was noticeably missing. Ma Zhongying, though he stated in a letter just the other day that he was to be joining, was no where to be seen. As [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars exchanged worried looks, the meeting was forced to begin without him.\n\nHowever, Ma Zhongying did intend to join the meeting. While he walked into the city of Kumul, behind him marched 500 of his loyal soldiers. After killing the city's guards, they surrounded the leaders palace, while Ma Zhongying walked into the meeting with 20 of his troops. Quickly they took over the meeting, arresting Fan Yaonan, [KUM.GetLeader] and Yulbars Khan. Right there in the meeting room, Ma Zhongying pulled out a pistol and shot each of the men in the back of the head. With great influence in the government already, Ma Zhongying's power is already secure."
 kumul.103.a: "Ma Zhongying rules in Kumul."

 kumul.110.t: "Opium Smuggling Crime Wave"
 kumul.110.d: "The industrious farmers of Kumul have managed to preserve their illegal opium crops during the war. Now, with the national emergency pulling police away from their posts to combat political violence, opium smugglers have quickly appeared in the villages. Fuelled by the demobbed soldiers of Yang Zengxin, who have little to live for in the new regime, opium dens spread. The Imams of Kumul who preached for years against what they saw as an imperialist conspiracy to destroy China and Islam are in despair."
 kumul.110.a: "We buy nice black police uniforms for nothing!"

 kumul.111.t: "Bandits Violate Kumul Border"
 kumul.111.d: "Common banditry, which was held at bay by a common cause against lawlessness, has returned to Kumul. Previously non-violent criminals like conmen, human traffickers and counterfeiters have bended together in a form of syndicate. The worst part being that some of these criminals are former state bureaucrats, whose authority still holds sway in the rural reaches of Kumul."
 kumul.111.a: "Well at least we don't need to pardon them."

 kumul.112.t: "The Best Opium in China"
 kumul.112.d: "Independent observers and recently convicted criminals attest to the new crime wave in Kumul. In their testimonies, they claim the opium in Kumul is the best in china. A brave reporter in Kumul has even apparently included a review of the drug scene in Kumul, explaining that he smoked opium to monitor its strength, 'which is how law enforcement does it.' The reporter then added that he tested it because he believes local opium consumption is now too strong — a development he blamed on [QIE.GetLeader], whom he claimed in his article has 'brain damaged a lot of people.'"
 kumul.112.a: "Perfect."

 kumul.113.t: "Emperor Puyi Recognises Kumul"
 kumul.113.d: "The recent news of the Manchu Restoration was initially tread with scepticism, as news from Beijing and the continued ignorance of their government towards the needs of their subjects have been proven repeatedly. However, a new proclamation from the young Emperor has shown his true grace and vision. The Emperor has given his support for our autonomy from Xinjiang, the rightful heritage of centuries stands together against modern autocratic terror of Jin Shuren."
 kumul.113.a: "Perfect."

 KUM_reordering_tax: "Re-Ordering Taxes"
 KUM_reordering_tax_desc: "The first demand of the Begs, the census and tax reform, can be done. Once a census of all tenants, free men and livestock is done, several forms of income, such as halal meat production and machine working can be exempt from taxation."

 KUM_opening_autonomy: "Opening Autonomy"
 KUM_opening_autonomy_desc: "Masqud Shah thought he could tighten his grip on power by closing the city to immigrants without Qing's authorisation. The Begs ask that additional Uyghur citizens be admitted into the city, and they be treated as free men."

 KUM_reform_administration: "Minor Administration Reforms"
 KUM_reform_administration_desc: "The palace in Kumul is staffed by totally unqualified bureaucrats. Masqud Shah did not employ anybody with an Imperial Examination score. By simply asking our administrators to seek certification, we can weed out the worst hangers-on."

 KUM_incorporate_advisory: "Adjusting the Advisory"
 KUM_incorporate_advisory_desc: "The power of the two Advisors has always been a risk to the Khanate. Especially with Hoja-Niyaz. If we were to deploy the advisors to the city walls, we could possibly slip reforms past them."

 KUM_increase_begs: "The 30 Begs"
 KUM_increase_begs_desc: "With the additional Uyghur people coming to Kumul, it is beneficial if we add nine more men to the graft. Thirty Begs may be unable to break a tie, but we can benefit from their advice."

 KUM_keys_kumul: "The Keys to Kumul"
 KUM_keys_kumul_desc: "The power of the garrison in Kumul has rested with the Advisors for decades now. The Begs promise that their Uyghur levies can man the city walls without extorting the people so heavily. This would alleviate our worries."

 KUM_kind_hand: "The Kind Hand"

 KUM_crush_corvee: "Crush the Corvée"
 KUM_crush_corvee_desc: "The use of corvée labour to keep land plots orderly and maintain the city was Masqud's idea. Under traditional islamic jurisprudence and Chinese civil law, corvée labour should not be used when the crimes of the labourers do not justify it."

 KUM_niyaz_ideals_desc: "Hoja-Niyaz, during his failed revolt against Nasīr's father, recalls his fighters fought better when they were supervised by an Imam and set aside time to pray each day.

 KUM_sideline_begs: "Side-lining the Begs"
 KUM_sideline_begs_desc: "The 21 Begs of Kumul are a relic of Masqud Shah's loneliness and feeling of alienation from fellow Muslims due to his drunkenness. It is best if the Advisors met with Nasīr without consulting the Begs first."

 KUM_maintaining_corvee: "Maintaining the Corvée"
 KUM_maintaining_corvee_desc: "Though it is cruel, the Advisors have justified the punishment of forced labour outside Islamic jurisprudence by claiming the criminals are on the verge of becoming fajir, stating that this work will tire out their energy to commit crimes."

 KUM_greater_taxes: "New Taxes"

 KUM_hire_more_tax_collectors_desc: "The garrison has chastised our tax collectors, who are still holding out for the hope that Nasīr will be released. We must now take in the garrison's suggested tax collectors, all of whom are Chinese and will extort the Uyghur mercilessly."

 KUM_even_higher_taxes: "Even Higher Taxes!"
 KUM_even_higher_taxes_desc: "The city people are unable to provide enough food for the annual tribute to Beijing. Which the garrison insists we still hoard, despite Beijing not asking for any in years. New taxes are being written, that the garrison believes will please Jin Shuren."

 KUM_seize_nobles_money_desc: "The Begs of the Khanate are being sought out by the garrison for additional taxation, under the auspice of national security. The families of the Begs are now in hiding with their gold, as both are targets of the garrison's grabbing hand."

 KUM_punish_opposition: "Punish the Opposition"

 KUM_road_through_hami_desc: "The road from Hami to Dihua is treacherous, stretching parallel to the Tarim Basin and surrounded by miles of desert on either sides. The garrison has ordered a new corvée to be assembled to fix the road in the heat. Return for the prisoners is unlikely."

Though these rebellions were crushed, the lingering resentment never went away and when Nasir succeeded his father in 1930, much of that resentment carried over to Nasir.
