 MEX_military_youth_desc: "Many disillusioned young men have seen fit to rebel against the government in the past, that's why the revolution was so popular among the younger generations.

 MEX_camps_for_syndies: "Work Camps"
 MEX_camps_for_syndies_desc: "A bullet is the simplest way of dealing with dissent, but not the most efficient one.

 MEX_army_modernization: "Modernise the Army"
 MEX_army_modernization_desc: "The Mexican armed forces are still using outdated equipment from the Weltkrieg-era and our military doctrines and tactics have also fallen behind the times over the past decade. Our nation is a major player in North and Central America, so our army should be modernised and expanded."

 MEX_guerilla_warfare: "Guerrilla Warfare"

 MEX_citizen_soldier: "Citizen Soldiers"
 MEX_citizen_soldier_desc: "A guerrilla force should not only be made up of professional soldiers, but every citizen should also be able to participate in the fight against the enemy. With special citizen militias, we can make sure that every citizen will be able to fulfil his duties."
 MEX_decentralized_command: "Decentralised Command"
 MEX_decentralized_command_desc: "It is difficult to command a guerrilla unit in the deserts of Sonora or the jungles of Yucatan from Mexico City. Our command structure should be more decentralised with local commanders having enough autonomy to perform well during guerrilla attacks."
 MEX_recon_scouts: "Recon Scouts"
 MEX_recon_scouts_desc: "Ambushes can be very powerful, like the Afghans have shown in their constant wars against the British imperialists. However, an ambush is useless if no enemy ever arrives.

 MEX_small_unit_tactics: "Small Unit Tactics"
 MEX_small_unit_tactics_desc: "Ambush units are usual on the same level of manpower as squads, maybe platoons, but an entire division doesn't create a good local ambush. Our army should function on the basis of small units, so our tactics and command structure need to be reworked."

 MEX_desert_training: "Desert Training"

 MEX_jungle_training: "Jungle Training"

 MEX_solderas_desc: "During the Mexican Revolution, many women fought for the principles of the revolution.

 MEX_mechanized_warfare: "Mechanised Warfare"
 MEX_mechanized_warfare_desc: "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, and while the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher, the strength of a Mexican tank is the highest! We need to mechanise our forces so that no regular enemy force can defeat us."

 MEX_general_staff: "General Staff Reforms"

 MEX_professional_army_desc: "The goal of our major military reforms is to create a professional, modern army.

 MEX_grand_navy: "Grand Navy"

 MEX_battleships: "Battleship Development"
 MEX_battleships_desc: "The Anáhuac is the largest ship of our navy, yet it is more than three decades old and will not be able to compete with modern capital ships. We need to develop our own proper battleship to serve as the new flagship of our navy."
 MEX_battle_cruisers: "Battlecruiser Development"
 MEX_battle_cruisers_desc: "Our naval industrial capacity is quite limited, so it will prove a difficult task to build up a force consisting of large battleships. We should accompany our larger capital ships with smaller but effective battlecruisers."

 MEX_naval_aircraft: "Naval Aviation"
 MEX_naval_aircraft_desc: "The air force has become a vital part of the military. While some doubt the efficacy of aircraft to perform precision strikes, most are convinced that they will play a major role in the future ground and naval battles. The navy has requested the formation of a naval aviation branch."

 MEX_marine_focus: "Fuerza de Infantería de Marina"
 MEX_marine_focus_desc: "Sometimes, it is easier to bypass the enemy forces by sea than to fight through entrenched lines in difficult terrain. While naval operations like the Battle of Gallipoli have failed, the invasion from the sea might become a viable military tactic."

 MEX_protect_trade: "Protect Trade"
 MEX_protect_trade_desc: "Our navy will simply never be able to compete with the major navies of the world, so instead of trying to compete nonetheless, we should focus on defending our trade lines instead. While we can't beat the US fleet, we can beat pirates and raiders."
 MEX_coast_guard: "Coast Guard"
 MEX_coast_guard_desc: "Our nation has a large coastline, both along the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, which provides enough hiding places for raiders and smugglers. We need to patrol our coasts to stop these criminals."

 MEX_destroyers_desc: "A large battleship is not very suited for convoy escort missions. Instead, we should invest in small escort destroyers which can protect our convoys will being cost-efficient and reliable."
 MEX_heavy_cruisers: "Heavy Cruisers"
 MEX_heavy_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers form the middle ground between battleships and destroyers. They are jack of all trades, but they still are subdivided into various classes. In case we ever need to engage a more regular fleet, we will need heavier cruisers to serve as 'mini-battleships'."
 MEX_submarines: "Submarine Development"
 MEX_submarines_desc: "We will need to protect our trade lines, but that doesn't stop us from raiding the trade lines of our enemies. Submarines are perfectly suited for convoy raiding missions, so we should invest more into the silent death from below the sea line."

 MEX_light_cruisers_desc: "A heavy cruiser is well suited for engaging as a regular fighting vessel, but most of our adversaries won't be fielding anything heavier than destroyers or similar ships. In order to save on resources, light cruisers are the way to go."

# Air Force #
 MEX_air: "Fuerza Aérea Mexicana"

 MEX_air_ports: "Build Airports"

 MEX_air_defense: "Air Defence"
 MEX_air_defense_desc: "We aren't the only ones to build up an air force... far from it actually. Our air force will most likely be on the defence if we have to face the major counter-revolutionary and imperalist air forces, so we should aid them from the ground."
 MEX_air_supremecy: "Air Supremacy"
 MEX_air_supremecy_desc: "In order to effectively support our ground and naval forces and in order to defend them from enemy bombers, our air force needs to focus on gaining and defending air superiority."

 MEX_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 MEX_army_air_support_desc: "Many of our adversaries, most notably counter-revolutionary Central American countries, lack an air force, so we should focus on supporting our army from the air. We will not be able to challenge the air forces of the Entente, so we should focus on exploiting the weakness of our smaller rivals."
 MEX_bombers: "Bomber Research"
 MEX_bombers_desc: "Using small aircraft armed with nothing more than machine guns to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry will be almost impossible. We need large aircraft with multiple engines to deliver a large bomb payload to the enemy."
 MEX_radar: "RADAR Development"
 MEX_radar_desc: "RADAR, which stands for radio detection and ranging, is a new method of detection which will be quite useful for the air force. With RADAR installations, we will be able to detect incoming aircraft outside of viewing distance so that we can alarm the air force quickly enough."
 MEX_expand_air_ports: "Expand Airports"
 MEX_expand_air_ports_desc: "Our air force is constantly expanding, but our airfields can't keep up. Their capacity limits will soon be exceeded, and we found out that you can't takeoff an aircraft from the jungle... we will need to expand our airfields quickly."
 MEX_paratroopers: "Paratroopers"
 MEX_paratroopers_desc: "The Battle of Gallipoli has shown that seaborne invasions are quite difficult to perform, but airborne invasions haven't been tried yet. We should build up an airborne unit that can jump behind enemy lines to cut supply lines and ambush retreating forces."
 MEX_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
 MEX_rule_the_skies_desc: "The Mexican air force shall rule the skies... well the skies of Central America at least. It will still take quite a while until we can compete with the air forces of the Entente..."

### Events - start up ###

 mexico.1.t: "Mexico - A few years ago"
 mexico.1.d: "Mexico has been transformed in the recent years. In 1910 the Mexican Revolution began against Porfirio Díaz and would last nearly a decade. By 1917 Venustiano Carranza had become the president, however, he quickly proved to anger other revolutionaries when he embarked on a campaign to destroy his political rivals including Zapata. This would lead to the Plan de Agua Prieta by a number of military and political leaders and lead to Álvaro Obregón to becoming the President of Mexico. From here the chaos of the revolution would wind down as the government of Mexico began a period of stabilisation.\n\nThe first term of Álvaro Obregón would see improved relations with the United States, especially after Pancho Villa was made Ambassador to the Commune of France and Adolfo de la Huerta was able to finally get the Yankees to recognise the current government of Mexico as the legitimate government of Mexico. The economy would start to be improved especially in the south where Zapata held power and was able to implement the land reforms more comprehensively than they were being implemented elsewhere in the country. Obregón would work to improve labour rights though this would spark a new conflict between the two big unions - Confederación Regional Obrera Mexicana or CROM and the more syndicalist Confederación General de Trabajadores or CGT. However, all was not well in Mexico there was the growing tension from the Catholic population due to the draconian anti-clerical laws that were written into the Constitution against the Catholic Church."
 mexico.1.a: "And then?"

 mexico.300.t: "Mexico in 1936"
 mexico.300.d: "Obregón would be succeeded by Adolfo de la Huerta who would continue for the most part the same general policies. However, his term would have a number of international incidents for him to deal with. Notably the British Revolution and the subsequent Great Depression in the United States which would send shock-waves down southward and effect the economy of Mexico. This would all trigger conflicts in Central America, notably in Nicaragua, where Zapata would go and help spread his brand of revolutionary ideals southward. However, none of this was the most controversial thing de la Huerta did. That would be the rewriting of the term limits, so that Obregón could run for a second term, which of course Obregón won.\n\nHowever in 1932, Zapata would be elected on a Socialist and populist platform. Zapata's term would focus on the economy, particularly the agrarian sector with improvements on the working conditions and rights of peasants of the ejidos, or communal land under usufructuary property. Work to improve the rights of the peasants and natives within Mexico would be his main focus during his first term. However, his policies would anger the conservatives and Catholics even more. A more unpopular measure with the conservatives was the change to electoral law, restricting maximum terms to 1 but lengthening the duration of each term to 5 years. His overtures to the International would cause tension with the US as was his policy of land redistribution.\n\nAs 1936 dawns many wonder what form the future of Mexico will take."
 mexico.300.a: "¡Viva México!"

On the other hand, Democracy has quickly become part of the Mexican culture, and with liberal and conservative parties pressuring the junta to restore at least some semblance of democratic rule, perhaps it would be best if instead of a dictatorship, we pursued a slow transition towards democracy..."

### National Populist events ###

 mexico.100.t: "Patria vs La Raza"
 mexico.100.d: "Synarchism as an ideology is still in its infancy, with the main unifying factor being a resistance to liberalism and secularism. Under the Synarchist banner there exist both Legionarists following the pattern of the Iron Guard, and the other followers of La Raza. The inherent conflict between these forces concerns their racial policies. The Synarchist leadership under Salvador Abascal sees the traditional caste system of Mexico as the correct social order, including the enshrinement of Catholic priests. La Raza as promoted by José Vasconcelos proports the idea of a Hispanic race as the true ideal of Mexican patriotism. These ideas are more similar to Integralism in Brazil than Legionarism. The party has begun to split with La Raza members becoming disillusioned with the lack of support they receive within the party. How can we correct this?"

##Army Generals##

 MEX_emiliano_zapata_salazar_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L August 8, in Anenecuilco, Morelos, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Emiliano Zapata Salazar's military career began shortly after his political activism began, when he was forcefully conscripted into the 9th Cavalry regiment under Alfonso Pradillo in 1908, where he began experiencing the benefits and drawbacks of military life. With the Plan de San Luis going into effect and the death of Pablo Torres Burgos, Emiliano was chosen by the Southern Revolutionary Junta as the new revolutionary chief of the Southern Maderista Army. His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties. In order to increase recruitment, he promised every soldier who signed up with him a piece of arable land for themselves in exchange for their help in the revolution, and this tactic proved to be extremely successful with the disenfranchised peasants of the Mexican countryside."
 MEX_francisco_pancho_villa_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known by his pseudonym, Francisco Villa or his nickname 'Pancho Villa', has become a living legend for the people of Mexico. He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his successor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua. He'd anger the American government in 1916 after attacking the small town of Columbus in New Mexico, which lead to the Punitive Expedition led by John Pershing, who was never able to catch Villa despite all his efforts. Villa has since then played a major role in the Revolutionary army and Mexico's politics. He is a respected member of the General staff, although he's been seen lately dabbling more on politics than learning military strategy.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Agrarista."
 MEX_plutarco_elias_calles_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 25, 1877, in Guaynas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano, born in an accommodated landlord family, graduated as a teacher in 1894 and dedicated to his teaching profession in Hermosillo and Guaynas, while trying to administrate the family business. When he moved to Agua Prieta, Governor José María Maytorena named him deputy. After the Decena Trágica, Calles began recruiting men from Agua Prieta to oppose Victoriano Huerta and in 1913 would join up the revolutionary forces to fight. Calles ended up under the direct orders of Alvaró Obregon, and became colonel and commander of Hermosillo by late 1913. In October of 1914, Calles successfully defended the city of Naco for three months, managing to hold against all odds, and due to this he was turned into Brigadier General by February 1915. With the success of the Plan de Agua Prieta and Obregon's rise to power, Calles became his second in command, and would become a vital member of the staff for years to come, although he has been seen dabbling more into politics in the recent years.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario.\n-He has a very strict moral standard, and he sees both alcohol and religion as dangerous for the mind of both his soldiers and his people."

He was one of the first revolutionaries to take up arms against Porfirio Diaz and took part in several of the early battles of the revolution. In May 1911, he took Cananea and Naco, and due to this he was ascended to Cavalry Colonel by Francisco Madero himself. He would become Commander in February 1912, and in 1913 he'd join Victoriano Huerta's forces. He'd be then selected to carry out low risk operations and was generally chosen as military governor by Obregón as a more conciliatory man than his colleagues like Maytorena and Callés. He has since then taken part in several diplomatic missions to other South American countries, and remains a very respected member of the staff, even being known as 'The cleanest military man from the revolution'\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Apathetic to Politics."
 MEX_pablo_quiroga_escamilla_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 7, 1875, in Cienaga de Flores, Nuevo León, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Pablo Quiroga Escamilla incorporated into the constitutionalist army in 1913, and was under the orders of Manuel M. Diéguez. With the Volunteer corp and the 13th Battalion of Lancers, Escamilla lead several expeditions in Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. He assisted in the Battle of Santa Ros, the siege of Guaymas and fight for Oredáin. He was promoted to colonel in 1914, taking part in another series of operations in Silao y Trinidad, Guanajuato, Queretaro and Durango. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General, and would take part in another 25 expeditions throughout the revolution and in the post-revolutionary era.

He was initially under the command of Gertrudis G. Sanchéz, but would continually switch sides during the revolution until joining the Army of Operations under the command of Álvaro Obregón. He was commendated for bravery at the Battle of Celaya. In 1916, he fought in Morelos and in Mexico City against the Zapatist forces, executing several civilians under the fear that they were going to betray Obregon's troops. In 1918, he operated in Durango and Chihuahua against the Villistas, and in 1920 he joined the Plan de Agua Prieta, which catapulted him to the rank of Brigadier General. Since then he has been named Headmaster of military education at the Heroico Colegio Militar, and he has held his post since then, encouraging discipline and technical expertise over raw manpower, and propagated sports and cultural activities through popular libraries in the barracks.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- His relations with both Zapata and Villa are sour at best. Fighting against them in the revolution have made Joaquin very wary of his new colleagues."
 MEX_francisco_luis_urquizo_benavides_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 21, 1891, in San Pedro de las Colinas, Coahuila, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Francisco Luis Urquizo Benavides joined the revolution in 1911 in Coahuila under the orders of Emilio Madero, where he'd later be assigned as one of Francisco Madero's personal guard, fighting alongside Madero in the Decena Tragica.

With his battalion, he was able to fight and capture Candela for Carranza, he'd take part in the capture of the Torreón and would assist in the attack on Monterrey Francisco Villa's Northern Division.

He was ascended to colonel in 1916, and would later take part in the Plan de Agua Prieta, which gained him enough prestige to become military governor of Baja California until 1930.
