### Ideas ###
 FRA_communard_spirit: "Communard Spirit"
 FRA_communard_spirit_desc: "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

 FRA_to_war_idea: "Revanchist Rearmament"
 FRA_to_war_idea_desc: "Our nation must rise again if we are to defeat the Imperialists!"

 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar: "Renseignements Généraux"
 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux serve as the eyes and ears of the Commune, gathering intelligence on both domestic and international threats to our proletarian dream. But the RG's mission goes beyond mere security. They are also responsible for promoting the values and principles of our socialist revolution, both at home and abroad. Through their intelligence gathering and analysis, they help shape our foreign policy and are the first deployed in our efforts to break the global chains of Capital.\n\nWith sympatisers in every factory still owned by the bourgeoisie, our networks are unmatched."

 FRA_economic_reforms_anar: "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco: "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms: "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_desc: "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_military_buildup_two_idea: "Calibrated Economy"
 FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc: "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

 FRA_ruralism_idea: "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_idea_desc: "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

 FRA_market_socialism_idea: "Market Socialism"
 FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc: "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

 FRA_mass_production_idea: "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_idea_desc: "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

 FRA_modern_farms_idea: "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc: "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

 FRA_war_eco_agri_idea: "War, Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc: "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

 FRA_inter_coop_idea: "International Cooperation"
 FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc: "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

 FRA_dedication_idea: "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_dedication_idea_desc: "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

 FRA_industrialization_idea: "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_industrialization_idea_desc: "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Ambroise Croizat, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

 FRA_mass_fire_support_idea: "Mass Fire Support"
 FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc: "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

 FRA_mass_motorisation_idea: "Mass Motorisation"
 FRA_mass_motorisation_idea_desc: "Motorisation enables our forces to move quickly to where they are needed most, outmanoeuvring our enemies and striking where they are weakest. It will also reduce the physical strain of prolonged marching and improve the overall morale of our comrades in the field. Thus, we must invest in the necessary resources to ensure that our armies are fully motorised, and thus ever mightier, faster in their defence - and spread - of the Revolution."

 FRA_empower_rifleman_idea: "Empower the Rifleman"
 FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc: "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

 FRA_military_academy_idea: "Military Academy"
 FRA_military_academy_idea_desc: "We have to face the harsh reality that the Great War led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

 FRA_centralized_hc_idea: "Centralised High Command"
 FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc: "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

 FRA_tank_quality_line_idea: "Quality Tank Production"
 FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc: "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

 FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea: "Tank Assembly Line"
 FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc: "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

 FRA_fast_army_idea: "Speed Cult"
 FRA_fast_army_idea_desc: "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next War will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

 FRA_Red_Army: "Grande Armée Rouge"
 FRA_Red_Army_desc: "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

 FRA_working_women_idea: "Working Women"
 FRA_working_women_idea_desc: "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

 FRA_bhartiya_support: "French Military Support"
 FRA_bhartiya_support_desc: "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

 FRA_amenagement_idea: "Aménagement of the Territory"
 FRA_amenagement_idea_desc: "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

 FRA_plan_prost_idea: "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc: "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes: "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc: "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the French Communal Police."

 FRA_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 FRA_secret_police_desc: "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

 FRA_demo_surete: "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
 FRA_demo_surete_desc: "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

 FRA_hawkish_renseignements: "Revolutionary Renseignements"
 FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support Syndicalist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

 FRA_peace_renseignements: "Protective Renseignements"
 FRA_peace_renseignements_desc: "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea: "Peaceful Revolution"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc: "The International Syndicalist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

 FRA_amateur_pilots_idea: "Amateur Pilots"
 FRA_amateur_pilots_idea_desc: "There are many in our country that have taken up flying as a hobby or a vocation, but not all of them pursue careers in the Air Force. They should preferably be drafted to our air force, where their skills will increase our chances of finding the new Aces of the Air."

 FRA_ecole_air_idea: "École de l'Air"
 FRA_ecole_air_idea_desc: "Flying is a skill by itself, and flying well in combat conditions is something that you can't just learn overnight. We won't repeat the mistakes of the Great War and its butcher of novice pilots, we need a large roster of well trained air pilots, and competent officers to lead them."

 FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea: "Waves of Syndicalism"
 FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea_desc: "The Commune's navy is mighty, and its reach is as far as we desire it to be. While we might lack the plentiful, worldwide ports of the French Empire of old, we still aim to have a navy that can intervene to any corner of the world at any time."

 FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea: "Cut off the Capitalists"
 FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea_desc: "The capitalists still pride themselves of their colonial territories. The fruit of their plunders still flow freely across the high seas. But if we have a say about it, we will ensure the stolen properties of the African, Asian and American workers will not enrich them."

 French_Revanchism_idea: "French Revanchism"
 French_Revanchism_idea_desc: "We have long prepared ourselves for this inevitable war. We have long cast away Pétain and his creed, but this does not mean we will forget what our brothers died for in the Ardennes, in Verdun, in the Chemin des Dames. We will avenge them, and once and for all regain what we deserved for our struggle."

 Revolutionary_spirit: "Revolutionary Spirit"
 Revolutionary_spirit_desc: "The survival and prosperity of the Syndicalist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

 FRA_socialist_education_idea: "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc: "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

 COF_prodcsaplanes: "Producing Aircraft for the CSA"

 FRA_avantgarde_idea: "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_avantgarde_idea_desc: "A united socialist artstyle, from art to music, could be a powerful tool that will help masses in the non-syndicalist world get interested in our ideals - through entertainment."

### Focuses ###
 commune_of_france_focus: "Commune of France Focus Tree"

 FRA_amenagement: "Aménagement du Territoire"
 FRA_amenagement_desc: "Our territory is vast and inequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
 FRA_hydroelectricity: "Hydroelectricity"
 FRA_hydroelectricity_desc: "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
 FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity: "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
 FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc: "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
 FRA_chemins_de_fer: "Office des Chemins de Fer"
 FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc: "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
 FRA_mining_expansion: "Mining Expansion"
 FRA_mining_expansion_desc: "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
 FRA_plan_prost: "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_desc: "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
 FRA_autoroutes: "The Autoroutes"
 FRA_autoroutes_desc: "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

 FRA_eco_direction: "Direction of the Economy"
 FRA_eco_direction_desc: "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
 FRA_orth_syndicalism: "Orthodox Syndicalism"
 FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc: "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
 FRA_reduce_unemploy: "Reducing Unemployment"
 FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc: "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
 FRA_work_design_coop: "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
 FRA_work_design_coop_desc: "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
 FRA_improve_manage: "Improve Management of Unions"
 FRA_improve_manage_desc: "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
 FRA_dedication: "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_dedication_desc: "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
 FRA_fac_towns: "Factory Towns"
 FRA_fac_towns_desc: "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
 FRA_Industrialisation: "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_Industrialisation_desc: "Ambroise Croizat is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
 FRA_inter_coop: "International Cooperation"
 FRA_inter_coop_desc: "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
 FRA_war_eco_agri: "War Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_eco_agri_desc: "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
 FRA_modern_farms: "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_desc: "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
 FRA_war_industry: "A War Industry"
 FRA_war_industry_desc: "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
 FRA_mass_production: "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_desc: "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
 FRA_cooperatives: "Cooperatives"
 FRA_cooperatives_desc: "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
 FRA_decentralized_industry: "Decentralised Industry"
 FRA_decentralized_industry_desc: "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
 FRA_market_socialism: "Market Socialism"
 FRA_market_socialism_desc: "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
 FRA_ruralism: "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_desc: "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

 FRA_communal_army: "The Communal Army"
 FRA_communal_army_desc: "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Great War with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass motorisation. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
 FRA_principe_concentration: "Principe de Concentration"
 FRA_principe_concentration_desc: "As the bourgeois butchery of the Great War showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
 FRA_tank_research: "Tank Research Grants"
 FRA_tank_research_desc: "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
 FRA_fast_army: "Speed Cult"
 FRA_fast_army_desc: "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
 FRA_tank_assembly_line: "Tank Assembly Lines"
 FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc: "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
 FRA_tank_quality_line: "Quality Production"
 FRA_tank_quality_line_desc: "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
 FRA_centralized_hc: "Centralised High Command"
 FRA_centralized_hc_desc: "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
 FRA_analysing_wki: "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
 FRA_analysing_wki_desc: "The Great War, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
 FRA_war_experience: "War Experience"
 FRA_war_experience_desc: "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
 FRA_military_academy: "Military Academy"
 FRA_military_academy_desc: "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
 FRA_officers_initiative: "Officer's Initiative"
 FRA_officers_initiative_desc: "How often during the Great War have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
 FRA_mission_type: "Mission Type Tactics"
 FRA_mission_type_desc: "Our plans are not meant to be task lists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
 FRA_flexible_support: "Flexible Support"
 FRA_flexible_support_desc: "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
 FRA_empower_rifleman: "Empower the Rifleman"
 FRA_empower_rifleman_desc: "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
 FRA_mass_conscription: "Mass Motorisation"
 FRA_mass_conscription_desc: "The War showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
 FRA_improve_manufactures: "Improve the Manufactures"
 FRA_improve_manufactures_desc: "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
 FRA_global_organization: "Global Organisation"
 FRA_global_organization_desc: "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
 FRA_mass_fire_support: "Mass Fire Support"
 FRA_mass_fire_support_desc: "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
 FRA_grand_army_reform: "Grand Army Reform"
 FRA_grand_army_reform_desc: "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

 FRA_equipment_modern: "Modern Equipment"
 FRA_equipment_modern_desc: "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
 FRA_special_forces: "Alpine Forces"
 FRA_special_forces_desc: "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
 FRA_tank_division: "Tank Divisions"
 FRA_tank_division_desc: "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
 FRA_road_to_war: "The Road to War"
 FRA_road_to_war_desc: "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first World War was not the last."
 FRA_renseignements_generaux: "The Renseignements Généraux"
 FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc: "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
 FRA_military_buildup: "Military Build-up"
 FRA_military_buildup_desc: "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
 FRA_military_buildup_two: "Calibrating the Economy"
 FRA_military_buildup_two_desc: "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
 FRA_socialist_education: "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_desc: "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
 FRA_Our_time_has_come: "Revanchist Propaganda"
 FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc: "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Belfort and Briey. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
 FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals: "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
 FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc: "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
 FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute: "Blanqui Research Institute"
 FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc: "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
 FRA_military_buildup_three: "Further Military Development"
 FRA_military_buildup_three_desc: "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
 FRA_military_science: "Military Science"
 FRA_military_science_desc: "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
 FRA_synthetic_refineries: "Synthetic Resources"
 FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc: "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium are all lacking and we must not rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research new ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
 FRA_secret_weaponry: "Electric Machines"
 FRA_secret_weaponry_desc: "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing. Our mathematicians already assure use that those new machines are of a tremendous help for rapid and efficient calculus. Given some patronage and time, we can only imagine the possibilities of this new field."
 FRA_damocles: "The Damocles Project"
 FRA_damocles_desc: "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference during the Second Internationale Congress, a reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
 FRA_nuclear_weapons: "Curie Project"
 FRA_nuclear_weapons_desc: "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by the Union of Britain to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs. Regardless, we must persevere and try to figure out what uses we can make of the atom. We will dedicate this project to the very woman who discovered Radium and set us on this path."
 FRA_German_borders: "Fortify the German Border"
 FRA_German_borders_desc: "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse River and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
 FRA_extend_line: "Extend the Line"
 FRA_extend_line_desc: "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead. The solution is quite simple, we will not have weak points. Least they learn how to walk on water, good luck for them to cross this line!"
 FRA_Demand_Romandy: "Demand Haute-Savoie"
 FRA_Demand_Romandy_desc: "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long! The Swiss have shown themselves brutish tyrants and oppressors of our people on our own rightful land! No-one can have the audacity to persecute and hunt down Frenchmen and think they may get away with it, the perfidious Swiss have made their last mistake."
 FRA_war_with_spain: "Liberate Iberia"
 FRA_war_with_spain_desc: "Right at our southern border, just across the Pyrenees, capitalism and imperialism still persists. With our efforts, we will achieve what no French imperialist could - total control of Iberia. But we are different. We do it for the common people, not imperial ambitions. Syndicalism will succeed in Iberia!"
 FRA_War_with_germany: "Take Down Germany"
 FRA_War_with_germany_desc: "The French people shall wait no longer! The time has finally come - the Revolution shall prevail, and our brothers will be avenged for what they have been put through in the Great War! Germany will just wish they had lost the first war, for we will stop at nothing until they are utterly destroyed!"
 FRA_War_with_austria: "The Red Danube"
 FRA_War_with_austria_desc: "The Danubian peoples have proven their incapability to commence a successful socialist revolution in their country and liberate themselves from the Habsburg tyranny. We shall assist them, then. Likewise, all the peoples still under the tyranny of this anachronistic empire will be freed. Europe will be free of the last of the reactionary empires."
 FRA_War_with_Netherlands: "Around Ludendorff"
 FRA_War_with_Netherlands_desc: "Lowlands of Benelux are strategically vital to our war efforts. The Germans will not expect the attack from this side and if we succeed, we will cut Germany off from its vital economic areas in the Rhineland. Germany will fall."
 FRA_World_revolution: "World Revolution"
 FRA_World_revolution_desc: "With the Revolution now well established in Europe, we can start to look outwards and launch a formidable plan to liberate the whole world from the reactionaries and imperialists. Our struggle will end once the last of them is tried before the people for their crimes. Vive la République Socialiste Mondiale!"
 FRA_european_revolution: "European Revolution"
 FRA_european_revolution_desc: "While the idea of a World Revolution is noble, we have to stay realistic. With smart influence and no other reactionary power to oppose us, we shall soon see the other continents convert to Syndicalism. However, we must ensure that Europe is free of reactionaries. Vive la République Socialiste Européene!"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution: "Peaceful Revolution"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution_desc: "We hear those who claim that the Revolution cannot end, and it will not. However, we cannot afford to constantly wage war in all corners of the world without cause. The workers will find their way as we act as a beacon of desires. Let us focus on ourselves instead. Vive la République Socialiste Française!"

 FRA_Host_the_Internationale: "The Internationale Congress"
 FRA_Host_the_Internationale_desc: "Heads of Socialist, Syndicalist, and Totalist parties, Heads of State and Governments, Foreign Ministers and journalists have all arrived in Paris for the opening of the First Congress of the Third Internationale. We are first to host the Congress and humbly hope to use it to establish ourselves as the leading socialist country in the world."
 FRA_mission_bhartiya: "Mission to the Bharatiya Commune"
 FRA_mission_bhartiya_desc: "The Bharatiya Commune asked for our support in their struggle against its neighbours, the Delhi imperialists and the Princely Federation reactionaries. They ask of us that we send military advisors to train their officers and their troops. We will ensure this aid arrives rapidly, so that they may unite India faster."
 FRA_arab_committee: "Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 FRA_arab_committee_desc: "The traitors of the French people, bastard Petain and his clique of friends, use the native proletariat in efforts to return to the mainland. We won't give them such a chance. Our Algerian comrade Mohamed Saïl, living in France, proposed to us the idea of supporting socialist liberation movements across all of Africa, for the good of all Africans."
 FRA_working_women: "Working Women"
 FRA_working_women_desc: "During the Congress, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. We supported her arguments and now we are ready to implement common sense reforms regarding the status of working women in our society. The reactionaries can gawk, we will surely have the last laugh."
 FRA_avantgarde: "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_avantgarde_desc: "For too long have traditional arts and classical music dominated the entertainment of the masses. While Jazz is enjoyable and widely popular in our countries, one genre cannot fight against all others. We have to create new ones, we have to show the world, what the real entertainment is. And it will show to the world that we are the good force of this era!"
 FRA_second_inter_congress: "The Second Internationale Congress"
 FRA_second_inter_congress_desc: "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to consider its approach towards the Global Revolution. Since the first Congress of the Internationale took place in France, the second one will take place in Britain."
 FRA_scientific_cooperation: "International Scientific Cooperation"
 FRA_scientific_cooperation_desc: "It is clear that we cannot simply keep our own technological discoveries to ourselves. During a meeting at the old university of Cambridge, we decided to establish a worldwide plan to combine the technological advances of Socialist countries. Some however, call for a more ambitious plan, including industrial investment."
 FRA_third_inter_congress: "The Victory Congress"
 FRA_third_inter_congress_desc: "The responsibility of holding the Third Congress has once again fallen back to us, with the new site chosen for the task being the Palace Populaire, where the Louvre once stood full of the plunders of the French Empire. Fittingly, one of the topics at hand concerns finally liberating the African continent."

 FRA_armee_de_lair: "Armée de l'Air du Peuple"
 FRA_armee_de_lair_desc: "Planes are a strange new aspect of warfare. These machines are quite complex to handle, and the punishment for failing to fly properly obvious. And yet, any able man can be a pilot. We must open the ranks of the air force to the conscripts, like the army and navy has. Our air force will have no shortage of pilots."
 FRA_amateur_pilots: "Amateur Pilots"
 FRA_amateur_pilots_desc: "No one is born a pilot. While some study to excel at air handling and combat with admirable effort, we cannot expect every single pilot to be an ace. We must give civilian pilots and amateur pilots their chance to shine. This also includes women, who would normally not be conscripted."
 FRA_valin_doctrine: "Valin Doctrine"
 FRA_valin_doctrine_desc: "Martial Valin is a brilliant aviator, and he has much to teach us about this new, strange world of air warfare. While his words are no gospel, we heavily value his unique experience and aim to make his teachings the frame of future air doctrine. A start, certainly."
 FRA_ecole_air: "École de l'Air"
 FRA_ecole_air_desc: "As our air doctrine rapidly expands and air fights go from disorganised brawls to carefully crafted engagements, we desperately begin to need trained pilots and trained officers who can plan air campaigns as they plan land or naval campaigns. Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
 FRA_air_bases: "Establish More Air Bases"
 FRA_air_bases_desc: "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours. As such, we must ensure our air base coverage is excellent, and we must make sure we are always under capacity so that our air force is never crippled by lacking infrastructure."
 FRA_fighters: "Fighter Focus"
 FRA_fighters_desc: "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for our enemies, and as such it is a new angle of defence for us. Unlike on land, there are no forts, no cover, just one-on-one dogfights. If we invest in fighter production, we ensure no-one will freely navigate our air. Our fighters will always be upon them and ready to bring them back to the ground."
 FRA_bombers: "Bomber Focus"
 FRA_bombers_desc: "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet. Bombs present a simple yet elegant way of transporting ordnance from the hangar to the target. We must invest in bombers to ensure that our enemies are assaulted from all sides, an advantage we cannot ignore."
 FRA_strat_bombers: "Strategic Destruction Focus"
 FRA_strat_bombers_desc: "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better. Further developments in bomber models have unveiled new airframes capable of carrying massive amounts of bombs, or a few devastatingly big bombs. Whatever the case, we may soon flatten entire cities or armies with a few waves of air attacks."
 FRA_paratrooper_focus: "Paratroopers Development"
 FRA_paratrooper_focus_desc: "Until now, we have always assumed that the only ways to transport troops are trucks and landing craft. However, recent breakthroughs in aviation means we now have planes capable of carrying entire squads, and dropping them into battle in a safe manner. We must immediately train regiments capable of this vertical encirclement!"
 FRA_rocket_development: "Rocketry Effort"
 FRA_rocket_development_desc: "The rocket engine is the pinnacle of our research in new propulsion methods for aircraft. While the path to creating rocket craft might still be long and arduous, our scientists propose a simpler use for rockets. By strapping an explosive charge and flinging them at the enemy, we can bomb them from afar. Simple, devastating."

 FRA_navy_focus: "Naval Reorganisation Programme"
 FRA_navy_focus_desc: "While we currently have an acceptable navy, it is quite disorganised, preventing us from expanding it any further. We must integrate our naval forces back into the hierarchy of the Communal Forces. Just because we do not have a grand navy yet, does not mean we do not have a navy."
 FRA_arsenaux_back_on: "Put the Arsenaux Back On"
 FRA_arsenaux_back_on_desc: "The naval dockyards have for long been silent, abandoned in favour of military factories and civilian needs. Today, we will reinvest into those old Arsenaux, staff them again, and fund them so that we might once again have a navy that compares with the one of the Republic."
 FRA_old_doctrine: "The Old Doctrine"
 FRA_old_doctrine_desc: "Our navy is one grand ensemble, slowly navigating the seas, ready to lay waste to the navies of our enemies. They protect our convoys, fight off marauders and stand ready to face any large fleet with the full might of the entire French navy. Why change what is not broken?"
 FRA_new_doctrine: "The New Doctrine"
 FRA_new_doctrine_desc: "Our navy is a tool, to be applied carefully when the situation calls for it. Instead of falling for the enemy's bait and joining into those massive open-seas scrapyards, we must seek to strike their convoys, their isolated fleets, and keep them on the run while we rapidly destroy their entire economy."
 FRA_castex_plan: "The Castex Plan"
 FRA_castex_plan_desc: "The Castex Plan aims for us to continue improving the core of our navy. Battleships and cruisers will be the striking force of our grand navy, allowing us to end any fight with the rout of our enemy, with little damage to us except for screen ships such as Destroyers."
 FRA_home_fleet: "Home Fleet"
 FRA_home_fleet_desc: "Our fleet defends our coasts, patrolling the Channel, the Atlantic Coast and the Mediterranean tirelessly, ensuring that not a single submarine or roaming ship passes and damages our convoys or tries to shell our coasts or our moored ships. We do not fear an attack from the seas, from anyone."
 FRA_strike_nat_france: "Strike the Regime in Algiers!"
 FRA_strike_nat_france_desc: "The old Regime still lives in Algiers, subsisting from its exploitation of the African colonies of the defunct French Empire, corrupting our legacy with their atrocities. We must secure the Mediterranean, and they stand in our way. We will put an end to this masquerade."
 FRA_waves_of_syndicalism: "The Waves of Syndicalism"
 FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_desc: "Syndicalism will reach to all the seas of the world. We may not have the ports or colonies of the old, reactionary Empires, but we have the will to send our ship on long voyages, bringing back tales of victory over the imperialists. Our sailors will sail the seven seas in the name of Syndicalism!"
 FRA_colonnes_neptune: "The Colonnes de Neptune"
 FRA_colonnes_neptune_desc: "If we are to defeat enemy nations abroad, a beachhead is a necessary step before we can deploy the brunt of our forces. We must train our Marines forces with purpose and ensure that only the best partake in those incredibly arduous tasks. The fate of entire invasions count on them alone."
 FRA_submarines: "Guerre Sous-Marine"
 FRA_submarines_desc: "As modern war takes to the air, it also goes under the seas. Submarines provide a new, revolutionary change to naval warfare. Their torpedoes can end even the most armoured of battleships, and their profile is stealthy, with only the most advanced technologies able to find and attack them."
 FRA_cut_off_capitalists: "Cut off the Capitalists"
 FRA_cut_off_capitalists_desc: "We cannot simply sit and watch as the Empires of old extort the peoples of the world and bring their plunder back to their colonial offices to count and enjoy. We will ensure that every convoy hauling their unjustly seized goods fears the Communal submarine."
 FRA_naval_bombers: "Develop Naval Bombers"
 FRA_naval_bombers_desc: "The air can well pair with the sea. Planes carrying torpedoes allow us to instantly kill even the biggest of ships with great accuracy, the torpedoes preventing us from having to hit dead centre on a ship's deck with a bomb. We must invest in naval bombers to gain an edge on big, bulky navies."
 FRA_protect_coastlines: "Protect our Coastlines"
 FRA_protect_coastlines_desc: "Eventually, our navy cannot protect every single beach and every single small harbour in our country. However, we can plan ahead and add some basic fortifications to ensure we are not taken by surprise. If they land on our beaches, they will enjoy cold hard steel after a long time at sea."

 FRA_Phalanstere_internationale: "Found the Phalanstère International"
 FRA_Phalanstere_internationale_desc: "The need for secrecy necessitates certain inefficiencies in military research. By working closely with other syndicalist nations and allowing researchers access to others' most closely guarded secrets, this fundamental issue can be overcome. The Phalanstère International shall serve as the central authority for the exchange of such secrets."

### Intro Screen ###

 comfrance.1.t: "The Commune of France"
 comfrance.1.d: "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing communist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."
 comfrance.1.a: "Aux armes, citoyens!"

### Events ###

 comfrance.5.t: "The Fall of Marceau Pivert"
 comfrance.5.d: "Despite the successful organisation of the Syndicalist Congress in May, the Pivert administration has been criticised for its lack of response to the crackdown on trade unions in Germany. Today, the opposition in the Bourse Générale du Travail has agreed to a vote of no confidence in Pivert, who has announced that new elections will be brought forward to elect a new Comité. His duties will be temporarily assumed by the Comité de Salut Public until the last results come in."
 comfrance.5.a: "Goodbye, Camarade Pivert."

 comfrance.6.t: "Election Day 1: Clarifying the Communal Army"
 comfrance.6.d: "Due to the presence of trade unions within the Communard Army, it has become overly politicised, creating tensions within the Guarantor of National Integrity and the Arm of the Syndicalist Revolution! This has resulted in the incumbent Chief of Staff, the popular civil war general Maurice Gamelin, having to step down. The French Syndicalist military leaders, mostly Sorelians, have decided to ask the soldiers who they wish to lead the French army, before definitely dissolving the military trade unions."
 comfrance.6.a: "Charles Delestraint (Travailliste) - Tank proponent."
 comfrance.6.b: "Ernest Petit (Jacobin) - Centralised High Command."
 comfrance.6.c: "Diego Brosset (Sorelian) - Officers' initiative."
 comfrance.6.e: "Joseph Putz (Anarchiste) - Mass motorisation."

 comfrance.7.t: "Election Day 2: The Renseignements Généraux"
 comfrance.7.d: "Due to its key purpose over external and internal security matters, the position of Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux is recognised as one of the keys to supreme power in the Commune of France, and is crucial for the destruction of political rivals. It could be a terrible weapon in the hands of one of the extremist factions, Jacobins and Sorelians..."
 comfrance.7.a: "Roger Salengro (Travailliste)."
 comfrance.7.b: "Waldeck Rochet (Jacobin)."
 comfrance.7.c: "Pierre Villon (Sorelian)."
 comfrance.7.e: "Devolve the position to the militias (Anarchiste)."

 comfrance.8.t: "Election Day 3: Internal Security"
 comfrance.8.d: "Travailliste Charles Rappoport has resigned his post of Delegate for Internal Security to compete for the Foreign Affairs post. Former Chairman Marceau Pivert, still hoping to preserve his political future, has managed to get endorsed by the Travailliste wing, and is now grappling for the post with the stern Jacobin Maurice Thorez, Sorelian Jean Marie Clamamus, and the anarchist Maurice Joyeux."
 comfrance.8.a: "Marceau Pivert (Travailliste)."
 comfrance.8.b: "Maurice Thorez (Jacobin)."
 comfrance.8.c: "Jean Marie Clamamus (Sorelian)."
 comfrance.8.e: "Maurice Joyeux (Anarchiste)."

 comfrance.9.t: "Election Day 4: Economic Affairs"
 comfrance.9.d: "Today's election seems to be a plebiscite on the Commune's economic policy implemented in recent years. Many visions of the future Syndicalist economy, more or less concentrated on industry or agriculture, are in competition. All of them are crucial for the future final struggle against Germany..."
 comfrance.9.a: "Benoît Frachon (Travailliste) - Orthodox Syndicalism."
 comfrance.9.b: "Ambroise Croizat (Jacobin) - Industrialisation."
 comfrance.9.c: "Jacques Doriot (Sorelian) - War economy and agriculture."
 comfrance.9.e: "Daniel Guérin (Anarchiste) - Cooperatives."

 comfrance.10.t: "Election Day 5: Foreign Affairs"
 comfrance.10.d: "With the final election day, one of the leading issues of the Commune of France is raised: diplomacy, which carries the double task of spreading the Revolution throughout the world and preparing for revenge against Germany. If the very existence of the Syndicalist Internationale is not in danger yet, the future theatres of the World Revolution will be defined today..."
 comfrance.10.a: "Charles Rappoport (Travailliste)-Internationalism."
 comfrance.10.b: "Marcel Cachin (Jacobin)- World Revolution."
 comfrance.10.c: "Pierre Comert (Sorelian)- Anti-German Revanchism."

 comfrance.12.d: "Even if many saw in this election the fall of the Travailliste-led consensus that has ruled the Commune since the death of Emile Pouget, they have managed to secure a firm majority in the election.\n\nThe Travaillistes are now looking towards the Russian émigré Boris Souvarine, who unlike Pivert, is seen as both strong enough to keep the radical factions in line and capable of leading the Commune to its final glory!"
 comfrance.12.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Souvarine."

 comfrance.13.t: "The Results: Jacobin Majority"
 comfrance.13.d: "The elections have finally put the Jacobins in power, permitting the return of Leninist values to lead the Commune to the World Revolution! The Syndicalist structures are now in Jacobin hands as Sorelian partisans are chased, exiled or gunned down. Now, the newly established Parti Communiste Français will have to choose between General Jacques Duclos and diplomat Marcel Cachin to lead France!"
 comfrance.13.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Cachin."
 comfrance.13.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Duclos."

 comfrance.14.t: "Marcel Déat Succeeds Pierre Monatte"
 comfrance.14.d: "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, the new Chairman of the CSP has asked to its BGT counterpart Pierre Monatte to resign, arguing that the alliance with the Anarchists was no longer corresponding to the vows of the Commune. The old man accepted with reluctance, thus consecrating the Jacobin complete takeover of the Commune. Marcel Déat was eventually elected."
 comfrance.14.a: "Vive la Revolution!"

 comfrance.15.t: "The Results: Sorelian Majority"
 comfrance.15.d: "The elections finally gave power to the military faction of the Commune of France, staunch followers of the revolutionary theories of Georges Sorel, and eventually destroying their old Jacobin foes, who are now victims of a bloody purge throughout the country. A new age has begun in French politics, after the weaknesses of the Travailliste era..."
 comfrance.15.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Valois."

 comfrance.16.t: "Pierre Monatte's Resignation"
 comfrance.16.d: "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, BGT Chairman Pierre Monatte has announced he would propose its resignation to its CSP counterpart Georges Valois, considering he was too old to assume political duties, even purely nominal, and that the incoming challenges for the Commune of France would require younger leaders. The solution now lays in Valois' hands..."
 comfrance.16.a: "Merge the positions of Chairmen of both the BGT and the CSP."

 comfrance.17.t: "The Results: Anarchiste Majority"
 comfrance.17.d: "The elections have finally given power to the Anarchistes, meaning that the French people has understood that the Revolution has entered a new phase and that younger minds are needed for guiding the nation. The most restrictive government structures have been dismantled, heralding a new era for libertarian Socialism throughout Europe."
 comfrance.17.a: "Congratulations, Camarades."

 comfrance.18.t: "The End of the Chairmanship"
 comfrance.18.d: "As the Anarchistes have been swept to power during the last elections of the Commune and the Revolution Progresses, it has become obvious that reform must come to the highest positions as well. While previously the power of the Chairman was not unlimited, having one person lead the Commune is obviously a restrictive, bourgeoisie concept. It is a spit in the face of the ideas represented by the victorious Anarchistes, who prefer a more communal leadership style."
 comfrance.18.a: "Abolish the position, it's time for collective leadership!"

 comfrance.19.t: "Pierre Monatte's Resignation"
 comfrance.19.d: "During the inauguration ceremony of the new Comité de Salut Public at the Bourse Générale du Travail, BGT Chairman Pierre Monatte has announced he would propose his resignation, as many claimed that the internal division within the executive branches of the Commune was the primary cause of the political crisis. The two favourites to succeed him are the trade unionist Léon Jouhaux and the civil war veteran Benoit Frachon."
 comfrance.19.a: "Léon Jouhaux becomes Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail."
 comfrance.19.b: "Benoît Frachon becomes Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail."

 comfrance.20.t: "No Majority Found After the Elections"
 comfrance.20.d: "After three days of verification, it's now official: no firm majority has been found from the last elections. Pierre Monatte, the Bourse Générale du Travail Chairman, has announced that he and the Assembly would elect a new Chairman itself to lead a compromise cabinet, and also to avoid deeper internal struggles between Jacobins and Sorelians."
 comfrance.20.a: "The moderate Travaillistes of Jouhaux and Blum unite the centre!"

 comfrance.22.t: "Camarade Blum's Call for Solidarity with Spain"
 comfrance.22.d: "As civil war ravages the Iberian peninsula, stories of white terror storm across the Pyrenees, horrifying our populace. Throughout the Commune, spontaneous gatherings and congresses have convened to gather funds and materials for our Spanish comrades to show the unwavering support offered to the CNT-FAI.\n\nAt such an event, Travailliste delegate, Leon Blum, has delivered a powerful speech urging the government to press on its support for the Spaniard workers and peasants by uniting in an international people's front against reactionaries and monarchists. This 'Popular Front' speech has been widely praised for its eloquence and solid socialist conviction. Monsieur Blum's fame as a public speaker has certainly been improved."
 comfrance.22.a: "Most eloquent, camarade."

 comfrance.25.t: "The Damocles Project?"
 comfrance.25.d: "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference which took place during the Second Congress of the Internationale, in May 1937, another somewhat secret reunion took place for the last weeks at the University of Cambridge.\n\nA group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France, led by Norman Feather, Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Francis Perrin, are discussing the possibilities of radioactivity and nuclear fission and its uses - from electricity generation and medical applications to powerful strategic weapons. The participants are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
 comfrance.25.a: "Establish the Damocles Project!"
 comfrance.25.b: "We won't waste money on such absurdity!"

 comfrance.26.t: "Establishment of the Damocles Project"
 comfrance.26.d: "The government of the Union of Britain has accepted our offer regarding the creation of the joint Damocles project. This grand undertaking will allow us to spread syndicalism to the entire world!"

Now, we are nearly ready to hold the First Congress right here on Montmartre Hill in Paris, built on the ruins of Sacré-Coeur. For three days, the city will host delegates from almost every Socialist, Syndicalist, and Bolshevik party from all across the World. We, the French, will take the floor first, that is if we are still planning on hosting the First Congress and continuing the work of the Second Internationale."

 comfrance.30.a: "Better start packing!"

 comfrance.41.t: "All of the Delegates Have Arrived"
 comfrance.41.d: "Heads of Socialist, Syndicalist, and Bolshevik parties, Heads of State and Governments, Foreign Ministers, and journalists have all arrived in Paris for the opening of the First Congress of the Third Internationale. It is time to open the doors and take the stage."

 comfrance.42.t: "The Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public Takes the Floor"
 comfrance.42.d: "Now that everyone is assembled and the Congress has begun it is time to take the stage on open discussion. The Prime Minister took the stage first and discussed the purpose of the Third Internationale. After the purpose of the Third Internationale is made more clear, the discussion will begin."

 comfrance.43.t: "Syndicalism in Spain"
 comfrance.43.d: "Joaquín Ascaso Budriá has taken the stage and elaborated the position of the CNT-FAI in Spain for the Congress. The CNT-FAI is the largest Syndicalist party in Spain, made up of Anarcho-Syndicalists, moderate Syndicalists and trade unionists. The Spanish revolutionaries have seen a White Terror, violent counter-revolutionary actions taking against the workers, first-hand. They have come, asking for support for their cause when the moment comes."
 comfrance.43.a: "The French pledge their support and ask all other members to do the same."

 comfrance.45.t: "White Terror"
 comfrance.45.d: "We heard Joaquín Ascaso Budriá speak of White Terror horror stories that have been coming out of Madrid and Barcelona, and Kurt Eisner, Bavarian Socialist wanted to delve deeper into the topic of White Terror and he was given the floor. After hearing more stories that have come out of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia and Finland, the Congress members were ready to make their decisions."
 comfrance.45.a: "Another reason we must end the Capitalist system of murder and robbery."

 comfrance.47.t: "John 'Jack' Reed and the Combined Syndicates"
 comfrance.47.d: "The American journalist, poet and Syndicalist activist John 'Jack' Reed spoke to the Congress for an hour and fifteen minutes about the crisis facing the United States and the chance for Revolution in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Benjamin Franklin, Mr. Reed laid out the situation in America very clearly. In the South, the America First Committee is stronger than the Central Government and the North is suffering from a depression as the West Coast prospers. This economic imbalance has caused massive unemployment along the Great Lakes, and the people are ready for a radical change."
 comfrance.47.a: "A modern day Benjamin Franklin! They have our support!"
 comfrance.47.b: "Offer support for Reed and his comrades."
 comfrance.47.c: "We can't yet risk hostility with America."

 comfrance.50.t: "Unemployment and Radicalism in Latin America"
 comfrance.50.d: "The Latin American countries were the hardest hit of all by the Stock Market Crash in Berlin and there has been a Great Awakening among the people. Socialist and Syndicalist parties grow larger by the day, paired with Unemployment. We should decide our policy on Latin America, where left-wing radicalism is ripening."
 comfrance.50.a: "Begin to nurture Syndicalism in Latin America."
 comfrance.50.b: "We should build Syndicalism elsewhere, we must rank our priorities."

 comfrance.51.t: "Women's Role in the Worldwide Revolution"
 comfrance.51.d.FRA: "Today the British feminist, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat. However, heeding this call is likely to cause some disturbances among the more 'conservative' elements of the society."
 comfrance.51.d.other: "Today the British feminist, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat. While our delegation agrees wholeheartedly with her message, some fear that it is yet too early to really push the issue of women's liberation and that formally affirming the speech is but a needless domestic disturbance."
 comfrance.51.a: "Participation of working women is necessary to achieve the Worldwide Revolution."
 comfrance.51.b: "A brave woman, but we shall not respond."

 comfrance.52.t: "Women's Role in the Worldwide Revolution"
 comfrance.52.d: "Yesterday Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat. Tempting as it may seem, the political climate in Britain is not ready for such decision - we need to wait for the Congress of Trade Unions in the fall to force the matter."
 comfrance.52.a: "So it be then."

 comfrance.53.t: "Support For the Risorgimento"
 comfrance.53.d: "Today is an opportunity for our representatives at the Congress of the Third Internationale to put forward their case forward to request international support for our reunification efforts. The Foreign Minister believes French support for Risorgimento could be vital for its success due to the potential for Austrian involvement."
 comfrance.53.a: "Ask for support to achieve the Risorgimento!"
 comfrance.53.b: "There are more important issues at hand."

 comfrance.54.t: "Policy on the Italian Peninsula"
 comfrance.54.d: "The Foreign Minister of the Socialist Republic of Italy appeared before the First Syndicalist Congress, making the case of supporting the Republic in its efforts to reunify the Italian Peninsula in the face of the traitors beyond the Po, the Sicilian Kingdom and their theocratic vassal in Rome. Involvement in Italy could prove beneficial in spreading the Revolution, but could lead to conflict with the reactionary Austrian Empire responsible for protecting the regime in Milan."
 comfrance.54.a: "Guarantee our friends in Torino aid when the time comes."

 comfrance.55.t: "The World Economic Crisis and the Role of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.55.d: "The stage has been set for the revolution to begin. With the Berlin Stock Market Crash, mass unemployment has arisen in Europe and South America and trade unions have begun to grow in both as a result."
 comfrance.55.a: "An opportunity."

 comfrance.56.t: "The State of Indian Socialism"
 comfrance.56.d: "As the congress approaches its end, young Jawaharlal Nehru takes the floor to explain the precarious state of our revolutionary government. In his speech, he strongly called for international support in building a people's army to rival our enemies in Delhi and Hyderabad."

 comfrance.57.b: "We can't waste our resources."

 comfrance.58.t: "Comrade Sail Mohammed Wants To Speak"
 comfrance.58.d: "Comrade Sail Mohammed, a prominent Algerian socialist, was allowed to speak before the assembled Congress. He has given a rousing speech on the situation in Morocco and French Africa where Arab labour is abused and exploited for the benefit of the wealthy and the colonial establishment. Sail urged the Congress to put an immediate stop to the situation. He proposed a creation of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee that will work to supply local syndicalist anti-colonial conspirators in North Africa."

 comfrance.61.a: "Watch them!"

 comfrance.62.t: "Communard French Military Support"
 comfrance.62.d: "After our delegates at the First Congress of the Third Internationale requested military support for organising the Indian revolutionary army, the Union of Britain and Commune of France decided to dispatch senior military officials and experts to educate our foremost officers. Hopefully, this cooperation will yield beneficial results on the battlefield!"
 comfrance.62.a: "The Red Army shall put these comrades to good use!"

 comfrance.63.t: "The Rise of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 comfrance.63.d.NFA: "Our counter-intelligence specialists have noted a recent surge of Syndicalist activity in our country. We know that the Commune of France, together with the Union of Britain, has established an Anti-Colonial Committee in the Internationale. This committee, with the help of Mohamed Saïl, a traitor of the Algerian people living in France, is coordinating the efforts made by the Syndicalists in supporting anti-colonial sentiments in our African holdings.\n\nThe Syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the native rebels. They have also opened a few training camps in their southernmost parts of the country. While the more oblivious politicians in our country believe that nothing will come out of this, our generals warn us that we have to be wary."
 comfrance.63.d.GER: "The word has spread. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the Syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. Our intelligence reports show that a small influx of Egyptian left-wing radicals who want to fight for the revolutionary cause are also arriving on French territory. While we are not at war with the Commune of France or any Syndicalist country for now, we should be very cautious."
 comfrance.63.d.OTT: "The word has spread from German agents in France. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the Syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause. The initiative also plays in with Egypt's attempt to foster Arab nationalism in the Middle East and North Africa, and might strengthen our rival. For these reasons, we have to be cautious, even if we won't be a main target."
 comfrance.63.d.SPA: "The word has spread to Spain. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the Syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. Let us hope we will not be one of its targets, for we have other, more important issues to deal with right now."
 comfrance.63.a: "A worrying development."

 comfrance.64.t: "The Creation of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 comfrance.64.d: "Our comrades in France have recently started a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. Helped by Algerian Revolutionary Mohamed Saïl, the Committee aims to help nationalist and syndicalist revolutionaries in all of Africa and to destroy all colonial governments. However, even if nothing in that sense has been said officially, it is obvious the Committee is directly aimed towards the reactionary French government in Algiers which is having difficulties handling its colonial holdings.\n\nThe French have invited us to participate in the Committee and to help with sending equipment, arms and propaganda, to which we gladly agreed. Together we are stronger, and we will soon be able to liberate all of the African workers from the grasp of the imperialists!"
 comfrance.64.a: "Solidarity Forever!"

 comfrance.65.t: "What should the Committee focus on?"
 comfrance.65.d.default: "The Committee was convened today, in Paris. Around the table of the meeting, French, British, Algerian, Senegalese or even Tunisian representatives are present to discuss the matter of the day. It was decided before that a large operation was to be conducted against the French government in Algiers to weaken their hold over Africa. What was left to debate however, is how exactly are we going to hurt them. Our options could be to start a wave of sabotage and insurrectional strikes across their industry, heavily supporting rebel elements in a specific region or to foment unrest more evenly throughout Africa by using a large propaganda network. What should we do?"
 comfrance.65.d.collapse: "The Committee was convened today, in Paris. Around the table of the meeting, French, British and Algerian representatives are present to discuss the matter of the day. It was decided before that a large operation was to be conducted against the remnant of the French government in Algiers to weaken what's left of their hold over Africa. It was in the end decided that, in this situation, the only sensible option was to start a wave of strikes and sabotage to hurt their industrial base."
 comfrance.65.a: "Weaken their industrial capacity"
 comfrance.65.b: "Support rebel elements"
 comfrance.65.c: "Spread unrest throughout French Africa"

 comfrance.66.t: "Wave of Sabotage"
 comfrance.66.d: "Without any previous notice, a large wave of violent strikes started in some of our industrial bases. Those strikes are different than what we are used to, they are only done by a small part of the workers and don't seem to have any clear motive, factory bosses throughout the country only woke up to an occupied factory and to a lot of the equipment smashed. In other factories, the workers weren't occupying the factory, but a large part of the machinery was still found damaged or destroyed. Repressing the strikes and arresting their participants wasn't too difficult, but it seems to be a shot in the dark as those incidents were clearly masterminded from elsewhere..."
 comfrance.66.a: "Those damned Communards!"

 comfrance.67.t: "Syndicalists Foment Rebellion"
 comfrance.67.d: "The colonial authorities and the Second Bureau have reported to us than an unusual influx of arms and equipment has been flowing to one of our colonies in the last weeks. This all evidently coming from the Commune of France, using the darkness of the night to smuggle arms into our territory, destabilise us and incite rebellion. We took too long however to uncover that scheme, and the revolutionaries are now well armed enough to be emboldened in their resistance. We only have to hope we will be able to weather the storm."
 comfrance.67.a: "Traitors everywhere!"

 comfrance.68.t: "Campaign of Dissent"
 comfrance.68.d: "In the last weeks, we have noticed an increased propaganda activity, coming from nationalist and syndicalist agitators. It looks like they were suddenly equipped with tens of thousands of leaflets and pre-prepared radio speeches, spreading their words about the wrongdoings of our regime everywhere in Africa. Propaganda, even more when supported by the Commune of France, is hard to stop, we can't possibly confiscate every leaflet spreading in our colonies. This isn't entirely a lost battle though, as we can try to focus on a specific region in which our agents will shut down the radios and confiscate every suspect document. By doing this, we will be at least able to reduce the effects of the campaign in one or two regions of our choice..."
 comfrance.68.a: "Focus on Tunisia"
 comfrance.68.b: "Focus on Mauritania and Southern Algeria"

Since the first Congress of the Internationale took place in France, many activists believe it would be the best to make Britain the second host."

 comfrance.86.d: "With all the delegates in London, the Second Congress of the Internationale begun with a speech by comrade Eric Blair.

 comfrance.86.a: "Bravo, comrade Blair!"

 comfrance.87.t: "Day 2 - The American Question"
 comfrance.87.d: "On the second day the delegates discussed the most pressing matter - the development of the Civil War in America. With Long and the Federal government pushing the CSA on to the defensive, the decision was made to send additional help for Reed and his followers."

 comfrance.99.t: "The Cambridge Conference"
 comfrance.99.d: "Along with the politicians in London, a separate meeting of scientists from France and Britain took place in the old university in Cambridge.

 comfrance.99.a: "Knowledge is power."

 comfrance.100.t: "Day 5 - Request International Support For Chile"
 comfrance.100.d: "The socialist regime in Santiago is surrounded by reactionaries, especially in Argentina. It seems that the best way to protect the government is to ask for international support via the Second International Congress."
 comfrance.100.a: "We shall not be alone."

 comfrance.101.t: "Day 5 - Chile Requests Support"
 comfrance.101.d: "The Chileans have asked for assistance in improving their army in the face of hostile imperialist foes such as Argentina. Bordered on virtually all sides by threats, Chile's position might become increasingly precarious without our help. Furthermore, they could prove invaluable at safeguarding the revolution in the New World."

 comfrance.116.d: "Philip Snowden, aged 73, passed away in his house in Tilford, Surrey. Although he resigned from the Chairman's post almost a year ago, his authority and influence in the Union were unprecedented. During his funeral, the Chairman of the TUC stated that 'Comrade Snowden has left us - but his ideas shall live on, forever.' The ceremony has turned out to be one of the greatest public manifestations of patriotism since the revolution of 1925."
 comfrance.116.a: "Sic transit gloria mundi..."

 comfrance.117.t: "The Death of Philip Snowden"
 comfrance.117.d: "Philip Snowden, aged 73, passed away in his house in Tilford, Surrey. The traitor and the Chairman of the Union of Britain's TUC, Snowden has been remembered among the Royalists as a synonym for treachery. Although the Socialists in Britain mourn his death, in Canada his funeral has become a single bright day in this dark period of history."
 comfrance.117.a: "The devil is dead."

 comfrance.118.t: "Germany and the Second Congress of the Internationale"
 comfrance.118.d: "The Congress has been received with anxiety in Germany. With the economic crisis still not completely solved, every increase in Socialist activity is a threat to the Reichspakt and the German Empire. In his latest speech, the Kaiser has condemned the Socialists, but words are not enough - action should be taken as well."
 comfrance.118.a: "We will have to react somehow..."

 comfrance.124.t: "French Aid Arrives!"
 comfrance.124.d: "Our French Comrades have seen the plight of the Spanish workers, and have sent us considerable shipments of supplies! Many volunteers have also arrived, who are filling to fight for the cause of international proletarian solidarity!"
 comfrance.124.a: "Great!"

 comfrance.125.t: "French Aid Arrives!"
 comfrance.125.d: "The help promised by our French comrades finally arrived at the airport of Santiago today, and tons of equipment, machines and construction materials are awaiting our decision, what should we do with them?"
 comfrance.125.a: "Use it to improve our army."
 comfrance.125.b: "Use it to improve our industry."
 comfrance.125.c: "Use it to fortify our border with Argentina."

 comfrance.127.t: "The Phalanstère International Research Organisation"
 comfrance.127.d: "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
 comfrance.127.a: "Participation sounds good."

 comfrance.128.t: "The Phalanstère International Industrial Programme"
 comfrance.128.d: "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves. The choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."
 comfrance.128.a: "It sounds like a great idea!"

 comfrance.129.t: "The Phalanstère Offers Assistance"
 comfrance.129.d: "As part of the Phalanstère International programme, our comrades in Paris and London have just offered us much needed help. Industrial machines, mining equipment, weapons, ammunition and more - all of this will be unloaded in our ports and airports and transported across the country - assuming we desire that."
 comfrance.129.a: "Excellent!"
 comfrance.129.b: "We don't want their help."

 comfrance.130.t: "A Jacobin Reformation?"
 comfrance.130.d: "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is now divided. Hardliners are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many members of the party are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines."
 comfrance.130.a: "The old system shall be swept away!"
 comfrance.130.b: "We shall reform Syndicalism from within."

 comfrance.131.t: "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
 comfrance.131.d: "The Syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with true Marxism as laid out by the Parti Communiste Français. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Députés du Peuple while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Commissaires du Peuple."
 comfrance.131.a: "An improvement, no doubt."

 comfrance.132.t: "Dissolution of the CGT"
 comfrance.132.d: "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confederation General du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune. We can finally break their power, so as to prevent our rival from further resisting our Communist doctrine."
 comfrance.132.a: "They are against our Revolution."

 comfrance.133.t: "Reports of Military Unrest"
 comfrance.133.d: "Our recent reforms, while making grand strides in setting France on the true path of Socialism, have upset many in French society. Now there are reports reaching the ears of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux that there are murmurs of dissent even within the Guarantor of National Integrity..."
 comfrance.133.a: "Keep a close eye..."

 comfrance.134.t: "Léon Blum and the Front Populaire"
 comfrance.134.d: "Now the leading Travailliste figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."
 comfrance.134.a: "Bring them to trial!"
 comfrance.134.b: "Leninist valours will endure these traitors."

 comfrance.135.t: "The Paris Trial"
 comfrance.135.d: "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."
 comfrance.135.a: "Execute these traitors!"
 comfrance.135.b: "Call the whole thing off."

 comfrance.136.t: "Anti-Jacobin Riots"
 comfrance.136.d: "Following the execution of the Paris Trial defendants, the city has risen up against the government, although lacking leadership or outside aid it is doomed to fail."
 comfrance.136.a: "Crush them!"

 comfrance.137.t: "Gamelin's March on Paris"
 comfrance.137.d: "Reports are reaching the Renseignements Généraux that units loyal to the civil war general Maurice Gamelin have mutinied and declared for the Popular Front. Gamelin is marching on Paris!"
 comfrance.137.a: "We shall resist these rebels!"
 comfrance.137.b: "The rebels seize the capital!"

 comfrance.138.t: "The Front Populaire Restores Syndicalism"
 comfrance.138.d: "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and is purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public."
 comfrance.138.a: "C'est la lutte finale..."

 comfrance.144.t: "Communal Elections of 1941"
 comfrance.144.d: "As planned in 1936, the five-year term of the current Bourse Générale du Travail comes to an end. It is time to discuss economic and internal policies as well as foreign matters, so that the BGT may elect the new members of the executive Comité Salut Public."
 comfrance.144.a: "Let's get to work, camarades!"

 comfrance.145.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Status of the Military"
 comfrance.145.d: "It's been five years since the last great reform of the revolution's armed forces and the French army has soared to new heights. However, the various factions of the CGT still disagree on the continued development of the Guarantor of National Integrity."
 comfrance.145.a: "Travaillistes: Modernisation and optimisation!"
 comfrance.145.b: "Jacobins: A more independent high command is needed!"
 comfrance.145.c: "Sorelians: The army must be completely subjugated to the CGT!"
 comfrance.145.e: "Anarchistes: Liberalise the army and promote volunteer service!"

 comfrance.146.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Internal Security"
 comfrance.146.d: "With France continuously being threatened by both foreign and domestic enemies, the issue of our internal security has been raised in the elections."
 comfrance.146.a: "Travaillistes: The Sûreté Populaire is doing well enough!"
 comfrance.146.b: "Jacobins: We need paramilitary gendarmes to keep the peace!"
 comfrance.146.c: "Sorelians: The secret police MUST be more active!"
 comfrance.146.e: "Anarchistes: Democratise the Sûreté Populaire!"

 comfrance.147.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - External Security"
 comfrance.147.d: "As the revolution marches on, the office of the Renseignements Généraux has continued to hold key influence within the political framework of the federation and, as a result, is thus hotly contended."
 comfrance.147.a: "Travaillistes: The current system is satisfactory."
 comfrance.147.b: "Jacobins: The RG must focus on supporting revolutionaries abroad!"
 comfrance.147.c: "Sorelians: The RG shall be introduced to Totalist doctrine!"
 comfrance.147.e: "Anarchistes: The BGT must control the Renseignements Généraux!"

 comfrance.148.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Economic Policies"
 comfrance.148.d: "The Syndicalist economy has ensured considerable betterment for the masses, but discord still exists between the four main factions as to which way it should develop."
 comfrance.148.a: "Travaillistes: Maintain the Syndicalist course!"
 comfrance.148.b: "Jacobins: Centralisation is needed!"
 comfrance.148.c: "Sorelians: We must focus on the armament industries!"
 comfrance.148.e: "Anarchistes: More power to the Cooperatives!"

 comfrance.149.t: "BGT Elections 1941 - Foreign Policy"
 comfrance.149.d: "Undoubtedly one of the most important issues for the next Comité would be how to handle the radically changing world developments. The Travaillistes argue for further cooperation within the Internationale, whilst the Anarchistes wish to commence a wave of liberation to sweep the old order away everywhere it lingers. Both Sorelians and Jacobins hold hawkish views."
 comfrance.149.a: "Travaillistes: The Internationale must guarantee peace!"
 comfrance.149.b: "Jacobins: The red flag must advance everywhere!"
 comfrance.149.c: "Sorelians: The reactionaries must be destroyed completely!"
 comfrance.149.e: "Anarchistes: Secure a European socialism!"

 comfrance.150.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Travailliste Majority"
 comfrance.150.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Travailliste faction has scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nHowever, the grouping is split between the moderates of Leon Jouhaux and the more militant members gathering around Benoît Frachon. Regardless of whoever claims the mantle of leadership, the Commune of France will certainly be in good hands."
 comfrance.150.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Jouhaux."
 comfrance.150.b: "Congratulations, Camarade Frachon."

 comfrance.151.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Jacobin Majority"
 comfrance.151.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Jacobins have scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nDuclos, known as the Red Dwarf, will form the new Comité while the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail will be Marcel Cachin, the long-time chief editor of the Humanité newspaper. The top military leaders are expected to stay in place."
 comfrance.151.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Cachin."

 comfrance.152.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Sorelian Majority"
 comfrance.152.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Sorelians have scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nCamarade Valois, the most brilliant leader of the orthodox Sorelians, is expected to form the new Comité while also being the new Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail."
 comfrance.152.a: "Congratulations, Camarade Valois."

 comfrance.153.t: "BGT Elections 1941: Anarchiste Majority"
 comfrance.153.d: "As the votes tickle in from the many communes of our great Federation, it has become clear that the Anarchiste faction has scored a majority in the Bourse Générale du Travail.\n\nThe Anarchistes have already began creating councils, and the position of Chairman is expected to be abolished soon."
 comfrance.153.a: "Congratulations, Camarades."

 comfrance.154.t: "BGT Elections 1941: No Majority Achieved"
 comfrance.154.d: "As none of the factions within the CGT has managed to achieve a majority, the leaders of the various groupings have begun negotiating about the possibility of creating different kinds of coalition governments."
 comfrance.154.a: "The Travailliste-Anarchiste bloc is restored to power!"
 comfrance.154.b: "Left Travaillistes and orthodox Sorelians form a coalition!"
 comfrance.154.c: "Georges Valois and his Totalist Sorelians seize the BGT!"

 comfrance.155.t: "Communal Elections of 1946"
 comfrance.155.d: "The major issue is the re-integration in the Commune of former Social-Democrats that left fifteen years ago. The Travaillistes, now the most reformist faction within the CGT, want to continue the democratisation process and push for an open arms policy towards the Social-Democrats. The Anarchistes, although in favour of liberalisation, oppose that policy, as well as the now declining Sorelians. The Jacobins, of course, still advocate a Bolshevik-like reform."
 comfrance.155.a: "Travailliste majority: We have to make room for our Social-Democratic friends."
 comfrance.155.b: "Sorelian majority: No decay of the revolutionary values will be tolerated."
 comfrance.155.c: "Anarchiste majority: Proletarian democracy does not require Social-Democrats."
 comfrance.155.e: "Jacobin majority: The Commune is ready for Bolshevism."

 comfrance.156.t: "Communal Elections of 1951"
 comfrance.156.d: "Thirty years have passed since the Commune of France was established. Our way to socialism and prosperity has been hard and long. Now, when the people choose the new government, our main goal is not only to develop Syndicalism, but also to protect 'des droits de l'homme et du citoyen', such as democracy and the right to happiness."
 comfrance.156.a: "Travailliste majority - Democratisation of the Commune should be gradual."
 comfrance.156.b: "Sorelian majority - Totalism shall stand triumphant."
 comfrance.156.c: "Anarchiste majority - The stateless society awaits!"
 comfrance.156.e: "Jacobin majority - We are true Communards."

 comfrance.159.t: "Paris is Lost!"
 comfrance.159.d: "Paris, the city of lights, cradle of the Revolution and capital of France has been captured by the enemy! While they are facing resistance from the civilian population we must quickly counter-attack and retake full control of the city."
 comfrance.159.a: "Foule esclave, debout, debout!"

 comfrance.160.t: "Liberation of Alsace-Lorraine"
 comfrance.160.d: "We have advanced in the former imperial province of Alsace-Lorraine, and secured the whole region. Germany can't stand before our superiority as the lost provinces are restored to France!"
 comfrance.160.a: "... Groupons-nous, et demain..."

 comfrance.161.t: "The Bastille Day Celebrations"
 comfrance.161.d: "Today is the Fete Nationale, the celebration of the Storming of the Bastille and the beginning of the First French Revolution."
 comfrance.161.a: "Vive La Commune!"

 comfrance.163.t: "Labour Day"
 comfrance.163.d: "Today, all around the world, Democratic, Socialist, and Syndicalist governments are celebrating International Workers' Day, Labour Day, or May Day. May Day has become an international celebration of the social and economic achievements of the working class and labour movement and is celebrated widely throughout the Commune of France."
 comfrance.163.a: "Celebrate!"

 comfrance.164.t: "The First Bourges International Art Festival"
 comfrance.164.d: "The First Bourges International Art Festival was held today. Only thanks to the efforts of both Britain and France in creating International Avant-Garde such festival took place. The artwork included many famous Syndicalist Realist paintings commissioned by the French Government as well as many British, Russian, and American paintings and a mural painted by Diego Rivera. The event will be lasting into the weekend and has attracted worldwide attention. We will enjoy the spotlight for now."
 comfrance.164.a: "This will be the first of many, The Government will make sure of it!"

 comfrance.165.t: "France proposes International Avant-Garde"
 comfrance.165.d: "An efforts were made by the French government to establish an International Avant-Garde. It will aim to create new artistic styles, unique in their unorthodoxy presentations, something this world has never seen before.\n\nFrench Government believes it will be a helpful tool in spreading syndicalist teaching through non-violent means. Now they expect us to join on it. "
 comfrance.165.a: "Count us in!"

 comfrance.170.t: "An Alliance with the Internationale?"
 comfrance.170.d: "The Internationale, the military alliance of the world’s foremost socialist powers, has discreetly approached us with an offer to join its ranks, considering an alliance with our nation to be in the interest of all and a great step forward in the long struggle towards the liberation of the international proletariat. This offer comes with undeniable benefits, we could certainly expect a great amount of support: help against our enemies and towards the realisation of our military objectives, protection should it ever be needed, and just as importantly, support for the development of our armed forces and even our economy through the Phalanstère programme. However, it comes with perhaps daunting obligations, setting us on a course of eventual but certain conflict with the Kaiser and his allies. How should we respond to their offer?"
 comfrance.170.a: "Stronger together!"
 comfrance.170.b: "On second thought, no..."

 comfrance.171.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 comfrance.171.d: "Time to rejoice! [From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer to join our military alliance, as we had dearly hoped they would. With this decision, they have been assured of our undying support as allies in the global struggle for the liberation of the working class, and we have gained a valuable ally against our undeniably mighty enemies. Soon, many others will follow them: “the Internationale shall be the human race”!"
 comfrance.171.a: "Excellent!"

 comfrance.172.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 comfrance.172.d: "To our chagrin, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our offer to join our military alliance. Perhaps too intimidated by the undeniable might of our enemies, or simply not committed enough to the fight for the liberation of the proletariat. In any case, though this is certainly a regrettable result of our diplomatic overture, many others will join us in this struggle: “the Internationale shall be the human race”!"
 comfrance.172.a: "Their loss."

 comfrance.200.t: "The Damocles Project"
 comfrance.200.d: "German spies have recently uncovered the papers of a research and development programme sponsored by the members of the Third Internationale. Dubbed 'The Damocles Project', it is an extensive multi-nation study into the destructive power of nuclear fission with the intent of creating 'bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known'. The famous German physicist Albert Einstein had previously warned that a successful 'nuclear bomb' might even be able to turn entire cities into ash.\n\nGerman intelligence agencies have shared the information about this project to their closest allies, so naturally the whole world now knows. Some have dismissed the project as a childish fantasy, but many experts fear a breakthrough."
 comfrance.200.a: "If they should succeed..."

 comfrance.301.t: "The End of the Third Internationale"
 comfrance.301.d: "The war has most decidedly not developed to our advantage. Despite the best efforts of us and our soldiers, the forces of reaction have proven to be too much for the power of the international proletariat - suffering a long string of setbacks and defeats, the British and French militaries have had their fighting effectiveness steadily reduced throughout the course of the war. While we have held out hope until now that the workers of the world will still rise up, the situation has reached such a critical point that neither Britain or France can offer effective resistance to the opposing forces, and no surviving member of the Internationale has the necessary strength and prestige to rally the alliance - as such, the Third Internationale has begun to break down.\n\nThe effects of this can be felt almost immediately - what was previously a steadfast resolve to never give in to the reactionaries has now swiftly given way to an almost defeatist attitude, as allied insurgents and governments alike increasingly consider our cause hopeless and begin contemplating either hanging up their rifles or seeking some sort of terms with the enemy, and the Phalanstère and other organs of the Internationale have been rendered largely defunct. It is expected that, barring an unthinkable reversal, the now-former members of the alliance beyond the reach of enemy forces will soon cease open hostilities, while the rest will eventually be forced to surrender unconditionally... or otherwise suffer eventual debellation.\n\nAs the flame of revolution burns out and the workers cry in despair, all that remains is to find whatever salvation we can..."
 comfrance.301.a: "Not like this..."

 INT_collapse_base: "Born from the ashes of the Great War, the Third Internationale had become, across more than 20 years and in equal measures, the world's greatest hope and its greatest fear - an alliance of the world's first socialist governments, bearing grand ambitions of completing the long-held dream of the global workers' revolution."

 comfrance.302.t: "The Internationale Collapses"
 comfrance.302.d.germany: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, the German world order has proven itself too powerful to defeat - after much struggle, Germany and its allies now control most of Britain and France, and the Third Internationale and its organs have been rendered defunct with no surviving state strong enough to rally them. After being considered an increasingly real prospect for years, world revolution has now been rendered impossible for decades or more to come - if not permanently."
 comfrance.302.d.entente: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, the exiled governments have proved themselves unwilling to die - following a monumental war effort, the Entente is now largely back in control of Britain and France, leaving the Third Internationale and its various organs defunct with no surviving state strong enough to rally them. After being considered an increasingly real prospect for years, world revolution has now been rendered impossible for decades or more to come - if not permanently."
 comfrance.302.d.germany_entente: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, the forces of the old order have proven too powerful to overcome - facing enemies on all sides, Britain and France have both fallen to German and Entente invasion, and the Third Internationale and its organs have ceased to function with no surviving state strong enough to rally them. After being considered an increasingly real prospect for years, world revolution has now been rendered impossible for decades or more to come - if not permanently."
 comfrance.302.d.russia: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nBut while they triumphed over Germany, it was what came after that proved their undoing: after a destructive war, the Internationale was unable to triumph over their new enemy in Russia and fell to invasion, leaving the Third Internationale and its organs defunct with no surviving state strong enough to rally them. Even so, its defeat of Germany has left the world as we know it permanently changed - so while the world revolution may be ended for decades or more, its legacy is a world radically different from the one that came before."
 comfrance.302.d.generic: "$INT_collapse_base$\n\nHowever, their enemies have proven to be too many and too powerful to overcome - with the socialist governments of Britain and France soundly defeated, and no remaining force strong enough to take up the mantle, the Third Internationale and its various organs have ceased to function. After being considered an increasingly real prospect for years, world revolution has now been rendered impossible for decades or more to come - if not permanently."
 comfrance.302.a: "And what a dream it was..."
 comfrance.302.b: "Never will we fear a revolution again."
 comfrance.302.c: "Everything is as it should be."
 comfrance.302.d: "Give it back! This isn’t right! That was ours!"
 comfrance.302.e: "We knew they would. But they could have lasted a bit longer..."
 comfrance.302.f: "None can deny now that we have carved our place in history."
 comfrance.302.g: "This bodes... poorly."
 comfrance.302.h: "We could not have asked for a better result."
 comfrance.302.i: "Death comes for all, eventually."

 comfrance.999.t: "Capitalist Economies Collapse!"
 comfrance.999.d: "Over the past few days, the workers and peasants of the world have watched as the bankers, capitalists, and tyrants scrabble to reap the benefits of the workers’ labour for their own selfish gain. They call it Black Monday, a terrible event they say! They say that such a collapse was completely uncalled for, something no economist could have predicted! Of course, the workers are no fools. The people see through their lies.\n\nAs the great philosopher Karl Marx predicted, such collapses are an inevitable result of capitalism. As the capitalist abuses and reaps the benefits of the workers, they begin to eat themselves alive like rabid dogs. All this as they leave their workers to struggle and die by the waste as they scramble for the last piece of meat.\n\nOur nation, however, has decoupled itself from the capitalist world and has begun the construction of a true people’s state. Therefore, we remain unaffected and can only watch as the nations of the world are eaten alive by their capitalist overlords. This is a great awakening for the peasants and workers of the world and soon, the workers of these nations will begin to organise against their oppressors. We must stand by, and stand tall as a true example for the workers of the world!"
 comfrance.999.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

 comfrance.1000.t: "Gamelin Marches on Paris"
 comfrance.1000.d: "A few days ago, General Maurice Gamelin, launched a successful coup against the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While this seems like a staunch attack on the commune’s democratic system, many argue that the Jacobins would have destroyed the democratic system if not for Gamelin’s intervention. Gamelin has promised to restore France to traditional syndicalism, and the process of De-Jacobinisation is already taking place. It is still unknown how his plans will turn out. We can only wait..."
 comfrance.1000.a: "Surprising, to say the least."

 FRA_pierre_monatte: "Pierre Monatte"
 FRA_pierre_monatte_leader_desc: "Worker. Militant. Revolutionary. Pierre Monatte has had an immense influence on our nation, leading us confidently for over a decade now. Born on January 15th, 1881, he was a renowned trade unionist before the Great War and had been unjustly arrested several times for various syndicalist 'crimes' against Capital, such as his participation in righteous protests in the aftermath of the Courrières mining disaster. Having quickly risen through the ranks of the General Confederation of Labour, he was even briefly forced into exile by the Republic's repression of the movement. When the War broke out, he was of the few to dare say a resounding no to collaboration with the bourgeois government, shortly before being sent to the front. This prescience and his reputation as a stalwart, tireless revolutionary meant that when the time came, Monatte played a critical role in the overthrowing of the old order, and was in an excellent place to steer the new proletarian course of our nation.\n\nBecoming one of the main organisers of the 'Travaillistes', and certainly their most influential member, his leadership led the union of the previously feuding 'Centrists' and 'Ultras' to victory in the 1926 elections, capturing the Presidency. A master politician, Monatte has managed to stay afloat through a fragile coalition with the Anarchistes, ever juggling their demands, along with the other, fractal factions that are so important in the parliament. Yet the man at the top will always be a target, and to say the position he holds is coveted would be an understatement. As knives sharpen in every dark corner, how long can the light keep them at bay?"

 FRA_nestor_makhno_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 8th 1888, in Huliaipole, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn in extreme poverty in rural Eastern Ukraine, Nestor Makhno experienced the worst of the late Russian Empire - he lost his father when he was ten months old and any chance at gaining an education at ten years old, as he had to abandon school to work odd jobs to feed his family. He developed a primal rage for the landlord and the factory-owner, led a wildcat strike against his landlord when he was twelve, and fully devoted himself to the impending revolution since he was seventeen, after witnessing the Revolution of 1905. He led anarchist study groups, skirmished with the police, and was ultimately convicted to a life sentence of hard labour.\n\nSickly, yet energetic, Makhno was released after the February Revolution, and immediately travelled to Ukraine to continue his work. Now, he was no longer a propagandist, but a revolutionary leader. After being briefly exiled from Huliapole due to the German occupation, he bore witness to the rise of the Bolsheviks, which he denounced as a "paper revolution" and returned home in July 1918. There, he set up the Revolutionary Insurgent Army and began a year long war of resistance against the Germans and Ukrainian nationalists. Though brutal and not at all educated in army affairs, Makhno earned the favour of the countryside and gave the Hetman a much tougher fight than expected before being forced to flee. Ultimately, he arrived in the Commune of France, which he immediately denounced as yet another paper revolution. Uninterested in its intellectual foundations, Makhno merely saw disunity, inaction and oligarchy which threatened to overturn the accomplishments of the Revolution by creating yet another aristocracy. Much like Bolshevik exiles, he was integrated into the Federal Army, and earned a following with tales of his exploits - however, he was a maverick in the officer corps, clashing with his superiors and ignoring his duties. Neither him nor the Army were satisfied, so, Makhno left for the wider world - serving in revolutionary volunteer corps throughout the post-war to further the world revolution instead. This path has brought him to Patagonia - where he can serve the cause while being out of mind for the Communards."
