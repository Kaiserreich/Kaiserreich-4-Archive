### Opinions ###

 YUC_high_command: "Yucatec High Command"
 YUC_high_command_desc: "In Mérida's Municipal Palace, our highest-ranking officers have come together to plan a defence of our liberties. An eclectic mix of former revolutionaries, militias, Red Guardsman, and local volunteers give us a variety of experience to draw from."
 YUC_barricades: "Mérida Barricades"
 YUC_barricades_desc: "The first order is to barricade Mérida's wide avenues and block the main road. We cannot risk letting Cuidado traitors into our city in this time of national crisis."
 YUC_national_joint_command: "National Joint Command"
 YUC_national_joint_command_desc: "Within the city are posts for several Mexican combatant commands, including the Escuela Superior de Guerra. The President has ordered the Chief of Staff to unify those that remain into a new National Joint Command to best utilise our meagre manpower."
 YUC_reform_national_army: "Reform National Army"
 YUC_reform_national_army_desc: "Our ramshackle organisation is in dire need of reform. General Salvador Alvarado has suggested a set of drills that were employed by the Colegio Militar to rapidly prepare soldiers for service, which isn't too far away from their homes."
 YUC_improve_equipment: "Improve Equipment"
 YUC_improve_equipment_desc: "Our arsenal is mostly composed of leftover arms of the 1910 revolution, and whatever loyalists came to Yucatán with. It is worth it to purchase better gun designs, and prepare for a longer conflict after the emergency has ended."
 YUC_reverse_engeneering: "Reverse Engineering"
 YUC_reverse_engeneering_desc: "Where we cannot buy, we must steal. Small arms smuggled past the blockade are given to our machinists in an attempt to reverse engineer whatever works to our advantage."

 YUC_maya_expertise: "Maya Expertise"
 YUC_maya_expertise_desc: "Centuries of eluding the Cuidado military must be brought forward if we are to ever cut off the enemy supply chain. The Chief of Staff has called in old Maya to assist in travelling the old Indian paths and helping units survive when their food supplies run low."
 YUC_call_to_arms: "Call to Arms"
 YUC_call_to_arms_desc: "While the population of Yucatán is enthusiastic and grateful to finally be free from the Cuidado, their commitment to the war could be better. We must leverage the cultural achievements of Yucatán's many poets recruit for the military."

 YUC_foreign_legion: "Mayan Rangers"

 YUC_drill_the_natives_desc: "While the Mayan Rangers have worked swimmingly, the normal Mayan militias appear to treat the conflict with some indifference. We are a republic, and they are citizens, not a retinue. These soldiers should receive the same training as would a Mérida resident."

 YUC_protect_coasts: "Protecting Our Coast"
 YUC_protect_coasts_desc: "This new dockyard is an obvious target for raiders. We must allocate some more industrial output to protecting Terminal Remota."

### Events ###

 yucatan.1.t: "The Yucatan Constitution"
 yucatan.1.d: "In Mérida, the new Yucatan Constitution was signed. While it was modelled on the 1917 Mexican Constitution, it also included quite a bit of Mayan legal code as well. Moreover it is also a compromise between the various factions within the Yucatec government."
 yucatan.1.a: "Viva Libre Yucatan!"

 yucatan.2.t: "The Land Issue"
 yucatan.2.d: "The issue of Land reform has been brought up and the question is how should we handle the land reform. Some suggest supporting small land owners, while others think we should implement the Georgist idea of a land tax, or collectivising the land what should we do?"
 yucatan.2.a: "Collectivise the land."
 yucatan.2.b: "Implement Georgism."
 yucatan.2.c: "Support small land owners."

 yucatan.3.t: "Dealing with Mexican Spies"
 yucatan.3.d: "We have recently caught a number of Mexican Spies that are trying to infiltrate our government. The question is what should we do with them. Some think we should deport them. Others think that we should just execute them while finally some think we should try to turn them to our side."
 yucatan.3.a: "Execute them."
 yucatan.3.b: "Deport them."
 yucatan.3.c: "Try to turn them."

 yucatan.20.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
 yucatan.20.d: "The first election of the new Republic of Yucatan is bringing about a great deal of fanfare throughout the country. Of course the question is whom shall the people choose to be the President, now that we have won our independence?"

 yucatan.20.b: "Partido Alianza por Yucatán."

 yucatan.21.e: "Partido Socialista de Yucatán."

 yucatan.25.t: "Mexican Spies Discovered!"
 yucatan.25.d: "Today, there was a terrible discovery in Merida. It seems that some of the bureaucrats in the government were secretly Mexican spies, sent to attack our nation's institutions at the core. Though they have been arrested, there may still be more lurking about."
 yucatan.25.a: "Terrible!"

 yucatan.26.t: "Influencing Yucatan?"
 yucatan.26.d: "To our north, the Yucatecs have revolted from Mexican rule successfully and are now establishing a government. There are currently many in our nation that seek to reestablish contact with their ethnic Maya brethren in Yucatan. If we used this opportunity to influence Yucatan's politics towards a socialist alignment, we could possibly gain a strong ally to the north."
 yucatan.26.a: "Go for it."
 yucatan.26.b: "It's too much effort."

 yucatan.27.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Influences Our Politics!"
 yucatan.27.d: "The Guatemalan migrants entering our nation have brought more with them than welcome manpower and economic activity - they have also brought radical socialist ideologies with them! We are powerless to stop this trend, as the border to our south is far too porous, and the migrants too valuable, to guard properly."
 yucatan.27.a: "Damn them!"

 yucatan.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks to Join [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 yucatan.28.d: "The socialists in our sister republic of [FROM.GetName] have long watched our progress as we reform Central America into a socialist paradise. Now, it seems, they are prepared to join our nation as another component republic. Should we allow this long-awaited unification to happen?"
 yucatan.28.a: "Of course!"
 yucatan.28.b: "We don't want Mexican outcasts!"

 yucatan.29.t: "Centroamérica Agrees!"
 yucatan.29.d: "Our southern neighbours have agreed to our request to accede to their nation. We shall have a glorious future as part of a greater Central America."
 yucatan.29.a: "Hip hip, hoorah!"

 yucatan.30.t: "The Accession of Yucatan"
 yucatan.30.d: "At [GetDateText] the Centroamerican Republic welcomed a new member into its fold. [YUC.GetLeader] handed over the authority of the Yucatan peninsula and its people to [ROOT.GetLeader], and proceeded on a parade through Merida, where the people cheered the annexation. This is a great day in our history!"
 yucatan.30.a: "Welcome, brothers!"
