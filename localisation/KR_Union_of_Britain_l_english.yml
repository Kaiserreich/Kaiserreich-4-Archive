ENG_united_britain:0 "United Britain"
ENG_united_britain_desc:0 "Britain faces great adversity both within and without. While conflict with reactionary nations may prove unavoidable, surely our nation and its people should stand united. Enemies of the revolution must be confronted and eliminated by any means necessary."
ENG_decentralized_command:0 "Decentralised Command"
ENG_decentralized_command_desc:0 "While our armies are decentralised, they still rely on inefficient chains of command to make tactical decisions. Non-commissioned officers and even the humblest of militiamen must be instilled with the spirit of leadership and given the agency to direct their units as they see fit. No man should die waiting for an order to be issued."

ENG_expand_industry_4:0 "Expand Industry: Lothian"
ENG_expand_industry_4_desc:0 "Edinburgh, the old capital of Scotland and its second largest city, has lagged behind the rest of Britain in its industrial development. Let us awaken Edinburgh, and all Lothian's, true potential."

ENG_expand_industry_3_desc:0 "The North of England is the beating heart of British industry and labour; the workers of the North, however, endure a standard of living far below what they deserve. A concentrated effort must be made to renovate the region's industry."
ENG_the_common_land:0 "The Common Land"
ENG_the_common_land_desc:0 "While Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, much of our nation remains rural and reliant on agriculture.

ENG_cayley_plan:0 "Cayley's Plan"
ENG_cayley_plan_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Admiral Richard Cayley is at the forefront of a highly vocal group of naval officers who wish to see Britain rapidly expand its submarine fleet and restructure its doctrine with Germany as its model."
ENG_anstice_plan:0 "Anstice's Plan"
ENG_anstice_plan_desc:0 "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, Admiral Edmund Anstice asserts the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, Anstice proposes that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded."
ENG_dickens_plan:0 "Dickens' Plan"
ENG_dickens_plan_desc:0 "The Royal Navy was centered around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted efforted to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
ENG_begin_reforms:0 "Begin Reforms"
ENG_begin_reforms_desc:0 ""
ENG_merchant_marine:0 "Merchant Marine"
ENG_merchant_marine_desc:0 "The British Merchant Service was on the bleeding edge of civilian shipping administration. During the Weltkrieg, tactics developed by the Service to counter U-Boat raids kept Britain from terrible starvation. If our republic is to have any chance of surviving future conflicts, we must develop a robust Merchant Marine to both regulate shipping and conscript civilian ships for military service when needed."
ENG_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
ENG_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
ENG_continue_reforms:0 "Continue Reforms"
ENG_continue_reforms_desc:0 "The direction and structure of the Republican Navy has been finalized. These reforms, however, have not yet been fully implemented; this must be resolved swiftly."
ENG_submarines:0 "Submarine Effort"
ENG_submarines_desc:0 "Per Admiral Cayley's direction, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models."
ENG_destroyers:0 "Destroyer Effort"
ENG_destroyers_desc:0 "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
ENG_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Effort"
ENG_carrier_efforts_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centerpiece of the renewed British Navy."

ENG_battlecruisers:0 "Fast Battleship Effort"
ENG_battlecruisers_desc:0 "While lacking the armour of a Dreadnought, Fast Battleships are agile and pack a versatile suite of heavy guns. An evolution of the Battlecruisers of WW1 who served effectively during the Weltkrieg, an expansion of our Fast Battleship fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
ENG_battleships:0 "Dreadnought Effort"
ENG_battleships_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
ENG_republican_marines:0 "Republican Marines"
ENG_republican_marines_desc:0 "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty:0 "Revolutionary Admiralty"
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc:0 "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves:0 "Britannia Rules the Waves"
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc:0 "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

ENG_republican_air_force:0 "Republican Air Force"
ENG_republican_air_force_desc:0 "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
ENG_new_pilot_training:0 "New Pilot Training"
ENG_new_pilot_training_desc:0 "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
ENG_flying_women:0 "Women's Flying Corps"
ENG_flying_women_desc:0 "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
ENG_aviation_unions:0 "Aviation Unions"
ENG_aviation_unions_desc:0 "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
ENG_battle_ground_support:0 "Battle-Ground Support"
ENG_battle_ground_support_desc:0 "Socialism mobilises all elements of society together for the benefit of all. Similarly, with support from the air, our forces on the ground can operate much more effectively."
ENG_rule_the_sky:0 "Dominate the Sky"
ENG_rule_the_sky_desc:0 "Air superiority allows for flexibility in military operations, and gives infantrymen the peace of mind of not having to fear a sudden enemy air attack. Control of the skies must therefore be the primary directive of the air force."
ENG_air_observer_corps:0 "Air Observer Corps"
ENG_air_observer_corps_desc:0 "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to foreworn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
ENG_expand_air_unions:0 "Expand Air Unions"
ENG_expand_air_unions_desc:0 "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the airforce now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

ENG_international:0 "Britain Within the International"
ENG_international_desc:0 "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches. With the turbulent 1936 special session of the TUC at an end, Britain's place in the world, and especially its relationship with its socialist comrades of the Third Internationale, must be reassessed."
ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation:0 "Anglo-Norwegian Cooperation"
ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation_desc:0 "A more equitable Norway has arisen, and we will stand arm in arm with our socialist brethren there. The Norwegian and British people have much to offer each other, and as a gesture of our goodwill, we shall offer Norway generous economic assistance in exchange simply for future cooperation."
ENG_anglo_irish_friendship:0 "Anglo-Irish Friendship"
ENG_anglo_irish_friendship_desc:0 "With the light of socialism at last shining upon the Emerald Isle, the time for reconciliation between our historically closely linked peoples has come.

ENG_class_warfare:0 "Class Warfare"
ENG_class_warfare_desc:0 "War is upon us, and to preserve our great nation and secure our liberty, all workingmen must now unite for victory. We should promote the spirit of unity, self-sacrifice, and most of all, renewed class consciousness, to augment our war effort."
ENG_never_surrender:0 "We Shall Never Surrender"
ENG_never_surrender_desc:0 "As with any war effort, there are many detractors who advocate reconciliation with the enemy. To counter this sentiment, we should begin a propaganda campaign to promote the just nature of our war and the necessity of victory."
ENG_bletchley_park:0 "Bletchley Park"
ENG_bletchley_park_desc:0 "In the north of Buckinghamshire, a crack team of military intelligence researchers has emerged. Despite minimal funding, the Bletchley Park Electrician's Union, in coordination with our foreign intelligence service, has produced singular results. We should expand Bletchley Park's facilities and provide them with substantial state funding."
ENG_support_comrades:0 "Support Foreign Comrades"
ENG_support_comrades_desc:0 "If socialism is to survive, all socialist nations must thrive. It is our duty as socialists to assist the formerly downtrodden peoples around the globe who now valiantly their oppressors."
ENG_american_comrades:0 "American Comrades"
ENG_american_comrades_desc:0 "From America's manufacturing belt has come forth a redoubt of socialism. This new bastion of liberation, however, could easily be destroyed by the reactionaries it defies. We must assist the courageous workers of America any way that we can."
ENG_mexican_comrades:0 "Mexican Comrades"
ENG_mexican_comrades_desc:0 "The people of Mexico were among the first to cast off the chains of capitalist exploitation. Mexico remains, however, quite underdeveloped. We possess the means to help the Mexicans better their lot, and such assistance would surely foster closer ties between our nations."
ENG_further_cooperation:0 "Further Cooperation"
ENG_further_cooperation_desc:0 "We must do even more assist our North American allies. The relationship we are building there will surely be the start of something far greater."
ENG_australasian_comrades:0 "Australasian Comrades"

ENG_indian_comrades:0 "Indian Comrades"
ENG_indian_comrades_desc:0 "Britain was once the oppressor of the Indian people. However, the strength of the relationship between our two peoples, regardless of the unfortunate circumstance in which it was built, is undeniable. Through economic assistance to Bharatiya Commune, we can begin to put right the injustices of history, and in the process, strengthen the socialist cause."
ENG_liberation_of_canada:0 "Liberation of Canada"
ENG_liberation_of_canada_desc:0 "Across the Atlantic Ocean in the frigid north, the devil himself seemingly lies in wait. Canada and its lackeys will surely strike us with even the smallest opportunity. We cannot wait to be attacked; we are as ready now to liberate the people of Canada as we ever will be."


ENG_tuc:0 "The 1936 Congress of the Trade Unions"
ENG_tuc_desc:0 "This year's TUC will probably be a bit special - long-time Chairman Philip Snowden has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralisationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley) and status quo Federationists (Arthur Horner) with his egalitarian & pacifist running mate Annie Kenney are all vying for superiority. These will be nights to remember..."
ENG_tuc_economy:0 "Economic Policy"
ENG_tuc_economy_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
ENG_tuc_internal:0 "Internal Policy"
ENG_tuc_internal_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
ENG_tuc_military:0 "Military Affairs"
ENG_tuc_military_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
ENG_tuc_foreign:0 "Foreign Policy"
ENG_tuc_foreign_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The congress listened casually to every candidate until the suggestion of the Autonomists were heard, when a slow, shocked murmur ran through the hall."
ENG_central_industry_research:0 "Central Industry Research"
ENG_central_industry_research_desc:0 "To prepare our Syndicalist industry for the fight against the Capitalists, we should establish the Department for Central Industry Research. This office will help us overcome inefficiency."

ENG_expand_industry_1_desc:0 "The capitalist regime of old neglected Wales for centuries, and allowed, if not outright encouraged, the gradual depopulation of the region as its laborers migrated to England's city for menial jobs. The great economic potential of Wales and its people thus remains largely untapped; for the benefit of all, we must invest in Welsh industry."
ENG_synthetic_industry:0 "Synthetic Industry"
ENG_synthetic_industry_desc:0 "For the longest time, the British industry was dependent on imports from the colonies, and the economic impact of being cut off from these supplies is still very much felt. To avoid such a shock from ever happening again, we should focus on research in the area of synthetic production."
ENG_militarized_industry:0 "Militarised Industry"
ENG_militarized_industry_desc:0 "Only through relentless efficiency and discipline, even in the most mundane of tasks, will we be able to beat the capitalists."

ENG_local_industry:0 "Local Industry Initiative"

ENG_local_talent:0 "Local Talent Initiative"
ENG_local_talent_desc:0 "We cannot afford to waste innovative talent just because it is not centred in the metropolitan areas. We need to support local talent."
ENG_local_initiative:0 "Local Initiative"
ENG_local_initiative_desc:0 "It's local, and it's an Initiative giving Initiative to the locals. What's not to love?"
ENG_political_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"
ENG_political_commissars_desc:0 "Sometimes, even the most diligent Syndicalist needs a small reminder of his duties. Sometimes, that reminder should be given from behind a revolvers' sights."
ENG_defend_the_revolution:0 "Federationists: Defend the Revolution"
ENG_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Revolution must be defended from the attacks from Autonomists and Maximists! The only way forward is the orthodox one!"
ENG_new_capital:0 "Move the TUC"
ENG_new_capital_desc:0 "London has long held a privileged place in Britain, and has become swamped by Centralism and bureaucracy; the TUC's current location reinforces this. Only by moving to a smaller city, one at the heart of Britain, and thus within reach of all its people, will we able to guarantee fair representation for all. This city will be Birmingham."
ENG_home_rule:0 "Home Rule"
ENG_home_rule_desc:0 "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
ENG_dissolve_tuc:0 "Dissolve the TUC"
ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress has served its purpose. While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many. With the success of our initial decentralisation efforts, the time has come to make the People's Palace the seat of a new, English TUC. The remains of the Union will be dealt with shortly."
ENG_devolution:0 "Devolution"
ENG_devolution_desc:0 "With the establishment of TUCs in Cardiff and Edinburgh, the process of Devolution will come to a successful end."
ENG_turn_the_other_cheek:0 "Compromise with Maximists"
ENG_turn_the_other_cheek_desc:0 "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We cannot throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
ENG_city_upon_a_hill:0 "Compromise with Autonomists"
ENG_city_upon_a_hill_desc:0 "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We cannot throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."

ENG_dissolve_militias_desc:0 "The arms in the hands of the rabble have been tolerated for too long now. While our enemies hold on to these remains of a bygone age for some reason we know that only discipline is the way forward."

ENG_revolution:0 "Revolution"
ENG_revolution_desc:0 "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political programme a reality. This will be risky, though."
ENG_central_command:0 "Central Command"
ENG_central_command_desc:0 "We need to establish a central Army Headquarters to optimise communication and cooperation between army units. This will allow for more grand-scale operations to be planned in an efficient manner."
ENG_improve_army:0 "A New Lee Enfield?"
ENG_improve_army_desc:0 "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least according to gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order."
ENG_improve_army2:0 "Improve the Army: The Lewis M1936"
ENG_improve_army2_desc:0 "The equipment of the soldiers of the Revolution can never be perfect enough - time to improve upon our tried and tested design for a mainline machine gun!"
ENG_officer_corps_academy:0 "People's Officer Corps"
ENG_officer_corps_academy_desc:0 "Officers have a duty, and that is to be loyal to the revolution. By establishing a centralised People's Officer Corps and ending the terrible practice of military units voting for their own leaders, we can make sure they fulfil that duty."
ENG_red:0 "The R.E.D."
ENG_red_desc:0 "With the establishment of the Revolutionary Exportation Directory we will finally be able to conduct clandestine operations to help the workers around the world in their struggle against their oppressors!"
ENG_raf:0 "The Doctrine Dispute"
ENG_raf_desc:0 "For the last few months, disagreement has been brewing between the theorists of the Republican Air Force. They're unclear on how our countries air doctrine should develop, and it is affecting officer training by now. It is time to resolve these disputes!"

ENG_women_soldiers:0 "Women Soldiers"

ENG_three_armies:0 "Three Armies"
ENG_three_armies_desc:0 "Now that the home countries have at least partly gained their autonomy that same autonomy should go to the Worker's Militias.

ENG_copenhagen_conference:0 "Copenhagen Conference"

ENG_naval_dockyards:0 "Organised Dockyards"
ENG_naval_dockyards_desc:0 "The current disorganised state of the Dockyards administered by the smaller Syndicates is unacceptable. Some centralisation will have to happen or else we will lose the war at sea."

ENG_navy_doctrine:0 "Reform Whitehall"
ENG_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "While the Admiralty of the Republican Navy still sits in Whitehall, where the British Navy had its headquarters for centuries, the brain drain following the revolution hasn't been completely overcome. And sadly...it's showing."
ENG_big_boat_research:0 "Battlecruiser & Battleship Research"
ENG_big_boat_research_desc:0 "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - but it's really not the right path.

ENG_float_boat_research:0 "Carrier Research"

uob.0.t:0 "The New Britain"
uob.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
uob.0.a:0 "Fascinating."

uob.1.t:0 "The 1936 Trade Union Council Begins"
uob.1.d:0 "Today the Trade Union Congress of 1936 has begun. The various factions of the congress have sent their delegates and their leaders to London to argue for their position. We shall see what shall happen."
uob.1.a:0 "Let the Congress Begin!"

uob.2.t:0 "Economic Policy Vote"
uob.2.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
uob.2.a:0 "Max.: The economy must be expanded, centralised and streamlined."
uob.2.b:0 "Fed.: The economy must be expanded and centralised."
uob.2.c:0 "Aut.: Greater economic autonomy must be given to the Home Nations."

uob.3.t:0 "Internal Policy Vote"
uob.3.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
uob.3.a:0 "Max.: The local governments must be brought in line with the TUC."
uob.3.b:0 "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory."
uob.3.c:0 "Aut.: Decentralisation - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations."

uob.4.t:0 "Foreign Policy Vote"
uob.4.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy specifically what should the Union of Britain's role within the International be. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions."
uob.4.a:0 "Max.: We must fight the reactionaries wherever we find them."
uob.4.b:0 "Fed.: Canada is our mortal enemy, and France is our good friend."
uob.4.c:0 "Aut.: European Socialism - A Thousand flowers must bloom forth within the International."

uob.5.t:0 "Military Policy Vote"
uob.5.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
uob.5.a:0 "Max.: The military must be expanded and the local militias placed under TUC control."
uob.5.b:0 "Fed.: The army must be expanded but only in self-defence."
uob.5.c:0 "Aut.: A Scottish, English, and Welsh national army."

uob.6.t:0 "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
uob.6.d:0 "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
uob.6.a:0 "Shocking, to say the least."

uob.7.t:0 "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"
uob.7.d:0 "The TUC has decided to vote for Oswald Mosley's Maximists with an overwhelming majority. Oswald Mosley will become the new Chairman of the TUC."

uob.8.t:0 "Chairman Election - Feds & Cons Secure a Majority"

uob.8.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Horner"

uob.9.t:0 "Chairman Election - Autonomists Secure a Majority"

uob.9.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Glais."

uob.10.t:0 "Chairman Election - Draw"
uob.10.d:0 "The TUC has voted repeatedly during the last few days and the deadlock continues. What should be done?"
uob.10.a:0 "A compromise is reached with the Maximist and Federalist."
uob.10.b:0 "A compromise is reached with the Autonomist and Federalist."

uob.11.t:0 "Chairman Election - Autonomists Secure no Majority"
uob.11.d:0 "The TUC has decided to vote for Niclas y Glais' Autonomists - but not with any great majority. Niclas y Glais will become the new Chairman of the TUC but he will have to compromise with other factions."
uob.11.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Glais."

uob.12.t:0 "Chairman Election - Feds & Cons Secure no Majority"
uob.12.d:0 "The TUC has decided to vote for Arthur Horner's Federationists and Annie Kenney's Congregationists - but not with any great majority. The two running mates will be able to decide who will become the new Chairman - or Chairwoman - but he - or she - will have to compromise with other factions."

uob.14.ac:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Kenney."
uob.14.ad:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Horner."

uob.15.t:0 "Show of Force"
uob.15.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
uob.15.a:0 "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters."
uob.15.b:0 "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland."
uob.15.c:0 "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland."

uob.16.t:0 "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
uob.16.d:0 "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island. In face of this grave situation many politicians suggest that Ireland should find someone to guarantee its independence. The most reasonable option would be Germany - but there are even some advocating a return to Windsor protection."
uob.16.a:0 "Maintain our neutrality."
uob.16.b:0 "Ask the Kaiser for protection."
uob.16.c:0 "Ask the Canadian king for protection."

uob.17.t:0 "Ireland Requests Canadian Support"
uob.17.d:0 "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violations of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
uob.17.a:0 "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Entente."
uob.17.b:0 "Announce our support for Ireland."
uob.17.c:0 "We are not ready for such involvement in the Old World."

uob.18.t:0 "Canada Protects Ireland"
uob.18.d:0 "The Canadian government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Windsor influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
uob.18.a:0 "Most splendid!"
uob.18.b:0 "Bloody hell!"

uob.19.t:0 "Canada Supports Ireland"
uob.19.d:0 "The Canadian government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Canadians are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."
uob.19.a:0 "At least we're not alone..."
uob.19.b:0 "It may actually be quite wise to do so..."

uob.20.t:0 "Canada Abandons Ireland"
uob.20.d:0 "The Canadian government has ignored the Irish call for help. Whatever comes next they must be prepared for the worst as this gives the British a free hand in choosing their next step towards the Emerald Isle."
uob.20.a:0 "Oh no!"
uob.20.b:0 "Rule Britannia!"

uob.21.t:0 "Ireland Requests German Support"
uob.21.d:0 "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violation of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
uob.21.a:0 "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Reichspakt."
uob.21.b:0 "Announce our support for Ireland."
uob.21.c:0 "We are not ready for such involvement."

uob.22.t:0 "Germany Protects Ireland"
uob.22.d:0 "The German government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Hohenzollern influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
uob.22.a:0 "Most splendid!"
uob.22.b:0 "Bloody hell!"

uob.23.t:0 "Germany Supports Ireland"
uob.23.d:0 "The German government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain.

uob.24.a:0 "Oh no!"
uob.24.b:0 "Rule Britannia!"

uob.25.t:0 "Union of Britain Threatens Iceland and the Azores"
uob.25.d:0 "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Royal Navy but this is opposed by many Canadians who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."
uob.25.a:0 "Demonstrate our own power."
uob.25.b:0 "Spend our resources on further buildup."

uob.26.t:0 "The Royal Navy on the Atlantic"
uob.26.d:0 "The King has ordered the Royal Navy to enter the Atlantic in a show of force roughly matching ours. Although the Entente is far too weak for another war we should keep this act in mind should we attempt another demonstration."
uob.26.a:0 "Bloody hell!"
uob.26.b:0 "Merde!"

uob.27.t:0 "The Canadians Cower"
uob.27.d:0 "The Canadians did not dare to send their fleet into the Atlantic allowing our force to operate freely. This has shown the power of socialism and weakness of the Imperialist 'great powers'."
uob.27.a:0 "Rule Britannia!"
uob.27.b:0 "Vive le Socialisme!"

uob.28.t:0 "Union of Britain Threatens Iceland and the Azores"
uob.28.d:0 "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Reichspakt but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Hochseeflotte but this is opposed by many Germans who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."

uob.28.b:0 "Spend our resources on further buildup."

uob.29.t:0 "The Hochseeflotte on the North Sea"
uob.29.d:0 "The Kaiser has ordered the Hochseeflotte to enter the North Sea in a show of force fairly matching ours. Although the Entente is far too weak for another war we should keep this act in mind should we attempt another demonstration."
uob.29.a:0 "Bloody hell!"
uob.29.b:0 "Merde!"

uob.30.t:0 "The Germans Cower"

uob.30.a:0 "Rule Britannia!"
uob.30.b:0 "Vive le Socialisme!"

uob.31.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Ireland"
uob.31.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Ireland. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Irish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Ireland?"
uob.31.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face Canadian arms!"
uob.31.b:0 "Back down! We've changed our minds!"

uob.32.t:0 "The Royalists Send an Ultimatum over Ireland"
uob.32.d:0 "The Royalists in Canada have sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Ireland and declare a ceasefire or Canada will come to Ireland's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the island and secure our vulnerable flank in the event of future conflict, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
uob.32.a:0 "We will not risk war with Canada over this."
uob.32.b:0 "We answer to no monarchy! Continue on to Dublin!"

uob.33.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Ireland Ultimatum"
uob.33.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Irish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Ireland into our alliance or we can stand down and let Ireland fall, stengthening their position in the Atlantic."
uob.33.a:0 "We stand with Ireland!"
uob.33.b:0 "Back down! We've changed our minds!"

uob.34.t:0 "Ottawa Warns London"
uob.34.d:0 "Canada has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain. They will either fall back to the British mainland or risk annihilation."
uob.34.a:0 "We knew they'd pull through for us!"

uob.35.t:0 "Britain Backs Down Over Ireland"
uob.35.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. Ireland's independence will be kept and our pride remains intact."
uob.35.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without Canada!"
uob.35.b:0 "Those Socialist eejits were in dire need of that!"

uob.36.t:0 "Canada Betrays Us!"

uob.39.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Ireland Ultimatum"
uob.39.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Irish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Ireland into our alliance or we can stand down and let Ireland fall, strengthening Republican control of the British Home Islands."
uob.39.a:0 "They have made their choice, war it is!"

uob.40.a:0 "We knew they'd pull through for us!"

uob.41.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
uob.41.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Ireland's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
uob.41.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without Germany!"

uob.42.a:0 "Never surrender!"

uob.43.t:0 "The Syndicalist British Attack Ireland"
uob.43.d:0 "The Union of Britain, those despicable usurpers, has declared war on the Irish state. So far we have only given diplomatic support to Ireland and do not have to intervene. We could still bring our forces into action - but after our lenient policy so far such a reaction would most likely raise protests here among those who support the Ulster cause and see the Irish Republicans as traitors to the Empire."
uob.43.a:0 "We stand with Ireland!"
uob.43.b:0 "Send a strong-worded letter..."

uob.44.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Ireland"
uob.44.d:0 "The Union of Britain, that nest of vipers, has declared war on the Irish state. In theory we have only given diplomatic support to the Irish and so do not have to intervene and many argue we are not ready for war, however to let a friendly state in our sphere be invaded by Syndicalists would cause us to lose face and be distrusted by other nations."
uob.44.a:0 "We stand with Ireland!"
uob.44.b:0 "Send a strong-worded letter..."

uob.45.t:0 "Diplomatic Moves in Ireland"
uob.45.d:0 "In recent days diplomats from the Union of Britain have begun to make intimidating moves in Ireland demanding a number of privileges and reforms. Without a doubt this is the beginning of a bigger campaign."

uob.48.d:0 "The 'British' ambassador has ignored our demands. While we could just pull out of this whole affair we could also announce to the world how these Syndicalist rowdies cannot be reasoned with - it will make us seem a little childish but will have consequences for them as well.

uob.63.t:0 "Ireland is Isolated!"
uob.63.d:0 "Now that we have been successful in isolating Ireland diplomatically, we can send them our demands. Ireland must allow us to station our forces there and allow syndicalist influence in their political system!"

uob.64.t:0 "Britain Demands Annexation!"
uob.64.d:0 "Our worst fears have been realised, the British government has demanded the re-annexation of Ireland. Ireland is to be an oppressed province once again. Although the situation looks hopeless the nation is near universally in favour of fighting until the bitter end, come woe or weal."

uob.64.b:0 "We'll make them pay for every inch they take!"

uob.65.d:0 "The British have decided to spread their so-called syndicalist 'revolution' and have demanded that we step down and put a socialist government into power, no doubt puppets of the British.

uob.66.d:0 "The British government has demanded that we allow them to base their troops in Ireland and have influence in the Irish government, which they will no doubt use to promote socialism.

uob.66.a:0 "We've been lucky, let's accept it."
uob.66.b:0 "Ireland must remain completely independent!"

uob.67.t:0 "Ireland Submits to Annexation!"

uob.77.b:0 "It's not worth the trouble..."

uob.78.t:0 "Germany Accepts!"
uob.78.d:0 "After years of holding out against the Union of Britain, we finally have allies in our struggle! Our courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds has been worth it."

uob.80.t:0 "Canada and Britain at War"
uob.80.d:0 "We have resisted the British for many long years, and now the Canadians and the British are at war. Should we send a request to ally with them against our common enemy?"

### 101 - 150: Office Events ###
uob.101.t:0 "The Office of General Secretary"
uob.101.d:0 "Now that the a new Chairman has finally been chosen many are urging to quickly choose a new General Secretary and end the period of uncertainty in British politics."
uob.101.aa:0 "The Congregationists are our closest allies."
uob.101.ab:0 "A compromise with the Maximists is in order."
uob.101.ac:0 "Niclas y Glais would make a much better general secretary."
uob.101.ad:0 "Eric Blair is the best choice in this matter."
uob.101.ae:0 "Arthur Horner would make a much better general secretary."
uob.101.af:0 "Christabel Pankhurst will improve women's rights all over Britain."
uob.101.ag:0 "Lewis Jones would make a much better general secretary."
uob.101.ah:0 "I have total confidence in the abilities of Tom Mann."

uob.103.t:0 "Merge the Posts of Chairman & General Secretary"
uob.103.d:0 "We can merge the positions of Chairman and General Secretary. While this is very much unconstitutional it will also very much strengthen our own position."
uob.103.a:0 "A strong leader for the Union!"
uob.103.b:0 "This doesn't seem like a good idea..."

uob.106.t:0 "The Exchequer's Post"
uob.106.d:0 "With Mosley securing his power in the TUC, he has to make up his mind about the Exchequer's office. His retaining his post would create a concentration of power that is not only prohibited by the Union's constitution but may also affect the quality of Maximist rule. The only problem is choosing a suitable candidate."
uob.106.aa:0 "Abe Moffat, director of the Coventry Machine Plants."
uob.106.ab:0 "David Kirkwood, former militia commander."
uob.106.ac:0 "Nye Bevan, creator of the Union's Health Service."
uob.106.ad:0 "Mosley has proven his efficiency and shall remain despite the constitution!"

uob.108.t:0 "A New Lee Enfield?"
uob.108.d:0 "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least according to gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order. A third option would be to not prefer one of the both and keep the Republican Army flexible instead."
uob.108.a:0 "Another trusty Enfield."
uob.108.b:0 "Give Birmingham a chance!"
uob.108.c:0 "Stay flexible!"

uob.150.d:0 "Veteran agitator and aid to the Arab Revolt in the Weltkrieg T.E. Lawrence has kept a low profile in the Union so far.

Today he approached Army High Command and offered to train as an agitator to help European Syndicalists rise up during the eventual war with Germany."
uob.150.a:0 "Lawrence shall be valuable in spreading the revolution."

They must be stopped at once!"
uob.152.a:0 "Damn you, Lawrence of Germania!"

uob.153.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence Has Moved North!"
uob.153.d:0 "That damned T.E. Lawrence is continuing to cause trouble, growing bolder as he moves his band of reds (who are blending in with the civilian population irritatingly well) into our northern Rhineland cities. He cannot be allowed to carry on!"
uob.153.a:0 "Damn you, Lawrence of Germania!"

uob.154.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence Has Moved East!"
uob.154.d:0 "That damned T.E. Lawrence is continuing to cause trouble, growing bolder as he moves his band of reds (who are blending in with the civilian population irritatingly well) into our central industrial cities. The chief of the Reich's security services has promised the Kaiser this will be the last time he and his 'merry men' can wreak havoc in this way. They have set a trap for him in Dresden."
uob.154.a:0 "Damn you, Lawrence of Germania!"

uob.155.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence Survives Ambush!"
uob.155.d:0 "German security forces snapped their trap on Comrade Lawrence while he and German Syndicalist fighters, one of them the writer Bertolt Brecht, were planting bombs in a factory in Dresden. While Lawrence managed to escape to the coast where a French submarine was able to take him back to Britain he was shot in the leg and can no longer walk without a cane. His time as an agitator is over, but his time as a Syndicalist hero has only just begun."
uob.155.a:0 "Hoorah for Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.155.b:0 "Good enough."

uob.156.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence Killed!"
uob.156.d:0 "German security forces snapped their trap on Comrade Lawrence while he and local Syndicalist fighters were planting bombs in a factory in Dresden. While Lawrence managed to secure the escape of his fellow revolters he was shot square in the chest and died on the spot. His time as an agitator is over, but his time as a Syndicalist hero has only just begun."
uob.156.a:0 "To absent friends! Hoorah for Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.156.b:0 "Good."

uob.157.t:0 "Counter-Revolution in Britain!"
uob.157.d:0 "The Syndicalist experiment in Britain is over! The military, commanded by the war hero T.E. Lawrence, also known as 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Lawrence of Germania' has taken control. The background of the coup is unclear; It seems that infighting between the wings of the Syndicalist government is involved. Lawrence has called for an immediate cease-fire at all fronts, he wants to bring the British troops back home and begin the process of reinstating the monarchy."
uob.157.a:0 "Hoorah for Lawrence of Britannia!"
uob.157.b:0 "Damn him!"
uob.157.c:0 "The nightmare is over!"

uob.158.t:0 "The Junta's Next Move"
uob.158.d:0 "Interim Chairman Lawrence has never been comfortable ruling a socialist nation such as ours. A good man and loyal Briton at heart, he was more at home agitating foreign peoples than overseeing five-year plans. Comrade Wintringham approached him and asked if he will allow a Congress to meet as soon as possible and establish a new civilian government - or maybe he has other ideas..."
uob.158.a:0 "Lawrence is secretly a Monarchist and launches a counter-revolution!"
uob.158.b:0 "Civilians? Pah! Though this socialism thing is growing on me..."
uob.158.c:0 "The Federationists secure the majority."
uob.158.e:0 "Congregationists and Autonomists form a pact!"

uob.205.t:0 "TUC Debate Stalled"
uob.205.d:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions has stalled in a fruitless debate over a proposed Maximist law. Comrade Blair has proposed to hold a speech in a few days - while he is known as a gifted public speaker he is not an orthodox Maximist and might smuggle in some of his own points..."

uob.209.t:0 "Opposition leaders Elude Capture"

uob.210.t:0 "Maximists Assume Control"
uob.210.d:0 "Today, we have worked closely together with loyal Army elements to take control of all important locations throughout the Union. Resistance is non-existent; We have won."

uob.211.t:0 "Resistance Against Maximist Coup"
uob.211.d:0 "Today we have worked closely together with loyal Army elements to take control of all important locations throughout the Union. However, on many streets and courtyards we have encountered open and armed resistance. If we don't act soon this resistance could organise itself."

uob.212.t:0 "Lawrence's Army Countercoup"

uob.213.d:0 "As the sun rises on the Union of Britain it rises over a different country - a Maximist country."
uob.213.a:0 "Hail Mosley!"

uob.214.t:0 "The Morning Afterwards"
uob.214.d:0 "As the sun rises on the Union of Britain it rises over a shocked country. The events of yesterday have shown that the Syndicalist order may not be as set in stone as it seems..."

uob.215.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has passed the 'Enabling Control Bill', passing quasi-dictatorial powers over to the government of Oswald Mosley. The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

uob.216.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.216.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has passed the 'Enabling Control Bill', passing quasi-dictatorial powers over to the government of Oswald Mosley.

uob.218.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"

There are also as-of-yet unconfirmed reports of many of them openly marching into the assembly hall of the Trade Union Congress under the massive cheers of anti-Mosley demonstrators, only leaving after being handcuffed at the speakers table to the "boos" of the assembly. This day will leave a clear mark on Maximist prestige."

uob.221.d:0 "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman.

The number of casualties is as-of-yet unknown, but the Maximists pass emergency law after emergency law in order to contain the situation; The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

Lawrence."

uob.224.t:0 "Maximist Putsch!"
uob.224.d:0 "This morning the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat.

uob.229.t:0 "Republican Forces Stand Idle"
uob.229.d:0 "The soldiers sitting on their tanks and guarding public squares seem to be not doing anything. For whatever reason, the hours pass, and nothing happens. The people peering out of their windows are waiting..."

uob.231.t:0 "Mending the Wounds"
uob.231.d:0 "The coup has been averted peacefully, but it should never have happened in the first place.

A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."
uob.361.a:0 "His Populist coup is successful!"

His name is Alan Turing, a math professor before the revolution, currently living in London. He first tried to evade our men, but after some time, calmed down. And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."

The small project of this Turing, over time grown into a whole village near the former cottage at Bletchley Park, has finally seen success. He has constructed a strange machine, called 'Pudding' after the Yorkshire pudding Turing was enjoying when he had the idea, that has revolutionised cryptography. For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."

A Revolutionary of the old guard, Mann spent his life serving the people of Britain and will be sorely missed.

uobflavour.33.d:0 "After the recent developments in Ireland the British ambassador in Dublin has invited his Canadian counterpart and his attachés to a dinner party in order to finally alleviate the tension - or at least that's what the Canadian delegation thought. Instead, they found themselves in a Dublin gin joint being served grumpy stew. As they finally left the embarrassing meeting they had to parade through a street filled with Irish socialists cheering on the British delegation. With this spiteful parting gesture however the British campaign against Ireland seems to have come to an end."

uobflavour.35.d:0 "The John Maclean, named after the first president of the Union of Britain, was the largest airship ever built. She was constructed in 1935 as a propaganda tool, intended to show the world the achievements of the Union of Britain. In 1936, she made her maiden voyage, and soon started making regular traffic to Paris. Today, as she was about to dock at a Paris airfield, she burst into flames and crashed to the ground. 35 people out of 97 (plus one of the ground crew) died."

uobflavour.36.d:0 "Comrade Mosley of the Maximist faction has invited Georges Valois of the French Sorelians, Lavrenti Beria of the former Bolsheviks in Georgia and Benito Mussolini of the Italian National-Syndicalists to Birmingham to compile a manifesto stating their joint aims for a new kind of Socialism called 'Totalism.' Chairman Snowden's Federationists should keep an eye on this development."

uobflavour.41.t:0 "The Totalist Charter"
uobflavour.41.d:0 "Mussolini, Valois, Beria and other interested parties arrived in Birmingham today to discuss their common ground. It has been agreed that Maximism, Sorelianism and National-Syndicalism all share basic principles of the state's primacy in the socialist struggle, the role of national identity within the state and the importance of a strong central authority to preserve and build socialism. The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism. These statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name "Totalism" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosley who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism."
uobflavour.41.a:0 "Let's hope the people reject this madness!"
uobflavour.41.b:0 "The people must reject this madness!"

uobflavour.42.t:0 "The Union of Arts"
uobflavour.42.d:0 "For a few years now, a group of artists led by a German emigrant by the name of Hannes Meyer have pushed for their idea of a unified Union of Arts. They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set. Should we establish one Union for all our artists, or leave things as they are?"
uobflavour.42.a:0 "The way forward is together!"
uobflavour.42.b:0 "We don't need centralisation for centralisation's sake..."

uobflavour.43.t:0 "Rebuilding the Crystal Palace"
uobflavour.43.d:0 "Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1844, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."
uobflavour.43.a:0 "Build the Worker's Palace!"
