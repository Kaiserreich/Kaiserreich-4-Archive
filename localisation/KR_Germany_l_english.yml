### Temporary ###
GER_poli_temp:0 "Final Reforms"
GER_poli_temp_desc:0 "For too long people have battled over where power should lie in our great government. It is time to answer that question once and for all."

### Ideas ###
black_guarantee:0 "Guaranteed Private Holdings"
black_guarantee_desc:0 "By guaranteeing the bank deposits of private citizens we have managed to stave off some level of panic. The cost has been immense however."

GER_political_uncertainty:0 "Political Uncertainty"
GER_political_uncertainty_desc:0 "Ludendorff's dictatorship exposed several serious problems in our government. Despite this, little has changed in the Constitution since 1871. It has yet to be seen if the increasingly loud calls for reform will be answered, ignored, or silenced."

GER_imperial_pride:0 "Imperial Pride"
GER_imperial_pride_desc:0 "The German Empire rests at the very top of the world's pecking order, a place it has enjoyed since the end of the Weltkrieg. It would take a great deal for them to admit defeat in the coming war... Though there are some who suggest that Germany's resilience is more brittle than it appears. Should the unthinkable happen and Berlin falls, or Germany loses control of many of its major cities, the nation would likely capitulate long before most of its territory is actually occupied."

GER_black_monday:0 "Black Monday Effects"
GER_black_monday_desc:0 "The stock market in Berlin has collapsed, and with it, Germany's already stagnant economy. If Germany is to retain its hegemonic position, the 'Black Monday' crisis must be addressed."

GER_black_monday1:0 "Schachtplan"
GER_black_monday1_desc:0 "Hjalmer Schacht, president of the German state bank, has implemented a controversial economic stimulus programme. His efforts seem to have succeeded in at least partially alleviating the Black Monday crisis, and public markets have already begun to slowly trend upwards."

GER_black_monday2:0 "Grönerplan"
GER_black_monday2_desc:0 "Statesman Wilhelm Gröner's proposal to allow conscripts to fulfil a year of military service through labour has been implemented, and the Black Monday crisis has been partially resolved by the extra employment boost."

GER_address_reichstag:0 "Address the Reichstag"
GER_address_reichstag_desc:0 "While we've implemented the preliminary steps to solve the Black Monday crisis, the situation is still dire. Despite his senility and failing health, Kaiser Wilhelm II has expressed in an address to the Reichstag that their first priority must be fixing the economy as soon as possible. Which proposals will be accepted, however, has yet to be seen..."

german_eco_finished:0 "Economic Resurgance"
german_eco_finished_desc:0 "Our economy has received fresh incentives and again liquidity has begun to flow. While it will not hold forever, for a time we should have something of a boom on our hands."

GER_bunkrupt_fact:0 "Major Company Collapses"

GER_rhine_unrest:0 "Rhineland Workers' Strike"

GER_strike_negot_desc:0 "We managed to come to terms with the strikers. It was the only way."

GER_col:0 "Colonial Upkeep"
GER_col_desc:0 "Once our colonies were profitable, but this is no longer the case. Now we must expend valuable resources to keep their administrations afloat."

GER_mil_mis:0 "German Military Mission"

GER_quenched_militarism:0 "Quenched Militarism"
GER_quenched_militarism_desc:0 "Victory always comes at a cost, and the Weltkrieg was unlike any war the world had ever seen. While we may have been victorious, that didn't bring our boys home. Our families still remember that pain clearly and are not eager to experience it again."

GER_quenched_militarism2:0 "Quenched Militarism"
GER_quenched_militarism2_desc:0 "Victory always comes at a cost, and the Weltkrieg was unlike any war the world had ever seen. While we may have been victorious, that didn't bring our boys home. Our families still remember that pain clearly and are not eager to experience it again. Though we've increased our recruitment, many of the youth are unwilling and unready for a true war."

GER_renwed_militarism:0 "Renewed Militarism"
GER_renwed_militarism_desc:0 "Though the German race has always been martial, the price we paid in blood during the Weltkrieg and the wars thereafter has been extortionate. Despite this, there is no more room for complacency. German patriotism is a virtue and the people will remember that fact."

GER_research_boost:0 "Research Funding"
GER_research_boost_desc:0 "The only way that we can get scientists out of their lecture halls and into the laboratories is by throwing money at them. Increased state funding will go some way to helping with this."

GER_victors_of_wwi:0 "Victors of the Weltkrieg"
GER_victors_of_wwi_desc:0 "We were the undisputed victors of the Weltkrieg and our place in the sun all but guaranteed. Unfortunately that was 20 years ago and our arrogance may have got the better of us since then..."

GER_tank_idea:0 "Investment in Panzers"
GER_tank_idea_desc:0 "Some view the Panzer as the weapon with which all future wars will be decided. Further investment into the area is vital for German hegemony to continue."

GER_tirpitz_idea:0 "Tirpitzprogramm"
GER_tirpitz_idea_desc:0 "Großadmiral Tirpitz was the titan of his age, and his investment into the Kaiserliche Marine prior to the Weltkrieg ensured that we had a fleet capable of facing off against the Royal Navy. Such vision is needed again."

GER_junkers_lost_idea:0 "Problems with Grain Supply"
GER_junkers_lost_idea_desc:0 "With Germany's population expanding after the Weltkrieg and during the Tirpitz golden age, we became reliant on grain from our Mitteleuropan partners. With there now being a hole in our eastern buffer, food supplies have dropped."

GER_easter_promises_idea:0 "Easter Promises"
GER_easter_promises_idea_desc:0 "When Germany was at its nadir after the Turnip Winter of 1916-1917, the Kaiser promised constitutional reform after the Weltkrieg ended. Perhaps now, with our stagnancy becoming increasingly evident, things might change."

GER_bundesrat_idea:0 "Restored Bundesrat"
GER_bundesrat_idea_desc:0 "The Ludendorff regime rode roughshod over many of the privileges that the German states had prior to the Weltkrieg, one of them being representation in the form of the Bundesrat. Restoring this ancient right is a great sign of things to come."

GER_post_idea:0 "German Post Office"
GER_post_idea_desc:0 "Though it may seem laughable, one of the last bulwarks against complete federal integration under the Reich was the existence of separate postal services. With this rectified, Germany truly is united."

GER_embrace_FAUD_idea:0 "Freie Arbeiterunion Deutschlands"
GER_embrace_FAUD_idea_desc:0 "The best way to disarm the Syndicalist menace is by working with less ideological leftists. Tolerating the main trade union should give less succour to the Reds in Germany."

GER_dcgb_idea:0 "Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund"
GER_dcgb_idea_desc:0 "A new state-sponsored union can channel the energies of our working class in the right direction."

GER_institut_idea:0 "Institut für Luftfahrttechnik"

GER_cult_of_aviation_idea:0 "Cult of Aviation"
GER_cult_of_aviation_idea_desc:0 "No longer is the sabre-wielding warrior the idol of Germany's youth. It is the dashing pilot, the duelist of the modern age, that inspires us all."

GER_mil_support_idea_desc:0 "Under the terms of our hard-fought treaty with the German Reich they have promised us full military support."

GER_eco_support_idea:0 "German Economic Support"
GER_eco_support_idea_desc:0 "Under the terms of our treaty with Germany we managed to agree an economic trade zone with them. This should help industrialise our nation."

GER_two_front_idea:0 "War on Two Fronts"
GER_two-front_idea_desc:0 "We're at war with both France and Russia, a nightmarish situation that we strove to avoid at all costs. We won once, and we shall do so again!"

AUS_Integration:0 "Austrian Integration"
AUS_Integration_desc:0 "Austrian integration will take time. Until it is finished we won't be the unified fighting force we should be."

GER_FVP1:0 "The Fourty Hour Work Week"
GER_FVP1_desc:0 "The implementation of the fourty hour work week has created a situation where employers can no longer expect to succeed by making their workers labor endlessly. The result of this new regulation has been a race of innovation and productivity, one that we can capitalize on and benefit from by increasing infrastructure investments in parallel."

GER_NLP2:0 "Easy Money Policy"
GER_NLP2_desc:0 "Simple and low-risk access to credit for both the general populace and businesses is causing some economic growth within the private sector."

GER_DKP2:0 "Agricultural Subsidies"
GER_DKP2_desc:0 "Subsidising agriculture both makes farmers fond of our administration and increases food supply. What's not to love?"

GER_ZEN2:0 "The Shakeout"
GER_ZEN2_desc:0 "Businesses are closing and consolidating together in the aftermath of Black Monday, causing some short-term chaos."

GER_ZEN1:0 "German Austerity"
GER_ZEN1_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. By cutting down on government expenditures wherever we can and securing budgetary confidence, our stability even in the face of crisis is guaranteed."

GER_ZEN22:0 "Consolidated Industry"
GER_ZEN22_desc:0 "Following Brüning's program of allowing German industry to settle with minimal intervention, it seems as though efficiency and output has increased as a result."

### Decisions ###
GER_black_monday_decisions:0 "Black Monday Crisis"
GER_black_monday_tooltip:0 "The Black Monday Crisis is wreaking havoc on our economy."

GER_bm_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"
GER_bm_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the Germans' belief in their country. Public faith is key, so starting weekly radio addresses to announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis will help avoid panic and keep trust in our administration."

GER_bm_halbstarke:0 "Mitigating the Halbstarke Terror"
GER_bm_halbstarke_desc:0 "With juvenile delinquency rampant, Germany's streets have been unsafe. We must enact an extensive programme of activities to rid our disillusioned youth of violent impulses."

GER_black_monday_reichstag_decisions:0 "Black Monday Policies"
GER_black_monday_reichstag_decisions_desc:0 "Black Monday has left the once mighty German economy in shambles, and economic experts say that the implications of the crash will lurk with us for years to come. The time has come to take firm, decisive action through wise statesmanship to fight back and bring some life back into the economy. Several proposals put forward by parties within the Reichstag are being debated to this end. The Kaiser has signaled that he expects action, and is likely to accept any feasible proposal that comes from the deliberations--Even one not fielded by a party found in the Cabinet.\n\nWe can only pass a total of four policies.\n\nPolicies Passed: ([?GER.GER_policies_passed|-0])"

GER_reichstag_in_progress:0 "Policy Being Implemented"

GER_bmr_SPD1:0 "SPD: Social Welfare"
GER_bmr_SPD1_desc:0 "With unemployment soaring to record rates, putting food on the table is becoming difficult for many families. No German should go hungry! Offering emergency assistance to help these people get back on their feet is not only a moral imperative of our administration, but a needed measure to prevent radicalization and bring stability."

GER_bmr_SPD2:0 "SPD: Mixed Economy"
GER_bmr_SPD2_desc:0 "Black Monday has shown that the private sector simply cannot be fully trusted to make good, rational choices. The nationalization of several failing industries within the Reich will bring much needed revenue and allow us to keep some people employed, as well."

GER_bmr_FVP1:0 "FVP: The Eight-Hour Workday"
GER_bmr_FVP1_desc:0 "While Industry insists that the ten hour workday is unquestionably needed to maximize productivity, the reality is that squeezing their labor to the bone has done little to stop the current economic crisis. Instituting a fourty-hour workweek will make life easier for the average factory worker, and hopefully force our industry to innovate and improve efficiency instead of simply stagnating."

GER_bmr_NLP1:0 "NLP: Opening the German Market"
GER_bmr_NLP1_desc:0 "Traditionally, the German Empire has taken a protectionist stance, preferring to sell and trade products within the sphere of Mitteleuropa. According to economist Ludwig von Mises, however, opening our market to the rest of the non-Syndicalist world and slashing barriers to trade has the potential to bring serious benefits. While undoubtedly a silly idea, it might just be worth a try." 

GER_bmr_NLP2:0 "NLP: Easy Money"
GER_bmr_NLP2_desc:0 "In the current economic environment, banks are holding back on loaning money. By lowering interest rates and instituting an Easy Money policy, we can encourage our financial institutions to make riskier loans to citizens and increase cash flow."

GER_bmr_ZEN1:0 "Zentrum: Budget Discipline"
GER_bmr_ZEN1_desc:0 "We've faced tough times before, and we'll do it again. By cutting our expenses wherever we can and increasing taxes, we can secure the position of the German state in the face of this crisis... Though it's safe to say that very few people will be happy about this course of action."

GER_bmr_ZEN2:0 "Zentrum: Shakeout"
GER_bmr_ZEN2_desc:0 "After looking at the German industrial sector, it's obvious that many manufacturers are currently overproducing goods following the rapid drop in demand after Black Monday. We need to step aside and allow the market to adjust and re-consolidate; a little bit of pain now will make for a much more healthy economy later."

GER_bmr_DKP1:0 "DKP: A Steady Course"
GER_bmr_DKP1_desc:0 "After implementing the first steps of our economic recovery plan, the DKP simply wants to make sure that the rest of our strategy goes smoothly. As one of the most prominent political parties in Germany, the DKP is in a unique position to mediate disputes and keep a calm, steady status quo within the Reichstag and Germany as a whole."

GER_bmr_DKP2:0 "DKP: Agricultural Subsidies"
GER_bmr_DKP2_desc:0 "Farmers represent a substantial part of the DKP's base and a non-negligible part of the economy, too. Emphasizing Germany's agricultural sector in these trying times will help guarantee both their votes and a lower cost of food."

GER_bmr_DVLP1:0 "DVLP: Economic Mobilization"
GER_bmr_DVLP1_desc:0 "Alfred Hugenberg's DVLP has been calling for increased military spending in the midst of Black Monday. The Kaiserreich's military is already substantial, and increasing this even further seems absurd, even if more recruitment could technically solve unemployment. Still, the infamous media magnate might just get his wish if he calls in a few favors."

GER_black_monday_mitteleuropa_decisions:0 "Black Monday Crisis in Mitteleuropa"

GER_bm_polish_nationalisation:0 "Approach Poland"
GER_bm_polish_nationalisation_desc:0 "With the economy slowly finding its track again, the time has maybe come to finally improve our economic ties with Poland. There has been some enthusiasm about this proposal in some circles. The Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano in particular has been a leading proponent of the idea."

GER_black_monday_colonies_decisions:0 "Black Monday Crisis in the Colonies"

GER_bm_sale_of_ceylon:0 "Sale of Ceylon"
GER_bm_sale_of_ceylon_desc:0 "Despite its natural resources, as a result of administrative inefficiencies the island of Ceylon is a very unprofitable part of our colonial empire, requiring massive investment every year. However, there have been proposals of selling the island to the Princely Federation - undoubtedly a profitable idea."

GER_doctrine_new:0 "Military Reform"
GER_doctrine_new_desc:0 "With the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been embroiled in heated debate as to which military doctrine should be adopted. We should establish an impartial committee of military officers to oversee the adoption of new doctrine."

GER_doctrine_great_war:0 "Squad Tactics"
GER_doctrine_great_war_desc:0 "The Chinese Intervention and more recent conflicts have convinced our officers of the importance of coordination within individual squads. We should integrate so called 'Gruppentaktiken' into our infantry training regime."

GER_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "There is one book that every man who wants to become an officer in the army of the Reich must read - Clausewitz's 'The Art of War'.

GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorised Infiltration"
GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While our military high command is divided on many subjects, they are united on one topic: that the possibilities mass motorisation offers to our infantry can be exploited to win decisive and speedy victories on an operational scale, hearkening back to the victory of 1870/71."

GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "A New Doctrine"
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Some of the more radical innovators in our high command including, among others, Heinz von Guderian and Erich von Manstein, are lobbying for research into a totally new doctrine. They want to focus on the fast movement of armoured spearheads to break up solid fronts."

GER_doctrine_superior_firepower:0 "Neutralization"
GER_doctrine_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The phrase 'artillery bombardment' fails to capture the essence of what we plan to do with artillery. We seek the complete neutralization of the enemy through a rain of shells, one that will last days, weeks, or longer--Whatever is needed."

GER_mil_expansion_naval_1:0 "Finish 1934 Navy Plan"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1_desc:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands unchallenged on any sea, for now. The Union of Britain, the French Commune, the Americans and the Japanese all jealously seek to catch up with us and if left unchecked, our naval domination will end as quickly as it began. We should continue the large navy modernisation project initiated back in 1934 to keep our fleet one step ahead of our rivals."

GER_global1:0 "Supply Lines to Singapur"
GER_global1_desc:0 "Having an empire across the globe has the small disadvantage of having to actually exert control over those areas, and that means sending not only soldiers, but also tax collectors and other vermin. Our officials need tax forms and invoice documents, bureaucratic elements that need to be sent all the way from Germany. We must ensure that our supply chain is adequately supported to reflect this reality."

GER_global2:0 "Expand Singapur Harbour"
GER_global2_desc:0 "Now that we have the capacity to exert our control more effectively over the supply lines to Ostasien, we need an adequate endpoint to the chain. The harbour of Singapur is the busiest in the eastern hemisphere, with German ships on their way to the Chinese concessions, Australasians Delhi-bound and the occasional American or Russian. Commerce is good; we should expand the harbour."

GER_global3:0 "Treaty with Hawaii"
GER_global3_desc:0 "Singapur is currently our easternmost major port, yet the Pacific is vast. Should we ever come into a position where we want to strike against the western coasts of America, we need a closer base. Only one site beckons, and it is on the independent islands of Hawai'i. We should approach their government to ask for basing rights."

GER_global4:0 "Strike at the Panamá Canal"

GER_north_sea2:0 "Flanders-Wallonia Naval Bases"
GER_north_sea2_desc:0 "We require more ports in the North Sea to ensure we have a chokehold over our enemies' trade and to discourage a repeat of the Weltkrieg blockade. Expanding our naval bases within Flanders-Wallonia such as in Antwerpen will help this goal."

GER_north_sea3:0 "Lease Trondheim from Norway"
GER_north_sea3_desc:0 "A proposal has been made to lease the port of Trondheim from the Norwegians in return for monetary compensation and our protection. We should propose this offer quickly in order to protect our vulnerable northern flank."

GER_north_sea4:0 "Secure the Skagerrak"
GER_north_sea4_desc:0 "The Skagerrak is the vital strait between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We must secure it to prevent our fleets becoming locked within the Baltic Sea in the event of the Kiel Canal being blocked."

GER_generic_navy1:0 "Fortify the North Sea Coast"
GER_generic_navy1_desc:0 "The North Sea Coast must be defended. In the unlikely event that our entire fleet is lost then our flanks would be dangerously exposed, and so we must begin fortifying the coastline at once."

GER_generic_navy2:0 "Fortify our Naval Bases"
GER_generic_navy2_desc:0 "In line with the coastline fortifications we should seek to better defend our vital naval bases from amphibious invasion."

GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing:0 "Heed Dönitz's Words"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing_desc:0 "The highly respected and talented Karl Dönitz reminds us that the success of ocean-going navies is dependent on them actively controlling the seas. Our fleets should strive for large, decisive battles and destroy our opposition before they get a chance to intercept our supply routes. This doctrine has been dubbed Präsenzflotte."

GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing2:0 "U-Boat Warfare"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing2_desc:0 "We conducted U-Boat warfare throughout the Weltkrieg but we restricted our attacks in order to avoid courting international condemnation. This policy shall continue but with a new range of U-Boat models at our disposal."

GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing3:0 "Larger, Faster, Heavier"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing3_desc:0 "Larger, faster, heavier. These are the words that our navy should live by when designing new warships. We shall make it so."

GER_doctrine_base_strike:0 "Listen to Patzig and Raeder"
GER_doctrine_base_strike_desc:0 "Patzig and Raeder have, in close communication with Sperrle of the Luftwaffe, devised a type of naval strategy reliant on mobile airbases in the form of carrier ships. These men are convinced that on the open sea, where assistance can take days to arrive, ships should only be risked if they fight together as one group with air cover under a doctrine known as Operative Manövergruppen."

GER_doctrine_base_strike2:0 "Naval Air Force Research"
GER_doctrine_base_strike2_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe have demanded extra funding if they are to implement the new Manövergruppen naval doctrine. We should grant this funding with the expectation of solid results."

GER_doctrine_fleet2_desc:0 "Destroyers cannot escape the gaze of our new modernisation programme. We will draft and construct a new modern destroyer fleet."

GER_tirpitzprogramm:0 "Renew Tirpitzprogramm"
GER_tirpitzprogramm_desc:0 "By 1914, the Tirpitzprogramm had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world. That was a long time ago, and the British fleet is no longer the biggest in the world. All the same we must not be idle. Germany must continue its extensive ship building efforts if we are to remain master of the high seas."

GER_naval_plans:0 "Deutschland beherrscht die Meere"
GER_naval_plans_desc:0 "Deutschland beherrscht die Meere are the words our navy lives and dies by. We shall launch a new series of training exercises on the North Sea coast to give our sailors some more experience at sea."

GER_marines1:0 "Independent Seebatallions"
GER_marines1_desc:0 "We must retrain and expand our marine corps to meet new challenges against enemies overseas. Granting them increased autonomy within naval command should give us better results."

GER_marines2:0 "Marine Transports"
GER_marines2_desc:0 "We lack dedicated landing craft for our Seebattalions. This must change if we are to storm the British coastline and take our fight to nations on distant seas. We shall design and construct a new dedicated amphibious landing craft to meet this challenge."

GER_doctrine_last:0 "New Textbooks"
GER_doctrine_last_desc:0 "Since 1810 the famous Prussian War College has been inarguably the most prestigious military institute for higher learning in the world. However, prestigious does not necessarily mean up to date. Our military doctrine has thoroughly changed in the last few years, and while some classics never get old - Clausewitz still saves stressed students - others have fallen out of date. It is time to replace them."

GER_security:0 "Institute the Verdeckte Reichspolizei"
GER_security_desc:0 "The Syndicalist terror is nearly as bad as back in 1928, when Reichsbank President Karl von Helfferich was shot by a lone gunman. Back then, a countrywide crackdown brought some measure of peace, but now security forces seem powerless. There have been proposals to found a new police force, the Verdeckte Reichspolizei. The 'Verpo' would work in the shadows, to save us all from the darkness of radicalism."

GER_security_prerequisite:0 "Either §YFranz von Papen§! or §YKurt von Schleicher§! is the head of government."

GER_political_suppression:0 "Political Suppression"
GER_political_suppression_desc:0 "The Reichspolizei are formally meant to stop Syndicalist cells and other radical groups, but they can also be put to other interesting purposes. There's plenty of politicans within the opposition that could be silenced with just a few convenient bits of blackmail..."

GER_consult_military:0 "Consult the Military"
GER_consult_military_desc:0 "Many seem to forget that the Heer is the loyal, sturdy backbone that Germany was built upon. Kurt von Schleicher, however, has not. Accordingly, the Reichskanzler has met with several interested figures within the military behind closed doors to express his support."

GER_kaiserbund:0 "The Kaiserbund"
GER_kaiserbund_desc:0 "In light of the ongoing economic stagnation, Reichstag foreign policy specialists from the FVP and the NLP have proposed a new plan dubbed the Kaiserbund project. It promises to greatly cut the expenses of our colonial administration by handing over control of our colonial empire to local governments in more loose alignment with our home administration..."

GER_security_2:0 "Ban French Organisations"
GER_security_2_desc:0 "The formerly French-controlled regions in western Germany have been unruly for a long time. French nationalism is widespread, and French cultural and political organisations have strong roots in the region even now. Banning them could suppress French nationalism, or it could serve to inflame tensions and radicalise the population. The Commune of France will not be happy either way."

GER_security_3:0 "Manoeuvres in Elsaß-Lothringen"
GER_security_3_desc:0 "The despicable Communards feel bold enough to defy our rule and are supporting insurgents in Lorraine! After extensive talks with the Kaiser and High Command, the Chancellor has approved partial mobilisation of the reserves and is considering a massive military exercise in Alsace-Lorraine involving air and armour detachments and military observers from the Reichspakt member states."

GER_security_4:0 "Destroy the Internationale"
GER_security_4_desc:0 "The greatest threat to stability in the world is by far the Syndicalists, and they have no greater stronghold than the Internationale. For years, High Command has dreamed of leading troops into Paris again, restoring order in Europe and eradicating the vile Red Menace forever. There is no better time than now to strike. Let the communards tremble, for the Reichspakt comes!"

GER_foreign_aid:0 "Aid Our Allies"
GER_foreign_aid_desc:0 "If we want to preserve our hegemony we must ensure our allies and protectorates throughout the world are strong and loyal. Let us invest in our puppets and colonies."

GER_IRE_deal:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
GER_IRE_deal_desc:0 "Assailed from all sides, the Irish have turned to the Reich for protection. We should offer them a full treaty so that we'll have a loyal ally in the fight against the Union of Britain."

GER_DKB_deal:0 "Military Mission to the Cossacks"
GER_DKB_deal_desc:0 "If we are to keep the Russians in check we must ensure we can combat them on all fronts. Let us send aid to our allies in the Don-Kuban union and help them build their army."

GER_BUR_ALLY:0 "Ally with Burma"
GER_BUR_ALLY_desc:0 "The recent invitation of Siam into the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere poses a threat to our large Pacific colonial empire. We can try to counter expansion of Japanese influence in Indochina by allying with Burma, a state threatened from one side by Syndicalists and from the other by the expansionist Siam. Through such a diplomatic manoeuvre we can threaten Siam from the west should a conflict arise."

GER_Mauser_werke:0 "Mauser Contracts"
GER_Mauser_werke_desc:0 "Founded under the auspices of the mighty Friedrich himself, Mauser has been instrumental in aiding the growth of German power over the past century. By sponsoring them more directly we can increase and improve our small arms production."

GER_weapons_contracts:0 "Weapons Contracts"
GER_weapons_contracts_desc:0 "Mauser, Erma Werke, Haenel, Walther, and Sauer & Sohn--Germany has a variety of private gun manufacturers that would all eagerly become our primary provider, helping us streamline production and get the exact type of firearms we're looking for."

GER_mil_expansion_air_1:0 "Wallonian Airstrips"

GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1:0 "Build More Airbases"
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1_desc:0 "Build airbases both in the Heimat and outer provinces so that we can set the infrastructure for better defence and offence in the skies."

GER_Henschel_Albatros:0 "Naval Aviation Corps"
GER_Henschel_Albatros_desc:0 "Another result of the untangling of air warfare from ground warfare has been the founding of a group of aviators focused on naval aviation. These pilots, trained in special courses, are now demanding aircraft to fit their special requirements."

GER_Junkers_Fogger:0 "Long-Range Fighters"
GER_Junkers_Fogger_desc:0 "As a result of the Bombergruppen doctrine, the demands on range of operations has multiplied. Theorists and researchers are demanding new aircraft models to keep up with their increasingly aggressive bombardment plans. After the Paris bomber comes the London bomber, after that the Moscow bomber - and there doesn't seem to be an end!"

GER_air_doc:0 "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"

GER_air_doc_2:0 "Modern Air Doctrines"
GER_air_doc_2_desc:0 "By relying on the youngest and brightest minds of the Luftwaffe we can make sure that our air force does not only have the weight of industry behind it, but also the finesse of modern tactics."

GER_mil_expansion_land_1:0 "Militarist Revival"
GER_mil_expansion_land_1_desc:0 "Though the German people are renowned for their bellicosity and national pride, the Weltkrieg cost us dearly and many a family was denuded of its menfolk. It is time for us to revive the militaristic spirit of the Prussian era, in the name of the Reich and the Kaiser!"

GER_Infantry_divs:0 "New Weapons"
GER_Infantry_divs_desc:0 "While the German army has the greatest soldiers in the world, it must not lag behind in equipment terms. Even the greatest of soldiers will have a hard time defeating a better equipped enemy and it would not do for the pre-eminent world power to have troops armed with broomsticks."

GER_political_1:0 "Imperial Restructuring"
GER_political_1_desc:0 "While it is an undeniable fact that the German Empire is the greatest nation to ever grace the pages of history, there is always room for improvement. In light of recent 'shortcomings' in our administration we should look into making various policy changes and reforms for a better future."

GER_black_monday_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
GER_black_monday_aftermath_desc:0 "The great stock market crash of 1936, widely known as 'Black Monday', has already had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be truly known, let alone fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."

GER_mil_industry_2:0 "PEkI I"
GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the civilian industry horribly, and the military industry has been affected even worse. Our military supply specialists are clamouring for a programme for the extension of war-relevant industries, or Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien, to ensure our military has bullets to fight."

GER_mil_industry_3:0 "PEkI II"
GER_mil_industry_3_desc:0 "The Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien - or abbreviated PEkI, but who would want to abbreviate such a good, German word - is making progress. At least our arsenals don't have to open their last reserves whenever a unit wants to move out anymore. There's still some way to go, but at least we are on the right path."

GER_civ_industry_1:0 "ZIP I"
GER_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is in shambles, with many workers out of a job after their former employers were forced to submit to the crisis. Some of our leading economic researchers have proposed a plan for civil industrialisation, the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan, to revitalise the civilian industrial sector."

GER_civ_industry_2:0 "ZIP II"
GER_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "The first phase of the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan has shown promise, but there is more yet to come. At least some of the worst social and economic disaster has been alleviated, though."

GER_civ_industry_3:0 "ZIP III"
GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps. Soon enough German industry will tower above the rest of the world once more, as the steady influx of resources from the colonies assures a massive production boost."

GER_industry_finished:0 "Economic Boom"

GER_siemens:0 "Subsidies for Siemens"
GER_siemens_desc:0 "Siemens is one of the many middle-to-larger sized businesses that form the heart of the German economy. By making contracts with them - and some other smaller industry companies - we can begin treading the slow and steady path to economic recovery."

GER_thyssen:0 "Build up Thyssen"
GER_thyssen_desc:0 "Thyssen AG, actually a conglomerate of various companies, produce everything; coal, steel, ships, and even some consumer products. By investing into them, we can help build up the civilian sector of our economy to get stronger returns later."

GER_krupp_steel_focus:0 "Krupp Steel"
GER_krupp_steel_focus_desc:0 "All this talk about infrastructure and helping our citizens is nice, yes, but what about artillery? Tanks? Planes? The world isn't safe, and Friedrich Krupp AG has the solutions we need! They've served Germany for generations, and the time has come to call on them again."

GER_infra_1:0 "Deutsche Bahn"
GER_infra_1_desc:0 "Germany is a large, busy nation, and the most practical solution for transporting goods and supplies is definitely locomotives. Funding a quick project to touch up our rail-system and extend it to some more rural parts of the country will stimulate the economy and help connect the nation a bit more."

GER_infra_2:0 "Reichsautobahn"
GER_infra_2_desc:0 "Trains are now, but cars are the future. Reichskanzler Tirpitz ordered the construction of several highways throughout Germany, but the projects remain uncompleted--Worse, progress has all but stalled in the wake of Black Monday. We need to not only complete this project, but think even bigger..."

GER_infra_3:0 "Europabahn"
GER_infra_3_desc:0 "Mitteleuropa is large and impressive on paper, but we just aren't making the most of it. Several regions, especially Eastern Europe, are not connected to Germany properly. A main reason for this are the underdeveloped and poorly maintained rail systems that result in constant logistical bottlenecks. We can fix this, and we will." 

GER_risky_industry:0 "Accelerate Recovery"
GER_risky_industry_desc:0 "This foolish talk of building up a 'strategic rear of industrial production' is not only idiotic, it's borderline treasonous! The Internationale, or anything else that might come from our Western border, for that matter, is not a credible threat. We need to focus on getting the economy up and running as soon as possible, and the best way to do that is by investing in the Rhineland and similar areas."

GER_risky_industry_1:0 "Revive the Rhineland"
GER_risky_industry_1_desc:0 "The Rhineland is one of the most productive and industrially prosperous areas in the world. Dealing with the ongoing turbulence the area is experiencing and defending it from the French will have to be a priority, but it's hard to argue that investing here could have serious payoff."

GER_risky_industry_2:0 "Building up Baden"
GER_risky_industry_2_desc:0 "Württemberg does not immediately come to mind when considering the industrial landscape of Germany, but this area is right next to the Rhine and the Danube. Making the right moves here could turn out well!"

GER_output:0 "Fund the Factories"
GER_output_desc:0 "We must manufacture more guns, planes, and tanks. There's no telling what our many enemies have in store for us, which means we have to be ready for everything. Not through great speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided, but by iron and blood!"

GER_safe_industry:0 "Emphasize Strategic Rear"
GER_safe_industry_desc:0 "Black Monday is both a problem and an immense opportunity. For years, the industrial heart of Germany has been extremely close to our unsafe western border. Should worst come to worst and we were to lose these areas, we'd be finished; however, if we were to invest in areas such as Silesia, far from the front, we could guarantee our ability to fight on in even the most terrible, unthinkable circumstances."

GER_safe_industry_1:0 "Silesian Steel"
GER_safe_industry_1_desc:0 "The Rhineland is a tempting target for investment, but it is important to remember that there's a variety of reasons why it's failing in the first place. The radicalisation of the workers and their wildcat strikes as of late doesn't bode well, and France being right next door could have dangerous implications. Silesia is a safer bet!"

GER_safe_industry_2:0 "Plans for Prussia"
GER_safe_industry_2_desc:0 "Prussia is the heart of Germany's history and governance, but not the heart of its industry. There's several reasons why this is the case, but no matter! Focusing on industrial buildup in the Kaiser's crownlands is certain to keep those factories as secure as we could hope for."

GER_construction:0 "Concentrate on Construction"
GER_construction_desc:0 "The economy is beginning to show some signs of life, and now is the time to push the program through to its natural conclusion. Whether through private investment, public funding, or the injection of foreign capital, let us begin building as much as we can as fast as we can."

#GER_industry_finished:0 "Economic Resurgance" already defined above
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "With our economic policies following the Black Monday widely regarded as a resounding success, private investors have picked up on the lead, and the economy has not only stabilised but is currently experiencing a boom of sorts.

GER_economy_desc:0 "It's good, really. The industry is humming along, the grain is coming in from the eastern member states of the Reichspakt, many citizens have work. It's looking up for the Kaiserreich, and it seems like nothing will be able to stop the golden age of the late Reichskanzler Tirpitz..."

GER_research_expansion:0 "Extra Research Funding"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Investing in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs. Isn't that an awfully good phrase? It doesn't really say anything, but it sure sounds good. Anyway, the laboratories are over there..."

GER_ig_farben:0 "Invest in IG Farben"
GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "We can invest in IG Farben, a pharmaceuticals company currently researching ways to synthesise various chemical compounds that might prove useful to our interests."

GER_krupp_focus:0 "Krupp AG Contracts"
GER_krupp_focus_desc:0 "The Krupps are an almost 400 year old dynasty of industrious Germans, who have fed the Reich's war machine ever since the Thirty Years War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg imminent."

GER_rearmament:0 "Aufrustung"
GER_rearmament_desc:0 "The world is getting less and less safe. The Syndicalists in France eye Elsaß-Lothringen greedily, Russia plunges into instability, and the Japanese wait for the right moment to hit us in the back to take Singapur. A focus on rearmament isn't going to be popular, but it's what we need right now if we want to keep our place in the sun."

GER_artillery_research:0 "Artillery Research"
GER_artillery_research_desc:0 "An area in which the German army has a longstanding tradition of lagging behind is the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."

GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Armoured Breakthrough"
GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Another crucial point of Guderian and Manstein's new doctrine is the so-called Schwerpunkt. They believe that Panzer technology has advanced to a point where massed, mobile Panzer forces, with adequately equipped support troops, should be able to lead any offensive to victory. Now they need new Panzers to fit this idea."

#GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Panzer Research" already defined above
#GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Although the degree to which they are emphasized in our new doctrinal thinking varies, it is hard to deny that the tank is going to play a crucial role in warfare. Armor is uniquely equipped to support infantry, or to simply lead a spearhead. Regardless of what we intend to use them for, we're going to need more and better tanks." already defined above

GER_hahn_meitner:0 "Support Hahn & Meitner"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Hahn and Fräulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists; Hahn is regularly published in science journals even in the Syndicalist bloc, and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together, we believe, the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."

GER_rocket:0 "Support von Braun"
GER_rocket_desc:0 "Von Braun is a notorious proponent for the field of 'Rocketry' and is the most accredited scientist for the field worldwide. He comes to us with the offer of new weaponised designs in return for sponsorship. We should heavily consider this."

GER_zuse:0 "Support Konrad Zuse"
GER_zuse_desc:0 "Konrad Zuse has already handed in several patents for what he calls a 'computing devices'. With proper sponsorship, his mind could be put to good use by the state, for the state."

GER_radar:0 "Support Rudolf Kühnhold"
GER_radar_desc:0 "Rudolf Kühnhold has some interesting ideas regarding a so-called 'radio measuring device'. This could give us a serious advantage on the sea, air, and even land, and might just be worth investing in."

GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society_desc:0 "Recent investments in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science have resulted in greater research capacity in various fields. If we officially endorse and promote the society as a place for state-sponsored research for state purposes, we should be able to attract some of the brightest minds of the new generation."

GER_black_monday_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"

GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the German's belief in their country. Public faith is key, so starting weekly radio addresses to announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis will help avoid panic and keep trust in our administration."

GER_groener1:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Estates"
GER_groener1_desc:0 "The statesman Wilhelm Groener has recently published an essay titled 'The black zero: the need for austerity', in which he demands absolute balance discipline, even if it means losing some companies depending on subsidies. The essay has found a lot of adherents within the populace, and liquidating a few unprofitable companies may be just what we need to alleviate our expenditures."

GER_groener2:0 "Reichsarbeitsdienst"
GER_groener2_desc:0 "The contacts and friends of Groener in military circles have now proposed a radical innovation. For the duration of the crisis, recruits will be able to choose to fulfil half a year of military service as manual labourers in state service instead. While bad for recruitment numbers, this will inject some much needed labour into our economy."

GER_groener3:0 "Sale of Ceylon"
GER_groener3_desc:0 "Despite its natural resources, as a result of administrative inefficiencies the island of Ceylon is a very unprofitable part of our colonial empire, requiring massive investment every year. However, there have been proposals of selling the island to the Princely Federation - undoubtedly a profitable idea."

GER_schacht1:0 "Bail Out Junker Estates"
GER_schacht1_desc:0 "The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, has demanded a green light to go ahead with his economic programme, dubbed the 'Schachtplan'. According to him, we need to bail out the highly indebted Junker estates if we don't want to trigger an even further descent into chaos."

GER_schacht2:0 "Investitionsprogramm"
GER_schacht2_desc:0 "The next part of the Schachtplan would be a massive programme aiming to encourage private investment, both into Mittelstand businesses as well as consumer products. While this will be hard to achieve, it should enable producers to find a market for their products again, which will hopefully help to restart the economy."

GER_schacht3:0 "Approach Poland"
GER_schacht3_desc:0 "With the economy slowly finding its track again, the time has maybe come to finally improve our economic ties with Poland. There has been some enthusiasm about this proposal in some circles. The Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano in particular has been a leading proponent of the idea."

GER_mitteleuropa:0 "One Currency for Mitteleuropa"
GER_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Now that Heinrich von Brentano and his friends of the European Friendship association have found their way into upper government circles, he has proposed another of his ideas. He proposes a single common currency, shared by all Mitteleuropan countries. This would, of course, never work. European friendship? What a silly idea."

GER_zollverein:0 "Reform Mitteleuropa"
GER_zollverein_desc:0 "For too long Mitteleuropa has existed in name and nothing else, it is time for is to start reforming it to actually benefit its members...and us. The first step is unified tariffs."

GER_synthetic:0 "Research in Synthetics"
GER_synthetic_desc:0 "In cooperation with members of the Kaiser Wilhelm society, IG Farben researchers have already been able to make astounding breakthroughs on the area of synthetic production. By giving them access to more funds, we might be able to make their research ready for mass implementation."

GER_experimental_research:0 "Experimental Research"
GER_experimental_research_desc:0 "While we have already made good progress in some of the more traditional fields relevant to industry - engineering, chemistry, physics - some of our scientists want funding to conduct research into some more esoteric matters. Though profit might not be as immediate, the long-term potential is immense!"

GER_black_monday_finish:0 "Finish Black Monday Reforms"
GER_black_monday_finish_desc:0 "It seemed impossible, but the numbers confirm it - the crisis is nearing its end. The key point is that it is not yet over. There are still millions without jobs, and civil society has been stretched to breaking point. The catastrophe of Black Monday will leave marks for a generation, but this is the beginning of the end."

GER_organize_the_youth:0 "Organise the Youth"
GER_organize_the_youth_desc:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness in our nation's youth would be organising them so that they can learn new skills and employ their energy for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."

GER_a_christian_trade_union:0 "A Christian Trade Union"
GER_a_christian_trade_union_desc:0 "By founding the Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund as a state-endorsed union, we will hopefully establish a bulwark against attacks on the workers' loyalty from left and right. Workers will be able to voice their concerns under the moral authority of priests and the guiding hand of the 'summus episcopus': the Kaiser."

GER_jet:0 "Cult of Aviation"
GER_jet_desc:0 "The image of the aviator has changed in the current conflict. They have replaced the cavalry as the image of the glorious and gallant war. Every child aspires to be an aviator and streak across the skies in his shining armour. By further fostering this image, we can motivate our pilots to give their very best in the service of the Reich."

GER_linie1:0 "Reactivate the Ludendorfflinie"
GER_linie1_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace looms darker than ever. In fear of going into the next war unprepared, the reactivation of the old Ludendorfflinie on our western border is considered vital. Once one of the dictator's many costly prestige projects, the line of bunkers and fortifications has fallen into disuse in recent years. This is nothing that cannot be solved with a bit of engineering ingenuity!"

GER_linie2_full:0 "Over the Meuse and Far Away"
GER_linie2_full_desc:0 "Our puppet regime in Brüssel is screaming for help against the Syndicalists. Extending the reactivation of the Ludendorfflinie over the Meuse river and up to the North Sea coast would be costly and take up precious time - but it might enable us to make a stand on foreign soil so that not one German civilian is threatened."

GER_linie2_small:0 "Fortify Bastenach Alone"
GER_linie2_small_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin and time is of the essence. Even though Flanders-Wallonia may lie somewhat undefended compared to the Franco-German border, we cannot afford to waste time defending foreign territory that will be lost sooner or later anyway."

GER_linie3:0 "Fortify the Rhineland"
GER_linie3_desc:0 "The Rhineland is the most heavily industrialised region in the entire world and absolutely vital to our economy, both in peace and in war. All the same, it lies only a few miles away from a border that many have been eyeing nervously in recent months. In order to prepare against any eventualities, we should start extending the Ludendorflinie northwards."

GER_schule:0 "Paderborner Luftkriegsschule"
GER_schule_desc:0 "The establishment of a formalised school for our aviators would help immensely in unifying and promoting this currently somewhat disorganised field. There are a lot of heroes of air warfare from the Weltkrieg, the most famous of course being the Red Baron himself, whose insight can still be valuable to new recruits. There, they could impart their wisdom to a new generation of German pilots."

GER_institut:0 "Institut für Luftfahrttechnik"
GER_institut_desc:0 "An independent research organisation for aviation technology, the Institut für Luftfahrttechnik, could prove a major stepping stone on the way to ensuring German dominance not only on the ground and on the sea, but also in the skies."

GER_tactical_bombers:0 "Operational Flexibility"
GER_tactical_bombers_desc:0 "Our domain stretches worldwide, with military operations being possible in the Pacific, Atlantic, or in continental Europe. There's no telling what threats we're going to face, and thusly a focus on tactical bombers that can fulfill any number of tasks would be wise."

GER_heerflieger:0 "Keep the Fliegertruppe"
GER_heerflieger_desc:0 "Our aviators are currently organised as part of our army structure, without an independent air force command. This boosts cooperation between aviators and ground troops, and therefore leads to the current doctrine concentrating solely on that; air support with ground force primacy. This specialisation is suitable and should remain our policy."

GER_doitagain:0 "Listen to Sperrle"
GER_doitagain_desc:0 "Hugo Sperrle, a grim veteran pilot from the Weltkrieg, has gained some notoriety amongst our Fliegertruppe lately for his bold new doctrine. He proposes that converting our industrial might into all-out production of Strategic Bombers could win us the next war quicker and with fewer casualties by destroying the enemy's capacity and will to fight."

GER_luftwaffe:0 "An Independent Luftwaffe"
GER_luftwaffe_desc:0 "Since the Weltkrieg the Red Baron, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, has argued for the establishment of an independent air force - the Luftwaffe, as he likes to call it. Up until very recently, the conservative elements in the traditionally more prestigious ground forces have been able to prohibit this, but with war looming once again, it might be time to consider the Baron's idea."

GER_sturzflieger:0 "Sturzflieger"
GER_sturzflieger_desc:0 "One concept that has recently found a lot of supporters among aviation researchers is that of an aircraft that dives from great heights onto the battlefield to deliver its payload, using its momentum to climb again immediately afterwards. This concept, dubbed Sturzflieger, would minimise the time our precious aircraft would be in immediate danger."

GER_cas:0 "Coordinated Close Air Support"
GER_cas_desc:0 "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more mainstream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate our air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting the intricacies of this specialised form of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."

GER_para:0 "Found the Luftlandetruppe"
GER_para_desc:0 "Due to our continuing focus on ground-air cooperation, there have been proposals of greatly expanding our Paratrooper division, which is currently in its infancy. This might have to do something with the fact that jumping from a flying plane does not seem very glorious or entertaining - or survivable, really. We should promote the image of the paratrooper as the spearhead of the Kaiser's military."

GER_bombergruppen:0 "Bombergruppen Doctrine"
GER_bombergruppen_desc:0 "One of the first results of the founding of Richthofen's Luftwaffe has been the invention of a new doctrine. This doctrine asserts that the possibilities of massed bomber warfare are exciting enough to warrant primacy over the traditional ground support. Fighters should not be used on the ground, where they can be subjected to anti-air attacks, but in the skies where they can escort bomber squadrons."

GER_singapore_airstrips:0 "Expand Singapur Airstrips"
GER_singapore_airstrips_desc:0 "Singapur is the centrepoint of Deutsch-Ostasien. A fortress city, it has great demands for both civilian as well as military airstrips. We should meet this pressing need by investing in construction to protect our naval station from foreign rivals in the region."

GER_finalise_centralisation:0 "Finalise Centralisation"
GER_finalise_centralisation_desc:0 "The independent postal services of the kingdoms of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany are some of the last remnants of the old federal structure of Germany. By finally expanding the responsibilities of the national German postal service to these states, we could help suppress these damaging particularist tendencies. Germany is not something you can opt out of!"

GER_disband_reichstag:0 "Disband the Reichstag"
GER_disband_reichstag_desc:0 "Reichskanzler von Schleicher has succeeded. The DVLP is once again the most influential party in Germany and Junkers occupy all ministerial posts of note. The only thing left to do is to formalise the new regime in the same way as Erich von Ludendorff did in 1919; dissolve and suspend the Reichstag for an indeteriminate period of time to bring peace, freedom, justice and security to this new Kaiserreich."

GER_sonderweg:0 "The German Sonderweg"
GER_sonderweg_desc:0 "Our path from aristocracy to democracy has been unlike any other in Europe and this is keenly reaffirmed within the new Sonderweg school of thought. We should embrace these democratic ideas as much as we can."

GER_parlamentsvertrauen:0 "End Prussian Constitutionalism"
GER_parlamentsvertrauen_desc:0 "After more than sixty years of battle against the authoritarian elements of the German establishment, the time has finally come to make Germany a democracy at last. From now on, the Reichskanzler and his government will no longer report to the Kaiser, but to the Reichstag and the people; There will be no more government against, but only of the people, by the people, for the people."

GER_democracy_in_prussia:0 "Democracy in Prussia"
GER_democracy_in_prussia_desc:0 "The current voting system in Prussia is archaic and undemocratic. The people are split into three strata according to their income, with the lowest strata, representing over sixty percent of the population, receiving as many delegates as the upper one, which represents less than ten percent! We should finally implement universal, secret and equal franchise for all citizens of Germany."

GER_easter_promises:0 "The Easter Promises"
GER_easter_promises_desc:0 "On April 7th 1917, when the war was at its very worst, after the horrifying 'Turnip Winter', the Kaiser promised substantial reforms and the abolition of the three-class voting system in Prussia. However, he promised all of that without offering an actual date. It might be time to remind the Kaiser of his promises..."

GER_minority_rights:0 "Guarantee Minority Rights"
GER_minority_rights_desc:0 "Traditionally, the Kaiserreich has pursued a hardline policy of Germanisation towards certain populations--Especially the French in Elsaß-Lothringen and the Polish in our eastern territories. While this process of integration should continue, we can gain some valuable goodwill by showing at least some hint of respect for them."

GER_rebuild_institutions:0 "A True Reichstag"
GER_rebuild_institutions_desc:0 "Over time, the Reichstag has become a glorified rubber stamp body that serves to approve the policies of the Reichkanzler appointed by the Kaiser. No longer! From this day forward, the Reichstag shall be a true legislative body with its own voice, one that speaks for the people of Germany."

GER_status_quo:0 "Guard the Balance"
GER_status_quo_desc:0 "It is true that the state of our government is not ideal, but the world is a dangerous place and the people's complaints never were all that relevant. We have neither the time nor resources to waste on populist reforms; the status quo suits us just fine."

GER_glorify_kaiser:0 "Glorify the Kaiser"
GER_glorify_kaiser_desc:0 "Starting from the humblest of origins in Brandenburg, the Hohenzollern dynasty guided Germany to unification and victory time and time again. The Kaiser is a symbol of the strength and unity of the German people, one that we should honor and respect. By continuing to concentrate power around him and the Reichkanzler, we can guarantee a safer and more stable future."

GER_embrace_faud:0 "Embrace the FAUD"
GER_embrace_faud_desc:0 "The Freie Arbeiterunion Deutschlands has been a troublesome organisation. By embracing them and finally allowing them to operate unhindered, we could maybe make sure that they don't radicalise further."

GER_women_suffrage:0 "Women's Suffrage"
GER_women_suffrage_desc:0 "While the Prussians now finally have their universal, secret and equal franchise, the women of Germany are still exempt from the vote. Awareness of this issue has been steadily rising, and clubs modelled on the British suffragettes are recruiting new members. If we want to avoid the public embarrassment that the British suffered in that affair, we should maybe consider fulfilling their requests."

GER_schleicher:0 "Schleicher's Kamarilla"
GER_schleicher_desc:0 "The Kaiser made von Schleicher Reichskanzler due to his promises to secure Germany against threats both from the democrats as well as the Junkers. However, now that he has his office, Schleicher has been restaffing important offices and making contracts with Junker companies, and some people whisper about a sinister plan to get the Junker into power after all..."

GER_restore_country_rights:0 "Restore the Bundesrat"
GER_restore_country_rights_desc:0 "Under the Ludendorff regime, many of the privileges of the constituent countries of Germany were abolished. The largest of these insults was the formal dissolution of the Bundesrat, the chamber where delegates from all countries can voice their concerns and vote on empire-wide legislature.

#GER_siemens_desc:0 "Siemens is one of the many middle-to-larger sized businesses that form the heart of the German economy.

GER_russia_treaty_desc:0 "We have ignored the Russian Question for far too long. No longer are they merely a disgraced shadow of their former selves - they are, as loathe as we are to admit it, a world power.

### Domestic Events ###

gerdom.1.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Kaiserreich"
gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the Federation and four other states in southern Germany. The new constitutional framework created integrated the southern states into the Prussian-led Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Empire is a federation of twenty-five German states. The title of Bundespräsidium, or Federation President, was held by the King of Prussia, a figure now invested with the title of Emperor of Germany. The Emperor directly appoints the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws are enacted by both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the lower house Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years.\n\nWith an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire actually rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained mostly unchanged since 1849.\n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with the status quo and our constitution may need revision soon to help us weather the upcoming turbulence..."
gerdom.1.a:0 "A constitution guarantees stability, at least."

gerdom.2.t:0 "Hans von Seeckt Dies"
gerdom.2.d:0 "Our Chief of General Staff, Hans von Seeckt, has died today in Berlin. The hero of the Intervention in China passed away peacefully in his sleep.\n\nOur nation is mourning the loss of a true German hero, and all important dignitaries were in attendance at his funeral in Berlin. Afterwards, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser."
gerdom.2.a:0 "I wonder what he is up to?"

gerdom.4.t:0 "The Grain Crisis"
gerdom.4.d:0 "With parts of our grain supply in the Baltic and the Ukraine no longer under our control, we have begun encountering severe problems. Our burgeoning urban population cannot rely on German agriculture alone, and there have been scattered reports of state granaries going empty. Let's hope that this does not escalate as far as the horrible hunger winter of 1916/17..."
gerdom.4.a:0 "Scheisse!"

### Sale of Ceylon ###

gerdom.7.t:0 "The Status of Ceylon"
gerdom.7.d:0 "The island of Ceylon, though valuable for its massive supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly costly to control. Native tensions and a profligate local administration mean that its status should be reassessed sooner rather than later. What should we do with the island?"
gerdom.7.a:0 "Keep Ceylon under our control"
gerdom.7.b:0 "Grant the natives autonomous status within the German Empire"
gerdom.7.c:0 "Offer Ceylon to the Princely Federation"

gerdom.8.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
gerdom.8.d:0 "The Germans have come to us offering us the sale of Ceylon. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Indian Ocean. What shall our reply be?"
gerdom.8.a:0 "Welcome home, Ceylon!"
gerdom.8.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

gerdom.9.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
gerdom.9.d:0 "The ambassador from the Princely Federation has sent a message to us declaring that government has agreed to buy Ceylon. We have begun to transfer control over island to them."
gerdom.9.a:0 "Great."

gerdom.10.t:0 "Princely Federation Refused Ceylon Offer"
gerdom.10.d:0 "The Princely Federation has replied to our offer stating outright that they do not want Ceylon. We can now only keep things as they are or take the unfortunate step of granting more autonomy to the natives in order to stave off revolt. What shall we do?"

### Agricultural crisis in Mitteleuropa ###

gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the complacent agricultural sector of German economy has proven to be particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn. With this in mind several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and state subsidies for their agricultural production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this vital sector of the Reich's economy and protect our farmers. Unfortunately such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, dependent as they are on German markets for their food exports. The wheat crop in the Ukraine is particularly vulnerable, and choosing to enact protectionist measures might seriously damage them and our other agrarian partners."
gerdom.11.a:0 "We must protect our own peasants."
gerdom.11.b:0 "We shall not risk our Mitteleuropan ties."

gerdom.12.t:0 "Suffragist Movement Gathers Strength"
gerdom.12.d:0 "Lately there has been increased momentum in the women's suffrage movement, which seeks to force the government to enfranchise women by giving them the right to vote and stand for elected office. In these troubled times for the Empire, we must be careful in formulating a policy response liable to cause domestic tensions. Granting the suffragists what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, particularly members of the Reichstag, a body currently elected solely by universal male suffrage. On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to further protests and riots, especially in the more liberal states, many of which already permit female voting in regional assemblies."
gerdom.12.a:0 "It's a cause worth supporting!"
gerdom.12.b:0 "Promise action but do nothing."
gerdom.12.c:0 "Women. Know your limits."

gerdom.13.t:0 "German Women Demand Recognition"
gerdom.13.d:0 "In the great war against the Syndicalists, German women have assiduously proven their loyalty to the Empire. Some of them have proven fundamental to our propaganda efforts with very many of them began working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence time and time again. For these reasons, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again that the government grant women the right to vote and to run for office."
gerdom.13.a:0 "Will they never stop?"

gerdom.14.t:0 "The Halbstarke Terror"
gerdom.14.d:0 "With the devastating economic situation, many families struggle to earn their daily bread and the social security net is strained to the breaking point. In recent weeks the streets of many German cities have been increasingly terrorised by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism to escape boredom and frustration. Few citizens feel safe on the streets anymore and it is clear that what some in the government might see merely as low-level civic disorder instead has the makings of total societal breakdown."
gerdom.14.a:0 "Mein Gott! How shocking!"

### Tirpitzprogramm ###

gerdom.15.t:0 "The 1934 Naval Programme"
gerdom.15.d:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands as the strongest navy in the world in the year 1936, but many challenges will face it in the coming years. The expansionist Empire of Japan and resurgent Syndicalist fleets of Britain and France are both key future enemies seeking to unseat German naval superiority across the world.\n\nIn 1934, we started a major naval construction plan, and many of the ships laid down in that period are well on their way to being finished. Unfortunately, with our naval industry limited due to ongoing economic malaise, we will have to limit ourselves to one area of production. The question is - what should we focus on during the next six months?"
gerdom.15.a:0 "Battleships."
gerdom.15.b:0 "Carriers."
gerdom.15.c:0 "Destroyers."
gerdom.15.e:0 "U-Boats."

gerdom.16.t:0 "Reviewing the 1934 Naval Programme"
gerdom.16.d:0 "With the Naval programme of 1934 well underway it is incumbent on us to choose how we wish to continue. After all, priorities in the shifting sands of modern naval warfare seldom stay the same for long. What should we do?"
gerdom.16.a:0 "Begin the construction of a pair of Battleships!"
gerdom.16.b:0 "Begin the construction of a pair of Carriers!"
gerdom.16.c:0 "A squadron of Destroyers!"
gerdom.16.e:0 "Some U-Boats!"
gerdom.16.f:0 "Continue Battleship construction."
gerdom.16.g:0 "Continue Carrier construction."

gerdom.16.j:0 "The programme has been fulfilled!"
gerdom.16.k:0 "There is nothing we CAN do until Kiel is back under our control..."

### Schleicher and the DVLP ###

gerdom.17.t:0 "Kurt von Schleicher and the DVLP"
gerdom.17.d:0 "'Scandal! Scandal! Reichskanzler von Schleicher observed dining with Alfred von Hugenberg! Scandal!' cry the newspaper boys today. The prestigious Berliner Tagblatt, already responsible for the publication of the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1923 that led to the end of the Ludendorff regime, has landed another major scoop.\n\nA reporter was able to observe and even partially overhear a conversation between Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher and the leader of the reactionary Junker party DVLP, Alfred von Hugenberg, at a Berlin varieté. The relatively low standing of the establishment only adds to the scandal and while crowds come together to discuss the news, one question is on everyones' lips - what will the Kaiser's reaction be once he opens his morning newspaper?"
gerdom.17.a:0 "We should turn to von Papen."
gerdom.17.b:0 "The SDP couldn't be any worse..."
gerdom.17.c:0 "I think it's Brüning time."
gerdom.17.e:0 "It's merely fake news."

### Army dispute event ###

gerdom.18.t:0 "Another Army Argument"
gerdom.18.d:0 "While there is no shortage of capable thinkers in our Staff, one may argue that the issue we currently face is actually having too many of them. Currently, the Staff has divided itself into three groups of competing thought.\n\nProponents of an infiltration-focused doctrine, backed by Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, argue that the fighting spirit of the infantry and well-trained battalions backed with the highest quality weapons available acting in perfect coordination is the key to success.\n\nMeanwhile, Georg Bruchmüller, a seasoned officer from the Weltkrieg, proposes an artillery-focused doctrine with an emphasis on heavy bombardment to facilitate a breakthrough, replacing the infantry charges of old with even more shells than we've traditionally used.\n\nFinally, the least popular group of theorists led by Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian passionately argue for a large tank army backed up with motorized and mechanized infantry, envisioning an armored breakthrough with coordinated air support to get behind the enemy's lines.\n\nDuring a typical briefing with the Kaiser on the military, Heinz Guderian initiated an especially inflammatory argument with Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord on the matter of production priorities. While seemingly trivial, these arguments have been becoming more common as of late over every minor detail.\n\nThe situation has reached a boiling point, and it falls on the aging Wilhelm to come to a decision. Who has his support?"
gerdom.18.a:0 "Guderian's army is the one I want."
gerdom.18.b:0 "Bruchmüller speaks sense."
gerdom.18.c:0 "von Hammerstein-Equord has served us well for years!"

### Weapon Manufacturer Selection event ###

gerdom.19.t:0 "Choosing a Weapons Manufacturer"
gerdom.19.d:0 "As the world continues to become more dangerous, many in our government are suggesting that we could benefit from selecting a single arms manufacturer to standardize production and equipment standards. Naturally, German industry is robust and we have several choices available to us!\n\nMauser, dating all the way back to 1811, is perhaps the most obvious choice. They have a global presence, and have provided us with weapons for years--Such as the sturdy and reliable bolt-action Karabiner 98k.\n\nHaenel has been around since 1840, and is a smaller and less likely choice. However, there is a remarkable simplicity and sturdiness about their weapons that we can use. They also have some interesting ideas for weapons that can fire multiple bullets without needing to be bolted back with every shot!\n\nMostly, Walther, founded in in Ulm back in 1886, makes pistols--Good ones. However, they could easily accommodate our needs with just a bit of funding. Their weapons are well-rounded, but don't particularly excel in any one area.\n\nSauer & Sohn is the oldest of them all. If anyone could get us plenty of guns quickly, it would be them. Time is short, and we need to get a substantial army in the field; it might be best to just get a weapon in our men's hands as long as it fires.\n\nWe have the forms filled out and ready. Who do we send them to?"
gerdom.19.a:0 "Mauser, as always"
gerdom.19.b:0 "Erma shouldn't exist, why is this option here?"
gerdom.19.c:0 "Haenel"
gerdom.19.e:0 "Walther"
gerdom.19.f:0 "Sauer & Sohn"

### Election of 1937 ###

The fate of several parties and, of course, the Kaiserreich itself could be decided today.\n\nIf the Social Democrats manage to secure enough votes, the 'realist' wing of the Social Liberal FVP will form a coalition with them. Another possibility would be a coalition of nearly all liberal and burgeois parties - NLP, FVP and Bavarian splinter party BVP - against the predominance of the DKP, led by the beloved Lion of Africa, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.

gerdom.53.d:0 "The Free Worker's Union of Germany, or Freie Arbeiter Union Deutschlands, is an Anarcho-Syndicalist trade union that has been operating in Germany since its creation on September 15, 1919. They had been free to operate but the German government has just decided to arrest its leaders and ban the organisation. How should we react?"
gerdom.53.a:0 "It is too early to confront Germany."
gerdom.53.b:0 "We must defend our brothers in Germany! Solidarity!"

gerdom.54.t:0 "Rhineland Unrest!"
gerdom.54.d:0 "Workers in the Rhineland are protesting against the recent anti-leftist actions of our government, especially the scandalous crackdown on the FAUD which many Rhenish citizens had viewed as a legitimate institution free of serious Syndicalist influence and strong in its support for the working man."
gerdom.54.a:0 "Hopefully this will not cause tragedy!"

gerdom.55.t:0 "Worker's Unrest in the Rhineland!"
gerdom.55.d:0 "Workers in western Germany are protesting against their oppressive government! This might be chance to weaken our mortal enemy if we are prepared for the possible consequences of such a choice."
gerdom.55.a:0 "We must help them!"
gerdom.55.b:0 "We are not ready for this."

gerdom.56.t:0 "General Strike in the Rhineland!"
gerdom.56.d:0 "Angered by our previous actions aimed against labour fronts the workers have launched massive demonstrations throughout the Rhineland. A major police station in Mainz was burned down in a suspected arson attack and a shell factory near Landau smashed up by angry workers. These demonstrations are seriously undermining our war effort and endangering the stability of our western front."
gerdom.56.a:0 "Send in the army to deal with the strike!"
gerdom.56.b:0 "Negotiate with the workers."

gerdom.57.t:0 "Rhenish Strikers Cave!"
gerdom.57.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The strikers, seeing little success in their efforts, have decided to call off the strike."
gerdom.57.a:0 "Great!"

gerdom.58.t:0 "Rhineland Strike Negotiations"
gerdom.58.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. With all major political groups in the country closely watch the meeting, some are even hoping that the strike will set a precedent for further reforms in the Empire."
gerdom.58.a:0 "Stall the negotiations and send in the army!"
gerdom.58.b:0 "Reach partial agreement."
gerdom.58.c:0 "Reach a complete agreement."

gerdom.59.t:0 "Rhenish Workers Return to the Factories"
gerdom.59.d:0 "With the crisis resolved the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
gerdom.59.a:0 "Splendid!"

gerdom.60.t:0 "Rhenish Workers Return to the Factories"
gerdom.60.d:0 "Thankfully, our armed forces were able to suppress the revolting workers, forcing them to abandon their hopeless struggle."
gerdom.60.a:0 "Splendid!"

gerdom.61.t:0 "Syndicalist Involvement in the General Strike"
gerdom.61.d:0 "Although the general strike in the Rhineland is finally over an official inquiry into the event has suggested that a number of rebellious workers were supplied from abroad. Agitators, likely French Communards, handed out military-grade equipment and distributed Syndicalist propaganda to the masses. How should we react to this insolence?"
gerdom.61.a:0 "We cannot tolerate such insolence!"
gerdom.61.b:0 "We need solid proof of Syndicalist involvement."

### Death Events ###

gerdom.62.t:0 "Johann von Bernstorff Dies"
gerdom.62.d:0 "Today it was announced that the former ambassador to the United States and the Ottoman Empire and former State Secretary for the Interior, Johann von Bernstroff, has died."
gerdom.62.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."

gerdom.63.t:0 "Wilhelm Groener Dies"
gerdom.63.d:0 "One of the heroes of the Weltkrieg and the victor over the Bolsheviks during the Russian Intervention, Feldmarschall Wilhelm Groener has passed away today. All Germany is in mourning for one of the great generals of the post-Weltkrieg Golden Age."

gerdom.64.t:0 "Ludwig von Reuter Dies"
gerdom.64.d:0 "A hero of the Weltkrieg and commander of the Kaiserliche Marine, Ludwig von Reuter has died today. Famed for his actions during the battle of the Skagerrak and decisive actions against the British blockade, the German nation is in mourning."

gerdom.65.t:0 "Wilhelm Souchon Dies"
gerdom.65.d:0 "Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, a hero of the Weltkrieg and a Großadmiral in both our fleet and the Ottoman fleet, has passed away today. Souchon initially commanded the small Mediterranean Fleet before daringly handing his forces to the Ottomans and precipitating their entry into the war as a Central Power."

gerdom.66.t:0 "Georg Bruchmüller Dies"
gerdom.66.d:0 "Feldmarschall Bruchmüller a hero of the Weltkrieg and key developer of modern artillery tactics, has passed away today. Known to all as 'Breakthrough Müller' for his decisive actions during campaigns on both the Western and Eastern fronts, he will surely be missed by all Germans."

### The Kaiserbund ###

gerdom.72.t:0 "Status of Indonesia"
gerdom.72.d:0 "As part of our Kaiserbund programme we have decided to make our Indonesian holdings a semi-autonomous state in our empire. How would we like to divide the lands?"
gerdom.72.a:0 "Create a pan-Malayan state."
gerdom.72.b:0 "Divide the lands between Sarawak and Malaysia."

gerdom.73.t:0 "Status of Indochina"
gerdom.73.d:0 "As part of our Kaiserbund programme we have decided to make our Indochinese holdings a semi-autonomous state in our empire. How would we like to divide the lands?"
gerdom.73.a:0 "Create a pan-Indochinese state."
gerdom.73.b:0 "Divide it into states."

gerdom.74.t:0 "The Division of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.74.d:0 "As part of our new Kaiserbund policy it is incumbent on us to issue directions as new administrative arrangements in our colonies. One such territory is Mittelafrika. While conservative members of Reichstag are eager to leave the autonomous state unmolested, the bulk of our political establishment have already realised that Freistaat of Mittelafrika acts as a burden for both the German armed forces and our economy. Among the limited benefits the colony offers us is imperial prestige, and even then the Dark Continent is no longer seen in the same light as during Scramble for Afrika. Therefore, drastic reorganisation of this area is needed if we want to retain our presence in Afrika with while limiting our costs as much as possible."
gerdom.74.a:0 "Divide Mittelafrika into states."
gerdom.74.b:0 "Federalise them."
gerdom.74.c:0 "Keep the status quo."

gerdom.75.t:0 "Status of Malta"
gerdom.75.d:0 "With our new Kaiserbund policy currently being instituted by all limbs of the German state, the gaze of our officials has reached the Mediterranean island of Malta. Almost all important members of the general staff and many conservative politicians are arguing for keeping this island under direct control. They argue that Malta is crucial for the security of our Mediterranean shipping lanes between Marokko and the Suez, and point to its function as an 'unsinkable aircraft carrier'."
gerdom.75.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
gerdom.75.b:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

#gerdom.76.t:0 "Status of Somaliland"
#gerdom.76.d:0 "With our decision to implement Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide extent of its implementation on various fringe regions under our control. One such region is the German Somaliland. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep Gulf of Aden under our control, the most of politicians would rather cut down our expenses with administration of this territory even at cost of diminishing our presence in this area."

gerdom.77.t:0 "The Reorganisation of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.77.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."
gerdom.77.a:0 "A new order for Africa!"
gerdom.77.b:0 "Oh, I don't think so."

gerdom.78.t:0 "The Reorganisation of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.78.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."
gerdom.78.a:0 "A new order for Africa!"
gerdom.78.b:0 "Oh, I don't think so."

gerdom.79.t:0 "The Reorganisation of [AOG.GetNameDef]"
gerdom.79.d:0 "The Kaiserbund programme demands that administratively burdensome and costly colonies have their administrative frameworks altered. The AOG-held provinces of China are an abberation in many ways so it is important that we consider our policy position towards them. Though senior conservatives see our Place in the Sun as inviolable and the status quo perfectly acceptable, modernising influences in the Reichstag have argued that the economic model represented by the AOG's administration is no longer effective and keeping it intact will eventually result in massive dissent in the Chinese population. If this happens, our military forces, currently overstretched policing our massive empire and pivoting towards Europe in the face of Communard aggression, may not be able to contain such a revolt."
gerdom.79.a:0 "Restore the Qing Empire."
gerdom.79.b:0 "Reorganise the AOG into a new Chinese government."
gerdom.79.c:0 "Hand over control to the Qing."
gerdom.79.e:0 "Give power to the Kuomintang."
gerdom.79.f:0 "Keep everything as it is."

gerdom.80.t:0 "The End of [AOG.GetNameDef]"
gerdom.80.d:0 "As part of the German new Kaiserbund colonial policy, former lands held by [AOG.GetNameDef] were handed back to our direct control!"
gerdom.80.a:0 "Excellent!"

gerdom.81.t:0 "Status of Aden"
gerdom.81.d:0 "With our decision to implement the Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide the extent of its implementation in various fringe regions under our control. One such region is Aden in the Yemen. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep the Gulf of Aden under our control, most politicians would rather cut down on our administrative expenses even at the cost of diminishing our presence in the region."
gerdom.81.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
gerdom.81.b:0 "Offer Aden to Yemen."
gerdom.81.c:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

gerdom.82.t:0 "Germany Offers Us Aden"
gerdom.82.d:0 "The Germans have sent us an offer in which they will secede us the Aden and in return we become their protectorate. The offer is tempting to say the least, should we accept it?"
gerdom.82.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
gerdom.82.b:0 "We refuse!"

gerdom.83.t:0 "Yemen Accepted"
gerdom.83.d:0 "The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen has agreed to our offer and they have become our protectorate."
gerdom.83.a:0 "Great!"

gerdom.84.t:0 "Coronation of Wilhelm III"
gerdom.84.d:0 "With the passing of the great Weltkriegskaiser Wilhelm II, Wilhelm III has given a grand speech on his coronation day to guide all of Germany towards prosperity and to safeguard our interests across the globe!"
gerdom.84.a:0 "Heil dir im Siegerkranz!"

gerdom.85.t:0 "Germany Bans French Organisations!"
gerdom.85.d:0 "In response to the increasing self-assurance and revolutionary spirit of the Commune, the pathetic German leadership has instituted a harsh policy of cracking down on any organisations funded by us or related to French culture or politics in any manner. These discriminatory actions aimed against the struggling French minority within Germany, particularly in our occupied regions of Nancy and Alsace, are absolutely intolerable."
gerdom.85.a:0 "This shall not stand. To war!"
gerdom.85.b:0 "Assist French resistance groups."
gerdom.85.c:0 "Publicly condemn German actions."
gerdom.85.e:0 "We should avoid entanglements at this stage."

gerdom.86.t:0 "International Condemnation of Our Ban!"
gerdom.86.d:0 "The Commune of France used our recent actions aimed against all French organisations within the German Empire to organise an international conference on the issue. They publicly condemned what they call 'German Imperialism' and pledged to do everything possible to protect the French minority within the Reich. In response, several important members of the international community similarly condemned our actions against the French population, stating that such actions are a stain on the honour of a modern state. How should we react to this public humiliation?"
gerdom.86.a:0 "The Communards are behind this, destroy them!"
gerdom.86.b:0 "Germany cares not for the protests of minnows."
gerdom.86.c:0 "Restore the rights of the French minority."

gerdom.87.t:0 "Uprising in Wallonia and Lorraine!"
gerdom.87.d:0 "Thanks to our support the French and Walloon populations have risen against their German occupants! Already there is open street fighting between partisans and imperialist forces, and the military benefits of our fostering of the French resistance movements in Germany are quickly becoming apparent."
gerdom.87.a:0 "Aux armes, citoyens!"

gerdom.88.t:0 "Uprising in Wallonia and Lorraine?"
gerdom.88.d:0 "We are finally at war with the hated German reactionaries! Should we use this opportunity to help local French resistance movements in Wallonia and Lorraine achieve their long desired freedom?"
gerdom.88.a:0 "Support them!"
gerdom.88.b:0 "They can't handle German troops."

gerdom.91.t:0 "German Mission Arrives In Don-Kuban"
gerdom.91.d:0 "The German Empire decided to send an official military mission to our homeland in order to help us improve our obsolete armed forces. Such missions are well regarded for their impact on the militaries of nations like Ukraine and Venezuela, and we are fortunate to have them."
gerdom.91.a:0 "We will show them Cossack hospitality!"

gerdom.92.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck and the Flame of German Resistance"
gerdom.92.d:0 "This is the darkest hour of the German Empire. Defeated by the planes, tanks and tactics of a brutal foe, the imperial government has evacuated Berlin and is currently converging, shell-shocked and battered, on Daressalam. However, the army is not Germany itself, and under the African skies our loyal colonies remain committed to the war effort. All the same, the Reich's government as it stands is facing loathing for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe in German history, and many senior army officers are demanding the appointment of a new emergency chancellor. Many of them are clamouring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in Afrika during the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection that he commands among the askaris we must now rely on."
gerdom.92.a:0 "Yes! Appoint von Lettow-Vorbeck! Heia Safari!"
gerdom.92.b:0 "No! This would be the last nail in the coffin of our democracy!"

gerdom.93.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck Proposes an 'Afrikakorps'"
gerdom.93.d:0 "Chancellor von Lettow-Vorbeck has stood before the emergency government and argued that the German state must raise additional units of native schutztruppen, also known as askaris. These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the jungles of Ostafrika during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck has also proposed that we grant the native kings, princes and vassals that rule Afrika in our stead complete independence once we retake our Vaterland. Such a reward would incentivise our native population and leaders and invigorate them to assist us in getting to Berlin. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich is going through desperate times."
gerdom.93.a:0 "Rally the askaris from all of Mittelafrika!"
gerdom.93.b:0 "Pointless. We need German troops for a German war!"

gerdom.94.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Südwestafrika"
gerdom.94.d:0 "One of the first German colonies, Südwestafrika has proven especially loyal to the imperial government. However, its close connection with the founding of the German colonial empire might make it difficult for conservatives within our cabinet to accept the prospect of independence that has promised by von Lettow-Vorbeck."
gerdom.94.a:0 "Excellent."

gerdom.95.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Ostafrika"
gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika, with its capital of Daressalam, is seen by most officials as the jewel in the crown of the Reich's African possessions. As such the German administration is deeply entrenched here and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Kongo"
gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the defeated Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has for decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

gerdom.97.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Äquatorialafrika"
gerdom.97.d:0 "Strategically located to the immediate south of the Sahara, the colony of German Equatorial Africa employs some of the most impressive auxiliary troops, most of which have spent years fighting nomadic raiders on the border."

gerdom.98.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Niger-Kamerun"
gerdom.98.d:0 "One of the more recently acquired African provinces, Niger was merged with the German colony of Kamerun in the Mittelafrikan state. Though somewhat disunited, the natives stand ready to earn their independence in the pay of the Reich!"

gerdom.99.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Togoland"
gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika. All the same, they stand ready to assist Germany in its hour of need - for the right price."

gerdom.100.t:0 "Decolonisation of Afrika"
gerdom.100.d:0 "In the darkest hour of the German Empire, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck rallied the colonial askaris behind the Reich by promising them independence once the war had been won. Our enemies have been crushed and Berlin liberated, leading to many of our African subjects humbly asking us to uphold our promises and commence the decolonisation of our domains in Africa."
gerdom.100.a:0 "We shall uphold our promises."
gerdom.100.b:0 "Afrika shall remain German forever more!"

### Security ###

gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state decided to tighten control of the border regions, since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come, when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

gerdom.106.t:0 "Further Internal Security Measures"
gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite the gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French Syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning the minds of our French minority with propaganda, with many using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, right-wing members of our government have demanded the complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation in the international community..."
gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"
gerdom.106.b:0 "It's time to ban all French organisations in Germany!"
gerdom.106.c:0 "This plan was madness from the beginning, abandon it..."

### Rhenish Syndicalist Volunteers ###

gerdom.200.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Requests Visa"
gerdom.200.d:0 "For some time now, Syndicalist sympathisers from the Rhineland have been going abroad to help their 'comrades' in their various conflicts around the world. Today, the famous underground writer Bertolt Brecht has announced his intent to join these 'International Divisions'.\n\nWe could let him go, which would most likely inspire quite a number of other Syndicalists to go abroad after him, or we could confiscate his passport and prohibit him from leaving the country. As Brecht is a prominent figure, blocking him could perhaps weaken the Syndicalist cause, but on the other hand it would likely cause tremendous outrage..."
gerdom.200.aa:0 "Let him go to wild America."
gerdom.200.ab:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
gerdom.200.ac:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
gerdom.200.ad:0 "Let's hope he freezes in Russia."
gerdom.200.ae:0 "He can sweat in Spain."
gerdom.200.af:0 "We should keep him where we can watch him."

gerdom.201.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in America"
gerdom.201.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.201.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.202.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Brazil"
gerdom.202.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.202.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.203.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Russia"
gerdom.203.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.203.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.204.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Spain"
gerdom.204.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.204.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.205.t:0 "Calm in the Rhineland"
gerdom.205.d:0 "With a number of prominent Syndicalists out of the country and allowed to fight, and hopefully die, in foreign lands, tensions in our lands have decreased greatly without their malign influence. The Rhineland is finally seeing some peace and quiet."
gerdom.205.a:0 "Let's hope things stay this way."

gerdom.206.t:0 "Policy on Returning Syndicalists"
gerdom.206.d:0 "Now that their war has been lost, the 'International Divisions' formed from our volunteers are trying to return to their homes. Many still have their arms and all survivors are battle-hardened, indoctrinated Syndicalists. However, if we prohibit them from entering over our borders, we should be able to keep them away without much of a scandal due to the hardening of the German population's views on the Red Menace. Still, we might risk them turning against us when we inevitably come to blows with the Internationale."
gerdom.206.a:0 "They'll have to serve their term in the Heer!"
gerdom.206.b:0 "Let them return to their families."
gerdom.206.c:0 "Close the borders!"

gerdom.207.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Dies in Suspicious Circumstances"
gerdom.207.d:0 "Though rumours have been spreading for weeks, we now have official confirmation; Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has died in some rotten cellar, most likely at the hands of foreign police. After serving abroad as Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was blocked from re-entering Germany.\n\nHis family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged scale demonstrations in Berlin, blaming our hardline policy towards Syndicalist volunteers for his death."
gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems that we have created a martyr."

gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Returns to Germany"
gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and the controversial figure is openly preaching for solidarity by the workers against the capitalist system."
gerdom.208.a:0 "Can't he ever shut up?!"

gerdom.209.t:0 "International Divisions Offer Their Service"
gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied entrance to their own homeland in Germany. After months of drifting, many of the former members have now reassembled and decided to take up arms to liberate Germany from the scourge of imperialism. While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the forces of the Internationale."
gerdom.209.a:0 "Welcome comrades!"
gerdom.209.b:0 "A needless expense."

### Foreign Events ###

gerfor.1.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Denmark"
gerfor.1.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Danish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Denmark?"
gerfor.1.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
gerfor.1.b:0 "We have enough problems to be dealing with."

gerfor.2.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Denmark"
gerfor.2.d:0 "The Second Reich has sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Denmark and declare a ceasefire or Germany will come to Denmark's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the Skagerrak and pose a dangerous threat to Germany on its northern border, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
gerfor.2.a:0 "We will not risk war with Germany over this."
gerfor.2.b:0 "We do not negotiate with imperialists."

gerfor.3.t:0 "German Assistance Against Britain"
gerfor.3.d:0 "We are in a state of war with the Union of Britain. Our military, while proud, will not be able to withstand the Syndicalist onslaught. Some influential figures are petitioning us to ask the Germans for help, even if it might mean having to accept some German influence after the invasion is repelled. What shall we do?"
gerfor.3.a:0 "Thank you Berlin!"
gerfor.3.b:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted."

gerfor.4.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.4.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the British Isles. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today. We have shown the world that we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or the Commune."
gerfor.4.a:0 "Yet again German diplomacy wins the day."

gerfor.5.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Denmark Ultimatum"
gerfor.5.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Danish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Denmark into our alliance or we can stand down and let Denmark fall, creating a northern front with our Syndicalist foe."
gerfor.5.a:0 "They have made their choice, war it is!"
gerfor.5.b:0 "Back down. There will be peace in our time."

gerfor.6.t:0 "Britain Backs Down Over Denmark"
gerfor.6.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Denmark's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
gerfor.6.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without them."

gerfor.7.t:0 "Internationale Seeks to Reunify Italy"
gerfor.7.d:0 "The combined forces of the French Commune and the Socialist Republic of Italy have launched an attempt to seize the entirety of Italy. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in Europe in favour of the Syndicalists. Shall we warn the Internationale that this threatens world peace or let the peninsula fall to their malignant ideology?"

gerfor.8.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Italy"
gerfor.8.d:0 "The German Empire has sent us a telegram, demanding that either we end our intervention in Italy and declare a ceasefire with the Italian states or the Reich will intervene by force."

gerfor.9.t:0 "Germany Sends the Internationale an Ultimatum"
gerfor.9.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France over their support for the Socialist Republic of Italy in its attempts to conquer the entire peninsula. The Germans demand that the Syndicalists fall back or risk utter annihilation."

gerfor.10.t:0 "Commune of France Withdraws from Italy"
gerfor.10.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris, they quickly withdrew their forces from the frontlines and abandoned the peninsula. Our independence will be preserved, and our pride left intact."
gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew the attention of the Reich which issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion. The [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our own forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

gerfor.11.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Italy"
gerfor.11.d:0 "After we sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France to cease their intervention in Italy and backing for the Italian Syndicalists in the war, they wisely decided to comply. Already Red forces are withdrawing and our prestige has been greatly heightened. Yet again we have used diplomacy to help guard the balance, and improve prospects for European peace."

gerfor.12.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Italian Ultimatum"
gerfor.12.d:0 "Our ultimatum was flatly ignored. Already SRI and Communard forces are on the march in Italy and refusing to return to their pre-war boundaries. The other states of the Italian peninsula are threatened existentially and Syndicalism is poised to spread its vile ideology to every corner of the land. The issue now is, do we back up our ultimatum with force and declare war on the Internationale?"

gerfor.13.t:0 "Commune of France Invades Spain"
gerfor.13.d:0 "The armed forces of the Commune of France have launched an invasion of the Spanish state. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the syndicalist alliance. Shall we warn the syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or let Spain fall?"

gerfor.14.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Spain"
gerfor.14.d:0 "Monarchies are as thick as thieves. After we began our campaign against the Spanish kingdom we received a message from Berlin ordering us to cease and desist in our military efforts. They claim that if we do not bring our forces back beyond the Pyrenees they will intervene militarily to preserve the current status quo."

gerfor.16.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Spain"
gerfor.16.d:0 "The Germans have achieved a significant diplomatic coup today, and helped preserve our independence. After the Reich sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France ordering them to cease their military aggression towards us, the French wisely decided to comply and brought their troops back from beyond the Pyrenees. The status quo remains, for now at least, intact."

gerfor.17.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Spanish Ultimatum"
gerfor.17.d:0 "Despite our public condemnation of the Communard invasion of the Spanish Kingdom and subsequent ultimatum, the French have refused to pull their forces back. The possibility of the loss of yet another European monarchy can no longer be discounted, and the choice is now incumbent on us to decide how we should respond to this flagrant dismissal of German hegemony."

gerfor.18.t:0 "Liberation of Flandern-Wallonien"
gerfor.18.d:0 "We have retaken Flandern-Wallonien from our Communard enemies. The collapse of our regime in the kingdom posed a dangerous threat to our fortunes on the western front, and this victory has already greatly improved German morale. The question now is - should we liberate it, divide it, or keep it for ourselves?"
gerfor.18.a:0 "Liberate them! Flandern-Wallonien fights again!"
gerfor.18.b:0 "Divide Flanders-Wallonia."
gerfor.18.c:0 "We will occupy them, for now at least."

#gerfor.19.t:0 "Fate of Southern Wallonia"
#gerfor.19.d:0 "With the situation stabilised on the western front to an extent, the time has come to settle a long unresolved issue. Should we give the provinces of southern Wallonia back to their rightful owner in the name of peace or shall we make clear our plans of fully integrating this province into the German Empire as a new federal state?"
#gerfor.19.a:0 "Return it to its rightful owner."
#gerfor.19.b:0 "Integrate Deutsch-Wallonia."

#gerfor.20.t:0 "German Returns Southern Wallonia"
#gerfor.20.d:0 "With the Reichspakt standing relatively strong on the western front Germany has seen fit to return the southern Wallonian provinces seized to us. Cities such as Bastogne and Malmedy, seized after the Peace With Honour, are finally back in our hands."
#gerfor.20.a:0 "Such kindness!"

#gerfor.22.t:0 "Partition of the Netherlands"
#gerfor.22.d:0 "After much fighting have finally taken control of the Netherlands. Perhaps should we split it with our loyal ally Flandern-Wallonien?"
#gerfor.22.a:0 "Partition it."
#gerfor.22.b:0 "Restore a Dutch state."
#gerfor.22.c:0 "Military occupation is preferable."

#gerfor.23.t:0 "Partition of the Netherlands"
#gerfor.23.d:0 "The Germans have chosen to hand over to us our rightful part of the Netherlands. We cannot exactly say we were expecting such benevolence from the Reich, but it is mostly certainly welcome."
#gerfor.23.a:0 "Neat."

gerfor.24.t:0 "Enemy at the Gates"
gerfor.24.d:0 "The Russians have reached the Oder. There has been little outright panicking in Berlin but it is clear that without a counter-attack Germany is greatly endangered. The last supply reserves have been distributed to volunteers and everyone is participating in this last effort to defend the Vatherland."
gerfor.24.a:0 "Not one step back!"

gerfor.25.t:0 "Die Wacht am Rhein"
gerfor.25.d:0 "The French have reached the Rhine. Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."
gerfor.25.a:0 "They must be stopped!"

gerfor.26.t:0 "Fate of Spanish Morocco"
gerfor.26.d:0 "With Syndicalist forces taking control of Spain our colonial possessions in North Africa might be endangered. As a preventive measure our general staff has suggested that we occupy Spanish Morocco before the CNT-FAI stabilise their rule and spread their foul influence into our colonies."
gerfor.26.a:0 "Occupy Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.26.b:0 "Dirt piles are beneath our concern right now."

gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
gerfor.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
gerfor.27.b:0 "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

gerfor.28.t:0 "Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"
gerfor.28.a:0 "Create a new joint-stock company."
gerfor.28.b:0 "Leave the industry alone."

gerfor.29.t:0 "Expanded Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has began to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."
gerfor.29.a:0 "Create the new processing complex."
gerfor.29.b:0 "In this economy?"

gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"
gerfor.31.d:0 "With no end in sight to the rising unemployment on Madagascar, many Malagasy locals, and especially the former loggers, have risen against us. What started as merely a local insurrection quickly spiralled into outright rebellion with an independence war brewing."
gerfor.31.a:0 "We really don't need this right now..."

gerfor.32.t:0 "A Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.32.d:0 "With the fall of France our armed forces have unsuccessfully tried to gain control over the British Isles and decisively end the war in our favour. Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."
gerfor.32.a:0 "It is time for an armistice."
gerfor.32.b:0 "This will only end with German boots marching through London."

gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"
gerfor.33.a:0 "Survival is all we can hope for. Sign."
gerfor.33.b:0 "Another humiliation? Never again!"

gerfor.34.t:0 "Second Peace with Honour Signed"
gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty in sight of a full German military parade. With this the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government said that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."
gerfor.35.a:0 "They will pay for this insolence."

gerfor.36.t:0 "Ethnic Conflict on Sri Lanka"
gerfor.36.d:0 "Ceylon Island is settled by Sinhalese and Tamils, who have battled for supremacy on the island for ages. With Black Monday wreaking havoc on our economy and colonial administration, disobedience from the native population is becoming intolerable. Our presence on Ceylon, crucial for its supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly precarious."
gerfor.36.a:0 "Damn those nationalists!"

gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from German's desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"
gerfor.39.d:0 "Germany has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain, either fall back to their home islands or risk annihilation."

gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores our Norwegian Ultimatum"
gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel, and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."
gerfor.43.a:0 "Offer Ireland aid if they join the Reichspakt."

gerfor.44.t:0 "German Offers Support"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us with an offer: if Ireland signs a treaty of association with the Reichspakt Germany will invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be immense there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid."
gerfor.44.a:0 "Where do I sign?"
gerfor.44.b:0 "We are doing fine on our own."

gerfor.45.t:0 "Ireland Signs the Treaty"
gerfor.45.d:0 "The Irish have agreed to our offer. According to the treaty we are to supply industrial machines and the licences required to construct additional ones in Ireland itself. Additionally, we are obliged to construct and deliver guns, artillery pieces, and a number of aircraft and armour pieces to bolster their armed forces."
gerfor.45.a:0 "Begin the construction then!"

gerfor.46.t:0 "Ireland Refuses the Treaty"
gerfor.46.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Irish have decided to turn our offer down. Still, our obligations towards Ireland remain the same as they were before."
gerfor.46.a:0 "Oh well."

gerfor.47.t:0 "Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.47.d:0 "We have finally finished preparations of all of the material ordered by the Irish as part of our treaty obligations. The goods are now ready to be delivered and we will give the convoy a military escort all the way to the Ireland."
gerfor.47.a:0 "Get it to Dublin, posthaste."

gerfor.48.t:0 "German Aid Arrives"
gerfor.48.d:0 "The guns, armour, aircraft and industrial machinery that Germany promised us as part of their treaty obligations have finally arrived. We have received a squadron each of fighters and bombers, a number of tanks as well as many artillery pieces and new German machine guns. This could be the first step in a fruitful relationship."
gerfor.48.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.49.t:0 "Our Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.49.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Ireland no longer able or willing to receive our aid the whole programme had to be aborted. Luckily, the equipment and craft already produced remain in our hands and is ready to be used."
gerfor.49.a:0 "Better than nothing."

gerfor.50.t:0 "Appeal to Old Friends?"
gerfor.50.d:0 "With the war turning against us it is becoming clear that we need allies. Perhaps it would be wise to turn to our old allies for support? The unity of the Central Powers quickly fell apart at the end of the Weltkrieg but they remain states generally sympathetic to the protection of monarchism. Surely they would not leave us to stand alone in the face of the Syndicalist threat?"
gerfor.50.a:0 "We need all the help we can get!"
gerfor.50.b:0 "Only contact Austria, the others are a liability."
gerfor.50.c:0 "Germany and the Reichspakt are strong enough without them!"

gerfor.51.t:0 "Germany Requests Austrian Support"
gerfor.51.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.51.a:0 "The Kaisers will fight together again!"
gerfor.51.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."

Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, with the end of the Weltkrieg the Germans refused to assist us in our recovery despite fighting with them virtually unnecessarily, and instead the Reich continued to exploit our serious foreign debt problems. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.52.a:0 "The Sultan shall aid the Reich!"
gerfor.52.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."

gerfor.53.t:0 "Germany Requests Bulgarian Support"
gerfor.53.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, despite our contributions to the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg being recognised to an extent, Germany seized control of Romania's coveted oil supplies for itself and has neglected us ever since. The question now is whether we should assist the Reich?"
gerfor.53.a:0 "We owe them. It is time to repay the debt!"
gerfor.53.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.53.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.54.t:0 "Austria Heeds the Call!"

gerfor.56.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.57.t:0 "Austria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.57.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea but pointedly refused to help us in our time of need. We stand alone in our struggle against Syndicalism."
gerfor.57.a:0 "Shameful."

gerfor.58.t:0 "The Ottomans Refused to Help"
gerfor.58.d:0 "Despite all of our exhortations the Sultan refused to support us at all in our fight against the Internationale."
gerfor.58.a:0 "Damn him!"

gerfor.59.t:0 "Bulgaria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.59.d:0 "The Bulgarians ignored our call for support and instead decided to stay out of the crusade against the Syndicalists. It is not like a Balkan country to avoid a fight."
gerfor.59.a:0 "Traitorous curs."

gerfor.60.t:0 "Austria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.60.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help but decided not to join our alliance or begin military operations against the Internationale. Instead they will send supplies and volunteers to help in our struggle against Syndicalism!"
gerfor.60.a:0 "It's better than nothing!"

gerfor.61.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Promises Some Support"
gerfor.61.d:0 "Though the Sultan was sympathetic to our cause, he made it clear that he did not wish to drag his realm into a needless war with the Internationale. Instead he promised to give us material support and to send volunteers."
gerfor.61.a:0 "The irony is palpable."

gerfor.62.t:0 "Bulgaria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.62.d:0 "The Bulgarian government did not wish to offer us overt military support, believing that though Syndicalism is a terrible plague, war with the Communards would be pointless. They promised to at least give us some equipment and volunteers."
gerfor.62.a:0 "Thank you Bulgaria."

gerfor.63.t:0 "Germany Requests Trondheim Leasehold"

The Norwegian inhabitants would be allowed to stay, as would our civilian administration, and the boost to commerce in the region would be immense. However, the Syndicalists might decide to retaliate against us if we agree to the offer...\n\nWhat shall we do?"
gerfor.63.a:0 "Money is good!"
gerfor.63.b:0 "We can't anger the British!"

gerfor.64.t:0 "Norway Agrees Trondheim Lease"

gerfor.65.t:0 "Norway does not agree to lease Trondheim"

gerfor.66.t:0 "Deal with the Devil?"
gerfor.66.d:0 "We have been defeated by the Syndicalist bastards but the Entente still fights on. While it was the inability of their governments to hold on to their lands that led to this whole mess in the first place, many say that we should put aside our differences and join with the Entente to reclaim our homeland."
gerfor.66.a:0 "Talk to the Entente."
gerfor.66.b:0 "We do not need them!"

gerfor.67.t:0 "Germany Seeks to Join the Entente"
gerfor.67.d:0 "The Germans have been defeated by the Syndicalist usurpers. While it was their fault that the Syndicalists have taken control of Europe they are now in the same position as we were just a few years ago. Surprisingly, the Germans have sent a delegate to the Canadian government asking for an alliance. What will our terms be?"

gerfor.131.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Give Concessions"

It seems we can't make them budge on this point, so acceptance may be our only option. The alternative could be catastrophic."
gerfor.131.a:0 "Fine then."

gerfor.132.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refuses Again"

gerfor.133.a:0 "Give them their damn treaty."
gerfor.133.b:0 "This is ridiculous!"

gerfor.134.t:0 "Germany Demands Direct Control of Our Oil Fields"
gerfor.134.d:0 "The German diplomats have claimed in the conference that the Azeri government and industrial sector is not equipped to properly exploit the oil deposits in the country. They have recommended allowing them to have complete oversight of our industries by placing German directors into key positions in state-owned oil companies, meaning that together we can access even more oil. While we could all get rich off the deal, the problem is that this could possibly threaten our position as an independent nation."
gerfor.134.a:0 "Well alright then..."
gerfor.134.b:0 "Economic influence is enough, we shall have no directors."
gerfor.134.c:0 "Refuse outright."

gerfor.135.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts!"
gerfor.135.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted our recent deal, giving us direct control over their oil fields and industry. This essentially makes them another one of our subjects, securing oil for a very long time."

gerfor.136.t:0 "Azerbaijan Varies the Treaty"
gerfor.136.d:0 "Azerbaijan has vetoed the idea of us having our directors manage their oil companies, and they only wish to have economic guidance. Our influence over the country and its oil supplies would still be immense, though substantially less than with our German oversight of the oil industry itself."
gerfor.136.a:0 "We'll accept the change."
gerfor.136.b:0 "It's this or nothing!"

gerfor.137.t:0 "Germany Accepts the Modified Treaty"
gerfor.137.d:0 "Germany has accepted our version of the treaty, which help us get more out of our oil fields and whilst also gaining us a guarantee from the Reich. In exchange all we need do is ensure that the oil supply remains unmolested and that the shipments reach Germany."
gerfor.137.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.138.t:0 "Germany Reaffirms the Original Proposal"
gerfor.138.d:0 "The Reich's diplomats have seemingly not budged on their position on having German directors control our oil fields, and this is simply unacceptable for us as it essentially makes us a puppet of Germany. Unfortunately the threat of war is present if we refuse. How do we respond?"

gerfor.165.d:0 "Do to our direct control over their oil fields and industry, Azerbaijan has become riddled with German influence, essentially making them into another one of our vassals."
gerfor.165.a:0 "The black gold will flow forever."

gerfor.166.t:0 "Under German Influence"
gerfor.166.d:0 "Because of our allowance to let the Germans establish direct control over our industry, we should have expected foreign influence to creep in. The government and industry are now riddled with Germans and Azerbaijan is now under de facto German control. Despite the ruling party retaining power, we are now within the German sphere of influence, whether we like it or not."

gerfor.167.t:0 "Brentano's Speech"
gerfor.167.d:0 "Yesterday in the early afternoon Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano gave an impassioned speech on how the "differences of the past" must be laid aside in order to create a stronger European economic bloc, that included "even nations with which we have our differences". While not mentioned explicitly by name, it was obvious to most that he spoke of reconciling with our smaller neighbour Poland.\n\nOur relationship with Poland has been icy since the end of the Weltkrieg, and Polish nationalism has been a keen thorn in the Kaiser's side over the past two decades. Perhaps it is time to set aside our old animosity for the sake of the future?"
gerfor.167.a:0 "Only time will tell."

gerfor.168.t:0 "Brentano's Speech"
gerfor.168.d:0 "In Germany yesterday, Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano gave an impassioned speech on how the "differences of the past" must be laid aside in order to create a stronger European economic bloc, that included "even nations with which we have our differences". While not mentioned explicitly by name, it was obvious to most that he spoke of reconciliation between our own nation and the German Empire.\n\nOur own relationship with Germany has been icy since the end of the Weltkrieg, with broken German promises and political interference causing many to see Germany as a conqueror rather than savior. Is this a true sign of more modest German intentions, or another thinly veiled plot?"
gerfor.168.a:0 "Only time will tell."

gerfor.169.t:0 "Germany Demands the Border Strip"
gerfor.169.d:0 "We have recieved an official request from Germany for the transfer of control to the German Empire of many small regions near the German border. The request listed these regions as "properly German" and that they must be returned immediately to German administration or dire consequences will follow. Such an unprovoked act of imperialistic aggression is astounding. How should we respond to this unprovoked attack on our sovereignty?"
gerfor.169.a:0 "Never!"
gerfor.169.b:0 "We cannot afford a conflict."

gerfor.170.t:0 "Poland Remains Defiant"
gerfor.170.d:0 "Despite our legitimate claim to the region, the Polish government has completely failed to comply with our demands to hand over administration of the border strip region, even going so far as to include a message that hurled a slew of insults at none other than the Kaiser himself. This outrage will no doubt have dire consequences for the Polish government in the near future."
gerfor.170.a:0 "It will be ours in time."

gerfor.171.t:0 "Poland Transfers the Strip"
gerfor.171.d:0 "In response to our official request to administer the region known unofficially as the "Border Strip", Poland has given in and handed over all of the requested territory without complaint. The Polish government has obviously seen that the region is ours by right, and has decided it is easier to acknowledge the truth than to fight over the land."
gerfor.171.a:0 "A wise choice."

gerfor.172.t:0 "Partisans in the Border Strip"
gerfor.172.d:0 "Our recent efforts to encourage German migration to the Polish border strip has been met with strong resistance by the local Polish population. Key industrial centres have been sabotaged, and many German citizens are beginning to see the region as unsafe. How should we respond?"
gerfor.172.a:0 "Appease the locals."
gerfor.172.b:0 "Send in the army!"

gerfor.173.t:0 "Continued Resistance in the Border Strip"
gerfor.173.d:0 "Despite our efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region, Polish partisans continue to harass both German citizens and regular army units. The damage they are causing to local productivity is not insignificant, and our efforts to encourage migration are flagging in the face of constant attacks. How should we respond to this renewed threat?"
gerfor.173.a:0 "Continue to appease the locals."
gerfor.173.b:0 "A stronger crackdown is needed."

gerfor.174.d:0 "Building upon their previous showings of goodwill and the signing of a pact of non-aggression between our two countries, Germany today has offered us an official invitation into the Reichspakt, Germany's economic and military alliance. Joining would bring great benefits to our nation, but put us under strong German influence. How should we respond to the invitation?"

gerfor.176.t:0 "Poland Declines our Invitation"
gerfor.176.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to woo Poland diplomatically, they have refused our official offer to join the Reichspakt. All signs were pointing to them accepting, what has gone wrong?"

gerfor.177.d:0 "Building upon their previous showings of goodwill and the signing of a pact of non-aggression between our two countries, Germany today has offered an official invitation to the Reichspakt, Germany's economic and military alliance. We were once a part of this alliance ourselves, but chose to leave it, as we saw little benefit in staying under Germany's thumb. How should we respond to the invitation?"

gerfor.179.t:0 "Poland-Lithuania Declines our Invitation"
gerfor.179.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to woo the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into rejoining the Reichspakt, they have refused all of our offers. It seems that the stubborn fools are intent on leaving the alliance for good."

gerfor.180.t:0 "The German Diplomatic Mission"
gerfor.180.d:0 "Today marked a historic day for Germany, as our diplomatic envoys arrived back in Berlin after days in the Polish capital. Our diplomatic mission was a great success, and relations with the Polish government are at an all-time high. The diplomatic envoys we sent met with top Polish officials, had extravagant dinners, and most importantly, signed a pact of non-aggression between our two great nations. This pact marks the beginning of new, warmer relations between us, and it seems that it is only a matter of time before we sign an official alliance with Poland, cementing our futures together."
gerfor.180.a:0 "A historic day."

gerfor.181.d:0 "German diplomatic envoys arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today with the intention of improving relations between our countries. They have met with top [Root.GetAdjective] officials, had extravagant dinners, and floated the offer of signing a pact of non-aggression. [GER.GetNameDefCap], they say, would look to guarantee our independence in return, if they could be assured a peaceful border on their eastern flank. If we agree, it would certainly signal a new era of cooperation between our countries, and possibly even lead to a future alliance."

Despite their expansionist agenda as of late, most policy experts within Germany agreed that Ivan would never again challenge our might--Today, we were proven horrendously wrong by a formal declaration of war from the East.

gerdom.101.t:0 "The Great Crusade"
gerdom.101.d:0 "Right-wing circles have been calling for a crusade against the Commune of France ever since the Syndicalists managed to oust the legal government from mainland France. Now their wishes have finally come true, as a state of war now exists between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of vipers to our west. Kaiser Wilhelm II explained the reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France in a special radio address, and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun". Subsequently thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of the Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on the streets publicly displaying their support for the war. Despite enduring catastrophic crises, the German nation is united once again. Long live Germany! Long live the Kaiser!"
gerdom.101.a:0 "Gott erhalte den Kaiser! Der Sieg wird unser sein!"

gerdom.102.t:0 "Von Hammerstein-Equord Affair"
gerdom.102.d:0 "A month before the elections, yet another scandal was revealed by the media, in this instance Die Gartenlaube, one of the newspapers owned by the DVLP chairman Alfred Hugenberg. The paper reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, a leading general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with Syndicalist-aligned intelligence agencies. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the War Secretary was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While General von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughters' doings, the real question for von Schleicher is - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - replace him with whom?"
gerdom.102.a:0 "Irren ist menschlich!"
gerdom.102.b:0 "Does somebody have Nicolai's number?"

gerfla.1.t:0 "Sedantag"
gerfla.1.d:0 "After the Franco-German war of 1870-1871, the Sedantag was established to celebrate our victory at Sedan, where we captured the last French Emperor Napoleon III and the cream of their army. Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed into a celebration of the Reich's foundation, and after the Weltkrieg the humbling of its foes.\n\nIn every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobles, soldiers and innumerable veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the forging of the Reich."
gerfla.1.a:0 "Heil dem Kaiserreich!"

gerfla.2.t:0 "Luise Hoffmann's Pacific Flight"
gerfla.2.d:0 "Luise Hoffmann was the first German woman to gain a pilot's licence. After her 1933 transatlantic solo flight she has become one of Germany's most famous aviation pioneers, along with heroes like Manfred von Richthofen and Gunther Pluschow. Today, Fraulein Hoffmann has accomplished a new long distance record in her customised Fokker F-IX. Starting in Tahiti 36 hours ago, Fraulein Hoffmann today landed safely in Lae on German Neuguinea, where she was welcomed by a jubilant crowd and local governor Albert Hahl.\n\nIt has been rumoured that Hoffmann will soon attempt a solo flight around the world. This would place her in direct competition with the Red Baron who is planning a similar endeavour..."
gerfla.2.a:0 "What an accomplishment!"

gerfla.3.t:0 "Hoffmann vs von Richthofen"
gerfla.3.d:0 "An exciting day for the history of aviation. Manfred von Richthofen has accepted Luise Hoffmann's challenge. Today both pilots, flying customised Fokker XIs, started in Daressalam in Mittelafrika for the first solo flight and air race around the world. His Imperial Majesty has wished best luck and Godspeed to both pilots."
gerfla.3.a:0 "How exciting!"

gerfla.4.t:0 "Hoffmann Wins"
gerfla.4.d:0 "Luise Hoffmann has just landed in Daressalam! She is now officially the first person to fly alone around the world! Manfred von Richthofen has already congratulated his opponent over the radio.

gerfla.5.d:0 "Manfred von Richthofen has just landed in Daressalam! He is now officially the first man to fly alone around the world! Luise Hoffmann has already congratulated her opponent over the radio. Again, the German flying legend has proven to be the world's best pilot."
gerfla.5.a:0 "Congratulations to a German hero!"

gerfla.6.t:0 "Erich von Ludendorff Dies"
gerfla.6.d:0 "Even after his death was reported early this morning, Erich von Ludendorff remains one of the most controversial people in recent German history. On the one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in the 1919 fall of France. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still received some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."
gerfla.6.a:0 "Let's remember the genius, not the dictator."

gerfla.7.t:0 "Georg Michaelis Dies"
gerfla.7.d:0 "The former Reichskanzler Georg Michaelis died today at the age of 78. Succeeding von Bethmann-Hollweg as Imperial Chancellor in 1917, the first and until now the only commoner to have acceded to the post of German chancellor, he was considered by many as the stooge of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff dictatorship, being forced to resign and replaced by Hindenburg after Ludendorff grew dissatisfied with him in 1919. As a former Reichskanzler, he received a state funeral, but the Kaiser pointedly refused to attend."
gerfla.7.a:0 "He was a commoner and a stooge, but a Chancellor above all."

gerfla.8.t:0 "Tenth Anniversary of von Tirpitz' death"
gerfla.8.d:0 "Today marks the tenth anniversary of the death of the Great Chancellor and Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. As the eight Chancellor and Commander of the German Navy Tirpitz led the Kaiserreich out of the Ludendorff dictatorship, initiating the Golden Age that lasted through the Twenties until his death.\n\nAfter his death, his Deutsche Vaterlandspartei (German Fatherland party, DVLP), reformed into the Junker party it is today under their new leader, Alfred Hugenberg, opening the way for von Papen's Deutschkonservative Partei, or DKP. While the Reich enjoyed prosperity under Tirpitz's reign, he also continued to hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises made in 1917, leaving us with political tensions brewing in recent years.\n\nStill, his prestige is enormous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all over the Empire."
gerfla.8.a:0 "And what a giant he was!"

gerfla.9.t:0 "Unser Kampf"
gerfla.9.d:0 "The Propylaen publishing house has today announced its intention to release a new series of books devoted to individual German soldiers' stories, accounts and poetry from the conflicts of the Weltkrieg, titled 'Unser Kampf'. Notable examples include the diary of sergeant Adolf Hitler, a signalman who amongst other distinctions was awarded no less than two Iron Crosses for his valour on both the Western and Eastern fronts.\n\nThe diaries provide a unique and fiery insight into the nature of a bitter ideological struggle. What better way to re-affirm the values and continuing glory of the Reich in these troubled times?"
gerfla.9.a:0 "A good read!"

gerfla.10.t:0 "Unser Kampf: The Movie"
gerfla.10.d:0 "Following the widespread popularity of the bestselling series produced by Propylaen, film director wunderkind Leni Riefenstahl resolved to turn the material into a movie based on the accounts given. 'Unser Kampf' boasts the highest production values hitherto seen - made possible by state investments into the Babelsberg studios - and offers a frighteningly real depiction of the war. Starring Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers and Theodor Loos, the story focuses on the heroism and dedication of the 'small people' in the Weltkrieg, such as the valiant corporal Adolf Hitler, who sacrificed everything for his Kaiser and the Reich."
gerfla.10.a:0 "A stellar movie!"

gerfla.11.t:0 "A Return to Europe"
gerfla.11.d:0 "Our soldiers line the streets of [GetGERCapital], cheering wildly as the leaders of Germany step off their newly-arrived ships onto European soil once more. We are exiles no longer."

### the Reichspakt Events ###

germit.1.t:0 "Germany Proposes A Single Currency"
germit.1.d:0 "In light of the consequences of Black Monday, the German government has come up with a somewhat strange proposal. In order to meaningfully increase and simplify commerce and trade across the Reichspakt, they propose that the German currency, the Mark, should become the accepted currency in all Mitteleuropa, renamed formally to the 'Europamark'.\n\nIn many of Germany's 'subject partner' states, the currencies are tied to the Mark already, so the actual impact would be relatively minimal. How should we respond to this proposal?"
germit.1.a:0 "Count us in!"
germit.1.b:0 "'Subject partner', eh?"
germit.1.c:0 "Oh blimey, surely not!"

germit.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refused the Europamark"
germit.2.d:0 "[From.GetName] has agreed to our proposal of a common currency for Mitteleuropa and will use the so-called Europamark from now on."
germit.2.a:0 "Wonderful!"

germit.3.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refused the Europamark"
germit.3.d:0 "[From.GetName] has refused our proposal for a single common currency for all Mitteleuropa and has publicly stated that they will continue to use their own currency, albeit still connected to the Reichsmark."
germit.3.a:0 "Scheiße!"

germit.4.t:0 "Europamark Abolished"
germit.4.d:0 "In light of recent developments, the Mark is no longer our official currency. Though will inevitably cause some economic upheaval, it will ultimately be for the best. After all, we did once have our own currency!"
germit.4.a:0 "Re-open the mints!"

germit.5.t:0 "Transfer to the Europamark"
germit.5.d:0 "As a a new member of Mitteleuropa it is incumbent on us to align our economy to that of the trading bloc, and that means joining the single currency. By transitioning our country to the Reichsmark we will be able to take advantage of the Reichspakt's many administrative advantages, but the loss of national sovereignty is somewhat difficult to mask..."
germit.5.a:0 "Just part of the deal I suppose."
germit.5.b:0 "We don't exactly have a choice."
germit.5.c:0 "Why would we give up our currency?"

germit.6.t:0 "Europarat Membership"
germit.6.d:0 "As a member of the single Europamark currency as dictated by our Mitteleuropa membership, it is incumbent on us now to align ourselves with the majority of the bloc by joining Europarat. This organisation, the 'Council of Europe' exists to regulate trade and is a key part of further integration."
germit.6.a:0 "A sound proposal."

germit.7.t:0 "Europakommission Membership"
germit.7.d:0 "Though Mitteleuropa nations share a common currency in the form of the Europamark, to be a proper part of the bloc now, a nation must put itself under the jurisdiction of the Europakommission. This body regulates industrial rules across the continent, though clearly is biased in favour of the German Reich."
germit.7.a:0 "We have to sign up."

germit.8.t:0 "Europabrigaden Proposal"
germit.8.d:0 "There has been a new proposal concerning Mitteleuropa emanating from the Berlin thinktanks. Germany is now calling for the creation of Europabrigaden, which will formalise Mitteleuropa recruitment and place them the conscripted citizens under the aegis of the Reich for the duration of the military emergency. Such a measure would greatly empower Germany."
germit.8.a:0 "Well if it's essential."
germit.8.b:0 "Do we have a choice?"
germit.8.c:0 "This is pure madness."

germit.9.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepted the Europabrigaden Programme"
germit.9.d:0 "Our new Europabrigaden programme is an ingenious idea to encourage our Mitteleuropa 'partners' to give up valuable military-aged men as part of international divisions and then place them directly into our own army, starved as we are to some extent of soldiers. [From.GetName] wisely decided to accept our pressure and signed up to the programme. Recruitment should be made far easier."
germit.9.a:0 "Brilliant!"

germit.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rejected the Europabrigaden Programme"
germit.10.d:0 "Our new Europabrigaden programme is an ingenious idea to encourage our Mitteleuropa 'partners' to give up valuable military-aged men as part of international divisions and then place them directly into our own army, starved as we are to some extent of soldiers. [From.GetName] unfortunately refused to bow to our pressure and decided not to become a part of the new programme, damaging our efforts to integrate Mitteleuropa."
germit.10.a:0 "Irritating."

germit.11.t:0 "Europabrigaden"
germit.11.d:0 "As a new member of Mitteleuropa it is considered essential that we sign up to Europabrigaden. This means that we will have to give up a certain percentage of our military age population for international divisions which will be placed under the aegis of Germany."
germit.11.a:0 "Just part of our dues I suppose."
germit.11.b:0 "Alright then..."
germit.11.c:0 "Who cooked this stuff up?"

germit.12.t:0 "Leaving Mitteleuropa"
germit.12.d:0 "As a result of our membership of Mitteleuropa we became incredibly integrated into the bloc, taking on a number of obligations while also receiving some benefits such as in trade and mutual defence. Unfortunately the time has now come to try to disentangle these tendrils from our state, something that is easier said than done."

gerdom.269.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our colonial empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well. To help with our deficit, it has been proposed that we essentially sell the island to either the Ottomans or the Greeks. What shall we do?"
gerdom.269.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence."

gerdom.276.t:0 "The Cretan State"
gerdom.276.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As the Cretan State was originally created because of our weak grasp on the island, the majority of the ministers are pushing to just merely shuffle the administration around in Crete. However a few hawkish men are calling for direct annexation. What shall we do?"
gerdom.276.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."

gerdom.277.t:0 "The Cretan State"
gerdom.277.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few outspoken figures are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete, due in part to lingering prejudice against Cretans. What shall we do?"
gerdom.277.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."

The island has had a turbulent history, and many foreign groups are interested in it, we may be able to defend the island better under local leadership, then again, another 'unsinkable aircraft carrier' wouldn't go amiss."
