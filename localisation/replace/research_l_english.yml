 infantry_weapons2_desc: "Personal and crew served weapons for infantry as well as the various other bits of kit a soldier needs. Improved weapon models and more specialised equipment."
 improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Personal and crew served weapons for infantry as well as the various other bits of kit a soldier needs. Improved weapon models and more specialised equipment."
 advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Personal and crew served weapons for infantry as well as the various other bits of kit a soldier needs. Further Modernised to include personal Assault Rifles and anti-tank rockets. Improved availability of weapons previously distributed to a limited extent."
 infantry_at_desc: "Arming our infantry units with anti-tank rifles will allow them to take out lighter armoured vehicles while maintaining mobility."
 infantry_at2_desc: "For infantry to effectively engage heavier armoured units, high-explosive anti-tank weapons need to be made smaller and lighter."
 paratroopers3_desc: "Learning to adapt para-drop operations according to weather, standardising equipment such as jump boots and extended specialised training will minimise the confusion and risks involved in these dangerous missions."
 marines_desc: "Troops specialising in amphibious warfare are growing ever more indispensable. Improvised methods and equipment become things of the past as our naval infantry is supported by specialised landing craft and training."
 marines2_desc: "Amphibious warfare requires constant innovation. Improved logistical support and portable harbours can enable our marines to perform landings that may otherwise have been impossible."
 marines3_desc: "Marines can be more than just amphibious infantry. In the future, our marine corps will be among the most disciplined and organised special forces."
 tech_mountaineers_desc: "Combat in mountain ranges exposes troops to many perils, but sometimes cannot be avoided. We can minimise these risks by providing our soldiers with specialised training for this environment."
 tech_mountaineers2_desc: "Going beyond survival, our forces can be trained to use mountains to their advantage. With light equipment and mule transports, they can manoeuvre this terrain better than other infantry."
 rangers_tech_desc: "By specialising in woodland combat, training our light infantry in adapting to terrain and vegetation, we can use less troops to hold some front areas, or even push trough enemy lines where they least expect us to do so."
 tech_recon4_desc: "Deep reconnaissance operations, mixing espionage, guerrilla operations and commando training, will aid our tactical choices and allow us to adapt our decision-making rapidly."
 tech_logistics_company_desc: "Having specialised Logistics Officers among our ranks will ensure that support networks are leveraged to minimise waste."
 tech_logistics_company3_desc: "Continued statistical evaluation of troop supply needs contribute to maximising the utility of our resources."
 tech_logistics_company4_desc: "Developing standardised classifications for supplies will minimise confusion and make planning more efficient."
 tech_military_police2_desc: "By engaging in regular police duties in occupied territories, such as traffic control and maintaining public order, our military police can minimise the chaos and confusion which partisan movements thrive in."
 tech_signal_company_desc: "Establishing and maintaining communications in the field has always required special skills. With the advent of new communications and detection technology in the Weltkrieg, new possibilities for the practice lie ahead."
 tech_signal_company3_desc: "Increasingly portable communications technology is more viable to be personally carried as a backpack. This increased mobility of signal corps must be utilised."
 tech_maintenance_company2_desc: "Routine operational maintenance procedures minimise the risks of equipment breaking down and alerts troops to replace it before it does."
 tech_maintenance_company4_desc: "Experiences with designing for active redundancy in the Weltkrieg can be renewed to work with more modern equipment to make maintenance easier."
 motorised_infantry: "Motorised Infantry"
 streamlined_line_desc: "The standardisation and rigid structure of the assembly line are keys to its efficiency and safety. These should be the key aspects to develop in our industrial production."
 concentrated_industry5_desc: "Major industrial complexes now combine many parts of our industry, minimising the costs of transports and labour."
 dispersed_industry2_desc: "Further decentralising our manufacturing makes it harder to strike at specific parts of it."
 construction2_desc: "Modernising our tools and equipment will further aid our construction efforts."
 construction4_desc: "A higher degree of mechanisation and better routines further improves building construction speeds."
 construction5_desc: "The future of efficient construction will require more extensive planning for individual projects as well as standardised solutions wherever possible."
 improved_cavity_magnatron_desc: "The use of radar has already proven crucial, but our decimetric radar sets are too few to ensure good coverage. Fitting more units with radar will allow us to maximise our technological edge."
 improved_encryption_desc: "Limitation in the randomisation of cipher machines can be exploited to break the ciphers. By improving the randomness of the rotor mechanics, we can make this kind of cryptanalysis more difficult."
 basic_decryption_desc: "Cryptanalysis is increasingly becoming an advanced mathematical science. Systems like card catalogues and devices like cyclometers can aid the necessary work."
 improved_decryption_desc: "The development of more sophisticated computers allows for new applications of cryptanalysis methods like differencing, which can be used to break advanced ciphers when combined with new hand code-breaking methods."
 rocket_interceptor_2_desc: "Still considered extremely dangerous to operate, the rocket-powered fighters are now aided by auto-pilots and towing by other aircraft to maximise the use of their extreme speed but short fuel window."
 artillery1_desc: "With more modern materials and mechanisms, howitzers and field guns from the Weltkrieg can be re-chambered and modernised for modern warfare."
 mountain_gun_desc: "The mountainous terrain of Northern India led to the development of an artillery piece that could be dismantled and carried on mule back to wherever it was needed."
 rocket_artillery2_desc: "Self-propelled artillery utilising multiple rockets will be able to cause large-scale destruction rapidly, while maintaining mobility to avoid counter-fire."
 rocket_artillery4_desc: "Spin-stabilised rockets can increase the range of lighter artillery batteries."
 antiair4_desc: "Combining modern systems of radar, computerisation and autoloaders will be necessary to react quickly against faster aircraft."
 antitank1_desc: "The importance of effective anti-tank weapons was established in the Weltkrieg. Introducing a new generation of these weapons will be necessary to combat modern tank designs."
 antitank2_desc: "Most anti-tank guns are so far fairly light. Larger calibre guns will be required to combat heavier tanks with sloped armour."
 antitank4_desc: "New versatile anti-tank guns employing armour-piercing discarding sabot shots can penetrate the armour of nearly any tank."
 antitank5_desc: "By combining different kinds of new ammunition technology with guns with higher muzzle velocities, we can be prepared for whatever new armour our enemies may develop."
 air_defence: "Air Defence"
 bomber_ace_initiative_desc: "Formally recognising and rewarding Ace bomber pilots encourages daring and initiative."
 cas_ace_initiative_desc: "Formally recognising and rewarding Ace CAS pilots encourages daring and initiative."
