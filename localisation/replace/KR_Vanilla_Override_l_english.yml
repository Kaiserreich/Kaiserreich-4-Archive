 elastic_defence: "Elastic Defence"
 elastic_defence_desc: "Rather than focusing all strength on the front line, an elastic defence creates a 'deeper' layer of defences which allows the defender more time to react and counter-attack, while the attacker is spread out and bogged down."
 mobile_infantry_desc: "Regular Infantry is often too slow to keep up with, react to, or escape from rapidly moving armoured forces. The answer is to focus on motorised or mechanised infantry that can keep up with the pace of modern warfare.\n\n"

 tank_heavy_cannon_2_desc: "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armour penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldly to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 tank_heavy_cannon_3_desc: "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armour penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldly to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 flamethrower_desc: "A device to project a stream of burning liquid. While very useful in urban combat and against fortifications, it offers no anti-armour capability and has to be used by a specially-trained crew in a separate unit to be effective."

 armor_tech_1: "Basic Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc: "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armour. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2: "Improved Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_3: "Advanced Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_4: "Modern Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc: "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armour. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 armor_skirts: "Armour Skirts"
 engine_tech_2_desc: "With bigger guns and heavier armour, the new generation of tanks requires a more powerful engine to remain mobile."
 engine_tech_3_desc: "Mechanised warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armour to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."

 light_tank_chassis_desc: "A small and compact chassis, ideal for a cheap and light vehicle for duties such as reconnaissance and fire support. Its limited load capacity makes it unsuited for carrying heavy armour or large guns."
 amphibious_tank_chassis_desc: "A small tank hull specifically designed to float. To achieve this, strict limits have to be set on the size of the weapon and the thickness of the armour the vehicle carries."
 heavy_tank_chassis_desc: "A large chassis that can mount a heavy gun, thick armour, or both."
 super_heavy_tank_chassis_desc: "A gigantic vehicle, capable of mounting the heaviest armour and the biggest gun, but consequently fairly slow and unreliable."
 modern_tank_chassis_desc: "A modernised chassis that borrows heavily from previous medium tanks, but puts a much bigger emphasis on speed and manoeuvrability, while also allowing for more armour and bigger guns than usually carried on medium tanks. The result is a vehicle that can fill a wide variety of roles."

 tank_light_two_man_tank_turret_desc: "A turret that allows for two crew members to share the work of operating the armament and observing the situation. It still does not allow for an effective division of labour amongst the crew."
 tank_medium_two_man_tank_turret_desc: "A turret that allows for two crew members to share the work of operating the armament and observing the situation. It still does not allow for an effective division of labour amongst the crew."
 tank_heavy_two_man_tank_turret_desc: "A turret that allows for two crew members to share the work of operating the armament and observing the situation. It still does not allow for an effective division of labour amongst the crew."
