 CANNOT_RECRUITE_OPERATIVE_NO_SLOT_DESC: "You can get the first slot by building the intelligence agency. Other slots will be available after the 5th upgrade or by assigning a §H$KR_head_of_intelligence$§! advisor.\nAs a faction's spymaster, more operative slots are unlocked by having more countries in your faction. Puppets or countries with very low factory counts do not contribute to more operative slots."
