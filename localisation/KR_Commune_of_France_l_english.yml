### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_DANIEL_GUERIN_DESC:0 "Daniel Guérin has now not only usurped from the charismatic Nestor Makhno leadership of the Anarchiste faction of the French Commune, but also won the chairmanship itself. Guérin is an academic, and a moderate in comparison to Makhno, who has proven to be a capable lawmaker."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat has upended the Communard political system. A Leninist who has frequently made public his contempt for syndicalism, Déat stands in opposition to much of France's political establishment. His many enemies both within and outside France could lead to his, and perhaps also the Commune's, downfall."

### Ideas ###
FRA_communard_spirit:0 "Communard Spirit"
FRA_communard_spirit_desc:0 "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

FRA_bad_intel:0 "Inefficient Intelligence"
FRA_bad_intel_desc:0 "Ever since the Party of Order tried to stifle the worker's uprising in France, the idea of a centralised intelligence service is seen by many as a hallmark of the reactionary oppression of the post-Weltkrieg social movements. As a result, the Commune's intelligence services are limited to extremely scrutinised intelligence committees to prevent a repeat of this situation."

FRA_to_war_idea:0 "Revanchist Rearmament"
FRA_to_war_idea_desc:0 "Our nation must rise again if we are to defeat the Imperialists!"

FRA_economic_reforms_anar:0 "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_economic_reforms_jaco:0 "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_military_buildup_two_idea:0 "Calibrated Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc:0 "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

FRA_ruralism_idea:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_idea_desc:0 "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

FRA_market_socialism_idea:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

FRA_mass_production_idea:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_idea_desc:0 "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

FRA_modern_farms_idea:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc:0 "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

FRA_war_eco_agri_idea:0 "War, Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

FRA_inter_coop_idea:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc:0 "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

FRA_dedication_idea:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_idea_desc:0 "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

FRA_industralization_idea:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_industralization_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Ambroise Croizat, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

FRA_mass_fire_support_idea:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc:0 "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

FRA_mass_conscription_idea:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
FRA_mass_conscription_idea_desc:0 "Whereas our enemies have trouble enlisting enough soldiers to fight their reactionary and imperialist wars, every man is ready to fight for the Commune. Let us mobilise as many as our economy can sustain, we will overwhelm the reactionaries with our ultimate dedication to the Commune."

FRA_empower_rifleman_idea:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc:0 "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

FRA_military_academy_idea:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_idea_desc:0 "We have to face the harsh reality that the Weltkrieg led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

FRA_centralized_hc_idea:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc:0 "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

FRA_tank_quality_line_idea:0 "Quality Tank Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea:0 "Tank Assembly Line"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

FRA_fast_army_idea:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_idea_desc:0 "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next Weltkrieg will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

FRA_Red_Army:0 "Grande Armee Rouge"
FRA_Red_Army_desc:0 "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

Capital_Ship_Primacy:0 "Capital Ship Primacy"
Capital_Ship_Primacy_desc:0 "A grand navy will be crucial to defeat the Kaiserliche Marine and bring the pain to Germany's northern coast. And in that role, the grand Battleship still shines. Its naval artillery will flatten the reactionaries with rolling barrages of thunder and steel, and send their boats to the bottom of the sea."

Carrier_Primacy:0 "Carrier Primacy"
Carrier_Primacy_desc:0 "The future of naval warfare is not in big, clunky warships, but in a combined arms approach with another front of future warfare, air warfare. Let us ensure that every naval group has a Carrier. Its fighters will ensure global air dominance, its naval bombers will wreck enemy ships and harbours alike."

FRA_working_women_idea:0 "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_idea_desc:0 "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

FRA_bhartiya_support:0 "French Military Support"
FRA_bhartiya_support_desc:0 "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

FRA_amenagement_idea:0 "Aménagement of the Territory"
FRA_amenagement_idea_desc:0 "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

FRA_plan_prost_idea:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc:0 "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes:0 "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc:0 "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the French Communal Police."

FRA_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
FRA_secret_police_desc:0 "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

FRA_demo_surete:0 "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
FRA_demo_surete_desc:0 "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

FRA_hawkish_renseignements:0 "Revolutionary Renseignements"
FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support Syndicalist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

FRA_peace_renseignements:0 "Protective Renseignements"
FRA_peace_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc:0 "The International Syndicalist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

FRA_amateur_pilots_idea:0 "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_idea_desc:0 "There are many in our country that have taken up flying as a hobby or a vocation, but not all of them pursue careers in the Air Force. They should preferably be drafted to our air force, where their skills will increase our chances of finding the new Aces of the Air."

FRA_ecole_air_idea:0 "Ecole de l'Air"
FRA_ecole_air_idea_desc:0 "Flying is a skill by itself, and flying well in combat conditions is something that you can't just learn overnight. We won't repeat the mistakes of the Weltkrieg and its butcher of novice pilots, we need a large roster of well trained air pilots, and competent officers to lead them."

FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea:0 "Waves of Syndicalism"
FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea_desc:0 "The Commune's navy is mighty, and its reach is as far as we desire it to be. While we might lack the plentiful, worldwide ports of the French Empire of old, we still aim to have a navy that can intervene to any corner of the world at any time."

FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea:0 "Cut off the Capitalists"
FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea_desc:0 "The capitalists still pride themselves of their colonial territories. The fruit of their plunders still flow freely across the high seas. But if we have a say about it, we will ensure the stolen properties of the African, Asian and American workers will not enrich them."

French_Revanchism_idea:0 "French Revanchism"
French_Revanchism_idea_desc:0 "We have long prepared ourselves for this inevitable war. We have long cast away Pétain and his creed, but this does not mean we will forget what our brothers died for in the Ardennes, in Verdun, in the Chemin des Dames. We will avenge them, and once and for all regain what we deserved for our struggle."

Revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
Revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "The survival and prosperity of the Syndicalist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

FRA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

FRA_phalanstere_NOR:0 "Aid to Norway"
FRA_phalanstere_NOR_desc:0 "We are currently providing industrial aid to our Norwegian brothers."

COF_prodcsaplanes:0 "Producing Aircraft for the CSA"

FRA_avantgarde_idea:0 "International Avant-Garde"
FRA_avantgarde_idea_desc:0 "A united socialist artstyle, from art to music, could be a powerful tool that will help masses in the non-syndicalist world get interested in our ideals - through entertainment."

### Focuses ###
commune_of_france_focus:0 "Commune of France Focus Tree"

FRA_amenagement:0 "Aménagement du Territoire"
FRA_amenagement_desc:0 "Our territory is vast and inequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
FRA_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"
FRA_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity:0 "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
FRA_chemins_de_fer:0 "Office des Chemins de Fer"
FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
FRA_mining_expansion:0 "Mining Expansion"
FRA_mining_expansion_desc:0 "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

FRA_eco_direction:0 "Direction of the Economy"
FRA_eco_direction_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
FRA_orth_syndicalism:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc:0 "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
FRA_reduce_unemploy:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
FRA_work_design_coop:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
FRA_improve_manage:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
FRA_improve_manage_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
FRA_dedication:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
FRA_fac_towns:0 "Factory Towns"
FRA_fac_towns_desc:0 "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
FRA_Industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Ambroise Croizat is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
FRA_inter_coop:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_desc:0 "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
FRA_war_eco_agri:0 "War Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_desc:0 "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
FRA_decentralized_industry:0 "Decentralised Industry"
FRA_decentralized_industry_desc:0 "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
FRA_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_desc:0 "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

FRA_communal_army:0 "The Communal Army"
FRA_communal_army_desc:0 "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
FRA_principe_concentration:0 "Principe de Concentration"
FRA_principe_concentration_desc:0 "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
FRA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research Grants"
FRA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
FRA_fast_army:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_desc:0 "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
FRA_tank_assembly_line:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
FRA_tank_quality_line:0 "Quality Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
FRA_centralized_hc:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_desc:0 "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
FRA_analysing_wki:0 "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
FRA_analysing_wki_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
FRA_war_experience:0 "War Experience"
FRA_war_experience_desc:0 "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
FRA_military_academy:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_desc:0 "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
FRA_officers_initiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
FRA_officers_initiative_desc:0 "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
FRA_mission_type:0 "Mission Type Tactics"
FRA_mission_type_desc:0 "Our plans are not meant to be task lists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
FRA_flexible_support:0 "Flexible Support"
FRA_flexible_support_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
FRA_empower_rifleman:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_desc:0 "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
FRA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
FRA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
FRA_improve_manufactures:0 "Improve the Manufactures"
FRA_improve_manufactures_desc:0 "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
FRA_global_organization:0 "Global Organisation"
FRA_global_organization_desc:0 "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
FRA_mass_fire_support:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_desc:0 "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
FRA_grand_army_reform:0 "Grand Army Reform"
FRA_grand_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

FRA_equipment_modern:0 "Modern Equipment"
FRA_equipment_modern_desc:0 "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
FRA_special_forces:0 "Alpine Forces"
FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
FRA_tank_division:0 "Tank Divisions"
FRA_tank_division_desc:0 "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
FRA_road_to_war:0 "The Road to War"
FRA_road_to_war_desc:0 "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first Weltkrieg was not the last."
FRA_renseignements_generaux:0 "The Renseignements Généraux"
FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc:0 "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
FRA_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"
FRA_military_buildup_desc:0 "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
FRA_military_buildup_two:0 "Calibrating the Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_desc:0 "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
FRA_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_desc:0 "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
FRA_Our_time_has_come:0 "Revanchist Propaganda"
FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc:0 "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Nancy. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals:0 "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc:0 "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute:0 "Blanqui Research Institute"
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc:0 "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
FRA_military_buildup_three:0 "Further Military Development"
FRA_military_buildup_three_desc:0 "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
FRA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FRA_military_science_desc:0 "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
FRA_synthetic_refineries:0 "Synthetic Resources"
FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc:0 "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium are all lacking and we must not rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research new ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
FRA_secret_weaponry:0 "Electric Machines"
FRA_secret_weaponry_desc:0 "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing. Our mathematicians already assure use that those new machines are of a tremendous help for rapid and efficient calculus. Given some patronage and time, we can only imagine the possibilities of this new field."
FRA_damocles:0 "The Damocles Project"
FRA_damocles_desc:0 "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference during the Second Internationale Congress, a reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
FRA_nuclear_weapons:0 "Curie Project"
FRA_nuclear_weapons_desc:0 "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by the Union of Britain to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs. Regardless, we must persevere and try to figure out what uses we can make of the atom. We will dedicate this project to the very woman who discovered Radium and set us on this path."
FRA_German_borders:0 "Fortify the German Border"
FRA_German_borders_desc:0 "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse river and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
FRA_extend_line:0 "Extend the Line"
FRA_extend_line_desc:0 "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead. The solution is quite simple, we will not have weak points. Least they learn how to walk on water, good luck for them to cross this line!"
FRA_Demand_Romandy:0 "Demand Haute-Savoie"
FRA_Demand_Romandy_desc:0 "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long! The Swiss have shown themselves brutish tyrants and oppressors of our people on our own rightful land! No-one can have the audacity to persecute and hunt down Frenchmen and think they may get away with it, the perfidious Swiss have made their last mistake."
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine"
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine_desc:0 "The French people shall wait no longer! The time has finally come for Germany to return the whole of Alsace-Lorraine or face the ultimate consequences!

FRA_war_with_spain:0 "Liberate Iberia"
FRA_war_with_spain_desc:0 "Right at our southern border, just across the Pyrenees, capitalism and imperialism still persists.

Syndicalism will succeed in Iberia!"
FRA_War_with_germany:0 "Take Down Germany"
FRA_War_with_germany_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, the German reactionaries have ceded Alsace-Lorraine. But we never intended to just stop there! The Revolution shall prevail, our brothers will be avenged for what they have been put through in the Weltkrieg! They will just wish they had lost the first war, for we will stop at nothing until they are utterly destroyed!"
FRA_War_with_austria:0 "Turn the Danube Red"
FRA_War_with_austria_desc:0 "The Austrian peoples have proven their incapability to commence a successful socialist revolution in their country and liberate themselves from the Habsburg tyranny. We shall assist them, then. Likewise, all the peoples still under the tyranny of this anachronistic empire will be freed. Europe will be free of the last of the reactionary empires."
FRA_War_with_Netherlands:0 "Around Ludendorff"
FRA_War_with_Netherlands_desc:0 "Lowlands of Benelux are strategically vital to our war efforts. The Germans will not expect the attack from this side and if we succeed, we will cut Germany off from it's vital economic areas in the Rhineland. Germany will fall."
FRA_World_revolution:0 "World Revolution"
FRA_World_revolution_desc:0 "With the Revolution now well established in Europe, we can start to look outwards and launch a formidable plan to liberate the whole world from the reactionaries and imperialists. Our struggle will end once the last of them is tried before the people for their crimes. Vive la République Socialiste Mondiale!"
FRA_european_revolution:0 "European Revolution"
FRA_european_revolution_desc:0 "While the idea of a World Revolution is noble, we have to stay realistic. With smart influence and no other reactionary power to oppose us, we shall soon see the other continents convert to Syndicalism. However, we must ensure that Europe is free of reactionaries. Vive la République Socialiste Européene!"
FRA_peaceful_revolution:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
FRA_peaceful_revolution_desc:0 "We hear those who claim that the Revolution cannot end, and it will not. However, we cannot afford to constantly wage war in all corners of the world without cause.

FRA_mission_bhartiya:0 "Mission to the Bharatiya Commune"
FRA_mission_bhartiya_desc:0 "The Bharatiya Commune asked for our support in their struggle against its neighbours, the Delhi imperialists and the Princely Federation reactionaries. They ask of us that we send military advisers to train their officers and their troops. We will ensure this aid arrives rapidly, so that they may unite India faster."
FRA_arab_committee:0 "Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
FRA_arab_committee_desc:0 "The traitors of the French people, bastard Petain and his clique of friends, use the native proletariat in efforts to return to the mainland. We won't give them such a chance. Our Algerian comrade Mohamed Saïl, living in France, proposed to us the idea of supporting socialist liberation movements across all of Africa, for the good of all Africans."
FRA_working_women:0 "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_desc:0 "During the Congress, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. We supported her arguments and now we are ready to implement common sense reforms regarding the status of working women in our society. The reactionaries can gawk, we will surely have the last laugh."
FRA_avantgarde:0 "International Avant-Garde"
FRA_avantgarde_desc:0 "For too long have traditional arts and classical music dominated the entertainment of the masses. While Jazz is enjoyable and widely popular in our countries, one genre cannot fight against all others. We have to create new ones, we have to show the world, what the real entertainment is. And it will show to the world that we are the good force of this era!"
FRA_second_inter_congress:0 "The Second Internationale Congress"
FRA_second_inter_congress_desc:0 "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to consider its approach towards the Global Revolution. Since the first Congress of the Internationale took place in France, the second one will take place in Britain."
FRA_scientific_cooperation:0 "International Scientific Cooperation"
FRA_scientific_cooperation_desc:0 "It is clear that we cannot simply keep our own technological discoveries to ourselves. During a meeting at the old university of Cambridge, we decided to establish a worldwide plan to combine the technological advances of Socialist countries. Some however, call for a more ambitious plan, including industrial investment."
FRA_third_inter_congress:0 "The Victory Congress"
FRA_third_inter_congress_desc:0 "The responsibility of holding the Third Congress has once again fallen back to us, with the new site chosen for the task being the Palace Populaire, where the Louvre once stood full of the plunders of the French Empire. Fittingly, one of the topics at hand concerns finally liberating the African continent."
FRA_end_GEX:0 "The End of the Kaiser"
FRA_end_GEX_desc:0 "Africa has long suffered under tyranny and oppression. The oppression of its many kings, the oppression of slave traders and missionaries, and finally the oppression of European colonists and explorers. Finally, we give freedom to Africa, and hope that one day we can right the wrongs done to them."

FRA_armee_de_lair:0 "Armée de l'Air du Peuple"
FRA_armee_de_lair_desc:0 "Planes are a strange new aspect of warfare. These machines are quite complex to handle, and the punishment for failing to fly properly obvious. And yet, any able man can be a pilot. We must open the ranks of the air force to the conscripts, like the army and navy has. Our air force will have no shortage of pilots."
FRA_amateur_pilots:0 "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_desc:0 "No-one is born a pilot, and while some study to excel at air handling and combat and their efforts are admirable, we cannot expect every single pilot to be an ace. We must give civilian pilots and amateur pilots their chance to shine. This also includes women, who would normally not be conscripted."
FRA_valin_doctrine:0 "Valin Doctrine"
FRA_valin_doctrine_desc:0 "Martial Valin is a brilliant aviator, and he has much to teach us about this new, strange world of air warfare. While his words are no gospel, we heavily value his unique experience and aim to make his teachings the frame of future air doctrine. A start, certainly."
FRA_ecole_air:0 "Ecole de l'Air"
FRA_ecole_air_desc:0 "As our air doctrine rapidly expands and air fights go from disorganised brawls to carefully crafted engagements, we desperately begin to need trained pilots and trained officers who can plan air campaigns as they plan land or naval campaigns. Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
FRA_air_bases:0 "Establish More Air Bases"
FRA_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours. As such, we must ensure our air base coverage is excellent, and we must make sure we are always under capacity so that our air force is never crippled by lacking infrastructure."
FRA_fighters:0 "Fighter Focus"
FRA_fighters_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for our enemies, and as such it is a new angle of defence for us. Unlike on land, there are no forts, no cover, just one-on-one dogfights. If we invest in fighter production, we ensure no-one will freely navigate our air. Our fighters will always be upon them and ready to bring them back to the ground."
FRA_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
FRA_bombers_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet. Bombs present a single yet elegant way of transporting ordnance from the hangar to the target. We must invest in bombers to ensure that our enemies are assaulted from all sides, an advantage we cannot ignore."
FRA_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction Focus"
FRA_strat_bombers_desc:0 "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better. Further development in bomber models have unveiled new air frames capable of carrying massive amounts of bombs, or a few devastatingly big bombs. Whatever the case, we may soon flatten entire cities or armies with a few waves of air attacks."
FRA_paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers Development"
FRA_paratroopers_desc:0 "Until now, we have always considered that the only way to transport troops are trucks and landing craft. However, recent breakthroughs in aviation means we now have planes capable of carrying entire squads, and dropping them into battle in a safe manner. We must immediately train regiments capable of this vertical encirclement!"
FRA_rocket_development:0 "Rocketry Effort"
FRA_rocket_development_desc:0 "The rocket engine is the pinnacle of our research in new propulsion methods for aircraft. While the path to creating rocket craft might still be long and arduous, our scientists propose a simpler use for rockets. By strapping an explosive charge and flinging them at the enemy, we can bomb them from afar. Simple, devastating."

FRA_navy_focus:0 "Naval Reorganisation Programme"
FRA_navy_focus_desc:0 "While we currently have an acceptable navy, it is quite disorganised, preventing us from expanding it any further. We must integrate our naval forces back into the hierarchy of the Communal Forces. Just because we do not have a grand navy yet, does not mean we do not have a navy."
FRA_arsenaux_back_on:0 "Put the Arsenaux Back On"
FRA_arsenaux_back_on_desc:0 "The naval dockyards have for long been silent, abandoned in favour of military factories and civilian needs. Today, we will reinvest into those old Arsenaux, staff them again, and fund them so that we might once again have a navy that compares with the one of the Republic."
FRA_old_doctrine:0 "The Old Doctrine"
FRA_old_doctrine_desc:0 "Our navy is one grand ensemble, slowly navigating the seas, ready to lay waste to the navies of our enemies. They protect our convoys and fight off marauders, but stand ready to face off any large fleet with the full might of the entire French navy. Why change what is not broken?"
FRA_new_doctrine:0 "The New Doctrine"
FRA_new_doctrine_desc:0 "Our navy is a tool, to be applied carefully when the situation calls for it. Instead of falling for the enemy's bait and joining into those massive open-seas scrapyards, we must seek to strike their convoys, their isolated fleets, and keep them on the run while we rapidly destroy their entire economy."
FRA_castex_plan:0 "The Castex Plan"
FRA_castex_plan_desc:0 "The Castex Plan aims for us to continue improving the core of our navy. Battleships and cruisers will be the striking force of our grand navy, allowing us to end any fight with the rout of our enemy, with little damage to us except for screen ships such as Destroyers."
FRA_home_fleet:0 "Home Fleet"
FRA_home_fleet_desc:0 "Our fleet defends our coasts, patrolling the Channel, the Atlantic Coast and the Mediterranean tirelessly, ensuring that not a single submarine or roaming ship passes and damages our convoys or tries to shell our coasts or our moored ships. We do not fear an attack from the seas, from anyone."
FRA_strike_nat_france:0 "Strike the Regime in Algiers!"
FRA_strike_nat_france_desc:0 "The old Regime still lives in Algiers, subsisting from its exploitation of the African colonies of the defunct French Empire, corrupting our legacy with their atrocities. We must secure the Mediterranean, and they stand in our way. We will put an end to this masquerade."

FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism will reach to all the seas of the world. We may not have the ports or colonies of the old, reactionary Empires, but we have the will to send our ship on long voyages, bringing back tales of victory over the imperialists. Our sailors will sail the seven seas in the name of Syndicalism!"
FRA_colonnes_neptune:0 "The Colonnes de Neptune"
FRA_colonnes_neptune_desc:0 "If we are to defeat enemy nations abroad, a beachhead is a necessary step before we can deploy the brunt of our forces. We must train our Marines forces with purpose and ensure that only the best partake in those incredibly arduous tasks. The fate of entire invasions count on them alone."
FRA_submarines:0 "Guerre Sous-Marine"
FRA_submarines_desc:0 "As modern war takes to the air, it also goes under the seas. Submarines provide a new, revolutionary change to naval warfare. Their torpedoes can end even the most armoured of battleships, and their profile is stealthy, with only the most advanced technologies able to find and attack them."
FRA_cut_off_capitalists:0 "Cut off the Capitalists"
FRA_cut_off_capitalists_desc:0 "We cannot simply sit and watch as the Empires of old extort the peoples of the world and bring their blunder back to their colonial offices to count and enjoy. We will ensure that every convoy hauling their unjustly seized goods fears the Communal submarine."
FRA_naval_bombers:0 "Develop Naval Bombers"
FRA_naval_bombers_desc:0 "The air can well pair with the sea. Planes carrying torpedoes allow us to instantly kill even the biggest of ships with great accuracy, the torpedoes preventing us from having to hit dead centre on a ship's deck with a bomb. We must invest in naval bombers to gain an edge on big, bulky navies."
FRA_protect_coastlines:0 "Protect our Coastlines"
FRA_protect_coastlines_desc:0 "Eventually, our navy cannot protect every single beach and every single small harbour in our country. However, we can plan ahead and add some basic fortifications to ensure we are not taken by surprise. If they land on our beaches, they will enjoy cold hard steel after a long time at sea."

FRA_Phalanstere_internationale:0 "Found the Phalanstère Internationale"
FRA_Phalanstere_internationale_desc:0 "The need for secrecy necessitates certain inefficiencies in military research. By working closely with other syndicalist nations and allowing researchers access to others' most closely guarded secrets, this fundamental issue can be overcome. The Phalanstère Internationale shall serve as the central authority for the exchange of such secrets."

comfrance.1.t:0 "The Commune of France"
comfrance.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing communist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause.

comfrance.97.d:0 "With the American question settled, Ernest Hemingway, the Syndicates' delegate to the Congress, took the stage. He thanked all those who supported the CSA's cause and called on the Socialist world to constantly battle the reactionaries. The speech was received with great applause, especially by the French delegation."

comfrance.99.t:0 "The Cambridge Conference"
comfrance.99.d:0 "Along with the politicians in London, a separate meeting of scientists from France and Britain took place in the old university in Cambridge.

comfrance.100.a:0 "We shall not be alone."

comfrance.101.t:0 "Day 5 - Chile Requests Support"
comfrance.101.d:0 "The Chileans have asked for assistance in improving their army in the face of hostile imperialist foes such as Argentina. Bordered on virtually all sides by threats, Chile's position might become increasingly precarious without our help. Furthermore, they could prove invaluable at safeguarding the revolution in the New World."
comfrance.101.a:0 "We cannot let Chile fall."

Although he resigned from the Chairman's post almost a year ago, his authority and influence in the Union were unprecedented.

comfrance.117.d:0 "Philip Snowden, aged 73, passed away in his house in Tilford, Surrey. The traitor and the Chairman of the Union of Britain's TUC, Snowden has been remembered among the Royalists as a synonym for treachery. Although the Socialists in Britain mourn his death, in Canada his funeral has become a single bright day in this dark period of history."

comfrance.118.t:0 "Germany and the Second Congress of the Internationale"
comfrance.118.d:0 "The Congress has been received with anxiety in Germany.

comfrance.125.c:0 "Use it to fortify our border with Argentina."

comfrance.127.t:0 "The Phalanstère Internationale Research Organisation"
comfrance.127.d:0 "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère Internationale Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère Internationale' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
comfrance.127.a:0 "Participation sounds good."

comfrance.128.t:0 "The Phalanstère Internationale Industrial Programme"
comfrance.128.d:0 "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves. The choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."

comfrance.129.d:0 "As part of the Phalanstère International programme, our comrades in Paris and London have just offered us much needed help. Industrial machines, mining equipment, weapons, ammunition and more - all of this will be unloaded in our ports and airports and transported across the country - assuming we desire that."
comfrance.129.a:0 "Excellent!"
comfrance.129.b:0 "We don't want their help."

comfrance.130.t:0 "A Jacobin Reformation?"
comfrance.130.d:0 "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is now divided. Hardliners are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many members of the party are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines."
comfrance.130.a:0 "The old system shall be swept away!"
comfrance.130.b:0 "We shall reform Syndicalism from within."

comfrance.131.t:0 "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
comfrance.131.d:0 "The Syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with true Marxism as laid out by the Parti Communiste Français. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Députés du Peuple while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Commissaires du Peuple."
comfrance.131.a:0 "An improvement, no doubt."

comfrance.132.t:0 "Dissolution of the CGT"
comfrance.132.d:0 "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confederation General du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune. We can finally break their power, so as to prevent our rival from further resisting our Communist doctrine."

comfrance.134.t:0 "Léon Blum and the Front Populaire"
comfrance.134.d:0 "Now the leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."
comfrance.134.a:0 "Bring them to trial!"
comfrance.134.b:0 "Leninist valours will endure these traitors."

comfrance.135.t:0 "The Paris Trial"
comfrance.135.d:0 "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

comfrance.138.t:0 "The Front Populaire Restores Syndicalism"
comfrance.138.d:0 "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and is purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public."

comfrance.149.t:0 "BGT Elections 1941 - Foreign Policy"
comfrance.149.d:0 "Undoubtedly one of the most important issues for the next Comité would be how to handle the radically changing world developments. The Travailleurs argue for further cooperation within the Internationale, whilst the Anarchistes wish to commence a wave of liberation to sweep the old order away everywhere it lingers.
