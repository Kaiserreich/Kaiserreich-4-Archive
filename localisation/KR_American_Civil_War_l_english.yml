### Set Up Events ###
 amcivwar.1.t.president:0 "President Reed Escapes to Chicago"
 amcivwar.1.t.not_president:0 "Jack Reed Calls for Action"

 amcivwar.1.d.president:0 "President Reed has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognise the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling spectre of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."
 amcivwar.1.d.macarthur:0 "Jack Reed has given a rousing a radio broadcast from Chicago, urging all his followers to rise up against the twin tyrants of General MacArthur and Huey Long. Within the hour, a number of governors across the Steel Belt have announced their support and declared both Huey Long and General MacArthur as having no true authority. The governors have been bolstered by Reed's supporters, who within days have overtaken army posts and erected road blocks throughout the northern states."

 amcivwar.1.d.nothing_is_done:0 "The violence in Pittsburgh was just the spark that was needed for Jack Reed to declare on the radio that President Olson is a puppet of the corporations and a dishonest conman, intent on selling out the American worker to the highest bidder. He said it is time for the worker to make a stand. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed and with its failure, America has been broken. Jack Reed today announced that the workers of America must take a stand against the governments, and almost immediately a number of northern governors declared their support for him. They say President Olson and his government have no authority, demanding they surrender to a committee headed by Reed to oversee the restructuring of the government 'as the founding fathers intended'."
 amcivwar.1.d.assassination_long:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Huey Long, Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as puppets of their capitalist masters. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.assassination_reed:0 "The assassination attempt against Jack Reed has been foiled, and worse, the involvement of the federal government has been made public. This is all the justification the SPA needed. Jack Reed today denounced President [USA.GetLeader] and Huey Long both as traitors and tyrants, and has rallied his supporters to defend their way of life against tyranny. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.1.d.long_assassinated:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the assassination of Huey Long, Jack Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as tyrants and American democracy as truly dead. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.austerity:0 "With his supporters fired up by the federal government's collusion with Huey Long and the AFP, Jack Reed has seized the moment and called on American workers to rise up against a tyrannical system which has betrayed them. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.1.d.default:0 "The crackdown on the Socialist Party could have only had one outcome: to protect the rights of workers across the nation, Jack Reed has called upon the workers of America to stand up against their capitalist overlords, saying that decent Americans have a moral obligation to take action against President Garner and the corruption he represents. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.2.d.president_reed:0 "In a fiery speech in Baton Rouge, Huey Long has spoken about the need to fight both the traitor MacArthur and pretender Reed. Both are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognised that they recognise the authority of neither MacArthur nor President Reed."
 amcivwar.2.d.president_long:0 "President Huey Long has escaped to Baton Rouge and has declared that General MacArthur is a traitor to the people of America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognised that they no longer recognise MacArthur's authority, and demanded his resignation. Long has spoken on the radio, urging all Americans to support the legitimate President and fight against the tyranny MacArthur represents."

 amcivwar.2.d.nothing_is_done:0 "The violence in Pittsburgh was just the spark that was needed for Huey Long to declare on the radio that President Olson is both a traitor and a conman, intent on selling out the American people to bankers and the syndicalists, and that both he and Reed must be fought to preserve the American way of life. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate and thus refuse to recognise its authority."
 amcivwar.2.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed, and with its failure America has been broken. Huey Long declared on the radio today that the corrupt President Olson and the tyrannical Reed both must be stopped for the good of America, and has called for all decent Americans to rise up against them. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate, and while they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognise the government's authority within their borders."
 amcivwar.2.d.assassination_long:0 "The assassination attempt against Huey Long has been foiled, and worse, the involvement of the federal government has been made public. This is all the justification the AFP needed.

 amcivwar.2.d.assassination_reed:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Jack Reed, Huey Long has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as corrupt and beyond redemption. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the [USA.GetName] government as legitimate. While they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognise the government's authority within their borders."

 amcivwar.2.d.reed_assassinated:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the assassination of Jack Reed, Huey Long has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as tyrants and American democracy as truly dead. A number of southern governors immediately declared their support for Long, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by Minutemen militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.2.d.compromise:0 "With his supporters fired up by the federal government's apparent embrace of a syndicalist agenda, Huey Long has seized the moment and called on Americans to rise up against a system that was about to betray them to tyranny. A number of southern governors immediately declared their support for Long, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by Minutemen militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.2.d.default:0 "Huey Long has declared that President [USA.GetLeader] is a tyrant and must be opposed. In a radio speech, he denounced the president for being in league with the syndicalists of the SPA, and accused him of doing nothing to stop the chaos. Long has vowed to restore order and destroy the corrupt government in Washington, and a number of southern governors immediately declared their support for him and demanded that [USA.GetLeader] immediately step down and turn over control to Long and a 'reconciliation committee' that would see a restructuring of the American government."

They currently have not seceded from the Union, but instead refuse to recognise the authority of any of the competing governments. Governor Frank Merriam announced at the Sacramento legislature that, if push came to shove, they would see 'proper democracy' restored to the country by force."

 amcivwar.4.d.reed:0 "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States, as the elected President Reed fled to the city of Chicago after being forcibly removed from his position by General Douglas MacArthur. From Chicago, Reed's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the southern supporters of Huey Long, based in Baton Rouge, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."
 amcivwar.4.d.long:0 "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States, as the elected President Huey Long fled to the city of Baton Rouge after being forcibly removed from his position by General Douglas MacArthur.

Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."
 amcivwar.4.d.olson:0 "President Floyd Olson experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Jack Reed. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until Olson steps down and a 'reconciliation council' is put in place to restore order. In response, President Olson has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
 amcivwar.4.d.garner:0 "President John Nance Garner experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Jack Reed. They stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until Garner steps down and a 'reconciliation council' is put into place to restore order. In response, President Garner has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
 amcivwar.4.d.landon:0 "President Alf Landon experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Jack Reed.

In response, President Landon has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
 amcivwar.4.d.long_assassinated:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, citing a direct link between the federal government and the recent assassination of Huey Long, and have thrown their support behind syndicalist leader Jack Reed. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but have declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until [USA.GetLeader] steps down. In response, President [USA.GetLeader] has given the governors thirty days to stand down - an order none of them appear interested in obeying, making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."
 amcivwar.4.d.austerity:0 "While President [USA.GetLeader] celebrated a recent victory by passing a massive austerity bill to rescue the American economy, with support from the America First Party, the bill had the opposite effect on the Socialist Party of America. Today several governors declared the government illegitimate and thrown their support behind SPA leader, Jack Reed.

The IWW proclaim we confiscate all their wealth and redistribute it to the people immediately. The up-and-coming Vanguard has called for their immediate arrest and execution as well, citing the fate of Vladimir Lenin as an example of a revolution defeated by leniency. SPA members belonging to the depreciated AFL, along with several loyal Progressives have sought life over death.

 amcivwar.32.d:0 "The revolutionary agitprop have just released the story of the life of Willaim Crawley, a humble son of Florida. Filmed on a modern sound stage, the daring rescue is portrayed by ex-Hollywood Paul Robeson. Although the real life William Crowley preferred the church choir, Paul Robeson's musical numbers were jaunty popular tunes. The film has proven to be a smashing success at the box office, beating out an adaptation of Jack London's The Iron Heel at the opening weekend. The press caught up to William Crawley, where he commented that the film is 'Quite the spectacle on our great liberation'."

 amcivwar.33.t:0 "Directive 213: War Syndicalism"
 amcivwar.33.d:0 "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the Central Committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalisation of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."

 amcivwar.34.d:0 "Gender equality has long been a major ideological component of socialist thought, and we have yet more evidence that it works! A squadron of female pilots has earned renown throughout the CSA for their daring raids on enemy territory, their coordinated and synchronised attack formations allowing them to take down larger enemy air forces with ease. Derisively named the 'Red Witches' by the reactionary forces under Huey Long, the squadron, led by Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."

The AFL, which had seen a decline in membership before 1935, was revitalised by Reed's endorsement. Now the AFL, as a part of the coalition fighting the socialist revolution, has begun to exercise their ideological autonomy. They have chosen to occupy the entire left side of the IWW, and begun to pull in allies. Their debates with the IWW can sometimes leak out into street brawls, and, in two cases, friendly fire. The Vanguards, owing only their allegiance to the revolution, have tried to foster cooperation. Now Reed must decide whether it is more danger to continue his support for the IWW, when compromise is in sight. "

When supporting the revolution and supporting the people are the same, the choice is trivial, but when one must be prioritised over the other, hard choices must be made.

 amcivwar.38.d:0 "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators?"

 amcivwar.39.d:0 "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathise with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old."

Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the Central Committee, including Chairman Reed, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"

The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions. Reed has made an executive decision to suppress these reports from the free media.

Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11.

 amcivwar.46.d:0 "Charles Lindbergh has arranged a meeting between Huey Long and a number of leading industrialists including Henry Ford, Fred Koch, and H.L. Hunt. These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."
 amcivwar.46.a:0 "Agree to their reasoning"
 amcivwar.46.b:0 "I will not betray my ideals!"

 amcivwar.47.t:0 "War Powers Committee"
 amcivwar.47.d:0 "Business leaders within our territory have formed a committee ostensibly in support of Huey Long in order to coordinate the war effort on his behalf called the War Powers Committee. Just as Huey Long himself had created offices to handle the monumental task of fighting for America, so did the industrialists take it upon themselves to create an industrial institution. Though they do not have all the power that they were promised, they have declared themselves to be the arsenal the AUS, and are led by controversially anti-Semitic but respected general George Van Horn Moseley."

 amcivwar.48.t:0 "Pelley pledges allegiance to Long"
 amcivwar.48.d:0 "One of the more unusual well-wishers to visit Huey Long is an eccentric but passionate man named William Dudley Pelley. Pelley is the leader of an all-white Legionarist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals is unsettlingly enthusiastic. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the fledgling Christian Identity movement, which clashes with his personal distaste for the political ideology of Klansmen and Prohibitionists. How shall we respond?"

 amcivwar.49.t:0 "The Silver Legion"
 amcivwar.49.d:0 "Along the way during the national tour, William Pelley came into contact with radio preacher Herbert W. Armstrong. In order to raise an army for the American Union State in favour of what they see as a moral war, they have officially combined their beliefs to form the Pelley-Armstrong line. This has swelled the Silver Legion into the tens of thousands of members from all across the country, and reports of their speeches have come in. In inclusion to the strongly anti-Catholic and pro-segregationist rhetoric at these speeches are promises that are said to come from Huey Long in favour of almost extraordinary wages for whites and benefits for veterans after the civil war. As these have entered the rumour mill there is nothing we can do to stop these promises from spreading."

This would require the government to provide the expenses for the WASPs similar to the other two organisations instead of having the female pilots themselves pay the expenses. It would not have them fly in combat situations, since that is still the job for the Male pilots. Despite this it is facing quite the pushback from Congress as many regard the WASPs as not as experienced as male pilots and not suited for the job.

Whether the Pacific rebels would even consider such a thing is unknown, but if it occurred it would give us time to consolidate our hold over the east and for our men to recover.

The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning. Both sides simply call for hostilities to stop for now, for damage to be assessed, and for the living to take a much-needed breath."

 amcivwar.206.d:0 "Civil war has ravaged America for many months, but today a ceasefire was called in the conflict after a meeting in Denver between officials of [PSA.GetNameDef] and [survivor.GetNameDef] worked out terms. Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable. Even so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."

 amcivwar.227.t:0 "Seizing American Equipment"
 amcivwar.227.d:0 "With the Americans heading off the island, they have left large amounts of equipment in the Philippines. The Filipino army is advocating seizing the resources while they are unguarded but the government is afraid of what this might do to the relations between the two countries."

 amcivwar.228.b:0 "We must hold our position"

 amcivwar.229.t:0 "The Philippine Commonwealth"
 amcivwar.229.d:0 "The Americans had never promised the Filipino people independence and forces inside the country wanted to use the American Civil War as an opportunity to declare independence and form a legitimate government. The Commonwealth of the Philippines was created to administer the nation and transition into a full state of independence."

So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself.

 amcivwar.312.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
 amcivwar.312.d:0 "The 30-day deadline issued by the federal government is almost at an end, with none of the sides having stood down.

### MacArthur's War ###
 amcivwar.700.t:0 "MacArthur's War Plan"
 amcivwar.700.d:0 "General MacArthur has long been preparing his plans for combatting civil unrest. The original War Plan White from the early '20s insisted on respecting the Constitution's provisions on states' rights. It said that only the governor could request federal troops to suppress a revolt. The situation in the nation now, unfortunately, requires stronger action. With President MacArthur's 30-day amnesty deadline yielding few results, it seems the United States needs to prepare for war. \n\nThere are three plans that have been proposed to the cabinet and chiefs of the military:\n\n1. War Plan White: Yorktown recommends abandoning the many military bases on the West Coast, in the Rockies, the Great Plains and the Midwest. With the withdrawal of Federal troops east of the Missisippi, the plan hopes the concentration of Federal troops on the eastern seaboard will be able to crush rebellions in Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, New England, and Georgia.\n\n2. War Plan White: San Jacinto calls for relocating the government to the Great Plains, along with much of the military, in order to crush resistance in the Pacific states. If properly executed, this would allow us to recapture the mutineering Pacific fleet. \n\n3. Lastly, MacArthur's original War Plan White, drafted late last year, calls for holding a corridor from Virginia to whichever states remain loyal in the Midwest. We hope that our superior organisation and mobility can quickly crush the rebellions before they can link up or begin war production. What should we choose?"
 amcivwar.700.a:0 "Abandon the Plains."

 amcivwar.701.t:0 "Evacuation of the Rocky Mountains"
 amcivwar.701.d:0 "The states of Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, and Utah have long been thought of as America's true heartland, a place where invaders would rarely reach. As such, there were few military bases or commands in the area, and few depots or bases to evacuate. In Nevada, unfortunately, Hawthorne Army Depot has refused orders to move materiel east. However, the states of New Mexico and Arizona were different. Here, Forts Yuma and Huachaca, built in the last century to protect against Indian raids and Mexican bandits, remained strong. Happily, they also remained loyal, and the soldiers and men there are trucking north and east as quickly as they can. The citizens of these states are cautiously obeying the instructions of the governors to remain where they are until a regional decision is made."
 amcivwar.701.a:0 "Perhaps the Navajo will come out again, now the Feds are gone."

 amcivwar.702.t:0 "Evacuation of the Northern Great Plains"
 amcivwar.702.d:0 "Like the rest of the old West, the only military bases in the north of the Great Plains were established during the last Indian Wars to finally pacify the region. Fort Russel in Wyoming, Fort Missoula in Montana, and Camp Grafton in North Dakota are now fairly badly-equipped bases, having not fought a battle or skirmish since the 1880s. The lack of hostile civilian activity has made the evacuation relatively smooth, and the troops have withdrawn south to Colorado and Missouri."

 amcivwar.703.t:0 "The Withdrawal from Denver"
 amcivwar.703.d:0 "The central Plains, Denver in particular, have become a rallying point for troops and militiamen in the Plains and west, coming together to organise, train, and fight the rebellions. As the President has decided to abandon the Plains until he can take Chicago and Baton Rouge, these troops have been sent out of Denver east to Missouri, to meet the loyalist militias already converging on St Louis. The governor of Colorado has begged our troops to stay and protect his state from the radical rebels, but they had their orders. The west has been left for dead."

Governor Stark of Missouri, a Pendergast machine politician, is an admirer of Governor Long and an ally of the AFP. He refused to allow our men to cross the Missisippi without checking each unit's papers by Washington by telegram. Our men seem to have gotten slightly fed up with this, and stormed across the bridge in Cairo to Kentucky. Unfortunately, the bridge could only take so many people, and the bridge soon collapsed, leaving thousands of men stranded on the far side. Ferries were soon organised to bring them over, but the first shots of opposition to the army were seen as the last of our men left St Louis as AFP militiamen shot at our retreating troops."

The Governor of Nevada, Richard Kirman, Sr., refused to allow Federal troops to evacuate or abandon their equipment, but the governors of Arizona, Idaho and Utah were more willing to accommodate the President. However, a recent regional conference of the four governors in Salt Lake City has led to them deciding to collectively rely on the provisional government in California for protection and support. Apparently, most of them were led to this by their clear abandonment by the Washington government. They have denounced MacArthur’s takeover pro forma and the Sacramento government has already sent in its own soldiers and airmen to occupy the abandoned bases in the west."

 amcivwar.706.d:0 "As Federal soldiers and marines left Arizona and New Mexico, they took most militiamen and National Guardsmen with them, promising to return them to their homes by way of Baton Rouge by the end of the year. Unfortunately for MacArthur’s government, stripping New Mexico of defenders left it open to takeovers from nearby. Steaming up the Pecos and racing along the roads to Albuquerque and Santa Fe, Huey Long’s loyal Minutemen and National Guard captured the greater part of New Mexico before the police knew what was happening. Soon, Progressive governor Tingley surrendered the state via radio before fleeing west to the PSA, taking most of the administration of the state with him."

In an attempt to gain the most favourable position in the Midwest possible, General Butler has dispatched militias to seize St Louis across the Missouri from Illinois. They encountered Governor Stark's National Guard at Eads Bridge on the border, and skirmishes ensued, as militias on both sides attempted to cross the river around the bridges without success. Finally, a rogue group of Illinois Minutemen came up from the north and began attacking the CSA forces from behind, which allowed Governor Stark's National Guard to push forward and force the CSA militia to surrender. Governor Stark has now declared Huey Long legitimate President, and Union forces have entered the state to guard the borders."

 amcivwar.714.d.TEX:0 "Today, at 8:45 am, Longist militias assaulted Federal defences in Nashville while they were still reorganising from their retreat east. Disorganised National Guardsmen and the few Army units present were quickly surrounded and forced to surrender, and soon the city of Nashville had surrendered to President Long's forces. Across the state, local Minutemen and Longist sympathisers secured the countryside and most towns, and most agree Huey Long's control of Tennessee is undisputed."

The operation was remarkably successful, but a socialist counterattack was soon felt once the Federal troops managed to capture the city and advance along the Ship-to-Shore highway northwest. A pitched battle began between the forces of General Butler, based in Allentown, and General Bowley in Philadelphia near Lansdale. Attempts were made to clear the area of civilians, but soon thousands were dead after artillery strikes began, and it became evident the reconquest of Pennsylvania was not going to be easy.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

Union members prepared major east-west streets, with fallback lines reaching all the way back to Broad Street, cut the bridges over the Delaware and Schuylkill, and telephoned General Butler’s forces in Allentown to coordinate counterattacks. While the initial the Federal assault rolled down the Main Line with little friction, Federal attempts to cross the river near the Market Street bridge were greatly disrupted by syndicalist local activity, and soon General Butler’s long-range guns, evacuated from the Frankford Arsenal the week before, were causing havoc in Federal supply lines. An exasperated President MacArthur eliminated all restrictions on his troops in the region, and the fighting became increasingly messy. Nevertheless, the Federal forces were mostly pushed back over the border to Maryland.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

Syndicalist rebels from New York broke the siege and overrun General MacArthur’s forces in Newark, and received General Smedley Butler’s reinforcements from Pennsylvania, who then proceeded to occupy the eastern half of that state. However, General MacArthur had sent reinforcements to New Jersey as well, and as they attempted to cross the Delaware they ran into heavy socialist resistance in Camden. Quickly taking up positions under the command of a Lieutenant Daniel Daly, the two sides began a large-scale firefight, and as more reinforcements entered the area, a small border conflict has finally bloomed into a full blown battle.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

Remnant strikers from the mostly-obsolete New Year's Strike in Rochester and Buffalo have been joined by partisans of Reed's government in Chicago, who have united to overthrow the city government and invite CSA soldiers in to protect the state.

 amcivwar.724.d.canada:0 "Although the British-Canadian government has accepted the New York governor's request to secure his state's neutrality, in the western part of the state British-Canadian troops have arrived too slowly to prevent CSA General Butler's soldiers from advancing into the cities of Buffalo and Rochester, there meeting up with partisans of President Reed, and moving to a defensible line from the mouth of the Susquehanna to Niagara Falls. The CSA has established their own state government in Buffalo, and it seems the state will remain split until either the CSA or Canada seize the rest in war."

Many junior members of government, left behind for now, are unsure how to react to the situation, with some burning confidential documents from government ministries and even the Library of Congress, from which the original Constitution was flown out to Denver. Protesters in the street are still being suppressed by local police, but most of the National Guard and Army have boarded trains headed west. This morning General MacArthur addressed the rump Congress in a secret joint session, outlining his plan for suppressing civil unrest in the west before defeating Reed and Long in the East."

On the one hand, riots in the Mid-Atlantic and Appalachian regions are spreading without Federal opposition, and it seems that the east might fall to rebels before we can crush dissent in the west. On the other hand, though, it seems that the increased unrest on the East Coast is obscuring our redeployment west, and newspapers hostile to the government have not picked up on it Even better, the rebellious factions in the west and Plains are facing their own internal disorders, as strikers in Oregon and Washington collide with National Guardsmen, some of which remain loyal to Denver while others follow their governors in recognising Sacramento’s rebellion, and Texan loyalist militia muster in San Antonio."
 amcivwar.752.d.TEX:0 "America’s unity is quickly breaking down as General MacArthur’s dictatorship alienates more and more citizens. We have a great opportunity in the East to take Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia from the doddering Federal government, and General Patton is recommending an aggressive push there.

We seem to be the first target of General MacArthur’s armies now mustering in the Great Plains, and there is already popular resistance to our governors’ decision to align with Sacramento in Oregon and Washington. Some state representatives of the Pacific states are reportedly regretting our decision to declare a rival government, as well. Our union is under great threat."
 amcivwar.752.d.CSA:0 "America’s unity is quickly breaking down as popular movements seek to overthrow their oppressors in Washington, Denver, Sacramento, and Baton Rouge. The Federal army seems to be undertaking no offensive moves in the east against the strikers there, but it is hard to pinpoint its exact location. Newly defected General Smedley Butler is recommending a strike to secure the old capital and Virginia, before taking New England and Kentucky. These are seen as more valuable prizes than the Midwest, as well as the most threatening should the dictator Long seize them."

Despite the city being right at the border with Mississippi, currently controlled by the southern traitors, our troops reached Missouri without having to fire a single shot. This was possible thanks to the Longists general staff preparing an attack on North Carolina, seeing it as a weaker area that would be more valuable to secure. In this way, our forces travelled west without suffering a single loss."

With almost all land west of the Mississippi north of Texas secure, Federal troops are now readying for an envelopment of Texas and a strike across the Rockies against Sacramento. Our position in the west seems secure."

 amcivwar.757.d:0 "As expected, loyalist militias from San Antonio and Oklahoma have overrun the disorganised Longist militias in Houston and Austin before General Devers could reinforce its positions.

In this way, however, General Patton’s forces are incredibly close to the strategic city of Norfolk, and now a race for whoever seizes Virginia first has begun."

Since there seemed to be no sign of a counter-assault, the militia soon began transforming the National Mall and other sites, with the most attention being paid to the Capitol. Hauling down the old flag from over the home of fled Congress, soldiers paused for photographs and interviews with socialist and local newspapers, before gathering to cheer over the flag of the CSA being raised over D.C. at last."

 amcivwar.767.d.PSA:0 "With the withdrawal of the Federal government west, it was obvious that General MacArthur intended to strike at the Pacific states first, seeing them as the most isolated threat. Coming over the Rocky Mountains with the last snows of winter, the 2nd Army Division commenced an organised attack on Oregon and the southern part of Washington. Happily for the defenders, a militia early warning system in Oregon managed to bring the Californian guard out to defend La Grande, managing to push out the Army from the state. The 3rd, 2nd, and 14th Divisions are now preparing a defence in Idaho and Nevada, but the Californians have already begun a counterattack, just as the Union strikes towards Arkansas once more, and the CSA moves on North Carolina.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

 amcivwar.767.a:0 "California cannot resist us alone."
 amcivwar.767.b:0 "We have to strike at Portland!"
 amcivwar.767.c:0 "We showed them!"
 amcivwar.767.d:0 "Traitors everywhere!"
 amcivwar.767.e:0 "To war!"

 amcivwar.768.t:0 "Trial of the New England General Staff"
 amcivwar.768.d:0 "With New England's rebellion against our rule crushed, we have secured the breakaway region that took refuge under the Canadian arm in 1937. Two prominent generals from the opposition were Leslie Groves and Mark Clark of New England. As they await their fate, many have begun to wonder if these men were simply forced into fighting against us by the Canadians who did not wish to see their chunk of America returned home. No evidence points to any egregious acts committed by either man in their defence of New England. Furthermore, both men promise to faithfully serve the flag of [ROOT.GetNameDef] if they can receive a formal pardon from our government."
 amcivwar.768.a:0 "Issue them a pardon"
 amcivwar.768.b:0 "They cannot be trusted"

### State Capture Events ###

 amcivwar.800.t:0 "The Occupation of [capture_state.GetName]"
 amcivwar.800.d_none:0 "Today [From.GetAdjective] forces captured the strategic home state of [capture_state.GetName]. Our soldiers and generals are concerned about the news, but we’re confident that we will still emerge victorious in the end."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_1:0 "Today [From.GetAdjective] forces captured the strategic home state of [capture_state.GetName]. Our soldiers and generals are concerned about the news, but we’re confident that we will still emerge victorious in the end."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_2:0 "Another piece of worrying news has come into [ROOT.Capital.GetName]: today [From.GetAdjective] forces captured [capture_state.GetName], the second state we have lost. Our troops are getting even more worried than before, but we are sure we can retake it, we just need more time."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_3:0 "We received news of the loss of a third strategic state today, as [From.GetAdjective] forces occupied [capture_state.GetName]. Our army’s morale is now low, as they begin to think the war is lost, and we need to move to retake the state before it’s too late."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_4:0 "[From.GetAdjective] forces today took [capture_state.GetName], and it seems the news is having an effect on our military. After this fourth blow, our army is beginning to experience desertions, but our own generals are still confident this war can be won. The civilian morale is still kept steady behind the lines, but at the front it’s hard to find supplies."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_5:0 "After the further loss of [capture_state.GetName] today, civilian morale is quickly sliding towards defeatism. Our troops, impacted by this, are refusing to advance into battle for what some are seeing as a lost cause, even though some generals see a way forward even yet."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_6:0 "We’re experiencing more desertions day after day now, especially after the loss of [capture_state.GetName]. There are rumours of discontent in our own general staff, draft dodging is the norm, and defeatism in the civilian population is widespread. Few think we can still win this war, and even the President is doubting the strength of his cause now."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_7:0 "Our ragged divisions are now completely unwilling or unable to leave their positions. Many are surrendering once the fighting reaches them, though the flood of desertions has been dammed by promises of extra rations for soldiers. However, the citizens still in our territory, many now starving, are now mostly refusing to work for our war effort, and our bullets and broken guns are not being replaced."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_8:0 "Our forces are collapsing, we’re experiencing massive desertions, our generals are surrendering, the population hates us, and we cannot win this war anymore. Without true divine intervention, we’re doomed, and our cause with us. We hope our conqueror can take better care of the American people than we could."
 amcivwar.800.a:0 "We shall return!"
 amcivwar.800.b:0 "A great victory!"

 amcivwar.801.t:0 "The Liberation of [capture_state.GetName]"
 amcivwar.801.d:0 "Today, our forces have liberated [capture_state.GetName] from the brutal occupation caused by enemy forces. People rejoiced as our forces liberated them, and our soldiers celebrated with them. Soon, this war will end, and with it the suffering the American people are experiencing."
 amcivwar.801.a:0 "We have returned."

 amcivwar.900.t:0 "Resistance Uprising in [revolt_state.GetName]"
 amcivwar.900.d:0 "Our government has clearly failed on restoring order in [revolt_state.GetName]. Partisans aligned with the traitors around us have launched an assault in the countryside, hoping to swing the war in their chosen side's favour once more."
 amcivwar.900.a:0 "Damn it."
