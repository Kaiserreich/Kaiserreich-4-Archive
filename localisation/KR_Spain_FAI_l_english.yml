SWF_oppress_opposition:0 "Crush the Revolution's Enemies"
SWF_oppress_opposition_desc:0 "The only way we will ever see permanent peace in Spain is to crush the opposition entirely. They have no place in the new order, and no strength with which to resist us."
SWF_reconcile_opposition:0 "Educate the Masses"

SWF_militia_focus:0 "Worker's Militias"
SWF_militia_focus_desc:0 "Our first order of business is to look to our army - to ensure that it consists of hard workers, those devoted to the new socialist order.

SWF_radio_focus:0 "Receptador del Pueblo"

SWF_military_focus:0 "Defending the Revolution"
SWF_military_focus_desc:0 "Our new regime sees threats from every corner of Europe and beyond. We must work quickly towards rebuilding and strengthening our revolutionary militias into a full and modern army."

SWF_join_french_war:0 "Join the French War Effort"
SWF_join_french_war_desc:0 "The Commune of France is engaged in a war which will determine the balance of the revolution here and across the world. We must offer our strength, no matter the cost."
