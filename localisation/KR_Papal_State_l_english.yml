Pius_XI_desc:0 "Pope Pius XI has been the pope since 1922, as well as the leader of the reborn Papal State. He is loved by Catholics both in and outside Italy."

### Focuses ###
PAP_conclave:0 "Call Papal Conclave"
PAP_conclave_desc:0 "With the death of Pius XI, a conclave will need to be called by the cardinals to select a replacement - a Pope who will determine our path for the years to come."
PAP_stephen_x:0 "Pope Stephen X"
PAP_stephen_x_desc:0 "Elia dalla Costa is a man most favoured by the people due to his charitable nature. However, he is not a man overly interested in politics, and his election will most likely result in the papacy giving way to the rule of the people."
PAP_help_poor:0 "Helping Those in Need"
PAP_help_poor_desc:0 "The poor of our country need to be fed, just as our Lord commands us to do. The new system of charity will make use of popular donations, allowing the government to invest its resources elsewhere."
PAP_displaced_families:0 "Help Displaced Families"
PAP_displaced_families_desc:0 "The collapse of Italy following the Weltkrieg and rise of syndicalism in the north caused many refugees to flee south, and even today along the border some seek shelter from syndicalist tyranny. Despite our duty to help we have largely neglected these refugees and left them in squalid conditions, something which the new Pope is determined to rectify."
PAP_call_people:0 "A Call to the People"
PAP_call_people_desc:0 "The thing about the poor and the common people is that they exist in multitudes. Fed, clothed, and provided the fire of inspiration which only God can provide, they can be marshalled to support the will of the Pope with a fervour unmatched by any mercenary."
PAP_john_xxiii:0 "Pope John XXIII"
PAP_john_xxiii_desc:0 "A socialist at heart, Achille Lienart would do his utmost to prevent another Weltkrieg by decreasing the political tension. Electing him could even mean limited friendship with the syndicalists, no matter how unpopular such a move would be among devoted anti-syndicalists."
PAP_welfare_programs:0 "Welfare Program"
PAP_welfare_programs_desc:0 "There needs to be no revolution to reach the necessary social changes. As times change, so shall our law."
PAP_trade_unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
PAP_trade_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions are the bedrocks of the modern social state. In our country, they should be completely Catholic, inspired by the Christian trade unions of Germany and Flanders-Wallonia. While doing so we can also begin to encourage the worker-priest missionary initiative, allowing the priesthood to take up work in factories and rediscover the working masses who have become disaffected with the Catholic Church."
PAP_economic_incentives:0 "Economic Incentives"
PAP_economic_incentives_desc:0 "With the unions empowered, we must mobilise the workers of the Papal State to expand our industry and make it the heart of our growing state. To begin this process we must assist our industry by creating artificial demand through public projects requiring industrially manufactured goods and materials."
PAP_eccalesiastical_matters:0 "Focus on Ecclesiastical Matters"
PAP_eccalesiastical_matters_desc:0 "As was to be expected the new Pope intends to restore democratic government to Rome, allowing him to focus on ecclesiastical matters. His legacy will be extending the rule of the Papal State to its people."
PAP_relinquish_temporal:0 "Relinquish Temporal Power"
PAP_relinquish_temporal_desc:0 "The last step in social reform is recognising that God's place is to guide, not to rule. True power belongs in the people, and a democratic state must be erected to look after their welfare."
PAP_peoples_rule:0 "The People's Rule"
PAP_peoples_rule_desc:0 "Some in the Curia and even among the ordinary priesthood remain opposed to the establishment of democracy in Rome, if we are to promote a stable system in the long-term we must seek to promote the new government and relinquishment of temporal power within the Church and clergy."
PAP_pius_xii:0 "Pope Pius XII"
PAP_pius_xii_desc:0 "Eugenio Pacelli is a man of peace and stability. His rule is perhaps sure to strengthen our country in many ways, making sure a mighty Italy walks the true path of God."
PAP_traditional_values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
PAP_traditional_values_desc:0 "A christian population is a loyal one. Focusing our propaganda on this fact may prove fruitful."
PAP_roman_patron:0 "Patron of Rome"
PAP_roman_patron_desc:0 "Let the government patronise some of the most promising artists and architects. They will not forget it, and neither will the people of Rome."
PAP_fight_corruption:0 "Fight Corruption"
PAP_fight_corruption_desc:0 "Pope Pius XII intends to issue a new encyclical, one aimed at corruption - both in the soul and within the government. It offers guidance to a nation struggling with finding its path."
PAP_julius_iv:0 "Pope Julius IV"
PAP_julius_iv_desc:0 "Alfredo Schuster is a man described by many as leaning too far right ideologically. He warns against the evils of radical socialism, and declares he is willing to take up arms to defend Christendom by any means necessary."
PAP_promote_order:0 "Promote Order"
PAP_promote_order_desc:0 "The new Catholic way of governance will ensure every man of every occupation will be represented accordingly, leading to a much more stable government."
PAP_call_faithful:0 "A Call to the Faithful"
PAP_call_faithful_desc:0 "The heart of Christianity itself is threatened by the godless syndicalists. With the enemy so close to the Holy See the faithful of Rome and the Papal Zouaves must fight with all their strength to ensure that the Lateran Palace remains untouched by our vile foes."
PAP_holy_war:0 "Holy War"
PAP_holy_war_desc:0 "The time has come for the Papal State to take on its role as the defender of God and virtue, and for the people to rise up to its service in an Eleventh Crusade against syndicalism."
PAP_temporal_power:0 "Reinforce Temporal Power"
PAP_temporal_power_desc:0 "The increasing secularisation of society means a lessening of the pope´s influence. However, there are ways by which we can reinforce his influence inside his own borders."
PAP_condemn_mobrule:0 "Condemn Mob Rule"
PAP_condemn_mobrule_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge of all things holy. It is unacceptable to let Catholics join syndicalist movements. The pope must publish an encyclical to make this clear."
PAP_strengthen_border:0 "Strengthen the Border"
PAP_strengthen_border_desc:0 "If an invasion comes, it will be by the evil syndicalists to the north. We must strengthen our border, fortify it to withstand the onslaught."
PAP_roman_senate:0 "The Senate of the Kingdom of Rome"
PAP_roman_senate_desc:0 "Now that the new Pope has chosen to delegate the administration of the Papal State to the people, we can bring back the Senatus Romanus for the first time in centuries with effective power to make sure the people's voice is heard"
PAP_general_election:0 "Call for General Elections"
PAP_general_election_desc:0 "Following the revival of the Roman Senate the next step to bringing democracy to Rome will be to call for a general election to elect a civilian government that will oversee the task of administrating and developing the revived Rome into a modern nation."
PAP_civilian_government:0 "Organising a Civilian Government"
PAP_civilian_government_desc:0 "With the transition from the temporal power of the Pope to democracy and civilian government complete we can now declare the end of the Papal State and the birth of the Kingdom of Rome, with the Pope reigning akin to a constitutional monarch."
PAP_black_monday:0 "Dealing with Black Monday"
PAP_black_monday_desc:0 "The entire nation has fallen into despair and unemployment with the collapse of the economy. Finding our way out will be a long road, though we are better off than some."
PAP_lazio_subsidies:0 "Subsidies in Lazio"
PAP_lazio_subsidies_desc:0 "The collapse of the Kingdom of Italy dealt a major blow to the economy of Lazio, and the industries that did survive have been dealt a harsh blow by the Black Monday crisis. If we are to maintain Lazio's industry and economy we must start with subsidies so that they may weather the crisis and expand in future."
PAP_revive_industry:0 "Reviving our Industry"
PAP_revive_industry_desc:0 "The industries hit hardest in Rome by the fall of Italy were those that depended on supplying the military, which was no longer needed after the war by the Papal State who saw themselves as protected by the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and saw no need for anything larger than an enlargened Palatine Guard. Now we must begin to revive our military industries so that we may field a modern army of our own."
PAP_aid_farmers:0 "Aid Farmers"
PAP_aid_farmers_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the farmers of the primarily agricultural Lazio hard due to a lack of sales from exports, and some farmers have even fallen into bankruptcy and forced to sell their farms. If we are to help both our people and economy we must begin to aid our farmers and save them from bankruptcy through subsidies and limiting production of agricultural products to create demand."
PAP_agricultural_incentives:0 "Agricultural Incentives"
PAP_agricultural_incentives_desc:0 "One way to further improve our agriculture and recover from the Black Monday crisis would be to reduce taxes on agricultural equipment and raise protectionist tariffs in order to encourage domestic farming over foreign goods and provide another source of revenue for the government."
PAP_economic_recovery:0 "Black Monday Recovery"
PAP_economic_recovery_desc:0 "The burst of industrial and agricultural development in our country has clearly been enough to spur the Papal State's recovery from the financial nightmare. Let us all celebrate!"
PAP_campaign_promises:0 "Fulfill Campaign Promises"
PAP_campaign_promises_desc:0 "We have promised much to the people of Rome during the former Papal government and the first elections. Now that we are in power we must begin to live up to our promises and build the Kingdom of Rome into a nation worthy of sharing the name of the greatest empire in history."
PAP_infrastructure_investment:0 "Infrastructure Investments"
PAP_infrastructure_investment_desc:0 "We must put people to work on expanding the country's infrastructure. The roads will be needed if there is to be more industry, and the labour is readily available."
PAP_military_railways:0 "Military Railways"
PAP_military_railways_desc:0 "A critical part of waging war that often gets overlooked is logistics. If we are to keep our armies well supplied in the coming war against the syndicalists up north we must ensure that our military railways are in top working order so that supplies and equipment may be delivered quickly to the front with few complications."
PAP_education_reform:0 "Educational Reform"
PAP_education_reform_desc:0 "We have so far neglected the need for a modern and highly efficient education system and the necessity of keeping the scientists well supported. Our new progressive reform will improve our situation in this area greatly."
PAP_university_grants:0 "Papal University Grants"
PAP_university_grants_desc:0 "We know of many bright minds in our universities, but unfortunately, they need more funding to continue their projects, which the Church is ready to provide. It is time to improve the qualities of our scientists."
PAP_expand_ports:0 "Expand Ports"
PAP_expand_ports_desc:0 "While the Papal State invested much into rebuilding the Pontifical Navy for a new age, the ports themselves and especially the shipbuilding industry were often neglected. With enough development, the docks of Rome shall become an ideal centre of shipping in the Mediterranean."
PAP_heavy_industry:0 "Attract Heavy Industry"
PAP_heavy_industry_desc:0 "For Rome to be an effective military power as it once was we will need to build artillery, vehicles and armour to assist our troops in battle against the larger and stronger armies of our enemies, as well as steel for building modern military equipment. To do this we will need to adjust our laws and spending to attract and encourage heavy industrial production."
PAP_airfield_expansion:0 "Military Airfield Expansion"
PAP_airfield_expansion_desc:0 "Our air force leaders have long been demanding additional funds. Our air bases do indeed need expansion."
PAP_roman_army:0 "Roman Army"
PAP_roman_army_desc:0 "Our former government, confident in the unlikelihood of a war and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, did not invest much in an army leaving the defence of the nation to only a small Palatine Honour Guard. With war seemingly becoming an inevitability it is essential that our army is fit to inherit the legacy of Rome and isn't reliant on Sicilian protection."
PAP_armed_citizenry:0 "Armed Citizenry"
PAP_armed_citizenry_desc:0 "If Rome is to protect its independence from the northerners or the exiled Savoyards its citizens must be prepared to resist any invading armies. Inspired by our Swiss Guards we can begin to implement a Swiss-style militia system, requiring our citizens to own a personal rifle and ammunition and to engage in periodical combat and marksmanship training so that our people can fight effectively when the time comes."
PAP_industry_captains:0 "Captains of Industry"
PAP_industry_captains_desc:0 "While the days of Rome being the world's greatest power are gone we must foster the Roman economy as much as possible. The greatest decider of economic strength in this era is industry, which the previous government under Pius XI viewed negatively and was reluctant to encourage. Now that Rome is under new governance we must undo these previous policies and ensure that Roman industry flourishes."
PAP_men_of_rome:0 "Men of Rome"
PAP_men_of_rome_desc:0 "Should our nation be invaded every man in Rome must be ready and determined to resist and drive out the invaders by any means necessary, using guerrilla warfare and their knowledge of the terrain to outwit and ambush the occupying forces."
PAP_legionary_spirit:0 "Legionary Spirit"
PAP_legionary_spirit_desc:0 "Through the discipline, organisation, persistence and motivation of the Roman Legions Rome emerged from an Italian city-state to become the world's greatest power and forever left a glorious mark on history. In these precarious times, we must revive this legendary discipline and make the legions of Rome internationally renowned once again."
PAP_army_reorganisation:0 "Army Reorganisation"
PAP_army_reorganisation_desc:0 "Ever since the re-establishment of the Papal State the defence of Rome was left purely up to the small Palatine Guard and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. With the new civilian government reforming the nation and army it is time to establish a professional army so that we may stand up for ourselves against the northerners."
PAP_latin_perimeter:0 "Latin Perimeter"
PAP_latin_perimeter_desc:0 "Our northern border lies exposed. It must be reinforced."
PAP_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
PAP_combined_arms_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to field a proper infantry army and fortified our borders for war with the North we should begin to fully modernise our army by researching motorised vehicles and tanks to assist our infantry in battle and encircle the enemy forces."
PAP_navy:0 "The Pontifical Navy"
PAP_navy_desc:0 "Despite our state's small size we have rebuilt the Pontifical Navy following independence from the Italians. However, our current fleet, including the former Italian battleship Roma, is becoming old and outdated, and will only be able to stall the enemy for a while should war break out. If we want to rule the seas as the Roman Empire did long ago we will need to continue building and modernising our navy."
PAP_in_being:0 "Fleet in being"
PAP_in_being_desc:0 "The Pontifical Navy must gallantly face the enemy's naval forces head on and claim the Mediterranean as our sea, as our ancestors did long ago."
PAP_trade_interdiction:0 "Trade Interdiction"
PAP_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "While we may have dominated the Mediterranean long ago our small state has no hopes of achieving such an ambition today. If our navy is to compete successfully against stronger opponents we must focus on hitting the enemy's trade."
PAP_roman_fleet:0 "A Roman Fleet"
PAP_roman_fleet_desc:0 "Long ago, we exercised the absolute control over the Mediterranean. It would be shameful if our ambitions were not to once again rule the area by large and powerful ships."
PAP_submarines:0 "Submarine Focus"
PAP_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines are an exceptionally powerful weapon. Relatively easy to build and deadly to even the biggest ships, they need to be focused on."
PAP_screens:0 "Cruiser Focus"
PAP_screens_desc:0 "Cruisers and Destroyers are useful in many ways and it is imperative to have a fleet to patrol our waters. They should be included in our navy."
PAP_air_force:0 "The Pontifical Air Force"
PAP_air_force_desc:0 "While we have built up a sizable navy by the standards of a small nation such as ours, we have not yet invested in an air force, giving our enemies a critical advantage over us. We must quickly rectify this if Rome is not to be destroyed from above in the event of war with the Socialist Republic of Italy."
PAP_defend_skies:0 "Defend the Skies of Rome"
PAP_defend_skies_desc:0 "Without air superiority, we can never make use of aircraft. Improving our fighters should be our top priority."
PAP_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
PAP_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers are seeing massive improvements all around the world. We must keep up and make use of them ourselves."
PAP_closeair_support:0 "CAS Focus"
PAP_closeair_support_desc:0 "Our land forces need proper air support to fight effectively. Our new CAS designs will help us achieve this."
PAP_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
PAP_naval_bombers_desc:0 "We can achieve a certain level of naval superiority without even using our ships. However, better bomber models will need to be developed."
PAP_radar:0 "Radar Focus"
PAP_radar_desc:0 "With the syndicalists having an industrial advantage over our small nation we must stay a step ahead if we are to defend ourselves in the air, the building of radars could help us achieve this advantage by allowing us to detect our enemy beforehand and react accordingly."
PAP_anti_air:0 "Anti-Air Defences"
PAP_anti_air_desc:0 "While we have begun to fortify our borders and have an effective navy to combat syndicalist invasions from the sea we have neglected our defences from the air. We cannot allow the precious works of art and history in Rome to be destroyed by syndicalist bombing raids."
PAP_reformed_power:0 "Reformed Temporal Power"
PAP_reformed_power_desc:0 "The Pope has established that his temporal power over the Papal State and its claimed territories offered to us by the Donation of Pepin and stolen by the Piedmontese in 1860 shall continue. To enforce this and quell dissent ultramontane groups have proposed that we establish the temporal power of the Pope as a dogma, divinely revealed by God himself."
PAP_faithful_arms:0 "Call to Arms for the Faithful"
PAP_faithful_arms_desc:0 "The Papacy has a history of using foreign soldiers to defend it, and with the Catholic nations of France and northern Italy under syndicalist rule there are many devout Catholics and war veterans with grudges against the Communards who will flock to our cause and help us bolster our forces for the coming fight."
PAP_palatine_guard:0 "Expand the Palatine Guard"
PAP_palatine_guard_desc:0 "The current Palatine Guard, while expanded since the years following the fall of Italy with the incorporation of the Swiss Guard, still remains far too small an army for our protection against the growing Syndicalist might. We must expand the Palatine Guard into reborn Zouaves if we are to be able to field a proper army against our enemies."
PAP_zouave_officers:0 "Zouave Officers"
PAP_zouave_officers_desc:0 "While we have received many Catholic volunteers willing to join our army, a majority are inexperienced exiles fleeing Syndicalist rule in the north of Italy and the French Commune. We will need to recruit some experienced Catholic officers to successfully train and lead our reformed Zouaves into battle."
PAP_zouave_mobilisation:0 "Zouave Mobilisation"
PAP_zouave_mobilisation_desc:0 "Now that war has broken out we must rally the Catholic world to our cause and encourage foreign volunteers to join the Zouaves and protect the Universal Church from Syndicalist desecration."
PAP_financial_aid:0 "Financial Aid"
PAP_financial_aid_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has severely affected our state and sent our national debt spiralling out of control, encouraging dangerous democratic and syndicalist sentiments and unrest among our people. If we are to maintain order and bring our economy back to normal we must seek financial aid from our longtime protector, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies."
PAP_budget_rebalancing:0 "Budget Rebalancing"
PAP_budget_rebalancing_desc:0 "With the effects of the crisis still affecting our state despite our attempts to get financial aid from the Sicilians we must enact austerity measures if we are to quickly recover from Black Monday, even if it is unpopular with our people in the short-term."
PAP_temporal_debt:0 "Ending Temporal Debt"
PAP_temporal_debt_desc:0 "Unfortunately our austerity measures while having a positive effect have not been yet completely eliminated our national debt or the economic repercussions of Black Monday. One radical idea to end the crisis would be to use Papal gold to repay those whom we are indebted to, which would be popular among the people but unpopular within the Church."
PAP_military_aid:0 "Military Aid"
PAP_military_aid_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has greatly emboldened the syndicalist powers, who see it as an opportunity to strike while other nations are weakened by the crisis. The chance of such an attack on our state is a major worry for many in the Curia, who have recommended reaching out to our protectors, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, for military aid in modernising our armies so as to defend the Holy See in such an event."
PAP_sicilian_advisors:0 "Sicilian Advisers"
PAP_sicilian_advisors_desc:0 "While we have recruited many foreign soldiers and officers into our military, we will need training from Sicilian military advisers if the strategy of our armies is to be modernised and effective."
PAP_technical_aides:0 "Technical Aides"
PAP_technical_aides_desc:0 "One other advantage we can gain from our close relationship with the Two Sicilies is to request the sending of some educated technical aides to Rome to bolster our technological capabilities with the aim of aiding both our nations in the fight against syndicalism."
PAP_joint_staff:0 "Joint Planning Staff"
PAP_joint_staff_desc:0 "The Papal State and the Kingdom of Two Sicilies share a common adversary in the Socialist Republic of Italy, if we are to be successful in defending ourselves and hopefully retaking the north of Italy we must stand together and coordinate our military efforts."
PAP_papal_gendarmerie:0 "Papal Gendarmerie"
PAP_papal_gendarmerie_desc:0 "The security of our borders is one matter, but we must also look to the enemies within. A new Papal gendarmerie must be created to combat chaos in the name of God. They will watch the people closely indeed."
PAP_renewed_impetus:0 "Renewed Impetus"
PAP_renewed_impetus_desc:0 "In the years following the defeat of the Syndicalist attempt to seize Rome, we became lax and idle, confident in Sicilian protection. Now that we have reformed our army and economy into one befitting a modern nation-state we must now begin to prepare our state for war with the Syndicalists."
PAP_igitur_qui:0 "Preparing for War"
PAP_igitur_qui_desc:0 "Dangerous times lie ahead of us. While we have been reluctant to industrialise, seeing it as resulting in less freedom for the individual and reducing a society of individuals to a mass-class society, we must nonetheless prepare our country for expanded military production if our army is to be supplied for a protracted war against the Syndicalists."
PAP_labor_omnia:0 "Labor Omnia Vincit"
PAP_labor_omnia_desc:0 "The marshlands in the Lazio region of central Italy have stood since the time of the Romans. A concerted effort to clear them will provide ample farmland, as well as work for many thousands of idle hands."
PAP_actiones_secundum:0 "Action Follows Belief"
PAP_actiones_secundum_desc:0 "We must be diligent in producing a holy arsenal for the protection of the Catholic faith."
PAP_contra_principia:0 "Crusade Against Syndicalism"
PAP_contra_principia_desc:0 "While we would prefer peace, against the great evil of syndicalism there can be no compromise. We have put off the inevitable for far too long. Our military is ready and prepared to defend the catholic faith and liberate the land from the godless syndicalists that have desecrated the north."
PAP_fortiter_in:0 "Resolute in Execution, Gentle in Manner"
PAP_fortiter_in_desc:0 "Socialist sympathies run deep in the liberated territories and as a result, we can expect the syndicalist remnants to fight on against us for many years. If our state is to avoid collapsing into instability and chaos we must take a light but firm approach so as to de-escalate the guerrilla conflict and make sure that we do not alienate the people whom we have fought to liberate from syndicalism."
PAP_caedite_eos:0 "Kill them all and let God sort them out"
PAP_caedite_eos_desc:0 "The territories we have reclaimed from the Italians are rife with supporters of socialism, who aid and abet the syndicalist guerrillas in their fight against our state. In order to swiftly and effectively restore order and maintain control, we must be ready to crush the insurgency by whatever means necessary, even if it requires an escalation of the conflict in the short-term."
PAP_experto_crede:0 "Experto Crede"
PAP_experto_crede_desc:0 "With radical and totalitarian socialist movements gaining power throughout the world, great faithful scientists are at risk of persecution. Let's make sure our state is the place they can and will emigrate into. To assist them, we can finish the late Pius XI's plan to open a Pontifical Academy of Scientists that was postponed indefinitely by his death."
PAP_per_aspera:0 "Through Difficulties to the Stars"
PAP_per_aspera_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has historically been a great patron of science despite the claims of the syndicalists and anti-clericalists that defame us with the lies of conflict thesis. Faith and reason are of mutual help to each other, and to overcome our current hardships we must adapt that reason and scientific mindset to military research."

### Events ###
papalstate.1.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Papal State!"
papalstate.1.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached us. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, our currency is losing value, industrial exports are shrinking, and our national debt is beginning to grow out of control..."
papalstate.1.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
papalstate.2.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin"
papalstate.2.d:0 "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing a weekly radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fermented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
papalstate.2.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"

papalstate.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
papalstate.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part, he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope, therefore, demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporativism is just beginning."
papalstate.3.a:0 "Excellent"
papalstate.4.t:0 "Donations from the Faithful"
papalstate.4.d:0 "With the very seat of God's church under threat from non-believers for the first time in centuries, donations have been pouring in from Catholics throughout the world."
papalstate.4.a:0 "Every bit counts"
papalstate.5.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
papalstate.5.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Romans and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
papalstate.5.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy"
papalstate.6.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes are Cleared"
papalstate.6.d:0 "The areas formerly known as the Pontine Marshes are now cleared, with factories and farms springing up throughout the area, further strengthening our small nation economically for the inevitable crusade against the depraved syndicalists."
papalstate.6.a:0 "A monumental achievement!"
papalstate.7.t:0 "Pius XI passes away"
papalstate.8.t:0 "The Successor to St. Peter"
papalstate.8.d:0 "The Holy See has finally come together to deliberate the election of a new Pope following Pius XI's death. In the end, they choose to..."
papalstate.8.a:0 "...elect the pious and popular Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli as Pius XII"
papalstate.8.b:0 "...elect the charitable Elia Cardinal dalla Costa as Stephen X"
papalstate.8.c:0 "...elect the socialist cardinal, Achille Liènart, as John XXIII"
papalstate.8.e:0 "...elect the hardline cardinal Alfredo Schuster as Julius IV"
papalstate.9.t:0 "The First Roman Elections"
papalstate.9.d:0 "With the Pope relinquishing his temporal power and the transition from Papal rule to democracy underway, free elections shall take place in Rome for the first time since the Roman Republic of 1849. The question is, which party shall come out victorious?"
papalstate.9.a:0 "Il Movimento Sociale Latino!"
papalstate.9.b:0 "L'Alleanza Cristiana Democratica!"
papalstate.10.t:0 "Refoundation of Rome"
papalstate.10.d:0 "Now that the transitionary process of the Papal State to democratic rule is complete, we can say farewell to the old symbols and celebrate the rebirth of the Roman nation after over a millennium!"
papalstate.10.a:0 "Rome rises from the ashes!"
papalstate.11.t:0 "Financial Aid from the Two Sicilies?"
papalstate.11.d:0 "While we have determined that the best way to get the Black Monday crisis under control is to seek a bailout from the Kingdom of Two Sicilies we must decide how much of our debt we shall ask them to take. If we were to ask them to take on all of our debts it would greatly improve our financial situation but would also give away much of our sovereignty to the Sicilians. If this proves unacceptable we could instead request that they take on only some of our debt, although should we do this we would have to enact measures ourselves to clear the remaining debt and economic damage."
papalstate.11.a:0 "Ask the Sicilians to take our whole debt."
papalstate.11.b:0 "Only ask them to take some of our debt."
papalstate.12.t:0 "The Papal State's Request"
papalstate.12.d:0 "The Papal State has been hit hard by Black Monday and in particular they are unable to handle their international debts. Despite our own economic troubles, they have requested that we take on all of their debts and while we have protected them ever since the collapse of Italy and accepting their request would give us far more control over their state, many question if our economy would be able to handle the stress."
papalstate.12.a:0 "Accept their request."
papalstate.12.b:0 "Take on some of their debts."
papalstate.12.c:0 "Refuse - our own nation must come first."
papalstate.13.t:0 "Two Sicilies accepts!"
papalstate.13.d:0 "The Sicilians have agreed to take on our debt! While we have given significant concessions and the Sicilian government now has far more influence over us, at least our debts have been cleared and our economy is running again."
papalstate.13.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.14.t:0 "Two Sicilies partially accepts"
papalstate.14.d:0 "Unfortunately the Sicilians were unwilling to take on our full debt due to their own economic problems following Black Monday, but they have still agreed to take part of it, helping to relieve the burden on ourselves even if we will have to take steps for our economy to fully recover."
papalstate.14.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
papalstate.15.t:0 "Two Sicilies refuses!"
papalstate.15.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have refused our generous request, claiming that their nation's economy comes first! This will make the road towards improving our state's economy more expensive than we had hoped."
papalstate.15.a:0 "How unfaithful."
papalstate.16.t:0 "The Papal State's Request"
papalstate.16.d:0 "The Papal State has been hit hard by Black Monday and in particular they are unable to handle their international debts. Despite our own economic troubles they have requested that we take on some of their debts and while we have protected ever since the collapse of Italy and our people are faithful to the Church and the Pope, many question if our economy would be able to handle the stress."
papalstate.16.a:0 "Accept their request."
papalstate.16.b:0 "Refuse - our own nation must come first."
papalstate.17.t:0 "Two Sicilies accepts!"
papalstate.17.d:0 "The Sicilians have agreed to take on some of our debts! Although we have not reached the light at the end of the tunnel yet, the elimination of some of our debts will lighten the load on our economy and make our recovery an easier task."
papalstate.17.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.18.t:0 "Military Aid for the Papal State?"
papalstate.18.d:0 "As international tensions grow and the possibility of a second Weltkrieg arises the Papal State has begun to see the need to rebuild its army in order to defend the Holy See from desecration by the vile syndicalists just across our border, and have reached out to us to aid them in modernising their forces. How shall we respond?"
papalstate.18.a:0 "Assist them as much as possible!"
papalstate.18.b:0 "We can spare them some help."
papalstate.18.c:0 "No need - we can protect them ourselves."
papalstate.19.t:0 "Two Sicilies accepts!"
papalstate.19.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have accepted our request and begun to aid us in modernising our military technology so that we may defend ourselves from the tyranny of syndicalism."
papalstate.19.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.20.t:0 "Two Sicilies supplies some aid"
papalstate.20.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have accepted our request and while they have not given us as much military aid as we had hoped what they have seen fit to give should hopefully assist us in modernising our army."
papalstate.20.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
papalstate.21.t:0 "Two Sicilies refuses!"
papalstate.21.d:0 "To our disappointment, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies have refused our request for military aid, claiming that doing so would be a waste of time and resources for their own nation and that the Sicilian army is capable of defending Rome themselves."
papalstate.21.a:0 "How foolish and arrogant."
papalstate.22.t:0 "Syndicalist Guerrilla Campaign"
papalstate.22.d:0 "While we have thwarted the syndicalists in their attempt to bring about a second Risorgimento and reclaimed the land stolen by Piedmont in 1860, it appears that our troubles have not ended there. Syndicalists in the liberated territories, refusing to recognise our rightful rule, have taken up arms against our government and are engaging in a campaign of guerrilla warfare against us!"
papalstate.22.a:0 "These subversives must be brought to justice!"
papalstate.23.t:0 "Syndicalist Riots"
papalstate.23.d:0 "Today many syndicalist sympathisers turned out for protests and demonstrations against our rule in the formerly Italian territories. The protests soon turned into rioting, causing much damage in acts of vandalism and injuring many."

papalstate.32.d:0 "After many long years of guerrilla warfare we have finally been successful in rooting out and destroying the syndicalist remnants still opposing our rule.

papalstate.38.t:0 "Effects of Black Monday end!"
papalstate.38.d:0 "While it was a hard and trying time for our nation and economy, the effects of the Black Monday crisis are at last at an end, and our country can begin to move on."

papalstate.39.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"
papalstate.39.d:0 "With the passing of Pius XI, the Cardinals of the Catholic Church have convened within the Sistine Chapel to elect the new Pope. They will remain in seclusion until a consesnus has been reached, and a new successor to St. Peter has been chosen by the electors."
papalstate.39.a:0 "Let us pray they choose wisely."
papalstate.40.t:0 "The State of the Papacy"
papalstate.40.d:0 "Following the collapse of Italy after the Weltkrieg, Rome became in danger of capture by the Socialist Republic of Italy, after it refused to recognize the new Italian Federation. The blurry battle lines of the civil war mostly spared Rome due to the local Austrian garrison, which, together with local right wing militas, crushed uprisings in Rome. The dehbilitated state had no armed forces loyal to it, however, and it had scarce chances at resisting any Syndicalist offensive. However, King Ferdinand III of the reborn Kingdom of Two Sicilies and now leader of the Italian Federation would not stand by while the centre of Catholicism fell to syndicalism, and led a counter-offensive to secure Rome, bringing the Papal State under Sicilian protection, receiving significant support from Austrian occupation garrisons and a few foreign volunteers, the reborn Zouave corps.\n\nAfter the war ended, the Papal state controlled only a small fraction of its nominal territory, and is in most respects a rump, puppet state. However, it's recognized as an independent state by the majority of nations in the world.\n\nIn the sphere of Curia politics, the fading health of Pius is in everyone's minds, and it remains to be seen who will succeed him should he pass in the coming years."
