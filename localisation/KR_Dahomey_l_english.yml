#Focuses
DAH_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
DAH_our_own_desc:0 "Mittelafrika has collapsed, likely forever. From the ashes many nations have arisen, including Dahomey. We are a new nation, weak and fragile. Thus we have decided to align with our old colonial masters in Algeria for protection.\nTogether we shall build a brighter future!"

DAH_topke:0 "Expand the Topke System."
DAH_topke_desc:0 "Most of our population lives in the countryside, and thus we must use special patrols to collect taxes: the Topke system. Expanding these patrols will generate more revenue for our young state."

DAH_stand_our_own_desc:0 "As we continue to develop our economy and build up our national might, we will be better able to defend our freedom and soverignty from any and all who might seek to destroy us."
DAH_expand_toll:0 "Expanding the Toll Systems"
DAH_expand_toll_desc:0 "Part of our income came from various tolls.\nIf we fix up the various roads left behind by the old German administration, we can then place more tolls on them and generate revenue even on the most remote roads."
DAH_french_exports:0 "Utilize French Expertise"
DAH_french_exports_desc:0 "The French, even when exiled to Africa, have more knowledge in the fields of science, production and warfare than we could ever gain on our own.\nBy drawing even closer to France we can utilize their expertise and become one of the most advanced nations in Africa."
DAH_exploit_nature:0 "Exploiting Our Natural Resources"
DAH_exploit_nature_desc:0 "Nature holds many treasures, especially deep below ground. Our mines can and should be improved in order to better exploit the riches that can be found within."
DAH_exploit_more:0 "Further Resource Exploitation"
DAH_exploit_more_desc:0 "Dahomey's mines have provided much wealth, but we can dig deeper, and find even more.\nIn a similar vein, our plantations can be better funded, better directed, and better equipped to provide a grander harvest."

DAH_navy_desc:0 "Dahomey's ports fell into disrepair under the Germans in favour of more lucrative ventures.\nWe should take the time to repair and redevelop the ports, and from there build a proper navy."

DAH_naval_doctrine:0 "Dahomey Takes To The Sea"

DAH_our_men:0 "The State Of Our Army"
DAH_our_men_desc:0 "Dahomey's freedom is only secure so long as we have the men and the guns to defend it.\nLet us call up volunteers, and if need be a draft, in order to build a new army to defend our people."

DAH_leader_lead:0 "King and General"

DAH_importing_arms:0 "Import Foreign Arms"

DAH_agaja:0 "Reinstating Agaja's Dowry"
DAH_agaja_desc:0 "Men who are not motivated by national pride to join the army can instead be motivated by pay. King Agaja understood this, and once instated a dowry for soldiers who joined his army. We can revive the concept, and reinstate the dowry to bring more recruits to their posts."
DAH_amazons:0 "Dahomey's Amazons"

DAH_french_relations:0 "Appeal to the French"
DAH_french_relations_desc:0 "Before the Weltkrieg, Dahomey was a part of the larger French empire in Africa.\nWe are once again part of that empire, but not all remember it fondly. We must find new ways to appeal to the French while also keeping out citizens happy."
DAH_baguette_lover:0 "Deepen Protectorate Ties"
DAH_baguette_lover_desc:0 "The world is a big place, with powers far greater than us trying to toy with our land. Seeking closer ties with our overlord might safe guard our nation more effectively than we could alone."

DAH_status_quo:0 "The Status Quo"

DAH_normal_person:0 "A Balanced Posture"
DAH_normal_person_desc:0 "While the French aren't... evil... overlords... There is nothing wrong with reducing their influence, and moving towards being a truly free nation."

#Events
dah.001.t:0 "French Expertise"
dah.001.d:0 "The French hold much knowledge of state building, even in their exiled state. Perhaps we should ask them to share some of this knowledge, so that we may become a stronger ally?" #Oh Great Frenchie of The Lake, what is your wisdom?
dah.001.a:0 "Seek aid in agricultural development"
dah.001.b:0 "Ask for their expertise in construction and engineering."

dah.002.t:0 "Buying Foreign Guns"
dah.002.d:0 "Our military is young, and lacks much of the basic equipment that an army needs, guns especially. One way we could make up for this deficiency is to ask one of the major powers (except those blasted Germans) to sell us some guns. Should we go ahead with this?"
dah.002.a:0 "Let us shop around."
dah.005.t:0 "Our Place In The Wider World"
dah.005.d:0 "Before the days of African colonization, we were a free and self-sufficient people. No one could keep us from being strong, proud, and free. Nowadays though, the world is a much bigger place, with many actors far larger than us. We are thus forced to consider our place in the world. Will we become a subject of France once more? Or perhaps we should go free, and take our chances there? Or do we sit back and allow events to develop before making this choice?"
dah.005.a:0 "Time will tell. Sooner or later, time will tell."
dah.006.t:0 "Dahomey wants to purchase Guns"
dah.006.d:0 "The recently independent nation of Dahomey wants to purchase firearms from us to supply their nascent military. How shall we respond?"
