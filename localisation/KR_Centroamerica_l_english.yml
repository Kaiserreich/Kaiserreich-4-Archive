### Events ###
cend.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sends an Embassy"

cend.1.d.GUA_socialist:0 "With the success of the socialist-Unity coalition, we have managed to escape the grasps of both Ubico and Orellana against all odds.

cend.1.d.ELS_socialist:0 "With the success of Martí in the revolution against the corrupt military dictatorship, he has managed to gain full control over El Salvador and truly free the people. This has been noticed by the fellow revolutionary country of [From.GetNameDefCap], hoping to build ties with us to free the rest of Central America from what we also suffered from. Hopefully this can mean closer cooperation between our nations into the future."
cend.1.d.ELS_liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] have sent a delegation to establish closer ties, following our restoration of the presidency.

cend.1.d.HON_liberal:0 "After successfully holding our first truly open elections, our democratic friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to establish closer ties.

cend.1.d.NIC_socialist:0 "As we have managed to survive through the storm of American occupation and Central American crisis, we are a highly desired ally among revolutionaries within Central America. [From.GetNameDefCap] has recognized this, sending us an embassy to ensure further cooperation between our nations."
cend.1.d.NIC_liberal:0 "Following our liberal transformation, [From.GetNameDefCap] has approached us to congratulate us on our achievement and with the offer of developing closer ties.

cend.1.a:0 "Socialist unity comes out strong."
cend.1.b:0 "In times of trouble, we come together."
cend.1.c:0 "Together, we stand against the revolution."

cend.5.t:0 "Formation of the Revolutionary Front"
cend.5.d.socialist:0 "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organize the men of Central America against those who would oppress them. The liberals who have betrayed us so many times in the past, the military dictators who have hurt us, and the foreign oppressors who support them. It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"

It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
cend.5.d.military:0 "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organize the men of Central America against those who would oppress them.

It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
cend.5.a:0 "A chance for socialism..."
cend.5.b:0 "A new threat emerges."
cend.5.c:0 "A threat to our existence!"

cend.6.t:0 "Formation of the Liberal Pact"
cend.6.d.socialist:0 "A 'Liberal' Pact has been founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]!

Furthermore, they claim that the Pact will be a bastion against socialist revolutionaries. We must prevent them from endangering our revolution!"
cend.6.d.liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! it is designed to bring together the liberal countries of Central America to resist the evil growth of military dictatorships and socialist revolutionaries. Those who join it will defend each other and make sure that its members remain democratic."
cend.6.d.military:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! They aim to bring together what they call the liberal nations of Central America.

cend.6.c:0 "You can't beat military democracy!"

cend.7.t:0 "Formation of the People's Vanguard"
cend.7.d.socialist:0 "The crooked dictatorship of [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. They seek to insulate themselves from revolution by working together with other dictatorships! We will not allow this. We must prevent their coalition from taking shape and we must work hard to prevent them from ending the revolution in Central America. If they get what they want, all our work may be for nothing!"
cend.7.d.liberal:0 "Because robbing their own people of their freedom is not enough, [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. It is aimed to protect themselves from any outside challenge to their rule. We know that such an illiberal pact will soon fail, but we must make sure they do not permanently smother the torch of liberty in the rest of Central America. We must do everything we can to prevent them from attacking our democracy!"
cend.7.d.military:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the People's Vanguard! Just like us, they prefer a stronger type of government and for that reason, there are many who are jealous and seek to topple our governments. They seek to end this by working together to defend Central America from the rising tide of revolution."

cend.8.d.liberal:0 "Our work has not been for nothing, as [From.GetNameDefCap] has joined the Liberal Pact! Together we will be stronger than alone and together we will be able to defend our shared values and our democracy. Together we can protect what is ours from the military dictators and socialist revolutionaries who wish to take it from us."
cend.8.d.military:0 "Our friends in [From.GetNameDefCap] have joined the People's Vanguard. We no longer stand alone in our struggle to contain the revolution in Central America. We will work together with them to prevent any kind of spark from threatening the stability of our rule. Together, we will be even stronger as the liberals and socialists are isolated."
cend.8.a:0 "Together for victory!"
cend.8.b:0 "The torch of liberty stands strong."
cend.8.c:0 "The status-quo will be retained."

cend.9.b:0 "[CEN_petition_refuse_option]"

cend.9.d.socialist:0 "We have been petitioned to join the Revolutionary Front, the pact founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]!

If we are united in this pact, we now we have to decide whether or not their struggle is also ours."

CEN_petition_refuse_liberal:0 "Liberty belongs in one country, not many."

cend.9.d.military:0 "We have been petitioned by [From.GetNameDefCap] to join the People's Vanguard. They state that in this violent era, no regime is safe and that only by working together to safeguard stability can we efficiently resist the rising tide of liberalism and socialism. They say that without cooperation, the countries of Central America will one by one fall to revolution. We must decide whether it is worth it to join their cause."

CEN_petition_refuse_military:0 "We can stand on our own."

Not only are our forces united and will we be better prepared to wage war on our enemies, but our spirits are united as well, something which will undoubtedly help advance the revolutionary mindset of our country! Hail to our new brothers and sisters!"
cend.10.d.liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join the Liberal Pact. They have made an excellent decision, as together we can create a lasting impact on our corner of the world and safeguard democracy for generations to come! United, we will make sure that the torch of liberty will not be extinguished. We will protect them and they will protect us."

We fight for the people, more than the revolutionaries ever will. With the help of [From.GetNameDefCap], we will keep the revolution at aby."
cend.10.a:0 "Together for victory!"
cend.10.b:0 "We'll come out on top."

cend.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
cend.11.d.socialist:0 "The cowards of [From.GetNameDefCap] have denied our petition. Instead of joining our forces in order to empower the revolution, they have decided to deny us and go their own path, thus betraying our revolution. But our spirits are strong and even without the help of our fellow Central Americans, we can take a stand against our oppressors. We will not let their refusal to cooperate affect us."
cend.11.d.liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our petition! This is unfortunate, as we cannot be sure that freedom will remain in their country. They are vulnerable to the opportunists of this world and we do not have their support in our own struggles to come. But we are not weak, we have the power to protect ourselves, even without them and we will not forget our goals of preserving and spreading democracy!"
