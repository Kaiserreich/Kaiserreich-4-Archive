### Decisions ###

 china_join_the_internationale_decision: "Join the Internationale"
 china_join_the_internationale_decision_desc: "When the German invasion collapsed the First Northern Expedition, many Kuomintang exiles sought refuge in the nations of the Third Internationale. Now with our strength revived and reinvigorated, it is only natural that we will be able to play a role in assisting the Third Internationale in spreading the world revolution as well as paying back our socialist comrades for their help over the years."

 china_join_the_reichspakt_decision: "Join the Reichspakt"
 china_join_the_reichspakt_decision_desc: "Germany has been our main benefactor since the KMT's doomed Northern Expedition. Now that we have cleared all opposition to our rule over China, it's is time to request a formal alliance with our friends in Berlin."

 chinese_unification: "Chinese Unification"
 chinese_unification_desc: "Central authority in China has long eroded, as decades of foreign imperialism, political instability and domestic unrest in light of imperial weakness spawned a new class of regional militarists in the ailing days of the old Qing Empire. The Xinhai revolution brought further turmoil to the nation, as revolutionary generals seized control of numerous provinces and set about building complex networks of military officers, allied businessmen, landed gentry, sympathetic intelligentsia, and government officials.\n\nNevertheless, a common national identity remains, and various movements across the land have made their bid to unite the nation and rebuild China in their image. Taking advantage of their own patronage networks, foreign support, and growing armies, they clash for influence in the cities and countryside. Still, in the twisting and turning realities of warlord China, open warfare is not the only this conflict develops. Tales of shifting alliances and sordid betrayal unfold, all the while foreign invasion looms..."

 china_create_united_front: "Create the United Front"
 china_create_united_front_desc: "We, the descendants of Yan and Huang, cannot sit idly by as our country is powerless to stop the foreign devil from ravaging our lands. Too long have we been divided, split alongside provincial and factional lines while the imperialists look hungrily at our borders - ready to exploit our nation. No more! Let us put aside our petty squabbles for national unity to defend our honour, the honour of Zhonghua, from being tarnished forever! Qilai!"

 china_join_united_front: "Join the United Front"
 china_join_united_front_desc: "As the foreign imperialists launch a brutal invasion of our country, [FROM.GetName] has invited us to help defend China's honour in her hour of need. While our country still remains heavily divided between provincial and factional lines, our civilisation is at risk of being utterly destroyed. Let us put aside our differences and work together for the defence of the Motherland!"

 china_offer_ceasefire: "Negotiate a Ceasefire with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_offer_ceasefire_desc: "China has found itself at war with a major power. Fighting them on our own would be a foolish decision while China is still divided. We should negotiate with our current enemies in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] a temporary truce till the aggressor has been defeated. We must not forget that all the imperialists want are our riches. We have nothing to lose! Wansui!"

 china_declare_government_SHX: "Proclaim the Zhongyuan Government"
 china_declare_government_SHX_desc: "With our position in the North Chinese Plain secured, we may now boldly claim for ourselves the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Our new government shall now strive for national unification, vanquishing any rival contenders that may stand in our way. No one, except perhaps [SHX.GetLeader] in all his wisdom, could have expected the province of Shanxi to find itself in such power. But through our courage and valiance in liberating the Central Plains, we have proven ourselves worthy of leading the national unification!"

 china_declare_government_SQI_national_populist: "Declare the New Qing Empire"
 china_declare_government_SQI_national_populist_desc: "The fierce battle for the Forbidden City was pressed on Zhang Tianran's orders. The palace gates became a prison for the cowardly Aisin-Gioro family. Several family members attempted to leave but were led back, and the walls manned by Red Spears at all corners. Finally, the Emperor surrendered to the Shangqing. Instead of death, Puyi was forced to capitulate to Zhang Tianran in his Imperial Yellow Jacket, as well as reaffirm to the people his emperorship. Puyi will remain the Emperor, and the Shangqing Tianguo's minor emperors, managers and priests the official magistrates of the Qing Empire.\n\nZhang Tianran has absolved the captive Emperor of any guilt in this war, and declared that this victory is the culmination of a spiritual genealogy that began with the Boxers and Sun Yat-sen."

 china_declare_government_other: "Form a National Government"
 china_declare_government_other_desc: "Having secured our place as the strongest force in China, it is time that we declare our ambitions to unify the nation and end this miserable age of strife once and for all. It may attract some unwanted attention, and there will likely be conflict instigated by those who would seek to their own dominance over the land, but that is the sacrifice we must make to free our nation from warlordism once and for all!"

 china_declare_unification: "Declare the Reunification of China"
 china_declare_unification_desc: "Our foes have been vanquished and anyone who dared to unjustly claim the mantle of national leadership has been put back in their place. We stand now as rulers of a mostly united China, all that is left to do is to formally claim our right to national leadership. We are the victors of the Warlord Era for better or for worse, and it is up to us to lead China into its benevolent future."
 china_united: "China has been fully united under one banner."

 china_move_capital: "Declare a Permanent Capital"
 china_move_capital_desc: "There have been many capitals of a united Chinese state and with key parts of China under our rule, we can proclaim a permanent capital for the republic. There are four main choices to go with should we control that city: Nanjing, Beijing, Wuhan or Guangzhou. Each one brings unique advantages. We must consider this carefully as this decision will be irreversible."

 china_attack_decision: "Attack [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_attack_decision_desc: "The continued defiance of [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership is one that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. [FROM.GetLeader] has proven [FROM.GetLeader.GetHerselfHimself] an unworthy leader, and will be ejected from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] by force."
 china_demand_submission: "Demand [FROM.GetNameDef]'s Submission"
 china_demand_submission_desc: "Regional authorities in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] find themselves adrift as of late, swearing allegiance to nobody but themselves. As China's truly legitimate government, we must bring them into the fold - they will either accept or we will prepare other, less courteous measures."
 china_integrate_subjects: "Increase Integration of [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_integrate_subjects_desc: "Although the leadership in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has thankfully seen wisdom and decided to align themselves with us, we must go further if we are to truly end the warlord era. Efforts will be made to bring the [FROM.GetAdjective] administration closer to our own."

 china_integration_timer: "[ROOT.overlord.GetNameDef] Increases Integration"

 china_demand_annexation: "Demand [FROM.GetNameDef]'s Annexation"
 china_demand_annexation_desc: "With our own magistrates already embedded within [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and within [FROM.GetAdjective]'s ranks, all that is left to do is secure the final submission of [FROM.GetLeader] to our cause. Their autonomy, which exists now effectively only on paper, shall be brought to an end."
 china_offer_alliance: "Offer an Alliance with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_offer_alliance_desc: "Cast adrift by the changing circumstances in China, our allies in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have nonetheless managed to prevail in face of the shifting winds of the nation. Given their alignment towards us, we shall begin negotiations to join forces together and bring about our shared vision for the future."
 china_negotiate_with_legation_cities: "Negotiate with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_negotiate_with_legation_cities_desc: "The Legation Cities, carved out of China's coast by ravenous foreign powers, is an institution that highlighted the unequal treatment of our proud nation by various imperialists. Having finally brought unity to the interior and ended the instability plaguing it, the Legations no longer serve a purpose in the world. We shall move to end this sad chapter in Chinese history."
 china_request_return_of_concessions: "Request the Return of the [FROM.GetAdjective] Concessions"
 china_request_return_of_concessions_desc: "The concessions were initially small pieces of land lease out to foreign powers in our weakness, which only expanded in scope as colonial powers sought to bring low our people. Having finally united the nation, we can bring to bear the united might of China and formally challenge the imperialists who desperately cling onto their unjust possessions."
 china_seize_concessions: "Seize the [FROM.GetAdjective] Concessions"
 china_seize_concessions_desc: "With negotiations having failed, there leaves no other choice but the sword if we are to liberate our coastal citizens from foreign rule. Already our forces have begun amassing along the outskirts, ready to ensure the return of these cities to their rightful owner."

 #Reusable loc
 #CHI_alignment_integration_category: "Chinese Autonomous Region Integrations"
 #CHI_alignment_integration_category_desc: "Our victory in the North of China has allowed us to centralise our nation into one cohesive government however, some of the provinces of China are ruled by autonomous governors which should be brought more directly under our control..."
 #CHI_dec_integrate_YUN: "The South West of China has long been isolated from politics, it is time they are represented once more."
 #CHI_dec_integrate_SZC: "Sichuan is one of the most populated regions in China so it is our duty to reintegrate the Sichuan Basin back into our full control."
 #CHI_dec_integrate_SHX: "Shanxi had for a long time been known as the neutral clique due to its unwillingness to get involved in other conflicts, with the mountains under our zone of influence we must bring the model province out of neutrality."
 #CHI_dec_integrate_XSM: "The Ma Clique is the key to the north-west and thus it is only natural they should be reincorporated into our government."
 #CHI_dec_integrate_SIK: "The Xinjiang area is the wild frontier of China, when the Qing were in charge they had little interaction with the far west. We will rectify this mistake and prevent another large war from erupting in the province."
 #CHI_dec_integrate_FNG: "The North-east is now pacified and the autonomous government set up there has now outlived its usefulness. We should begin reintegration immediately and secure our frontier against the Russian Far East."
 #QIE_negotiate_with_LEC_desc: "The Legation Cities' leadership has signalled some degree of openness in peaceful integration with our regime. There is certain to be much negotiation involved, but this will make our government's claim to the territory look far more legitimate than an outright invasion would."
 #QIE_attack_entente_LEC_desc: "The Legations have fallen under the sway of Canada and the rest of the hated Entente. This losers club is no match for our new military, and a by mobilising our troops on the outskirts of the Legation boundaries we should be able to scare them into ceding the cities back to us!"
 #QIE_attack_non_aligned_LEC_desc: "The Legations international backers have left them alone. Now is our moment to strike!"
 #QIE_attack_GER_LEC_desc: "With Germany distracted in its war, we have a perfect moment to strike at the Legations. Let us attack while they are distracted, and seize them for ourselves!"
 #QIE_attack_entente_HK_desc: "The [AST.GetName] seize control over Hong Kong during the chaos of the last few years, and have been ruling it directly ever since. This last vestigial remnant of British imperialism must be crushed!"
 #china_seize_concessions_desc: "While we signed over the islands of Macau to Portugal centuries ago, our new power, combined with their current conflicts, makes launching a surprise attack on the territory an inviting prospect. Portugal refused to cede the area to the Legation Cities, and with their current conflict few expect them to put up any more than a token resistance."
 #QIE_negotiate_ger_treaty_ports_desc: "The treaty ports of Qingdao, Wehawei, and Zhanjiang are integral parts of China, though they are currently held by Germany on a 99-year lease. We can offer them some cash to accelerate this timeline, however."
 #QIE_threaten_ger_treaty_ports_desc: "[GEA.GetName] currently holds a several treaty ports on a 99-year lease. Instead of waiting for decades, let's exploit their distraction in their war and mobilise troops on the border! They won't dare fight over a couple of ports, right?"
 #CHI_seize_macau: "Demand Portugal Return Macau"
 #CHI_seize_macau_desc: "Macau has been owned by Portugal since 1557 on a lease basis although the Portuguese certainly took advantage of our weakness during the Century of Humiliation by annexing Taipa and Coloane.

 #CHI_threaten_ger_treaty_ports: "Demand the Germans Withdraw from China"
 #CHI_threaten_ger_treaty_ports_desc: "Too long have we suffered under Germany's humiliation, from the failure of the first Northern Expedition to their restoration of the despicable Qing monarchy.

### Army Reform
 china_army_decisions: "Army Reform"
 china_army_decisions_desc: "Chinese armies have long struggled to catch up to Western standards. Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines.\n"

 china_army_reform: "Army Reform"
 china_army_reform_desc: "Formed by the needs of the waning days of the old Qing Empire and moulded by the experiences of the Warlord Era, warlord armies are almost feudal in nature, organised by bands of regional strongmen. Our army has been frequently criticised for its low quality, with some officers accused of being incompetent at everything but enriching themselves. We must strive for more than this, especially if we wish to stand for anything greater."
 china_lessons_of_war: "Lessons of War"
 china_lessons_of_war_desc: "The lessons of war have taught us considerably in the ways of modern conflict. With renewed ambition, we must pursue major structural reforms to bring our forces up to date, building a force that can stand the test of time."

 china_poor_officers_fixed_text: "Desertion has declined thanks to a mix of pay increases, better morale, and greater competence across the board. Ghost soldiers are being slowly eliminated from army rosters, though considerably more reforms are required to fully eliminate the issue. With officers promoted by merit rather than patronage or nepotism, a coordinated and effective command structure can emerge its place."
 china_poor_army_3_officers: "Warlord Era Inadequacies"
 china_poor_army_3_officers_desc: "Despite various claims, there has never really been a \"Chinese Army\". Instead, the military is decentralised, highly factional, and irregular, having grown haphazardly over decades of conflict. Most significant forces are regional, oversized, poorly maintained, and distrustful of one another, if not outright hostile. Corruption is endemic. Where logistics exist, most are simple coolie or mule trains complemented by regular robbery of the surrounding countryside. Though a few units appear to meet western standards, the vast majority do not, and better resemble gangs of bandits and other criminals. Even in peacetime, mere word of an approaching army is often enough for local peasants to flee the oncoming wave of looting and abuse."

 china_poor_army_2_officers: "Systemic Military Shortcomings"
 china_poor_army_2_officers_desc: "The first steps toward systematic military reform are underway, beginning to sweep aside the corruption and many inadequacies plaguing what will one day be a true Chinese army. A centralised bureaucracy and coordinated logistics are the first step on such a journey, and will build the foundation for future reforms. A more reliable system of supply and payment is already being established, ensuring better retention of troops, reducing incentives to loot, and building trust with local populations. For now, the system remains vulnerable to theft and embezzlement, but you can't make Danhuatang without breaking some eggs."

 china_poor_army_1_officers: "Military Reforms in Progress"
 china_poor_army_1_officers_desc: "Army reform continues steadily, though not always at an even pace. The difficult task of breaking up localised units and wider patronage networks has begun, albeit with considerable resistance both open and subversive. New officers without such extensive connections, hoped to be more competent and less overtly corrupt, have been assigned as the command roster begins to shift. Training and requisition too are being reformed, though some elements are resistant to these changes, seeing them as too far and too fast. Although unit quality can vary, the baseline has been lifted far above the old \"Murder of Crows\" that they were formerly dismissed as."

 china_poor_army_0_desc: "The army has come a long way since its chaotic and dishevelled state mere years ago. Thanks to a great deal of effort, and experience earned from successes in the battlefield, its core units stand on the cusp of modernity; their battlefield prowess more attributable to equipment and specialisation than outright neglect.\n\n$china_poor_officers_fixed_text$\n\nThe same cannot be said for the entire force, nor allied and integrated units in particular, but the path is now clear to building a new, modern, and unified army to defend Chinese interests."

 china_green_forest_school_desc: "§LSome of China's warlords have no military schooling whatsoever and instead refer to themselves as having attended the 'university of the green forest'. Yet, for all their shortcomings, these former (and sometimes active) bandits bring a unique approach to warfare, able to remain flexible and resilient in even the most trying circumstances.

 #Generic Description, use scripted loc for tag specific descs
 china_land_reform_decisions_desc: "Although our government has done considerable work in improving the plight of the Chinese people, the reality is that the Warlord Era has done considerable damage to many parts of the country and stunted growth in others. Some of the worst affected regions are rural in nature, having seen little benefits of the industrialisation China has painfully undergone over the last few decades. After years of domestic turmoil and governmental neglect, many continue to suffer under the yoke of unfair tenantry laws, inadequate equipment, out-of-date techniques, various predatory entities, and natural disasters.\n\nWith our battlefield victories now won, it is up to us to face the next front in China's reconstruction and make those triumphs count. It is time that we make our mark on China's countryside, and alleviate the suffering of our people."

 china_generic_land_reform_decision_desc: "There have been many thinkers and theorists who have posed potential solutions to the decades-long issues festering in the Chinese countryside. Having successfully united the nation under one banner, we have the sufficient resources and stability to implement a comprehensive plan to solve these problems. All that is needed now is the political will to carry out such an effort on a large scale."

### Misc Events

 lepwar.1.t: "Our Men Defect!"
 lepwar.1.desc: "Day by day, our morale collapses. We have no victories to show, no glory to held, and have been sent into a spiral of death from which we may not return. Close confidants of [THIS.GetLeader] have urged him to flee to safety, but while he refuses and holds on to faith in victory, our soldiers have already begun to melt away..."

 lepwar.3.desc.good: "When a man believes that victory is close at hand, he will fight harder and better, it is often said. Whether or not this is true, recent battlefield success have done well to boost morale, having a positive effect on the war effort."
 lepwar.3.desc.bad: "A string of mistakes, setbacks, and plain bad luck have meant that our forces have been unable to meet their objectives. We are failing to make significant gain, and as the war drags on, more men begin to question our cause, leaving the army to return home or become bandits."
 lepwar.3.a: "Well done..."
 lepwar.3.b: "Terrible..."

 lepwar.4.t.good: "Enemy Stockpile Captured"
 lepwar.4.t.bad: "Equipment Losses"
 lepwar.4.desc.good: "With recent victories on the battlefield, our men have recently captured a supply depot full of enemy weapons! Though retreating forces had tried to leave nothing for us, the speed of our advance caught them off guard."
 lepwar.4.desc.bad: "With a series of defeats on the battlefield, morale has sunk to a new low. While retreating from advancing enemy forces, a group of soldiers sent to bring supplies further towards the capital instead deserted and took the supplies with them. This represents both a breakdown in general discipline and a heavy loss for our logistics situation."
 lepwar.4.a.good: "Excellent!"

 lepwar.5.t.good: "[THIS.GetLeader] Praised"
 lepwar.5.t.bad: "[THIS.GetLeader] Attacked"
 lepwar.5.desc.good: "Recent advances in the war have done well to strengthen [THIS.GetLeader]'s position. Members of the government once critical of his rule have begun to fall silent, while supporting voices have grown louder. If this trend continues, the war will see a swift conclusion."
 lepwar.5.desc.bad: "Recent setbacks in the war have brought increasing criticism upon [THIS.GetLeader]'s leadership. Voices opposed to his rule have grown louder, with rumours of plots to remove him circulating, while promised victories seem to be slipping further and further away. If this trend continues, [THIS.GetNameDef] may collapse along internal divisions long before an enemy army takes [THIS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 lepwar.5.a: "It's only right"
 lepwar.5.b: "Can't they just shut up?"

 lepwar.6.t: "Defectors from Anqing"
 lepwar.6.desc: "It seems that with the collapse of the Anqing Clique, a number of warlords, generals, and petty despots tainted by Chen Tiaoyuan's association with the Japanese have chosen to place their bet on [SQI.GetLeader] rather than risk retribution from the Kuomintang. Their skills will surely prove an asset to us."
 lepwar.6.a: "Welcome!"

 lepwar.7.t: "Fallout of Chen Yi's Treachery"
 lepwar.7.d: "Governor Chen Yi's defection to Anqing has been met with considerable scorn and apprehension within the fraying ranks of the Nanjing clique. The former banker, commander, and governor had established a powerful patronage network in Zhejiang and a considerable numbers of troops and officers have defected with him. Communications with the area has been severed and critical intelligence lost in this latest blow to the southern Zhili. Not every officer from Zhejiang has joined Chen however.\n\nOne of the few bright spots in these trying times has been the heroic retreat of Tang Enbo, a long-time staff officer and student of Chen Yi. Despite his studies in Japan and local connections, the young officer has chosen to remain loyal to Nanjing. With extensive experience pacifying the south against Kuomintang guerillas, he was able to mitigate some of the damage done by Chen Yi's betrayal while retreating to friendly lines. His skill no doubt has caught Marshal Qi's eye."

 #Reusable loc
 #fengtian.284.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Integration!"
 #fengtian.284.d: "The Central Government under [FROM.GetLeader] has demanded that we formally relinquish control of our armies and territory. While [ROOT.GetLeader] and his subordinates will be permitted to retain their current titles and positions, there is no way to know what the future might bring. On the one hand surrendering most of our autonomy would be the patriotic thing to do, and perhaps the safest in the short term. On the other hand, freedom is sweet."
 #fengtian.284.a: "For an United China! (Play as [From.GetNameDef])"
 #fengtian.284.b: "We shall not submit."

 #chi_for.102.t: "The Kuomintang Threaten Our Treaty Ports!"
 #chi_for.102.d: "The Kuomintang have long been a menace to our interests in East Asia, receiving extensive support from Syndicalist powers and riling up the people with their socialist, nationalistic messaging. Our intervention to save China from syndicalist rule in the 1920s was supposed to bring peace, but it seems that it has only bought them a decade to prepare - an opportunity squandered by our various allies in the continent. Emerging from their hiding places in Fujian, they have spent the last few years dismantling the hard work we have put in building a security architecture capable of keeping the Japanese and Syndicalists out.\n\nNow they are at our gates, demanding that we hand over all concessions we have in their \"integral territories\" lest there be war. Although perhaps it would be easy to acquiesce to these threats, it would be a great shame for our nation. Qingdao was a small fishing village when we first arrived and received a 99 year lease, and it was through a tremendous investment by our admiralty that it has become a modern port that it is today. And if it wasn't for us, it would've been seized by the Japanese during the Weltkrieg. To lose Qingdao and the other territories would truly mark the end of the age of German influence in the region."
 #chi_for.102.a: "Cede them, the lease was only good for another few decades anyway."
 #chi_for.102.b: "55 days to Peking."
 #
 #chi_for.103.t: "German Cities Are Ceded!"
 #chi_for.103.d: "The Germans have caved into our demands, and vacated their port cities! Before our troops could even arrive to finalise the arrangement, local crowds have begun to form to witness this momentous event in Chinese history. The handover was, however, peaceful with the German flag being lowered in solemn ceremonies before the last of the German ships left each harbour. President [Root.GetLeader] decided to go to Qingdao to observe the occasion, delivering a speech as the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth was raised over the harbour. Many foreign businesses have elected to liquidate their assets rather than deal with our government, despite our assurances that there will be no violence - proof that they only serve themselves. All across China, the people are jubilantly celebrating this great victory over imperialism, and our legitimacy is as solidified as ever!"
 #chi_for.103.a: "Great!"
 #
 #chi_for.104.t: "Germany Stands their ground!"
 #chi_for.104.d: "Citing the illegitimacy of our government, prior treaties, and the continuing \"Syndicalist\" activities in our lands, the Germans have bristled at our demand to hand over the treaty ports. If anything, they have increased the fortifications of their territories, putting their troops on high alert and declaring the need to protect the citizens under their protection from the \"Red Menace\". We have word that their fleet and whatever forces they can muster are being deployed in effort to buttress their defences.\n\nIt hardly matters however, at least for many of our high command and leading anti-Imperialist thinkers. Ever since the Germans' intervention during the northern expedition, many have held a grudge - waiting for the day to avenge their fallen comrades. It should come as no surprise that the Dare-to-Die units amassing outside the concessions have been overflowing with volunteers as [CHI.GetLeader] and their cabinet makes their decision."
 #chi_for.104.a: "We wait for a better opportunity!"
 #chi_for.104.b: "Mobilise the troops!"

 #chi_for.105.t: "[From.GetName] Attack Macau!"
 #chi_for.105.d: "Early this morning Kuomintang troops began an attack on the outer fortifications of Macau, flagrantly violating our territorial integrity and international law! A major port held by our nation since Portuguese merchants first settled the area near the Pearl River. Formally rented from the Chinese government after an agreement in 1557, Macau has since become a major city and the embodiment of what a successful Sino-Portuguese cooperation could look like.\n\nInstead however, the new red government has elected to throw all of that away in favour of violence, threatening a broader war. Although they claim to be \"liberators\", we point out that many refugees fleeing the socialist menace have fled into our concession - showing how little legitimacy their government has. On the other hand however, our forces are stretched fairly thin, and Macau is a long way from the metropole. The local Governor and military authorities have begun sending urgent telegrams asking for instructions on what to do next."
 #chi_for.105.a: "Put up a token resistance, then surrender."
 #chi_for.105.b: "We will fight them!"

 #chi_for.106.t: "Portugal Surrenders Macau!"
 #chi_for.106.d: "Excellent news! Portuguese forces, facing our overwhelming superiority, surrendered control of Macau soon after our attack began. Both sides took few casualties, and we have released all prisoners to return home unmolested. Within a few days, the national flag could be seen in buildings all across the city, showing once and for all that the city is ours! This victory, done with as little violence or costly fighting, is proof of the growing strength of the Chinese people and is one great step towards reversing the humiliation our nation has experienced. In a speech today [Root.GetLeader] declares this a triumph against imperialism and proof that under the auspices of the Kuomintang, China will once again be reunited."
 #chi_for.106.a: "Great!"

 #chi_for.107.t: "The War for Macau!"
 #chi_for.107.d: "The Portuguese have stubbornly and foolishly decided to fight for control of Macau. Citing a litany of ancient treaties and various testimonies of reactionaries and warlords that have holed up in their concession of \"Socialist abuses\", they have made it clear that our attempt to take back Macau means war. We are, however, unbowed. The Chinese people are behind us, behind our revolution, behind our principles. The imperialists have stolen our land and exploited our people for centuries now, and Macau was perhaps one of the first instances of Chinese land being taken by force. With banners raised, we go forward for the liberation of the people from Portuguese domination!"
 #chi_for.107.a: "Onwards!"

 #lngupc.31.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Integration!"
 #lngupc.31.d: "With intensified anti-imperialist rhetoric, [FROM.GetLeader] has made it clear that our uncertain status cannot be maintained any longer. While the municipalities under our control are guaranteed to have autonomy under the Chinese Constitution, we are to be returned to direct control of the Chinese Federal Government with the Unequal Treaties declared null and void."
 #lngupc.31.a: "We shall join the reunited China. (Play as [From.GetName])"

 #chi_for.21.t: "An Ultimatum from the KMT"
 #chi_for.21.d: "Ever since the Hong Kong incident in 1925, the international community looked with suspicion on the Kuomintang - fearing their radical socialist and nationalistic tendencies. Their defeat in the Northern Expedition was supposed to extinguish the threat for good, and the establishment of the Legation Cities was meant to ensure a peaceful and cooperative future with the Chinese. When reports of a KMT insurgency emerging in the mountains first came in, Sun Chuanfang and the league were supposed to handle it, holding up their end of the bargain. How wrong we were.\n\nThe uprising of the KMT remnant overtook the League all too quickly in 1936, and since then we have watched in trepidation as the socialist army marched across China - no doubt backed by Syndicalist powers. Multiple attempts to stop this red tide by native Chinese forces have failed, and our commanders had begun preparing for the inevitable.\n\nThings have finally come to a head today. Emboldened by their successes, KMT agitators staged a series of protests and strikes across our cities - a flimsy pretext to invade. We have received a final ultimatum personally signed by [CHI.GetLeader], demanding that transfer over control of our concessions over to their authorities - which would mark the end of the Legations.\n\nGiven the overwhelming power of the nationalist government, our administration is divided. Some say we would be better off cutting our losses and leaving, while others argue that the powerful defence we have erected and the loyalty we have gained from the locals (joined by those fleeing the KMT's advance) will be sufficient to hold them off until foreign reinforcements arrive. Finally, the council arrives at a decision..."
 #chi_for.21.a: "They made us an offer we can't refuse."
 #chi_for.21.b: "Great Powers will protect us."
 #
 #chi_for.22.t: "Reply from Legation Cities"
 #chi_for.22.d1: "The Legation Cities have agreed to finally rejoin China after oppressing the Chinese citizens there for many years, places like Hong Kong and Shanghai haven't truly been free for decades with generations living and dying under European yoke. Now with the key cities under our control, they can, at last, be free from European colonialism."
 #chi_for.22.d2: "The Legations have refused our just demands and have pleaded with Europe for protection, this won't save them when our armies are read. The only question is, should we go as far as to attack them?"
 #chi_for.22.a: "Goodbye, the imperialists."
 #chi_for.22.b: "The imperialists are not credible."

 #lngkmt.12.t: "Request from the Central Committee"
 #lngkmt.12.d: "The reorganised Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou has sent a simple request that we rejoin their ranks. This means putting ourselves under their command and supervision. For the good of the nation, of course."
 #lngkmt.12.a: "Of course. For the Republic!"
 #lngkmt.12.b: "This is encroaching on our autonomy!"
 #
 #lngkmt.13.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Refuses our Request"
 #lngkmt.13.d: "The treacherous dogs in [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to comply! They have essentially refused to recognise the authority of the Central Committee and they shall receive the punishment befitting traitors."
 #lngkmt.13.a: "They will pay."
 #
 #lngkmt.14.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Rejoins the Central Committee"
 #lngkmt.14.d: "Our friends in [FROM.GetNameDef] have, of course, accepted our request and have rejoined our ranks."
 #lngkmt.14.a: "For the Republic!"
 #
 #lngkmt.15.t: "Integration into the Republic of China"
 #lngkmt.15.d: "With the consolidation of the Central Government under the Kuomintang, we are to be integrated firmly into the Republic."
 #lngkmt.15.a: "We will work within."
 #
 #lngkmt.16.t: "[FROM.GetName] Integrated"
 #lngkmt.16.d: "The region under the control of [FROM.GetNameDef] has been integrated into the Republic. Our government should now be unopposed there."
 #lngkmt.16.a: "Excellent!"

 china_events.0.d.target: "Reports from the border indicate that we will soon be under attack from our wretched neighbours in [FROM.GetName]. Dissatisfied with our government, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally denounced us before a crowd in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Since then, more and more units have amassed along the border. Small skirmishes have already begun as our opponents make probing attacks and tensions spike. We must hurry to our defence, lest we be crushed under the weight of our foes."
 china_events.0.d.ally_of_target: "We have received a warning from our allies in [FROM.GetName] that an invasion from [FROM.FROM.GetName] is on the horizon. Both sides have already begun preparation for such a conflict as the border grows increasingly tense. Given our prior obligations to [FROM.GetName], we will likely be drawn into this conflict. We must begin scrambling troops of our own immediately - let us hope that our decision to ally with the [FROM.GetAdjective] was not made too hastily."
 china_events.0.a: "Assemble the general staff!"

 china_events.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Submission"
 china_events.1.d: "Confident in their growing strength or perhaps merely seeking to project it in these times of troubles, we have received a series of demands from [FROM.GetLeader]'s government demanding our immediate recognition of their authority. This would naturally entail the stationing of troops, adhering to their decrees and likely further tributes that would naturally be sent to a national government.\n\nCalling their bluff of course, is always an option. It will likely mean war, though freedom from tyranny often requires such a price. Especially in warlord-era China, the nation is littered with failed governments who overstretched themselves assailing \"weak\" and \"vulnerable\" factions. Submitting for now and playing the long-game is also an option as well."
 china_events.1.a: "We acquiesce to their demands."
 china_events.1.b: "We stand defiant!"
 china_events.1.c: "We are the legitimate government of China!"

 china_events.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Submits to Our Authority"
 china_events.2.d: "Seeing few potential options to preserve their autonomy and believing us to be their best one, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to recognise us as the legitimate rulers of China. In doing so they have committed to harmonising their laws with ours, provide troops for our wars, and commit to further coordination in national affairs.\n\nIn return however they have in practice preserved much of their old government, as well as the patronage networks that operate underneath. Warlord troops have always been known to be unwieldy and the warlords themselves untrustworthy. Further integration will have to be discussed another day, for now though the status quo works."
 china_events.2.a: "We are magnanimous rulers."

 china_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Yield!"
 china_events.3.d: "Despite our efforts to settle the matter peacefully, [FROM.GetLeader] has formally renounced our efforts at promoting national unity and begun mobilising [FROM.GetAdjective] units in a show of force to try and ward us off. [FROM.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] has also ejected all of our representatives and denounced our government as illegitimate, spreading such vile lies throughout [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nNaturally his actions are a grave insult, but our best course of action remains to be seen. Given the stubborn and fickle nature of warlords, rejection was always in the cards. But enforcing our will on [FROM.GetNameDef] will require allocating forces which may be spent elsewhere. Timing, as always, is everything."
 china_events.3.a: "Let us begin a buildup at the border."
 china_events.3.b: "The invasion begins now!"

 china_events.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers an Alliance"
 china_events.4.d: "Just because we are the only legitimate government of China does not mean we travel alone. There are many sympathetic to our goals throughout the nation, just waiting for liberation. Sometimes, however, they manage to liberate themselves in advance.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] appears to have done just that, rallying the [FROM.GetRulingParty] to free the people of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Aligned with our cause, or at least so they claim, we have officially received their petition to join our cause as a local affiliate."
 china_events.4.a: "We graciously accept."
 china_events.4.b: "We cannot trust them."

 china_events.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts our Alliance"
 china_events.5.d: "Having heard our petition to align with them, we have been officially accepted into the ranks of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Communications between our officers are being established, and we will work more closely towards national liberation. [FROM.GetLeader] has officially commended [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] in a speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for their patriotic efforts, deepening our ties. Although a small victory for us today, history will remember this as a critical step toward the future of China."
 china_events.5.a: "Onwards comrades!"

 china_events.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses an Alliance"
 china_events.6.d: "Despite our sincere efforts at national unity, the paranoid clique surrounding [FROM.GetLeader] has decided to reject our efforts at joining their movement, going so far as to denounce us as duplicitous and power-hungry. These unfair accusations only serve to demonstrate their own internal rot, unable to trust outsiders with power.\n\nWe will have to find our own way towards liberation, independent of [FROM.GetAdjective] machinations. In doing so we bear the true legacy of Xinhai, one uncorrupted by the tendrils of [FROM.GetLeader]."
 china_events.6.a: "Their cause is not as noble as they say."

 china_events.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Join Ranks"
 china_events.7.d: "Even as China grew more and more divided, there were many across the nation that shared a common vision for the future of the nation. These kindred spirits were often divided by mountains and rivers, forced to fight their own regional battles for dominance. Still, it is always a pleasant sight when the stars align and comrades independently take power.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has identified our [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as an ally in their quest to liberate the nation. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been invited to join forces, bringing China ever closer to unification without firing a shot."
 china_events.7.a: "We accept wholeheartedly."
 china_events.7.b: "We are not affiliated with one another."

 china_events.8.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Joins our Ranks!"
 china_events.8.d: "Thanks in part to the similar roots between [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have remained aligned over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to begin coordinating our efforts at unification, peacefully bringing [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fold.\n\nWith any luck, our combined forces will be sufficient to bring about successful national liberation from the chaos and strife that has engulfed it. With momentum on our side, the combined might of our forces will continue onwards to victory!"
 china_events.8.a: "One cause for one nation."

 china_events.9.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies our Alliance!"
 china_events.9.d: "Despite the similar roots of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have diverged over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our efforts at peacefully unifying our cause against mutual enemies, instead electing to go their own route.\n\nThis treason can only be explained by their own selfishness and inability to think beyond their own interests. Whatever the case, it appears that it is up to us to bear the true legacy of Xinhai, and carve a future for all the Chinese people."
 china_events.9.a: "[FROM.GetAdjective] traitors ought to at least stay out of our way."

 china_events.10.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Attempts to Increase Integration"
 china_events.10.d.integration_level_1: "Having already professed our loyalty to the [FROM.GetAdjective] cause, one would believe some trust is in order. Nonetheless, [FROM.GetLeader] insists that further efforts at integration is necessary to continue on with national liberation, and insisting on further oversight in our internal matters.\n\nFor now, this only means a slight increase in the number of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] magistrates roaming about, but by accepting the state of affairs will subtly but perceptibly change. The extensive autonomy we have so far enjoyed will begin chipping away and many will begin turning away from [ROOT.GetLeader] and look towards [FROM.GetLeader] for leadership. Perhaps now it is time to break free and save our independence."
 china_events.10.d.integration_level_2: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy here in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], far from the prying eyes of central authority. This has in many ways made things more efficient in terms of governance, though we are by no means secessionist or regionalist (rather dirty words within Chinese politics). Still, it appears things are changing.\n\nThe [FROM.GetRulingParty] operating out of [FROM.GetNameDef] have insisted on greater control over our mostly autonomous political council. They insist on control over several key internal functions, something that we had thought would be left alone when we initially agreed to submit to [FROM.GetAdjective] rule. Of course, refusing will have dire consequences, but we are quickly approaching the turning point in which it will be difficult to escape [FROM.GetLeader]'s grasp. We must now seriously contemplate the risks and successes of breaking free from the grasp of this newly proclaimed government."
 china_events.10.d.integration_level_3: "Leading members of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] have begun growing anxious as of late, as their long-entrenched patronage networks grow threatened by the increasing presence of [FROM.GetAdjective] agents. Rumours abound that the [FROM.GetRulingParty] has begun establishing regional headquarters in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], hoping to build a political base of their own.\n\nThe point of no return nears, as magistrates from the central government grow bolder in their efforts to subjugate us. Laws passed in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], previously often ignored, are now being enforced with increasing vigour. Sooner or later we will be nothing more than another province under the auspices of the [FROM.GetRulingParty]. We have no choice but to prepare our selves for war."
 china_events.10.d.integration_final: "It has been a long time coming, but all the same there was some shock within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s inner circle when [FROM.GetNameDef] made their move today. In a private meeting, [FROM.GetLeader] spoke about the future of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and while assuring that [ROOT.GetLeader] will remain governor for the time being, the central government will take steps as necessary to ensure his rule is compatible with the ideals of the [FROM.GetRulingParty].\n\nLeft unspoken is the growing control in which [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has asserted over us, with the expectation that they will have the right to de facto (and possibly even de jure) select a new governor and veto internal appointments. There is really no other choice at this point, either we go down in history as good [FROM.GetRulingParty] soldiers or [ROOT.GetLeader] makes one final desperate stand against their rule. This pivotal moment shall decide the fate of our province henceforth."
 china_events.10.a: "We accept [FROM.GetAdjective] rule."
 china_events.10.b: "We oppose this encroachment!"

 china_events.11.t: "Integration of [ROOT.GetNameDef] Progresses"

 china_events.11.intro: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy as an independent province, away from the shadow of the central government. Due to the corruption and instability of China's political climate, we have turned away from any notion of centralisation - finding that in this chaotic period of strife; only self-governance would alleviate our own problems. Indeed, for many years we have set about to carry out our own reforms and to reinforce our cultural differences from the rest of the country."

 china_events.11.d.integration_level_1: "china_events.11.intro$\n\nGoverning officials from [overlord.GetNameDef] have demanded that our local radios and our newspapers to cease the production of dialect-based media. The news is henceforth broadcasted from the language chosen by [overlord.GetNameDef] and to cease publication of our provincial newspaper. Several prominent authors in our province have resigned out of protest, and voices have sprung up in fear of further centralisation."
 china_events.11.d.integration_level_2: "$china_events.11.intro$\n\nGoverning officials from [overlord.GetNameDef] have demanded that all local culture festivals are to be shut down as they are \"inciting notions of separation\" and are reminiscent \"of a backwards and archaic era\".

At the same time, many teachers and professors have lodged complaints of protest against our government. Even more shocking are that we finding that it is more and more difficult for parents unable to communicate with their children. As instruction is now in the dialect of [overlord.GetNameDef], a greater number of our citizens, from students to local rickshaw pullers, cannot speak either the new national dialect or their old one."
 china_events.11.d.integration_final: "We have long enjoyed our autonomy as an independent province, away from the shadow of the central government. Due to the corruption and instability of China's political climate, we have turned away from any notion of centralisation - finding that in this chaotic period of strife; only self-governance would alleviate our own problems. Indeed, for many years we have set about to carry out our own reforms and to reinforce our cultural differences from the rest of the country.\n\nOur home province, while appearing the same on the outside, has experienced significant political, social, and economic shifts since the centralisation of our country. Magistrates and governing bodies are now directly appointed by the central government in [overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. While plenty in the province still speak their provincial dialect fluently, the younger generation of today only speaks in the national dialect. Our economy has also experienced profound changes as the once useful provincial monetary system has collapsed in the wake of adopting the national currency. Furthermore, our provincial forces have all been nationalised, leaving any notion of political independence from the central government gone."
 china_events.11.a: "Change comes inevitably."

 china_events.12.t: "Our Efforts to Integrate [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_events.12.intro: "In recent weeks we have taken steps to further integrate the [FROM.GetAdjective] administration with our own, making slow but steady progress in this regard. This has of course not gone unnoticed by [FROM.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty], but it appears that they have generally acquiesced to our demands, whether out of genuine ideological loyalty or because they see unification as fait accompli."

 china_events.12.d.integration_level_1: "$china_events.12.intro$\n\nTo prepare such matters, let us proclaim to their government that they must henceforth use our dialect in all forms of public communication. Not only will this help tear down provincial dialect barriers but it will help us prevent means of local dissent. In any case, our control over [FROM.GetNameDef] has greatly increased from before."
 china_events.12.d.integration_level_2: "$china_events.12.intro$\n\nWe must reach out to the masses of China as well and inform that we are bringing China into a modern age, a new era for the Chinese nation.

 china_events.12.d.integration_level_3: "$china_events.12.intro$\n\nThe future of China belongs to the new youth, and the youth must learn our ways and understand our authority if our hold on China is to carry on for generations. Let us send out an order to have their schools use our languages in instruction and conversation."
 china_events.12.d.integration_final: "Our efforts to integrate the [FROM.GetAdjective] provincial administration with our own has been a complete success. Their people are now content and understanding of our rule, with favourable reports arriving weekly from our appointed magistrates. Furthermore, we hear that their society is now embracing the culture of our capital region and that their schools use our dialect in all forms of dialogue. We do not need to worry about dissent as their local media no longer broadcast with their provincial dialects, and their army is now fully integrated into ours."
 china_events.12.a: "One step further in the road to unification."

 china_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Revolts Against Integration"
 china_events.13.d: "Warlords are fickle, untrustworthy beasts, always jealously guarding their autonomy despite the costs it imposes on the nation and their people. Although we tried to be as reasonable and subtle as possible during the transition, [FROM.GetLeader] has stubbornly resisted our efforts to bring [FROM.GetNameDef] closer in line with what is expected from our national cause.\n\nHe has instead rallied the [FROM.GetRulingParty] against us, denouncing what he decries as [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] tyranny and efforts to disarm [FROM.GetAdjective] military forces. We must work to quickly quell this rebellion, and with any luck avoid any further damage to our cause."
 china_events.13.a: "A small price to pay for national salvation."

Discontented at [FROM.GetLeader]'s leadership and fearful of continued encroachment by [FROM.GetRulingParty] agents in local affairs, the [FROM.FROM.GetName] has expelled all [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives in an act of fierce defiance.\n\nThis has thrust [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] into a sudden position of prominence as the leader of what he hopes to be a broader coalition of those who dare to defy [FROM.GetRulingParty] authority. For now we watch from the sidelines as chaos engulfs the fledging [FROM.GetAdjective] government, but it is likely that we will soon be forced to chose as they fight for the future of the movement."

 china_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Our Authority"
 china_events.15.d: "Perhaps it was inevitable, or perhaps this is an action of brazen selfishness, but regardless the day has come. Inspired by [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetLeader] uprising against our rule, [FROM.GetLeader] has chosen to throw his lot with the rebels. Perhaps incensed by perceived encroachment on their autonomy or maybe discontented by the continued leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader], they have found an opportunity to bring down our government from within. Either we put down these traitors immediately, or the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] dream of national unification will be dead before it could even begin."

[FROM.GetLeader] has sent a telegram formally placing the resources of [FROM.GetNameDef] under our control, though how much this will actually work out in practice remains to be seen. Warlords are fickle creatures, and no doubt they are wondering if we too will take a tyrannical turn.\n\nFor now however, we must focus on defeating the forces of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]. Our ranks now swelling in number, our chances have grown with it. However, it is unlikely that [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] will go down without a fight, and the revolt continues."

Such fears finally came true today, with many governors rebelling against [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe two sides have been trading claims of tyranny, with the rebels denouncing the central government as betraying federalist principles while the [FROM.GetRulingParty] insist that they are trying to democratise regionalist oligarchies. War is imminent, and if the Federalist ideal is to survive, their armies must move quickly."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_lkmt: "Frantic news from China has arrived that the country has seemingly fallen into another civil war. While they once proclaimed loyalty to the Kuomintang's National Government, rebellious warlords have announced their decision to cut off ties with the [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government - denouncing the Kuomintang's apparent authoritarianism.\n\nWhile some may consider that the Kuomintang's idea of a unitary state has led to an inevitable civil war, there can be no doubt that the NRA must act quickly in dispelling the rebels, or else the Kuomintang may very well lose their chance once more to fulfil Dr. Sun's revolution."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_rkmt: "After being repeatedly ousted by his rivals, Dr. Sun Yat-sen formed the Kuomintang along vanguardist lines, demanding personal loyalty oaths from each member. Despite this, the Kuomintang have long struggled to present a united front, even before their eternal Premier's death. The Kuomintang's rightist elements have attempted to build a unified coalition, only to see it collapse in recent days.\n\nThe central government, led by [FROM.GetLeader] has denounced the growing rebellion as the work of \"bandits\" in hopes of delegitimising the growing discontent at his authoritarian rule. As the armies prepare to clash, it appears that the Kuomintang have suffered another major blow."
 china_central_plains_war_desc_zhili: "It was supposed to be over. After the Zhili clique's stunning victory over its rivals in the 1920s, many envisioned a future built along Zhili lines. This dream was utterly shattered in 1936 with the collapse of the League, and it seems things have only gotten worse from there. [FROM.GetNameDefCap]'s attempt to pick up the pieces took a severe blow today with news of a major uprising by various regional governments.\n\nReminiscent of the National Protection War, the rebels claim to be liberating the nation from Zhili tyranny.

They have offered to put aside any differences to help us in ejecting the invaders, contributing forces to the cause of national protection.\n\nThere are some concerns of course, particularly about the trustworthiness of [FROM.GetLeader] and his [FROM.GetRulingParty]. Aligning with them means tying our fates together. Coalitions such as these are unfortunately common in warlord China, and collapse just as quickly. Still, in the name of national unity, can we really say no?"
 china_events.20.d.ceasefire: "$china_events.20.d$\n\nPosing another challenge is the fact that [FROM.GetNameDef] remains at war with other factions in China. Accepting them creates the diplomatic headache of having to resolve any existing conflicts, lest we be drawn into them."
 china_events.20.a: "We welcome them into our alliance."
 china_events.20.b: "We refuse reject duplicity."

 china_events.21.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Entry Into the Front"
 china_events.21.d: "Seeing the pressing need for unity in face of foreign aggression, [FROM.GetLeader] has personally messaged [ROOT.GetLeader] to welcome us into the Chinese United Front. Our combined armies are bound to pose a major threat against those that would invade China, however it is doubtful that such a coalition can last for long. There is little time to think about that now however, as we march onwards against the invaders!"
 china_events.21.a: "Comrades to victory!"

 china_events.22.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Entry Into the Front"
 china_events.22.d: "Despite our ernest efforts at promoting national unity, we have been harshly rebuffed by [FROM.GetNameDef]. It appears they do not trust us, as [FROM.GetLeader] jealously guards his power over the coalition. This sort of treasonous behavior is not uncommon in China, and may very well spell the doom of the nation as it is invaded by outside forces. In the mean time, we will simply have to manage on our own."
 china_events.22.a: "Fools and traitors."

 china_events.23.t: "The End of the Chinese United Front"
 china_events.23.d: "Now that enemy invasion has come to a close, it appears that there is little need for a Chinese United Front. Already the various warlords have begun refusing central government commands, and distancing themselves from [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. It seems that things will go back to the way they were as various factions press their claims for national leadership.\n\nStill, we demonstrated in this last war that we can lead China. That we can protect it from enemy invasion, and disunity is not inherent but an illness caused by regionalist selfishness. May the people remember us and our accomplishments across the nation, and we will soon united with them once again."
 china_events.23.a: "Blessed victory."

 china_events.24.t: "The United Front Disbands"
 china_events.24.d: "Now that enemy invasion has come to a close, it appears that there is little need for a Chinese United Front. The unity that such a front provided was useful for a time, however the divisions within the front are simply too much to last. We now must go our own way, though the goodwill and patriotic fervour we have gained from our participation will likely stay with us for years to come. As one China fended off foreign invasion. And that will go down in the history books forever."
 china_events.24.a: "It was nice while it lasted."

 china_events.25.t: "United Front Formed"
 china_events.25.d: "In face of foreign threats, various policymakers, patriots, and intellectuals have proposed the warring Chinese factions come together into one Chinese United Front in the name of common national security. We, as a Chinese state, have been included in such discussions, and there are many within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] that have petitioned [ROOT.GetLeader] to move towards this alliance. Although it cannot possibly last forever, it is the patriotic duty of all Chinese to defend the nation for enemy aggression."

 china_united_front_desc_front_leader: "In face of foreign aggression, we have achieved a prominence that we have long sought as the effective leader of China. [ROOT.GetLeader] has delivered a speech today in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] formally announcing the creation a Chinese United Front, and calling for all China to rally to the national cause.\n\nThe war ahead is not expected to be easy by any means, and the coalition we assembled will likely be unwieldy. Nonetheless, our strength has been buttressed by the joint might of various warlord armies, and our odds considerably improved as a result. Under the shadow of war, China girds itself for a prolonged conflict against those who would subjugate it."
 china_united_front_desc_front_member: "In face of foreign aggression, we and many others have banded together to face off against the invaders in a Chinese United Front. A shared government, mostly on paper, has been established to coordinate activities, one of which we have taken an active interest in.\n\nThe war ahead is not expected to be easy, but united China is still a power to behold. With millions of patriots prepared to fight and die against foreign oppression, and with considerable battlefield experience shared across its members, we must push the enemy out of Chinese lands. For the sake of the nation, its people, and its future, there can be no surrender!"
 china_united_front_desc_possible_front_member: "Assembling various factions within China together, the Chinese United Front has formed to oppose foreign aggression and coordinate a defence against enemy invasion. Although [ROOT.GetLeader] and his staff are still mulling whether or not to join, that has not stopped others from going forward in creating this alliance.\n\nWe have experienced pressure internally, even within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], to participate in this defence of the homeland, though the risks remain evident. United, China can pose a major threat, however victory is far from assured. And the future of the front is not certain either - what will happen after a victory remains an open question."
 china_united_front_desc_enemy: "Various Chinese forces, in a desperate effort to deny us our rightful demands, have come together to form a so-called \"Chinese United Front\". Unifying disparate warlord factions into one supposedly joint alliance and government, they have vowed to force us to retreat, utilising every resource and ounce of Chinese patriotism left in such a divided nation.\n\nWhile it is unlikely such an unwieldy alliance can truly stand up to our forces, this sudden Chinese unity is cause for some concern. We must take care to adequately adjust to such battlefield changes, and possibly expand the scope of our campaign objectives as well."
 china_united_front_desc_neutral: "Faced with foreign invasion, various Chinese factions have agreed to cooperate in a \"Chinese United Front\". Ostensibly with a unified command structure and government, experts warn that in practice regional autonomy will remain the same and coordination will probably be lacking.\n\nStill, this sudden unity against aggression has caused an outburst of patriotism in cities across the nation. Whatever doubts exist about the sincerity of the participants or the odds of victory have largely remained invisible, as the Chinese nation mobilises for war. It appears that the idea of a united China is far from dead, though the outcome of the war may very well change that."
 china_united_front_option_front_leader: "We shall lead our people to victory!"

 china_events.27.d: "Citing our current conflict within the nation and the need for unity in face of foreign threat, representatives from [FROM.GetNameDef] have insisted that we sign an immediate ceasefire, allowing the winning side in our conflict to set limited terms. Under normal circumstances, ending a conflict such as this and giving our enemies a respite is only a recipe for disaster, though the alternative in this case does not seem to be much better.\n\nRefusing would mean being seen as a collaborator with foreign aggressors in a time where patriotic fervour is at an all-time high, and we will attract scorn from the gathering Chinese alliance to resist foreign invasion. We may very well end up facing down the entire united front in the looming conflict if we do not take similar steps towards peace, a proposition far greater in scope that we initially bargained for."
 china_events.27.a: "We reluctantly accept."

 china_events.28.d: "Agreeing with the need for national unity in these dire times, [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to sign a ceasefire with representatives of our United Front. For the most part, forces have withdrawn to status quo positions, which may cause friction but in the grand scheme of things has been peaceful. We are very fortunate that [FROM.GetAdjective] have seen reason in this time of peril."
 china_events.28.a: "This is...acceptable."

 china_events.29.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Ceasefire"
 china_events.29.d: "Despite the clear national emergency that the nation faces, [FROM.GetLeader] has stubbornly refused to sign any ceasefire and end their present conflict within the Chinese nation. As a result, they have effectively thrown in their lot with the enemy, and become co-belligerents with the invader. We therefore have little choice but to fight them too, casting out yet another group of selfish traitors that taint the nation's integrity. Although our enemies continue to grow, we expect many await within [FROM.GetAdjective] borders for national liberation."

 china_events.40.d.first_step: "The first steps to reforming our military is underway, with the creation of a centralised bureaucracy to coordinate logistics, supply, and payments. A commission to handle this project was established, with trusted men supposedly hand-picked by [ROOT.GetLeader] taking on this task with stride. This lays the foundation for future army reforms, critical for bringing our forces to the modern era of war."
 china_events.40.t.second_step: "Military Reforms March Onwards!"
 china_events.40.d.second_step: "Having taken our first steps towards improving the quality of our army, further initiatives soon followed. Localised units have been broken up and redistributed, with some officers outright expelled for corruption. Training similarly has been revamped from the ground up to bringing our forces up to speed with modern techniques.\n\nThere has been plenty of grumbling from members of the old guard, particularly those who have benefited from the regional nature of our old forces. However, this patchwork model, while sometimes more effective in the early days of the warlord era, has no place in the future of our military."
 china_events.40.t.third_step_officers: "A Breath of Fresh Air in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Army"
 china_events.40.d.third_step_officers: "After considerable effort, our military has been thoroughly reformed. Having successfully reformed the core components of our military, the difficult work of integrating the allied and auxiliary units that we have inherited from times past, began.\n\nOur high command is pleased to report their efforts across the last few months as a success. Although there remain issues with ghost soldiers, corrupt payrolls and desertion, there is little doubt that we have come a long way."
 china_events.40.t.third_step_finished: "A New Day for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Military"
 china_events.40.d.third_step_finished: "After considerable effort, the core components of our military has been thoroughly reformed. Gone are the ghost soldiers, the desertion, the looting, the semi-feudal structure. In its place is a new, professional force, comparable with that of Europe and Japan. Now, they are ready to enforce Chinese unification and possibly beyond, an army truly to be reckoned with!"
 china_events.40.a: "Our armies triumph even off the battlefield!"

 china_events.41.t.army_reform_ongoing: "Cleaning House and Catching Thieves"
 china_events.41.d.army_reform_ongoing: "China's military has taken a severe dive in quality over the last few years, despite the abundance of veteran officers produced by the warlord era. Many have achieved their ranks through nepotism, corruption, or favouritism, while others (even competent ones) exploit their power for their own ends.\n\nOur efforts have involved cleaning up the ghost rosters, stopping desertion, and eliminating patronage - increasing accountability within our ranks. A new batch of officers have been trained to this end, instilled with patriotic spirit and hopefully less beholden to corruption that the previous generations."
 china_events.41.t.army_reform_finished: "A New Day for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Military"
 china_events.41.d.army_reform_finished: "$china_events.41.d.army_reform_ongoing$\n\nThese officers join an army thoroughly reformed from the inside outwards, ready to liberate their nation. Through our efforts, they have a become a professional force, comparable with that of Europe and Japan. May they ensure China will never be divided or humiliated ever again!"
 china_events.41.a: "A new generation of officers for a new China."

### Capital Event ###
 china_events.50.t: "The New Capital"
 china_events.50.d: "With the unification of China, it is finally time to set the permanent seat of the new central government. Beijing would be the natural choice, an ancient city that has been capital of Chinese governments consistently for the past centuries under the Yuan. A strong contender, it would represent a natural, stable transition from the old. This however also works against it, being strongly associated with the Monarchy and the failed Beiyang government. To a lesser extent, it emphasizes a certain northern political dominance in national politics.\n\nNanjing is another potential choice, sitting closer to center of China, between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers.

They will be allowed to operate de jure outside our country as a sovereign entity but will be tied exclusively to our markets and political alignments. While we certainly view these lands as integral to the Chinese nation, perhaps we can see their point and respect their autonomy under our influence. Other nationalists have argued that since we have the larger hand in these negotiations, we should at least demand the regions with the most Han inhabitants so that we can encourage settlement on the frontiers.

While these regions are explicitly ours, pacifist members of our government have urged our leadership to accept these demands in order to avoid bloodshed. Even if we lose land to the Chinese, at least our core territory and people will be allowed to enjoy the benefits of independence far away from Chinese rule.

Although plans are being drawn up for a triumphant march down the Bund, and the raising of a Chinese flag over Shanghai for the first time in a century, events will likely unfold far less cleanly. The cities' existing volunteer defence groups will soon find themselves bolstered by those hoping to defend their homes, even as [LEC.faction_leader.GetAdjective] troops prepare to withdraw.

'Once again, the line must be drawn', he writes. This time, though, there are no German, Japanese, or American warships that can steam to his aid, and instead the might of a united China bears down upon his set of small, ill-gotten, concessions. Given their small size and lack of protection, seizing the Legation Cities should be akin to squashing an insect, but the international community will no doubt paint us as villains. With Shanghai in particular offering resistance, the cities will quickly fall into chaos, as foreigners pile onto ships, others barricade their homes, and men take up arms as part of various volunteer forces. The foreigners will defend their homes, many to the last man, and Shanghai, the Paris of the East, will burn."

Faced with failure after failure, the Mandate of Heaven, which had ruled the Chinese people for so long, seemed to draw the imperial system to an end finally.\n\nSince the end of the Weltkrieg, the political situation in China has changed dramatically with the Xuantong Restoration. Despite being allied with the Zhili Clique, Chinese royalists have successfully brought the Qing Dynasty to a complete restoration in the past years. Now from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Emperor [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially proclaimed that with China's recent unification, [QIE.GetNameDef] will seek to reassert China's cultural and political superiority in East Asia."

While other warlords attempted to split from Zhili control, the Zhili nevertheless have defeated all competing governments, thus unifying China once more.

 china_events.306.d: "After defeat by both the Fengtian and Zhili Cliques, the shattered revolutionary Guominjun retreated to Shanxi province in the late 1920s. There they bid their time, and after a power struggle with the province's governor Yan Xishan, they emerged from the province to successfully unify the Chinese nation under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s ecstatic revolutionary ideology.\n\nNow as the first President in the revived Republic of China, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared that the new Republic will serve as the forefront of a new revolution in China. Led by the former Guominjun, the new Chinese government has announced that it will be the vanguard of a new revolution of anti-imperialist liberation, no doubt shaking the old order of Asia drastically."
 china_events.306.a: "The Guominjun Revolution has arrived in China."

 china_events.307.t: "China under the Yiguandao"
 china_events.307.d: "A dramatic development has occurred in China with the proclamation of national reunification under the religious leader [ROOT.GetLeader] and his Yiguandao sect of millenarian populists. After defeating all competing governments on the battlefield, the new supreme leader of China has dedicated his unification in his speech to the 'Eternal Venerable Mother' to a massive crowd in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe new regime has declared China's isolation from world affairs, and many (both foreigners and Chinese) are expected to leave the country soon in fear. The near-future of the Chinese nation looks bleak as the cult begins its process of converting the Chinese peoples to its esoteric ideology."
 china_events.307.a: "A new age for China dawns."

 china_events.308.t: "Proclamation of [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 china_events.308.d.KMT: "With large swathes of China now under the National Revolutionary Army's control, Chairman [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially proclaimed the formation of a second National Republic of China. His proclamation, made just inside the Nanjing Presidential Palace's Main Hall, is rife with symbolism - it was where Dr. Sun Yat-sen was declared provisional president of the first Chinese Republic in 1912.\n\nThough the Nationalists have long held a foothold in the region, they were dismissed as a fleeting insurgency. Their final triumph over rival contenders has secured begrudging international recognition as the left wing of the Kuomintang aims to establish a single-party socialist state that will eliminate the chaos and allow for a just and democratic civil society to safely form under their tutelage."
 china_events.308.d.LCS: "With large swathes of China now under the Red Army's control, socialist rule over China seems inevitable. Largely propped up by foreign socialist powers, [FROM.GetLeader]'s government was initially dismissed as being untenable, beset by continued divisions within the small Chinese syndicalist movement.\n\nDespite these challenges, they have successfully united most of the nation under their banner, securing the begrudging recognition of world powers. Build on the smouldering ruins of the old Kuomintang socialist revolution, this Syndicalist government aims to build a new order in China in the ashes of the old one, moving beyond the ravages of the warlord era."
 china_events.308.a: "Dr. Sun's dream for a Revolutionary China carries on!"
 china_events.308.b: "The Chinese Revolution has arrived."
 china_events.308.c: "We must stop the Kuomintang threat!"

 china_events.309.t: "Proclamation of the Republic of China"
 china_events.309.d: "News from China has been chaotic recently, as rapid warfare for control over China seems to be coming to a close. The right wing of the Kuomintang under [FROM.GetLeader] has achieved supremacy throughout China, and has declared the unification of the Republic of China under the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun and Wholly Red Earth.\n\nFollowing in the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Generalissimo [FROM.GetLeader] has promised the Chinese people and the world that this is a new era for China, promising to reverse the humiliation of European powers and the guiding of the nation to greatness. Only time shall tell what the Kuomintang shall achieve."
 china_events.309.a: "The Kuomintang has done it at last."

 china_events.310.t: "Proclamation of the United Provinces of China"
 china_events.310.d: "With China largely under the control of Chen Jiongming's National Defence Army, a new Republic has been proclaimed in Beijing as Federalist troops parade through Tiananmen Square. The United Provinces of China, as often called in the West, has completely replaced the previous internationally-recognised Chinese government and with their power secured, it is only a matter of time before the international community recognises it.\n\nThe Federalist Government intends to organise a \"National Conference\" consisting of deputies from all liberated provinces to draft a new constitution and form an official provisional government until national elections can be called at the earliest convenience."
 china_events.310.a: "Long live Chen and the Republic!"
 china_events.310.b: "Will they truly bring democracy in China?"

 china_events.311.t: "The Zhili Unify China Against the Odds"
 china_events.311.d: "Since the Northern Expedition, there has been no greater crisis for the Zhili Clique than the successful coup of Manchu loyalists - that saw the deaths of Cao Cun and Wu Peifu. Driven out of Zhili Province in the coup's aftermath, the remnants of the Zhili Clique fled for their aligned province of Sichuan - where they declared a rival government to the Manchu Government.\n\nEmerging out of the famine-stricken province, the Zhili defeated all competing national governments and returned home to their native province by victory of arms. With the Manchu threat finally defeated, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared that under the Zhili Clique, the Republic of China is hereafter to be revived. Only time will tell whether the Zhili will succeed in their new battle to win the hearts of the masses."
 china_events.311.a: "The Zhili have shown that they cannot be defeated."

 china_events.312.t: "The Federalist Movement in Sichuan is Victorious"
 china_events.312.d: "To many in China, the Federalist movement seemed destined for failure as the Federalist movement has been expelled twice now in recent history from their home province of Guangzhou. Driven once more into exile, Chen Jiongming found a haven under the Sichuanese provincial government.\n\nFrom Sichuan, the Federalists have managed to defeat all competing and rival governments successfully. Their rule solidified, the Federalists have officially proclaimed the first year of the United Provinces of China under the leadership of the Zhi-Gong Party. The new government intends to organise a \"National Conference\" consisting of deputies from all provinces to draft a new constitution prepare the nation for elections."
 china_events.312.a: "Will they bring true democracy to China?"

 china_events.313.t: "General Liu Xiang declares National Reunification"
 china_events.313.d: "The poor western province of Sichuan is known for its competing warlord factions and cliques, tearing the province apart in a civil war before a deadly famine consumed it. In this chaotic period of Sichuanese politics, General Liu Xiang of the Industrial Corps managed to outmanoeuvre his opponents and unify his province under his leadership.\n\nDenouncing the leadership of the Central Government, the General took the province of Sichuan on a path of war, with his provincial army waging war and defeating rival competing governments. With his recent victories and crushing of dissenters, he has declared himself the President of a revived Republic of China. Only time will tell whether or not the General's regime and legacy will be lasting."
 china_events.313.a: "The Sichuan Clique has answered the call to unification!"

 china_events.314.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] complete Chinese Unification"
 china_events.314.d: "In the era of constant warfare and strife in the ever-changing political landscape, it is not surprising to see smaller cliques and provinces move beyond their borders to seek power and glory. Surprising many, [FROM.GetNameDef] has emerged out of their province to defeat rival competing governments and has proclaimed the Republic of China from their capital of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe country of China long divided, has finally been reunified once more under the leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader]. Only time will tell whether or not China will catch up to the rest of the world, but for now, the Chinese people can finally rest, knowing that the chaotic Warlord Period has come to an end."
 china_events.314.a: "The Chinese people have stood up at last!"

 china_events.340.t: "Chairman Wang Holds On"
 china_events.340.d: "Despite leading the Kuomintang from exile and near destruction to resounding national successes with the completion of the Second Northern Expedition, Chairman [CHI.GetLeader]'s rule seemed to fall apart with the growing factional opposition from the Kuomintang's Provisional Action Committee. Despite attacks on all sides however, it appears that the Chairman has indeed solidified his control and rule of the Party, effectively crushing the opposition.\n\nNow, for the first time in decades, peace has finally returned to China and Chairman Wang will seek to modernise and revive the Chinese country in order to fulfil the principles outlined by his mentor, the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, for years to come."
 china_events.340.a: "Wang Jingwei is truly the heir to Dr. Sun's Revolution."

 china_events.341.t: "Song's PAC Secures Leadership of the KMT"
 china_events.341.d: "While the Kuomintang was nominally led by Wang Jingwei during the party's exile period following the Northern Expedition, those who remained in China organised themselves as the autonomous MinGan Insurgency government. This was the foundation on which the Provisional Action Committee (PAC) of the Kuomintang was formed, and in their 1932 Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World, they announced a populist, socialist platform seemingly closer to the people.\n\nYears later, Chairwoman [CHI.GetLeader] has declared the transition of the PAC into a new Revolutionary Committee to lead the common masses towards the eradication of class and towards a new revolutionary future for the peasants and workers of China."
 china_events.341.a: "The people have stood up!"

 china_events.342.t: "The Reorganisation Faction Takes Over the KMT"
 china_events.342.d: "While the Kuomintang succeeded in unifying the country under their party flag, the Party descended into civil war following the assassination and death of its former Chairman, Wang Jingwei. The party then splintered into multiple factions as the country once again collapsed into another great civil war.\n\nIt would appear that from his government in Beiping, Chairman Zeng Zhongming and Premier Chen Gongbo, along with the Reorganised Comrades Association, have proclaimed victory against all the other factions. Now that the Reorganisation Faction maintains total control of both the country and the Party, foreign observers believe that China will head towards an authoritarian socialist future, one driven by some of China's most radical socialists."
 china_events.342.a: "A New China has arisen..."

 china_events.343.t: "The China Revival Society Declare Victory"
 china_events.343.d: "While the Kuomintang succeeded in unifying the country under their party flag, the Party descended into civil war following the assassination and death of its former Chairman, Wang Jingwei. As squabbling factional forces began to fight one another, the radical China Revival Society managed to seize power and secure the country in a state of an emergency.\n\nIn a grand speech from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Generalissmo Hu Zongnan has declared that all enemies of China, both foreign and domestic, shall be crushed under a new direction of the national revolution. The CRS' talk of a totalitarian revolution inspired by the likes of Savinkov, Mussolini, and Mosley shall surely dim a light on any chances of democracy in China."
 china_events.343.a: "Darkness has befallen the National Revolution."

# Faction Joining Events
 china_events.401.t: "China seeks to join the Internationale"
 china_events.401.d: "Our relationship with the Chinese Kuomintang goes back to the 1924 Reorganisation of their party when we approached the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen to work with the KMT, as we see the Kuomintang movement as the only one in which a socialist China can emerge. We helped train their revolutionary army at Whampoa and most of all, we took in the Kuomintang exiles such as Wang Jingwei following the collapse of the First Northern Expedition.\n\nNow many years later, our investment in the Kuomintang has bore fruit as the Kuomintang has succeeded in unifying China under the socialist creed and has now approached us to join the Internationale. Citing their commitment to help others secure liberation in the world revolution as well as their desire to help us oversee the destruction of the German world order, they have asked to formally be invited to the Third Internationale. While we are more than happy to accept cooperation with our Chinese comrades, a minority within our  government who are suspicious of the Kuomintang's \"Party State\" ideals and have warned against working with them."
 china_events.401.a: "Together we shall free the world!"
 china_events.401.b: "They are far too unorthodox for our taste."

 china_events.402.t: "China Joins the Internationale!"
 china_events.402.d: "Our application to join the Internationale has proven to be a success! For years, we have owed much to the Third Internationale for their support, recognition, and aid in helping organise and funding the Kuomintang so that we may liberate China from the warlords and imperialists that oppressed our dear country. With our revolution finally successful, it is due time that we repay years of support to the Internationale and aid in the world revolution against the capitalist and imperialist world order of [GER.GetNameDef]. Together, the Internationale shall unite the human race and we will strive forward for mankind's socialist progress forevermore!"
 china_events.402.a: "Together we complete the world revolution!"

 china_events.403.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.403.d: "Despite our desire to cooperate with the Third Internationale, unfortunately - they have denied our application to join their global revolution. Citing our ideological differences from orthodox syndicalism amongst other differences, the Internationale has formally rejected our application to join them. While this is certainly frustrating given our once close relationship with the Third Internationale, it proves to many of us that no matter what ideology - the West merely seeks to work with China for its own benefit and does not really seek to establish an equal relationship. Whether capitalist or socialist, it is quite clear to us that the West is still guided by the mindset of imperialism."
 china_events.403.a: "Imperialists can never change their stripes."

 china_events.404.t: "China seeks to join the Reichspakt"
 china_events.404.d: "Ever since we intervened in favour of the Beijing Government during the KMT's doomed Northern Expedition, we have held close ties with China both diplomatically and economically. Although at times fragile, especially during the anti-concessionist rebellion that nearly destroyed the our ally's rule over China, they have, thanks to our help, overcome this struggle and united China for good.\n\nNow, seeking deeper co-operation, the Chinese ambassador has requested for China to formally join our military alliance. While it could prove beneficial for both parties, we are aware how such closer ties could jeopardise the security of our investments as China would be pulled into any war Germany is in. However, at the same time it could give us the opportunity to better defend our interest in the event of a outside attack against China."
 china_events.404.a: "A military alliance will secure our investments."
 china_events.404.b: "We can not ruin our investments by allying them."

 china_events.405.t: "China Joins the Reichspakt!"
 china_events.405.d: "Today, the [FROM.getAdjective] ambassador in Berlin has wired the German response regarding [FROM.getNameDef]'s bid to join the Reichspakt. The many years of military co-operation and economic concessions with the Germans have bore fruit - China is finally formally accepted into a military alliance with Germany.\n\nFor the government in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today marks a turning point in history. The military alliance is a major step towards the Western powers accepting China as an equal partner and thus a major step towards ending the Century of Humiliation."
 china_events.405.a: "German and Chinese soldiers march side by side."

 china_events.406.t: "Our Application Denied."
 china_events.406.d: "Despite having compromised and conceded to the Germans for years, the government in Berlin has today denied the [FROM.GetAdjective]'s request to join the Reichspakt. They cite concerns regarding the safety of German investments and preference of an ambiguous security relationship.\n\nIn response, our government has condemned Germany for its imperialist attitude towards China saying that it was a huge blow to the Chinese people and government. Still, in a separate statement they affirmed to continue strong ties to Germany despite the recent events."
 china_events.406.a: "After all these years they still treat us like chess pieces!"
