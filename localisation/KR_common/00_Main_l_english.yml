 kr.political.100.t: "Order Restored in [Root.GetNameDef]"
 kr.political.100.d: "While [Root.GetNameDef] still labours under [overlord_name.GetAdjective] control, the [Root.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over our own borders that a semblance of greater autonomy is now possible to exert. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean we no longer have to rely on [overlord_name.GetAdjective] troops to secure our borders."
 kr.political.100.a: "Excellent"

 kr.political.101.t: "Order Restored in [From.GetNameDef]"
 kr.political.101.d: "While [From.GetNameDef] still labours under [Root.GetAdjective] control, the [From.GetAdjective] military has asserted enough control over its own borders that a semblance of autonomy is now possible. This is not independence - far from it - but it does mean they no longer have to rely on [Root.GetAdjective] troops to secure their borders, and are thus not so tightly under our control."
 kr.political.101.a: "So be it"

 kr.political.102.t: "Greater [Root.GetAdjective] Autonomy?"
 kr.political.102.d.tfv: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [overlord_name.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to surely lessen as our strength reasserts itself. [Root.GetAdjective] power is not something to be easily contained, and already our leaders are clamouring for more control over our own affairs. Surely our [overlord_name.GetAdjective] will not be able to resist us for long."

 kr.political.103.t: "Greater [From.GetAdjective] Autonomy"
 kr.political.103.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] remains under the control of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, but that control is beginning to lessen as their strength reasserts itself.

 kr.political.106.d.tfv: "[overlord_name.GetAdjective] control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. We are too powerful for them to contain.

 kr.political.107.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] control over the [From.GetAdjective] government has been slipping for some time, now. They are too powerful for us to fully contain. There is a general clamouring among the [From.GetAdjective] people for [From.GetNameDef] to be set free, and now their government has officially submitted a demand for full independence."

 kr.political.107.b: "Are they joking? Forget it"

 kr.political.108.t: "Independence Refused"
