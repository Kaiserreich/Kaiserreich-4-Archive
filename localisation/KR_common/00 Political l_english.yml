### Generic Faction Joining ###
 generic_events.10.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]?"
 generic_events.10.d: "International relations is often fluid, with agreements and alignments quickly shifting from generation to generation. Sometimes even within a generation, pacts are signed and discarded as interests change. The instability fostered after Black Monday and other political developments around the world has heightened fears in many weaker nations that the great powers coming to blows will catch them in the middle.\n\nWhile some turn to isolation either because of their own domestic turmoil or in hopes that neutrality will make them not worth the time for various powers to prey upon them, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has taken the opposite approach. With any internal issues now resolved, the people in [FROM.GetNameDefCap] are now looking outwards hoping to find protection alliances provide. We, perhaps due to superior geographic conditions, military power or ideological consistency are [ROOT.GetFactionName]'s choice of ally.\n\nThe question now remains, do we accept them? Another ally in our pact does mean further resources contributed to our combined forces, though any additional dangers they add for our faction is danger that will be taken into common. Any competing claims need to be taken into consideration, and any discord they may cause between faction members. What should be our decision?"
 generic_events.10.a: "Stronger together!"
 generic_events.10.b: "A fine proposition, forward it to [faction_leader.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]!"
 generic_events.10.c: "On second thought, no..."

 generic_events.11.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.11.d: "Having heard our request to enter their alliance, [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our application and we are now set to become a member of [FROM.GetFactionName]. This will hopefully increase our safety in these troubling times, as we strive to ensure our people's protection from outside powers and foreign meddling.\n\nThat is not to say however this agreement comes for free. We have certain expectations now placed upon us to contribute to the common defence of the nations of [FROM.GetFactionName] and will likely be drawn into conflicts involving this pact. This includes the possibility of being brought into wars initiated by members of this pact.\n\nWe go now into the future together, our fates now intertwined both by words and by force of arms. With any luck, we will gain far more out of this agreement that we have lost in autonomy."
 generic_events.11.a: "Excellent!"

 generic_events.12.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Proposes an Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]"
 generic_events.12.d: "An urgent notice has just come in from the foreign office: [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has asked us to consider bringing [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into our military alliance. Apparently, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] originally proposed the idea to [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef], who believed the idea had enough merit to warrant passing to us.\n\nThe benefits are fairly obvious. In strategy, having more forces available is virtually always a good thing, and [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has acknowledged that it would likely be compelled to participate in all conflicts we may be involved in, regardless of their origin. However, the idea is not without risk — we would be similarly expected to participate in [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s wars, and entering an alliance with them may be contrary to our existing strategic aims. Such questions must always be considered when a new alliance is on the table.\n\nAll that being said, what is our decision?"
 generic_events.12.a: "Let them join."
 generic_events.12.b: "We don't want them."

 generic_events.13.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.13.d: "Good news! After considering [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s proposal, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has accepted our request to join their alliance. With friends like these, we will surely sleep much safer."
 generic_events.13.a: "Excellent."

 generic_events.14.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.14.d: "Good news! After considering our proposal, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has agreed to allow [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into the alliance. We will both surely benefit from the arrangement."
 generic_events.14.a: "Excellent."

 generic_events.15.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.15.d: "Unfortunate news: despite [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s sponsorship, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has rejected our offer to join their alliance. It seems that their aims are not as aligned as once thought."
 generic_events.15.a: "Their loss."

 generic_events.16.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.16.d: "Shocking news: despite our arguing on their behalf, [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has refused to allow [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] into the alliance. Our foreign office has been caught completely off-guard by this development — they believed our strategic thinking to be much closer than it seems to be."
 generic_events.16.a: "What?"

 generic_events.17.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.17.d: "Despite our convincing appeals that we could be an effective contributor and member of their alliance, to our chagrin [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our request to join the [FROM.GetFactionName]. In some ways, this can be expected: alliances are often delicate and wrought with dangers, and some caution is to be expected when making them. Still, this rejection leaves us in a sore spot. Either they have no intentions of defending us or more cynically they see us as a future target on the battlefield.\n\nWe must hurry then to find a working means of national security. Whether this means finding another alliance to shield us from invasion, appealing to multiple factions as a benevolent neutral mediator or whether it means turning inwards to an armed defence, we need to ensure our people's security. The [FROM.GetFactionName] may or may not regret rejecting us, but it is essential that we do not regret this outcome."
 generic_events.17.a: "Their loss."

 generic_events.18.t: "An Alliance with [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]?"
 generic_events.18.d: "International relations is often fluid, with agreements and alignments quickly shifting from generation to generation. Sometimes even within a generation, pacts are signed and discarded as interests change. The instability fostered after Black Monday and other political developments around the world has heightened fears in many weaker nations that the great powers coming to blows will catch them in the middle.\n\nIn an effort to pursue common interests, [FROM.GetFactionName] has banded together into a comprehensive military alliance. They have sought our membership, offering us the potential of further protection (whether from outside threats or from themselves), and in exchange for deepened military and economic ties we will become part of a stronger and united bloc.\n\nJoining however is not without risk. We will likely be drawn into any conflicts that emerge related to this alliance, and it is possible that our contributions will outweigh the benefits we gain from membership. It is essential that as a nation we carefully weigh the costs and benefits of such an agreement."
 generic_events.18.a: "Stronger together!"
 generic_events.18.b: "On second thought, no..."

 generic_events.19.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
 generic_events.19.d: "After some deliberations, [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our invitation to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName], as we had dearly hoped they would. A new member of our alliance is generally welcome,bringing further security for each other and at the very least ensuring peace between the members in it. Their contributions of military forces, funding, and diplomatic weight will hopefully advance the mutual interests of [ROOT.GetFactionName], but there are some concerns ahead.\n\nAnother ally in our pact does mean further resources contributed to our combined forces, though any additional dangers they add for our faction is danger that will be taken into common. Any competing claims need to be taken into consideration, and any discord they may cause between faction members.\n\nWe will need to work diligently to ensure that these issues are smoothened over and that this alliance works for everybody (or at the very least, ourselves). Still, this should not dampen the diplomatic victory we have won today for all of our peoples."
 generic_events.19.a: "Excellent!"

 generic_events.20.t: "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Has Refused!"
 generic_events.20.d: "After some deliberation, to our chagrin [FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected our invitation to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. Unfortunately this is not an uncommon occurrence when it comes to alliance building. Some nations fear the loss of diplomatic flexibility a formal commitment would make, hoping to avoid being drawn into a losing conflict or wishing to join a more suitable alliance. It is also possible that they have designs that are mutually exclusive with our goals, though hopefully not in antagonistic way.\n\nWhatever the case, [FROM.GetNameDef] will not make or break our alliance. Or at least that should be the case if our faction is to have any weight. We will go on to achieve our goals one way or another, and if they are lucky [FROM.GetNameDef] will not regret their poor decision too much."
 generic_events.20.a: "Their loss."

### Incoming War-ning ###
 generic_events.30.t: "Prepare for War!"
 generic_events.30.d: "We have received numerous reports that [From.GetAdjective] troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [Root.GetAdjective] border. Military officials say it is clear [From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [Root.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."
 generic_events.30.a: "We must get ready!"
 generic_events.31.d: "We have received alarming word from [From.GetNameDef] that [From.From.GetAdjective] troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [From.GetAdjective] border. Military officials say it is clear [From.From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [From.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."
 generic_events.32.d: "We have received word from our allies in [From.GetNameDef] that their troops are currently massing, and that a great deal of reconnaissance is taking place across the [attack_target.GetAdjective] border. [From.GetNameDef] is planning an invasion of [attack_target.GetNameDef], one that could begin anytime within the next several weeks."

Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organisation, stating that until the world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralised and militarised to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. "Totalism" is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarisation, centralisation, and totalitarian transformation of society."
 syndicalist_subtype_desc: "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organised in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralised and federal, all industries are organised into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
 radical_socialist_subtype_desc: "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied by some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which vary from movement to movement."
 social_democrat_subtype_desc: "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform and humanise capitalism by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a pluralist form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
 social_liberal_subtype_desc: "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market Liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies, the social liberals aim to create a society in which every individual, regardless of their status, is free to live their own life with full opportunities."
 market_liberal_subtype_desc: "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenets of Market Liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic pluralist political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
 social_conservative_subtype_desc: "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society orderly and stable. Usually, they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
 authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc: "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partially democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. These regimes aim to maintain national stability and provide the people with both a popular and responsible government."
 paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc: "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state-controlled economy."
 national_populist_subtype_desc: "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militarist movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."
