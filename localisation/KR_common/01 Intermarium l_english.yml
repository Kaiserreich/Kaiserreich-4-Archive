A joint military defence fund has been established and [MIE_leader.GetNameDef] has been entrusted with managing it to fund the region's joint defence ventures."

The country responsible for distributing the joint resource pool can invest in its fellow member states to §Ybuild fortifications§!, §Yraise divisions§!, and provide beneficial §YNational Spirits§!.\n\nCurrent pooled resources:\n    £rifle_texticon  Infantry Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_infantry_equipment]§!\n    £support_texticon  Support Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_support_equipment]§!\n    £unit_artillery_icon_small  Artillery Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_artillery_equipment]§!\n\n[MIE_leader.GetNameWithFlag] is currently responsible for distributing the resource pool."
