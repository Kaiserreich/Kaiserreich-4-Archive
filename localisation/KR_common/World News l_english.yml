# Russia starts the war
 worldnews.1.t: "Russia Invades the Reichspakt"
 worldnews.1.d.starts_wk: "For two decades, Germany and Russia have been at peace. Despite the animosity left by Russian defeat in the Great War, the price of five years of foreign and civil war was steep - and neither side wished to pay it again. Not everyone was convinced that this would last.\n\nToday, the sceptics were proven correct: after years of military rearmament and revanchist sentiment, Russia has repudiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and proclaimed their intent to forcefully reverse what they describe as German overlordship over Eastern Europe. As Germany and her allies mobilise against this long-feared threat, Russian artillery strikes have been reported on German positions across the Russian border - the inauguration of the second great war in a generation to shake the continent of Europe."
 worldnews.1.d.joins_wk: "While long anticipated, the outbreak of war between the Internationale and Germany was a dramatic shock - the last time there was war between the great powers of Europe, it quickly spiralled to include the entire continent. Even if they wouldn't act instantly, it was already obvious that Russia, Germany's long-bitter eastern nemesis, has been growing more belligerent in recent years.\n\nAfter much anticipation, [RUS.GetLeader] made a speech early this morning declaring that, in light of recent years, German hegemony over the world has never been more of a myth. While it only obliquely referenced the war, the speech was otherwise bellicose - and was followed by aggressive army postures along Russia's border. Once more, Germany must fight a war on two fronts."

The Hungarians, however, were unwilling to oblige with the dismantlement of their state and privileges within the Monarchy.\n\nIn consequence, the Austrians have announced their intention to both humiliate Hungary and liberate the Slovaks, Transylvanians and Ruthenes by force, and already skirmishes have begun along the Austro-Hungarian border.\n\nOnly time will tell the fate of the former Dual Monarchy."

The Hungarians soon attempted to move into Croatia-Slavonia, but were met by Illyrian troops on the border, who refused to allow the Hungarians into their land.\n\nSkirmishes between the Hungarians and Illyrians have now spiralled into a war that pits the two powerhouses of the Dual Monarchy in Austria and Hungary against the former autonomous components, all of which are fearful of renewed Dualism.

While the mantle of the Third Internationale was taken up by the Communards after the Russian Civil War, the ideological tenor of the event promises to be very different, with Syndicalist parties being the newly dominant force of the far left. Delegates were greeted by a military parade, an exhibition of Avant Garde art and finally a speech by the chairman of the CSP.\n\nAt the top of the agenda is the spread of the revolution to Asia and North America, ongoing conflict in Spain, policy on colonialism and the requirements for membership of the Third Internationale's military alliance."

Now that process has taken another great leap forward, with the creation of [AUS.GetNameDef].\n\nThe Monarchy has restructured its internal structures to be more representative, while institutionally bringing its lands closer together. With the replacement of a decentralised, squabbling Empire with a unified state, the balance of power in Europe has shifted against all enemies of the status quo and the Habsburgs."

The navies and air forces of both belligerents are already being mobilised, and the first shots have already been fired in the Irish Sea.\n\nExperts believe that the intensity of this conflict will be limited due to the large bodies of water separating the belligerents, but it has nevertheless raised world tensions to new heights."

 worldnews.13.d: "British politician and former Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill has published a new book, part of an emerging genre known as \"alternate history\", and concerning the Great War.\n\nThe story takes the perspective of a young British soldier returning from a victorious Gallipoli campaign amid a world radically different from our own. In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic. Churchill has commented that \"Something like this could have happened in another universe\"."

Instead, the Austrians renounced any decentralisation, and consequently the autonomous Slavic states have revolted against the Austrians.\n\nNow, with all other parts of the Empire occupied by Austrian troops or in open revolt, the government in Vienna has announced a return to the Austrian Empire as it was before 1867. Most observers predict the revolts will be crushed, and the return of reaction to Central Europe."
 worldnews.14.d.nopuppets: "After the revolt of Illyria and Bohemia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire looked set to return to the status quo of 1920. Instead, the Austrians refused to let the Hungarians reclaim Croatia-Slavonia, despite all their promises. When the angered Hungarians attempted to take it by force once again, they were promptly invaded by the Landwehr, and were soon defeated.\n\nNow, with all other parts of the Empire occupied by Austrian troops, the government in Vienna has announced a return to the Austrian Empire as it was before 1867 - centralised under Vienna, committed to the status quo and reaction. Though some continue to predict the collapse of the Empire, order has been restored for now."

King Amanullah Khan now hopes to use the turmoil in Delhi following the death of George V to his advantage.\n\nBy repeating the success of the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War, the king hopes to silence the conservative opposition and bring new lands to the crown.

 worldnews.50.d: "Arab nationalism and Turkish imperialism have finally found themselves at odds as talks over the Sinai-Palestine issue have collapsed after Egypt marched its army through the Sinai desert. Nominally united until 1914, the two leading powers in the Middle East are now set on a course to decide the destiny of the Middle East. Even as the Egyptians can count on an array of allies in the other Arab states, many fear that it won't be enough as the military and economic capacity of the Turkish Empire for now still vastly outclasses that of its rival.\n\nForeign investors look to the conflict with fear as well as the oil reservoirs of the Middle East have become more important than ever with the collapse of authority in the United States."

Romania was now dominated by German and Austrian industries, most of her coastline was annexed by Bulgaria, and the Carpathian Mountains separating Romania from Hungary were put under firm Austro-Hungarian control.\n\nThe humiliation Romania endured resulted in it devolving into a National Populist dictatorship, led by the Conducător, Corneliu Codreanu. Codreanu and his Iron Guard set out to restore Romania to what they say it should have been, a titan of the Balkans.\n\nTheir first major move is a large-scale military exercise seemingly in preparation to seize the Carpathians, and perhaps the lands beyond."

Clear failings in leadership during the war against Argentina and the dire strategic situation facing the nation today led to a cabal of military officials seizing power in Santiago, and a number of key strong points in the city and across the country swiftly fell into their hands.\n\nWhere Chile's path now lies remains uncertain, but it appears that another junta rules in Latin America - for now at least."

As the humiliated leadership of Egypt and the other Pact members sign the peace treaty in Beyrut, it has become clear that the situation in the East has changed. The House of Osman lives to fight another day."

The two nations sent representatives to the tiny Ardennes city of Arel in German Luxembourg, near the border with southern Wallonia, and there the future path of Belgium in Europe was decided.\n\nBelgium and the Reich have agreed that in exchange for the Kaiser recognising the formal independence of Brussels, Belgium would rejoin the Reichspakt allowing the Germans to protect them against the aggression of the Commune of France. It appears that the Belgians are willing to compromise their newly-won independence in order to safeguard their future."

With German and Royalist forces gathered on the Meuse for a swift counter-attack, hopes for the survival of Syndicalism in Wallonia fell onto Paris.\nWith tensions rising between the German Empire and the Commune, it seems that France blinked first. Seemingly unwilling to bring down the wrath of Germany on them, even now, France was unwilling to offer guarantees to the Walloon rebels. The survival of the independence movement now seems in doubt, and there are few who believe that King Adelbert's regime will now fall. However, war between the great powers has been avoided - for now."

The survival of Wallonia is assured, and Syndicalism's strength in Western Europe has grown once more. However, war between the great powers has been avoided - for now."

The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism.\nThese statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name \"Totalism\" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosley who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism."

Speaking to an assembled group of military and political officers, two senior Manchu generals - the Emperor's brother Pujie and his uncle Zaitao - announced the launch of a \"National Pacification Campaign\" designed to crush leftists, republicans, and eradicate the \"stench of warlordism once and for all\".\n\nAlready, panicked telegrams from provincial governors have begun to flow into [FNG.GetLeader]'s headquarters in Fengtian, and the German legation is hurriedly preparing to evacuate personnel from dangerous areas."

 worldnews.235.t: "Kaiser Wilhelm II Is Dead"
 worldnews.235.d: "Wilhelm II, the German Emperor, has died of a pulmonary embolism in his home today. One of the last monarchs of the nineteenth century, Wilhelm II tried to continue the legacy of European greatness and world leadership. He initiated the policy of Weltpolitik, which bore fruit after the Weltkrieg as Germany became the foremost power of the world. He was the last leader of the Old School - a bulwark against radicalism, a rallying point in war, a stable leader in unstable times. With his death, Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm will ascend to the throne as Wilhelm III. More of a moderniser and extremist than his father, his succession marks a sea change in German politics and diplomacy. How German partners and rivals will react is yet uncertain, but what is sure is that with Wilhelm II's death, the long waning of the nineteenth century is finally complete."

 worldnews.236.d: "SHANGHAI. Disturbing news has come of the total collapse of Legation Council rule. This news comes on the heels of earlier reports detailing how several unwise financial choices lead to a devastating lack of economic confidence, and ultimately bankruptcy of the Legation Cities. Now the powers formerly making up the Legation Council have all withdrawn from the institution, and the Japanese, Germans, and British have sent in troops to protect their concessions from approaching Chinese forces.\n\nThe Shanghai Municipal Council has assumed control of Shanghai and its former neutral region, but, as demonstrated by ongoing fights between German- and Japanese-backed Chinese troops in the streets, the city is now little more than a prize for the great powers."

The Legation Council has issued an explanatory statement elaborating on their decision. It states that the Germans have clearly violated the provisions of the Beijing Treaty, and that they are no longer a reliable actor in China.\n\nThe Germans have denounced the action, and an attack by the Kaiserliche Marine may be forthcoming.

Chen Jiongming and the Public Interest Party had called for the unilateral end of these treaties since the 1920s and it appears that the UPC has gone through with that promise. This is serious shift in international diplomacy, one that is likely to cause a serious rift between China and the European colonial powers.\nHowever, with the West's power at an all-time low in the Far East, the new Chinese government has taken the chance to reassert itself on the world stage as it seeks an end to what they call the \"Century of Humiliation\", hoping to negotiate new \"equal\" treaties with the great European powers as China marches into the modern world with renewed confidence."

The new president of the republic, Getulio Vargas, will be sworn in in January, but has already promised to deal with a firm hand against the economical issues plaguing the country, and also promises to do better for the common man of Brazil in his victory speech.\n\nHowever, the Republican victory will not mean such an instant end to Brazil's woes, and time will tell if this continued hegemony will have positive consequences."

A surprising result to many observers, others claim that the wide appeal and clear goals of the coalition gave it a broader base than its opponents.\n\nNow, João Mangabeira, curiously the brother of current president Otávio Mangabeira, will take office in January, and he has perhaps the impossible task of keeping a coalition that has everything from social liberals to maximalists from tearing itself apart, as he has to manage this marriage of convenience while making the reforms that got him elected a palpable reality."

The sweeping movement took over Brazil by storm, and its anti political establishment message of faith, national pride, and monarchism found many sympathetic listeners from the poorest neighbourhood to the mightiest manor.\n\nNow the relatively politically inexperienced party has to deal with the burdens of power, and many fear that the fragile alliance between different factions inside the Action may weaken the party. Nonetheless, its influence has now increased quite considerably, and a restoration of the monarchy is considered by observers to be a near certainty at this point."

Conquered earlier by the armies of [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] and governed by [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef], the city had hoped that the last of the carnage was behind them. Unfortunately, conflict would envelop the city once more as [FROM.GetAdjective] troops stormed the city overwhelming the local defenders and raising their flag atop the Bund.\n\n[FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers have already begun the process of looting the areas outside the old International Settlement, while most foreigners are thus far left unscathed, but not without concern that they may be next."

Despite the city's international protections, the victory came somewhat easily, as Shanghai's police forces and limited garrison could put up little resistance against a real army. The general population barely resisted, and their non-cooperation cannot have aided the already bare-bones defences.\n\nThe international city's future now seems unclear, as its prosperity has always been built on the backs of trade and foreign investment. Uncertainty reigns, and the futures of the city's foreign residents are also in doubt."

 worldnews.300.d: "Nicknamed the Paris of South America, Buenos Aires is a leading destination for immigrants from Europe, the regional capital of arts and finance. The main avenues of the city were recently built and along with the construction of South America's tallest buildings and first underground system.\n\nHowever a decisive campaign from the [FROM.GetAdjective] army led to an all out battle in the city streets.

However, by nightfall, it was clear that the Patagonian revolutionaries had secured victory, and the capital of the Argentine regime had fallen.\nA photograph was snapped of the iconic moment when the ecstatic revolutionaries paraded down the main avenue of the city riding the tanks and trucks of the former Argentine regime. However, while the Patagonian government has assured the world that the revolution will be as peaceful as possible, there are already stories of priests and former \"enemies of the state\" herded away at gunpoint."

In the ensuing battle, firefights took place along the famous Alameda avenue.\n[FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers were able to smash through the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] barricades and fortifications on the Paseo Ahumada.

Following the Great War, the revolutions in Britain, France, and Italy did not destroy their old governments, but merely sent them overseas, preparing for a final confrontation ever since.\n\nThat confrontation seems at hand. Earlier today, Canadian warships began forcibly seizing a number British merchant vessels crossing the Atlantic, in what seems like a coordinated move. While posturing between the two navies is known to happen, this time it seems that the Royal Navy is not withdrawing - and instead moving with intent towards Republican waters. The Republican Navy has responded in kind: their war is no longer waiting."

This colony's very existence now seems to be in jeopardy, however, as what German authorities previously described as a small-scale, dying conflict has violently erupted into war.\n\nIn Kenya, a coalition of several different ethnicities have banded together in an insurgency to expel European settlers from the land.

Now, though, this status-quo threatens to shatter as [JAP.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] go to war.\n\nDespite hopes for peace, many have seen this turn of events as inevitable. Japanese plans for an Asia centred around itself were always incompatible with German domination in the region, and with the West engulfed in crisis, Tokyo's leaders doubted whether another chance to realise these ambitions may appear. Whichever side fortune may favour, one thing is for certain - Asia's future hangs in the balance."

Mere hours after his death, officers under Yang Yuting led a coup d'etat with Japanese support and ousted forces loyal to Zhang Xueliang, the Old Marshal's son.\n\nYuting's new regime has already taken a pro-Japanese stance, allowing Tokyo's corporations near unlimited access to the country's vast resources and the IJA to assist in \"keeping order\".

Following the failure of the government to crack down on the nation's nascent Syndicalist movement, conservative officers conducted a coup d'etat, ousting the Prime Minister and establishing a military dictatorship. But even this has proven temporary - officers aligned with the rival Restorationist faction have launched a counter-coup.\n\nAs the streets of Asia's greatest city run red with blood, they have announced the Shōwa Restoration - a restoration of ultimate power to the Emperor, and the rebirth of Japan, free from the corrupting influences of Syndicalism, democracy, and Western influence."

Ultimately, it seems, their efforts were for nought - troops loyal to the government were able to launch a counter-coup and successfully crush the rebels.\n\nYet, this episode has shown without a doubt the parties' weakness.
