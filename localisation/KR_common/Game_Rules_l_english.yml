 ### Game Rules ###
 RULE_GROUP_KAISERREICH_RULES: "General"

 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS: "Early Second Weltkrieg"
 RULE_OPTION_RESTRICTED: "Restricted"
 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_RESTRICTED_DESC: "Almost all paths which could lead to war breaking out between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale before 1939 are blocked, even if this means early confrontations between the two always result in one party backing down."
 RULE_OPTION_RARE: "Rare"
 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_RARE_DESC: "Paths which could lead to war breaking out between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale before 1939 aren't blocked, but the chances that they'll lead to war are very small."
 RULE_OPTION_UNRESTRICTED: "Unrestricted"
 RULE_WK2_BEGIN_OPTIONS_UNRESTRICTED_DESC: "Any early confrontation between the Reichspakt and the Third Internationale could mean a breakout of the Second Weltkrieg, based on the chances involved in any event chain. This means early wars will happen frequently."

 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS: "Division Limits"
 RULE_OPTION_STANDARD: "Applies to All"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_STANDARD_DESC: "Limits have been applied to how many divisions the AI can build, based on their factory counts and economy law level. Once the AI hits this limit, they will simply stop building new divisions. This limit also applies to a player, though for them it's a soft cap and they receive a malus based on how far over the limit they build.\n\n§RNote that this is a system put in place to reduce the inevitable slowdown that happens as a game goes on, as the sheer number of divisions in action is the primary cause of system lag.§!"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_AI_ONLY: "Applies to AI Only"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_AI_ONLY_DESC: "Limits have been applied to how many divisions the AI can build, based on their factory counts and economy law level. Once the AI hits this limit, they will simply stop building new divisions. At this setting, there is no limit to how many divisions a player may build other than their ability to supply manpower and equipment.\n\n§RNote that this will put the player at a considerable advantage against AI countries that would otherwise be of comparable strengths.§!"
 RULE_OPTION_TURN_OFF: "Turn Off"
 RULE_UNIT_LIMIT_OPTIONS_TURN_OFF_DESC: "This turns off the division limit system completely.\n\n§RIt is suggested you only do this if you either don't mind game speeds getting much slower as the game goes on, or you have a VERY hefty computer to run the game.§!"

 RULE_DEMOB_OPTIONS: "Peacetime Demobilisation"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_EXISTS: "Default"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_EXISTS_DESC: "When at peace, the player will be prompted to reduce their economy and/or conscription laws to levels allowed in peacetime and according to their $MODIFIER_WAR_SUPPORT_FACTOR$ within four months. The AI will do the same, though they will do so more quickly and will tend to reduce their laws to lower levels than the player is required to. If unit limits apply to the AI, this will also tend to prompt them to reduce the number of units they have active for performance reasons."
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY: "Applies to AI Only"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY_DESC: "In peacetime, the AI will reduce their economy and/or conscription laws. If unit limits apply to the AI, this will also prompt them to reduce the number of units they have active for performance reasons. The player, however, will never be prompted to reduce their laws."
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_OFF: "Turn Off"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_OFF_DESC: "Neither the player nor the AI will never be prompted to reduce their economy and/or conscription laws in peacetime.\n\n§RIt is suggested you only do this if you either don't mind game speeds getting much slower as the game goes on, or you have a VERY hefty computer to run the game.§!"

 RULE_CONFERENCE_OPTIONS: "Peace Conferences"
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_STANDARD: "Default"
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_STANDARD_DESC: "The AI will take states in a peace conference based on its cores, claims, ambitions, and whether it can reach them."
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_PLAYER_PRIMACY: "Player Primacy"
 RULE_OPTION_CONFERENCE_PLAYER_PRIMACY_DESC: "The AI will refuse to take any states in a peace conference if it involves a player on the winning side. Note that, once this game rule is active, a debug decision will appear which allows the player the option of turning this effect off and back on throughout the game."

 KR_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_OPTIONS: "State & Country Transfer Tool"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_STANDARD: "Inactive"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_STANDARD_DESC: "The State & Country Transfer Tool will be deactivated, and no user interface for it will be visible. Note that this has no effect if the debug option is set in the HoI4 launcher - if it is, then the State Transfer Tool can always be activated by the debug decision."
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_ACTIVE: "Active"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_ACTIVE_DESC: "The single player version of the State & Country Transfer Tool will be active by default, and its custom GUI visible when any state is clicked (unless removed from view with Ctrl-S or deactivated by the debug decision). This will allow states to be transferred between any existing countries, and all cores added or removed.\n\n§RUse at your own risk!§!"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MULTIPLAYER: "Multiplayer - Standard"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MULTIPLAYER_DESC: "This multiplayer version of the State & Country Transfer Tool will be active by default. It works as the single player version, save that only states belonging to the player or one of their puppets (with some puppets ineligible, in situations where they could rebel against the player later in the game) may be marked and no cored can be added or removed.\n\n§RUse at your own risk!§!"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MP_NO_SUBJECT: "Multiplayer - No Subject Transfer"
 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_MP_NO_SUBJECT_DESC: "Works the same as the multiplayer version, save that no subject states can be marked.\n\n§RUse at your own risk!§!"
