### International Workers' Olympiad ###
 iwo.1.t: "A new air in Town"
 iwo.1.d: "There has been something different about the atmosphere of [iwo_host_city] these past few days; and one need only ask a passer-by why that is: despite it still being a week before the date of the opening ceremony, athletes from the entire socialist world have been arriving steadily, their number increasing by the day. The local populace is positively ecstatic to be part of this international an event, and are happily intermingling with the travellers from abroad that our city now hosts."
 iwo.1.a: "Truly an event for the ages."

 iwo.2.t: "The 1937 Workers' Olympiad"
 iwo.2.d: "Today, the 1937 International Workers' Olympiad has been opened in [iwo_host_city]. The ceremony was attended by dignitaries and athletes from the entire socialist world. After a parade through the host city, a mass gymnastics event followed that ended up drawing a crowd of tens of thousands of people. Over the next few days, athletes both local and from abroad will participate in countless events such as Athletics, Cycling and Football.\n\nOrganised by the Socialist Workers' Sport International, the I.W.O. is conceived as the antithesis of the bourgeois Olympic games: where theirs are a showcase of elitist competition, our Games are based on mass-participation and friendship between our peoples. That difference in conception has sure shown its effect in the attendance numbers!"
 iwo.2.a: "What a glorious day for the working man!"

 iwo.5.t: "Homeward Bound"
 iwo.5.d: "The Workers' Olympiad has ended a week ago now, and it has been deemed a great success. For a brief moment, [iwo_host_city] was a place where the many peoples of our movement were able to exchange dreams, hopes and ideals, but all things must come to an end. Even the last stragglers are starting to hop on the trains and busses leaving town, carrying with them homewards memories and stories to tell their families and comrades."
 iwo.5.a: "Too bad it ended."

 iwo.23.t: "Choosing a Host City for the International Workers' Olympiad"
 iwo.23.d: "The Socialist Workers' Sport International have asked us for assistance in planning the 1937 edition of the International Workers' Olympiad. While previous Olympiads have taken place in cities all over Europe, most notably the 1931 Games in Vienna, the worsening political climate have made a Games within the syndicalist bloc the safest bet. It is now up to us to choose a location for the Fifth International Workers' Olympiad."
 iwo.23.a: "Marseille will do."
 iwo.23.b: "Up in Britain, Birmingham shall host."
 iwo.23.c: "Our Italian Comrades will host in Turin."

 iwo.24.t: "Preparing for the Workers' Olympiad"
 iwo.24.d: "While we have had the pleasure to host a Workers' Olympiad in the past, that was in Paris, not Marseille. Attendance numbers are expected to exceed to soar this time around, and we would do better to ensure that the city of Marseille can handle an event of this size."
 iwo.24.a: "To the Work that we must do."

 iwo.25.t: "Birmingham to host the 1937 Workers' Olympiad"
 iwo.25.d: "The Socialist Workers' Sport International have asked us for assistance in planning the 1937 edition of the International Workers' Olympiad. The games are to take place in Birmingham. Attendance numbers are expected to exceed to soar this time around, and we would do better to ensure that the city of Birmingham can handle an event of this size."
 iwo.25.a: "To the Work that we must do."

 iwo.26.t: "Turin to host the 1937 Workers' Olympiad"
 iwo.26.d: "The Socialist Workers' Sport International have asked us for assistance in planning the 1937 edition of the International Workers' Olympiad. The games are to take place in Turin. Attendance numbers are expected to exceed to soar this time around, and we would do better to ensure that the city of Turin can handle an event of this size."
 iwo.26.a: "To the Work that we must do."
