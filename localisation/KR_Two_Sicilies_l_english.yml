### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last twenty years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a member of the Italian Federation and now a sovereign nation. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

SIC_pretty_much_feudalism_desc:0 "Ever since the invasion of the Lombards, our lands have been dominated by large-scale landholders.

SIC_kingpath_desc:0 "A king restored to his throne is the pinnacle of the will of the people; the people of Sicily had every opportunity to reject His Royal Majesty; Why we did not? For the simple fact that a monarchy is the natural state of humanity, and every single group of people requires a leader who leads by example, not power or oppression."

SIC_agrarian_issue_desc:0 "Ever since the invasion of the Lombards, our lands have been dominated by large-scale landholders.

SIC_smaller_navy:0 "Strategic Navy"

### Events ###

sic.1.t:0 "The Legacy of the Civil War"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians signed an armistice in 1919, in which they were allowed to occupy Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. However, outraged nationalists, republicans and socialists rose up against the government for their foolhardy actions in starting a war they were doomed to lose, and when King Victor Emanuel and his son abdicated, the Kingdom of Italy collapsed into anarchy. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and hope seemed lost for the White forces in the south of Italy until the Austrians rejoined the war, in exchange for southern participation in a new political system - the Italian Federation. The Austrians pushed back the syndicalists from Lombardy, and the syndicalist pressure on the Abruzzo line was removed. Following the ceasefire, the south joined the Italian Federation as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but it was always with the understanding that only the promise of Austrian aid kept the Federation intacy. When the syndicalists threatened the south in 1927, Austria's promises of protection vanished... and while the war never materialized, the worth of the Federation was revealed. The Two Sicilies, the Papal State and Sardinia withdrew, leaving Austria's only place of influence the republic in the north."
sic.1.a:0 "Now we are on our own!"

sic.200.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"
sic.200.d:0 "Since the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been mostly focused internally. The Christian Democrats, in power since 1921, have been trying to pursue the age-old dream of land reform in the South. The lack of progress on this front, however, caused the Christian Democrat supermajority to fail in 1927, though a democratic coalition has kept power since, and made some small movements toward land reform in Campania and Capua. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Doje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."
sic.200.a:0 "Long live the kingdom!"

sic.201.t:0 "The Second Risorgimento"
sic.201.d:0 "As for the future of Italy, questions have slowly arisen regarding our place in the coming conflict. Peace on the peninsula is held by a delicate balance: if the syndicalists strike, they must do so without drawing the Third Internationale into battle with them. Should they do so, both Germany and Austria will feel compelled to intervene. They will not, however, feel so compelled if Two Sicilies strikes first. So it is on the Socialist Republic of Italy to make the first move towards a Second Risorgimento, and they must do so without French backing. We must keep a careful watch on the Abruzzo line, to see if they become so bold."
sic.201.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

sic.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Kingdom"
sic.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that began in Germany has spiralled out of control and spread to Italy. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies' prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and confidence in the government has been shaken."
sic.2.a:0 "May God protect us!"

sic.3.t:0 "Poverty and Crime Rises"
sic.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, poverty has skyrocketed and the living standards of many Sicilians have plunged. At the same time, the various criminal cartels and mafiosos have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something."
sic.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

sic.4.t:0 "The Camicie Nere"
sic.4.d:0 "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo. Supposedly led by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom, for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well as disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
sic.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them."

sic.5.t:0 "A Call for New Leadership"
sic.5.d:0 "The Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon claiming that the government's Social Conservative policies are ruining the kingdom and are at fault for Black Monday. He says that it is time for the kingdom to have new leadership with new ideas. Many that support the Social Liberal Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."
sic.5.a:0 "May God protect the kingdom"

sic.6.t:0 "The Liberal Coalition"
sic.6.d:0 "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Conservatives and the Social Liberals. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Democratico Cristiano. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."
sic.6.a:0 "The torch of liberalism shall not fail"
sic.6.b:0 "The new coalition galvanizes opposition"

sic.7.t:0 "Fighting between the Left and Right"
sic.7.d:0 "A rally by the Confederazione Generale Siciliana del Lavoro or the 'Sicilian General Confederation of Labor' for the ruling Partito Democratico Cristiano was disrupted when members of the Camicie Nere disrupted their rally. This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."
sic.7.a:0 "The Union members are innocent"
sic.7.b:0 "They are disloyal traitors"

sic.10.t:0 "The [GetYear] Sicilian Elections"

sic.11.t:0 "Sicilian Welfare Act of [GetYear]"
sic.11.d:0 "With Black Monday over, a number of ministers from the Social Democrat Partito Popolare Demoractico have proposed a plan for an extensive welfare system. However, such a move seems to many as not dissimilar to syndicalism. Thus a more moderate form has been proposed as a counter by the Democrazia Cristiana, which has some attraction even among some of the conservatives. However, the remainder of the conservative faction believes we should not implement any sort of socialist or syndicalist reforms in our country, which is clearly what this is."
sic.11.a:0 "Extensive Welfare"
sic.11.b:0 "Moderate Welfare"
sic.11.c:0 "We shall not bring socialism here!"

sic.19.t:0 "End to the Camicie Nere"

sic.20.c:0 "Democrazia Cristiana"

sic.21.t:0 "Nobility Act"
sic.21.d:0 "One of the first acts of the Integralists was to restore various noble titles. While these were never abolished, many had become purely ceremonial, but today marks a full restoration of rights, making these nobles the leaders of their respective regions. Local rulers are the better rulers after all."
sic.21.a:0 "The Nobility is restored."

sic.22.t:0 "Trade Union Act of [GetYear]"
sic.22.d:0 "The issue of Trade Unions must be dealt with and two proposals have been discussed lately. The first would outlaw and criminalise the Unions altogether. The second would force the trade unions into a single union that would be controlled by the government and be strictly non-socialist."
sic.22.a:0 "Outlaw Unions all together."
sic.22.b:0 "Force them into a controlled state Union."

sic.23.t:0 "Catholic Recreation"
sic.23.d:0 "As part of our new political plan, a program of Catholic-oriented recreation has been created. The program has the local churches sponsoring recreational activities, intertwining support for the Integralist ideology. Such a policy has become rather popular and increases support for our other policies, with the welcome side-benefit of higher church attendance."
sic.23.a:0 "The beauty of God's work."

sic.24.t:0 "Protests Against Dissolving Parliament"
sic.24.d:0 "There have been a number of protests against the government with the permanent dissolution of Parliament, especially from the Partito Democratico Cristiano who are responsible for leading the majority of protests. In order to resolve this issue, three solutions have been proposed.\n\nThe first is to just let them shout and let them tire. The second is to lock them up and silence their voice. The third is to let the black shirts have their way with them."
sic.24.a:0 "Let them Shout"
sic.24.b:0 "Lock Them Up"
sic.24.c:0 "Let the Black Shirts deal with them"

sic.25.t:0 "Integrate the black-shirts?"
sic.25.d:0 "With our control of the country secure, the question is how the Black Shirts should be dealt with. Some want to see them integrated into the secret police, while others think that keeping them as a separate organisation will be best."
sic.25.a:0 "Integrate them"
sic.25.b:0 "Keep them as our Paramilitary Force"

sic.26.t:0 "National Catholic Youth League"
sic.26.d:0 "The National Catholic Youth League has been created to help the youth of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies be taught the ideals of Integralism and Traditional values. The League has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls. By making sure that the youth are enrolled in the organisation this will make sure that they never sway from the government's ideals."
sic.26.a:0 "The Youth are the future."

sic.27.t:0 "Traditional Art Program"
sic.27.d:0 "With a return to traditionalism across the kingdom, traditional artwork has recently begun to be patronised by nobles. Styles that have not be seen in a century or more are once again being used. Traditional artwork is once again popular throughout the Two Sicilies."
sic.27.a:0 "Futurism is all bunk anyway."

sic.28.t:0 "Magna Curia"
sic.28.d:0 "To govern the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Magna Curia has been re-founded. The Magna Curia was the principal organisation of the Kingdom of Sicily in the Middle Ages and it brought forth the nobles of the realm. Unlike the parliaments of today, this was a proper noble court and filled with art and learning. The Magna Curia will henceforth be the new governing body and limited only to the ruling local lords."
sic.28.a:0 "A new Court for an old Kingdom."

sic.29.t:0 "Ennobled Corporate leaders"
