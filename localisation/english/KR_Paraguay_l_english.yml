### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence. However, a romantic nationalist, Estigarribia has only encouraged extreme movements which seek to ultimately depose him. Whether he survives politically is an open-ended question that time alone shall answer."
 POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_RETURNED_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence.\nWith the return of democracy, Estigarribia's political career at first seemed to have come to an end. Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is nowhere near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

 PAR_pensions_desc:0 "War veterans, families of the lost and many other personnel receive rightful compensation for defending our nation in the war for the Chaco. However, doing the right thing is often costly and our budget suffers from all the privileges and good payment for military personnel."
 PAR_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky-high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available."
 PAR_reformed_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky-high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available."
 PAR_bm_desc:0 "More than a fiscal crisis, Paraguay suffers from a harsh case of lack of imports, as the few goods imported to South America rarely reach the nation."
 PAR_bm_selfsuf1_desc:0 "After a series of decisive measures, we have finally re-gained out capacity to acquiring goods and started making said goods in our nation. We are taking the first steps towards true independence, as painful as they are."
 PAR_bm_selfsuf2_desc:0 "We have reached industrial output levels high enough for the government to declare our programs a success. An empty boast when it comes to most metrics, but one that increases national morale and thus increased spending in the short turn, as the people regained faith in the economy and the state recovered much of its losses."
 PAR_slash_desc:0 "Harsh budget cuts were the way chosen to deal with our budgetary issues. It won't go well with the military whose pensions are at risk..."
 PAR_elite_army_desc:0 "Truly with no equal, Paraguay is now truly an Army with a State, as its military forces have achieved such hegemony over all matters, and such mastery of their local warfare, its doubtful for its legacy to fade away."
 PAR_no_pasaran_idea_desc:0 "Those who fought for our nation, even against unimaginable odds; Those who fought against Bolivian aggression and foreign plots, they know what its stake and will never give up as long the fight can continue!"
 PAR_everymanasoldier_desc:0 "Every man is ready to do his duty, and to die for the nation. Paraguay will never again be at the mercy of foreigners, who plot to keep our mighty people under their thumb!"
 PAR_training_desc:0 "Strict regimens and expanded funding ensure that we can send every able-bodied man to the field with proper training."
 PAR_exportseffort_desc:0 "Our economy should not be isolated, and we should not hesitate to help our neighbours to recover. The profits we get by fulfilling their import demands are nothing but byproducts of being a good neighbour, wishing prosperity for the continent."
 PAR_freedom_desc:0 "The rampant nationalist zeal in our country came from more than a lack of faith in common politicians, but the utter failure of our nation to properly protect individuals and free enterprise, leading to war and unrest. Part of these fall on our inability to correct our constitution and move away from the shadowy delusions of leftist vultures."
 PAR_doctrine_review_desc:0 "The best way to learn is by studying your own mistakes. Via constant reviewing and advancing, we will always ensure that our forces are neither outdated nor predictable."
 PAR_I_Love_democracy_desc:0 "Our democracy has never been so strong."
 PAR_PUS_IDEA_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by the ideas of US senator Huey Long, but with a unique militaristic spin, the Estigarribia government has changed its government to its core, and the power of the president is almost unchecked."
 PAR_forwardthinking_desc:0 "If our nation is to move forward in any way, we must ensure that those with the minds and qualification to take it there are properly funded and promoted"
 PAR_workersofthehomefront_desc:0 "Every person must do their part for the state. Everyone will work to aid us the way they can, and the brave Women of Paraguay will help supply our brave armies."

We shall contact them immediately and see if they are willing to stand side by side with us"
 PAR_reclaim_misiones:0 "Destroy Argentina"
 PAR_reclaim_misiones_desc:0 "Now that Argentina is vulnerable, it's our moment to strike, to avenge the defeat of 1870, and to reclaim our rightful territories! To arms!\n§RHostile forces from the west might use this occasion to strike against us while we are distracted fighting Argentina.§!"

 PAR_reclaim_igassu_desc:0 "After the 1870 war, Brazil stole our rightful territories of [1041.GetName] and [1043.GetName]. Now that they are busy fighting elsewhere, it's our moment to strike and recover our lost territories!"

 PAR_reclaim_bolivian_chaco_desc:0 "[From.GetNameDef] took the territory of the Bolivian Chaco from us when we were busy fighting against Argentina, but now that has been dealt with, we can focus our attention on them.

 PAR_urbanize_asuncion:0 "Urbanisation of Paraguay Proper"

 PAR_chaco_boreal_state_cat_up:0 "Encourage Farming in the Chaco Boreal"
 PAR_chaco_boreal_state_cat_up_desc:0 "The Chaco region is scarcely inhabited, but it has tons of free land we can use for farming. Sponsoring farmers to open new farms in the region will help our agricultural exports and encourage immigration to the region.\n§RNote: taking this decision while owning [901.GetName] will unlock a decision to also improve that state!§!"
 PAR_chaco_austral_state_cat_up:0 "Encourage Farming in the Chaco Austral"
 PAR_chaco_austral_state_cat_up_desc:0 "The newly conquered region of the Chaco Austral, rightfully ours, is in dare need of development, since it was left in a backwards state by the Argentinean government. By giving funds to the farmers in the region we are sure the Chaco will be no more a backwards region."
 PAR_misiones_state_cat_up:0 "Encourage Urbanisation in Posadas"
 PAR_misiones_state_cat_up_desc:0 "The newly conquered region of Misiones has just been integrated in our country, and a way to integrate it more deeply will be by proceeding with planned urbanisation in the city of Posadas, the main urban centre in the region. This should ensure the sympathy of the people in the region towards our regime."
 PAR_chaco_boreal_industrialization:0 "Expand Industry in the Chaco Boreal"
 PAR_chaco_boreal_industrialization_desc:0 "The chaco is full of resources, and our booming mining industry should take advantage of that. By providing it more funds we are expecting it to boom even more and bring even more prosperity to our country."
 PAR_chaco_refineries:0 "Build Oil Refineries in the Chaco"
 PAR_chaco_refineries_desc:0 "There is oil in the Chaco, but we need refineries in order to not only sell raw fuel, but also provide fuel to our own country. Building said refineries in the region should help us solving that issue."
 PAR_get_cores:0 "Integration of New Lands"

### Focuses ###

### Economic Tree ###
 PAR_new_challenge:0 "A New Challenge"
 PAR_new_challenge_desc:0 "The Berlin Stock Market has crashed, and its effects are to be felt all around the globe. Its seismic waves have reached Paraguay, and now we have to deal with the enormous damage caused by this economic earthquake. The economy has suffered greatly, so nothing short of radical reforms will help."
 PAR_self_sufficency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
 PAR_self_sufficency_desc:0 "Paraguay's economy is in shambles, but its potential isn't. We should mobilise our budget to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."
 PAR_reform_military_spending:0 " Reform Military Spending"
 PAR_reform_military_spending_desc:0 "Right now we spend tons of money to pay our soldiers, but we don't have enough money to equip them. If we spend less in conscripting and more in producing equipment, we should solve this issue while not cutting the military budget."
 PAR_build_buildsake:0 "Building Roads"
 PAR_build_buildsake_desc:0 "While South America, in general, has an undeveloped industrial base, Paraguay's industry is even weaker. We need to construct new industrial complexes and for industrial purposes suited roads and infrastructures to develop our industrial base."
 PAR_agrieffort:0 "Agricultural Effort"
 PAR_agrieffort_desc:0 "A strong industrial base is vital for a modern economy, but we shouldn't ignore all those who won't build toasters, tanks and trucks. We need to set up agricultural subsidies and agricultural institutions which help our rural farming population."
 PAR_factorio:0 "Import Substitution Program"
 PAR_factorio_desc:0 "A self-sufficient economy can't rely on imports, that's self-explanatory. We should find ways to avoid importing goods, we need to substitute everything that isn't made in Paraguay."
 PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency:0 "Industrial Self Sufficiency"
 PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency_desc:0 "Our self-sufficiency plan works, that's for sure! Paraguay's economy now relies much less on imports and our manufacturing section is growing daily. 'Made in Paraguay' really does work."

 PAR_new_budget:0 "Slash The Budget"
 PAR_new_budget_desc:0 "Our state spends too much money, way too much money. We need to make cuts everywhere and anywhere if we wish to avoid bankruptcy. Most Paraguayans, from bureaucrats to veterans, won't be too happy with this, but we don't want to end up like the French in 1789, now do we?"
 PAR_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
 PAR_national_liberalism_desc:0 "The state can't play god, that is a sad reality. Instead of handing over the economy to the bureaucrats, we need to liberalise it in favour of private enterprise and economic freedom."
 PAR_export_focus_economy:0 "Export Focused Economy"
 PAR_export_focus_economy_desc:0 "The Paraguayan market is quite small, but the German market isn't. In order to maximise the strength and the profits of the Paraguayan economy, we need to augment the exportation of Paraguayan goods to the whole world."
 PAR_increase_yields:0 "Increase Mining Yields"
 PAR_increase_yields_desc:0 "The mining sector is relatively small, but even then the Chaco still has quite important resource deposits. We need to increase the productivity of the mining sector so that we can export more primary resources."
 PAR_cut_veterans_pensions:0 "Cut Veteran's Pensions"
 PAR_cut_veterans_pensions_desc:0 "The pensions paid to the veterans of Paraguay are simply too high for the state to support. We need to cut their pensions, even if this will severely anger all those affected."
 PAR_cut_military_incentives:0 "Cut Military Incentives"
 PAR_cut_military_incentives_desc:0 "Our military is quite enormous in comparison to the state. Our military spending is far too high, and it has not stopped rising. We need to cut military incentives before our state collapses under the burden of the military budget."
 PAR_a_day_to_remember:0 "History or Death!"
 PAR_a_day_to_remember_desc:0 "This is a day when the destiny of Paraguay will be decided. Will democracy be able to hold, or will radical forces prevail?"
 PAR_how_am_I_still_alive_questionmark:0 "Democracy Has Been Saved!"
 PAR_how_am_I_still_alive_questionmark_desc:0 "Forces loyal to the Estigarribia and the Colorados were able to repel extremism. Now the country and our fragile democracy have been saved, and a bright future shines in front of Paraguay and its people."
 PAR_military_angery:0 "The Military Takes Control!"
 PAR_military_angery_desc:0 "Turns out, cutting the budget of the military in a country where the military IS the country is not exactly a popular move. Now that the military took control, we will have to see what will come for Paraguay and its people."
 PAR_black_monday_is_over:0 "A Stronger Paraguay!"
 PAR_black_monday_is_over_desc:0 "We have faced the biggest economic crisis of the century, but we were able to overcome it. Our nation has never been that strong, and the future smiles on us, for peace and justice await us in the future."

 PAR_frick_economy_desc:0 "No more foreigners will be able to dictate what the economy of our country should be! We will be the masters of our own destiny, for no one can dictate it. The foreigners can be mad at us, we don't care about them nor about trading with them. There is only one thing we will fight for, and that will be our proud and shining nation!"

### Military Trees ###

### Army Tree ###
 PAR_defensores_del_chaco:0 "Defensores Del Chaco"
 PAR_defensores_del_chaco_desc:0 "Our beautiful nation has significantly grown in the last years at the cost of Bolivia. Our glorious soldiers have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but now it's time to consolidate our gains. The Chaco will forever remain Paraguayan!"
 PAR_doctrine:0 "Doctrine Review"
 PAR_doctrine_desc:0 "A major army reformation is required to defend our vast country. One of the most important things a modern army needs is a definite, efficient military doctrine. We need to overhaul ours to ensure that our army will win every battle."
 PAR_women_in_the_workforce:0 "Women in the Workforce"
 PAR_women_in_the_workforce_desc:0 "Our country, despite being more than twice the size of Uruguay, has half its people. Our male population is not enough to produce everything we need, and we need to have also our female population produce our weapons. While some conservative elements might protest this measure, we don't really have that many options to go with."
 PAR_pupupupush:0 "Concentrated Fire"
 PAR_pupupupush_desc:0 "We cannot let the enemy reorganise and consolidate their forces after one of our successful offensives. We must attack them until we arrive in their capitals so that they will never have time to rest."
 PAR_firepower:0 "Superior Firepower"
 PAR_firepower_desc:0 "Our nation doesn't have as many fighting-able men as Argentina or Brazil, so we need to compensate our low manpower with high firepower. Let's adopt a doctrine focusing on superior firepower and combat strength."
 PAR_harry_spotter:0 "Spotters & Scouts"
 PAR_harry_spotter_desc:0 "There is one major issue with long-range artillery pieces: If we don't know where exactly the enemy is, we will just blow up a few squirrels. We need spotters and scouts that can accurately report the position of the enemy."
 PAR_shock_n_awe:0 "Shock & Awe"
 PAR_shock_n_awe_desc:0 "Speed is the key to all modern war. It must be the main focus of our army if we are to defend our national borders."
 PAR_military_science:0 "Military Science"
 PAR_military_science_desc:0 "The process of reinventing our military doctrine was long and exhausting as we were missing enough theorists and military experts. We should invest more in military science to avoid this situation from happening again."

 PAR_logistcial_expertise:0 "Logistical Expertise"
 PAR_logistcial_expertise_desc:0 "One of the largest Bolivian shortcomings during the Chaco War was their supply system, as their communication and supply lines were inadequate. We should learn from their mistakes so we don't repeat them."

 PAR_new_army:0 "The New Army"
 PAR_new_army_desc:0 "Our glorious army won against Bolivia, but many doubt that we will win against Argentina or Brazil, who both own lands that are rightfully ours. We need to modernise and professionalise our army."
 PAR_guns:0 "Improved Equipment"
 PAR_guns_desc:0 "Our equipment is rather outdated, which gives us a disadvantage on the battlefield. We need to modernise and improve them to keep up with the armies of our rivals."
 PAR_supply_capabilities:0 "Army Railways"
 PAR_supply_capabilities_desc:0 "A large issue that the Bolivian army faced in the Chaco War was the lack of proper infrastructure suited for military usage. We should not make the same mistake: We need to construct railways suited for military transportation."
 PAR_milfac:0 "Intensify Military Production"
 PAR_milfac_desc:0 "Our new railways have a large transportation capacity, but if our production capacity is low, we will not be able to use these railways. We need to increase the production of military equipment."
 PAR_extreme_training:0 "Superior Training"
 PAR_extreme_training_desc:0 "Unlike the veterans of the Chaco War, the new recruits have little actual combat experience. We need to improve our training to keep a relatively high standard of experience in our army."
 PAR_every_man_a_soldier:0 "Every Man a Soldier"
 PAR_every_man_a_soldier_desc:0 "Our population is roughly one million. In comparison, Argentina is the home of almost fourteen million. We need as many men as possible to fill our army if we wish to reclaim our rightful lands."
 PAR_no_pasaran:0 "No Pasaran!"
 PAR_no_pasaran_desc:0 "Every man in Paraguay knows how to handle a rifle, and is willing to employ his knowledge if the enemy dares to advance in our sacred land. The enemy shall pay in blood for every meter of Paraguayan land he conquers."


 PAR_extreme_army:0 "An Army With No Equal"
 PAR_extreme_army_desc:0 "Nowhere in the world, not even in 19th century Prussia, has an army been so well integrated into the state that it forms a union with the other national institutions. Nothing is as mighty as our armed forces."
 PAR_general_staff_power:0 "General Staff Review"
 PAR_general_staff_power_desc:0 "Our army has greatly expanded, but our general staff has been lacking behind in personnel. We need to review our general staff to increase its command capacity and effectiveness."
 PAR_specialforcetraining:0 "Extend Special Forces Training"
 PAR_specialforcetraining_desc:0 "Specialised units always require more training than their ordinary counterparts. We need to increase the effectiveness of the training so that more soldiers can effectively fight as members of a specialised unit."

 PAR_need_a_dispenser_here:0 "Expand the Engineers Corps"
 PAR_need_a_dispenser_here_desc:0 "It is said that the infantryman's best friend is its shovel, and that is true especially in regards to the engineers corps. By providing them better equipment and stricter drills, we can expect our engineers to become the best engineers of Southern America."
 PAR_planning:0 "Well Planned Attacks"
 PAR_planning_desc:0 "We can't let our soldiers charge in a disorganised way to the enemy machine guns, we need to plan thoroughly our attacks in order to minimize the casualties and strike like thunder, shattering the enemy forces and breaking them like a twig."
 PAR_anti_air:0 "Static Anti Air"
 PAR_anti_air_desc:0 "Despite our efforts in creating an air force, we simply lack the capabilities to build one. In order to protect our homeland we should invest into static anti air stationings capable of taking down even the biggest of the bombers out there."
 PAR_river_patrols:0 "River Patrols"
 PAR_river_patrols_desc:0 "Paraguay has many rivers patrolled by gunboats, each one carrying a huge amount of firepower compared to what a rifle can do. If we can coordinate them to the army, we will be able to make every one of our rivers uncrossable for the enemy."
 PAR_army_railways:0 "Army Railways"
 PAR_army_railways_desc:0 "It's been proved by Von Moltke the senior that railways can change the course of a war, yet we are reluctant to expand them. Well, not anymore, our army will now be able to strike faster than a hawk."
 PAR_army_of_the_future:0 "The Army of the Future"
 PAR_army_of_the_future_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, our army can't be really said to be modern: we lack airplanes, tanks, trucks, and way more equipment to effectively turn into a modern army. While we can't produce that, we can at least research them for the future."
 PAR_big_planes:0 "Bombers Research"
 PAR_big_planes_desc:0 "Bombers can shatter enemy railways and enemy factories, but they are incredibly expensive to build. We can hope that in the future we will be able to produce them, but for now all we can do is research them."
 PAR_paraguayan_bias:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 PAR_paraguayan_bias_desc:0 "There is a new king of land warfare. It's not the infantryman, it's not the artilleryman, and it's not the horse. That is the tank, a steel monster that can spout fire and cannot be stopped. If we wish that our soldiers will be able to face enemies in the future, investing in tanks is the right move."

### Air Tree ###
 PAR_defensores_del_cielo:0 "Defenders of the Sky"
 PAR_defensores_del_cielo_desc:0 "Our beautiful blue sky is the home of many rare birds, but sadly our enemy doesn't seem to respect its quietness. We need to form a professional air force to defend the Paraguayan sky!"
 PAR_cas_focus:0 "Low Altitude Craft"
 PAR_cas_focus_desc:0 "Industry and infrastructure aren't the only bombing targets there are, enemy units are also great targets. In order to effectively weaken enemy forces, we need more agile low flying bomber aircraft."
 PAR_fighters:0 "Fighter Aircraft"
 PAR_fighters_desc:0 "If we wish to use bombers and close air support aircraft effectively, we need to first achieve air superiority. We need specialised fighter aircraft to intercept and destroy enemy planes."

 PAR_estigarribato:0 "The Estigarribiato"

### Colorado ###
 PAR_colorado_resurgence:0 "Colorado Resurgence"
 PAR_colorado_resurgence_desc:0 "The last Colorado president Paraguay has had was in 1912 with Pedro Pablo Peña who was deposed very quickly. This has left our country with a nearly unchallenged Liberal rule for decades. However, broken promises from the liberals and an ailing economy are leaving many Paraguayans disillusioned. We shall reach out to the common Paraguayan and offer them the solutions the Liberals didn't give them."
 PAR_true_values:0 "True Values"
 PAR_true_values_desc:0 "The Colorados has always been a conservative party. During the liberal governments, the Paraguayan populace was forced through several progressive reforms which many didn't agree with. Now that we're in power, we shall take steps to protect our nation's traditional and familiar values to secure our society for a better, more stable tomorrow."
 PAR_prosperity:0 "Prosperity and Progress"
 PAR_prosperity_desc:0 "We Colorados know that the only way forward for our country is with hard work. We have to focus this spirit towards achieving economic prosperity and progress, that way we shall both be true to our ideals and help our country get back on its feet."
 PAR_individual_freedoms:0 "Individual Freedoms"
 PAR_individual_freedoms_desc:0 "The Liberals had a mouthful of how their progressive reforms were helping the country. They proved to be unreliable and treacherous. We shall champion individual values and begin legal reforms to include individual freedoms into our current law code."

### Shared tree between liberals and colorado ###

 PAR_democracy_survives:0 "Sane and Free Elections"
 PAR_democracy_survives_desc:0 "Our democracy survived, and with free elections the people of Paraguay can rejoice and exercise their right to vote. With extremism at bay, we will see who will come to power between Estigarribia's liberal party or the conservative Colorados. May the best party win!"
 PAR_policy_on_the_army:0 "Policy On The Army"

### Events ###
 par.1.t:0 "The Republic of Paraguay"
 par.1.d:0 "After the devastating War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguay was shattered and broken almost beyond recognition; the vast majority of its male population dead or orphaned. The extreme demographic and economic damage was not all, however, as both Brazil and Argentina took slices of land off the Guarani Republic and effectively only kept its sovereignty as a buffer state between the two nations. Rebuilding and recovering from that disaster was no easy feat, and political instability still corroded the nation. In 1904, a Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability, which culminated in a Civil War in 1922 between rival political factions. Then, in late 1929, war again came to Paraguay by the hand of Bolivia. That nation, under economic pressure to secure the rumoured oil wells of the Chaco region, aggressively started to assert its claims in the disputed area. The Chaco War took four gruesome years, and by 1933 Paraguay had completely routed the Bolivian forces and was starting to occupy their lands. The total victory did not come without a cost, however, as mounting debt and military expenses continue to be a burden on the government. The Bolivian military was poorly equipped and poorly trained to fight in the region, and its low morale meant the Paraguayan casualties were far smaller. The political situation did not improve, however, and the Liberal rule was faltering. Rafael Franco and other radical leaders launched a coup in 1934 based on left-authoritarian principles but were deposed after a short three-month rule by Chaco War hero José Félix Estigarribia. Now, the age of liberal chaos is over, and José Felix's rule is one of great peace; his actions against the \"Syndicalist\" Franco and Bolivian invaders greatly influenced politics, as he is now almost unanimously acclaimed as a national saviour and hero. With the rise of the Argentinean Patriotic League, Estigarribia and his cabinet are again in high alert, as Manuel Carlés did little to hide his expansionist goals in his speech upon ascending to leadership. War may soon be upon Paraguay once again."
 par.1.a:0 "Estigarribia has brought Peace and Justice to our new Republic. We can't fall!"

 par.2.t:0 "Anti LPA Rally"
 par.2.d:0 "Argentina's new President, Manuel Carlés, is relentless in his smear campaign against Paraguay and other countries he deems enemies of the Argentinean state. Today in Asuncion, hundreds of people gathered to protest his insults and his rhetoric, demanding an official diplomatic break between our nations. While this is unlikely to happen, such a danger is politically good for the army, as the threat of war is a reminder of who saved Paraguay a few short years ago."
 par.2.a:0 "Argentina can't regain its greatness; it never had any!"

 par.3.t:0 "Black Monday ravages our Economy"
 par.3.d:0 "Paraguay, despite being a landlocked nation, is connected to the wider global economy via the port in Asuncion and the Rio de la Plata basin. The stock market crash news first arrived to us as a curiosity, but the effects were soon felt. Foreigners can't buy our products, and we are having immense difficulties in importing vital goods for our nation. Worse still, the budgetary situation has entirely collapsed, and retired military personnel are already up in arms, ready to defend their rights should we encroach on them in any way. Truly, bad times are ahead, and Paraguay may very well have to live in commercial isolation..."
 par.3.a:0 "We have to prepare for difficult times."

 par.4.t:0 "Military Payment Issues"
 par.4.d:0 "Our budgetary issues predictably resulted in the reduction of the pay of several military officers, especially among lower ranks. This situation affects morale, leading to desertion, resignations and small protests in the army. Whatever we do, and even after we asked for their understanding considering the situation, the dissatisfaction continues to get worse."
 par.4.a:0 "Please understand us!"

 par.5.t:0 "Pensioners Protest!"
 par.5.d:0 "Veterans and other pensioners have protested in very large numbers after the announcement of delays to their payments. Usually, such protests would have been quickly over, but now the payment delays also extend to low ranking officers and soldiers who are normally in charge of dealing with such rabble and now refuse to intervene. With both local soldiers and veterans united in protest, there isn't much left to do about it than to wait it out."
 par.5.a:0 "Wait and the situation will improve."

 par.6.t:0 "Military Discontent"
 par.6.d:0 "The payment issues have not affected every single Paraguayan soldier, but discontent spreads like the plague in the barracks as no improvement of the situation is visible to the common soldier. A few quartelazos and other minor revolts have been suppressed, but we are unsure for how long we can sustain the situation."
 par.6.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 par.7.t:0 "Rafael Franco in Exile"
 par.7.d:0 "Ever since he was ousted from the government due to his radical syndicalist ideas, Rafael Franco further delved into Left-Wing rhetoric in exile in Chile. Now styling himself a 'Solanist Totalist', he clamours for Revolution in Paraguay from his exile. For years, few paid any heed to him, just one of the many deposed despots in this world, but now, with our position threatened, he directly calls for a coup that would allow his return. And the worst part is that he actually finds some who are willing to listen..."
 par.7.a:0 "Ramblings of a madman."

 par.8.t:0 "Disturbances in the Chaco"
 par.8.d:0 "Bolivia's foul plots are endless. As they again began a war of aggression to claim the Chaco from us and give it to their corporate masters, we are facing infiltrators and sabotage in the areas liberated in the previous war. Their disruptions, while small, are symbolic of how far Bolivian treachery can go."
 par.8.a:0 "They will see things our way in time."

 par.9.t:0 "Huey Long is elected President of the United States"
 par.9.d:0 "Former US Senator Huey Long has been successful in his bid to be elected President of the United States of America in an incredibly contentious election. Running against Syndicalist and sell-out candidates alike, Long has managed to triumph in key states of that nation and prove that the people of the Americas had enough of the elites who seek to put us down and sell our wealth rather than share it! Many Paraguayan papers had begun to shower the man with praise before the ballots were even finished being counted. Time will tell if his foul foes will accept the loss gracefully."
 par.9.a:0 "Congratulations Amigo!"

 par.10.t:0 "Aid the American Union State?"
 par.10.d:0 "The United States are under Siege! Huey Long has been challenged by Syndicalist and Banker thieves and they seek to enslave the people of North America by force. Long is an extremely popular person in Paraguay, as he was the only foreign politician to see the truth and denounce the war of greed Bolivia led against us in the Chaco, propelling him to celebrity status. The popular outcry was thus strong when news reached Paraguay, with many vocal unemployed veterans of the Chaco War demanding an official intervention. Tired of waiting, now all they request is material aid and ships to send them to the US to fight for Peace and Justice in the name of our nation."
 par.10.a:0 "We must help our American friends to free their nation!"
 par.10.b:0 "We can help, but we should be careful not to spend too much."
 par.10.c:0 "We can't afford it, sadly."

 par.11.t:0 "The Chaco Brigade Arrives!"
 par.11.d:0 "From the small nation of Paraguay comes the brave Chaco Brigade. Named after a disputed area, which caused a war fuelled by greed and denounced by the Kingfish publicly here in the States, the folks in Paraguay regard him as the only foreigner to see the truth behind that war and to tell things the way they are. Long's popularity only kept rising in the past few years, and news of the coup against democracy have outraged the Paraguayan populace, and many thousands have decided to lend a hand to us in this final struggle for the very soul of America."
 par.11.a:0 "Our cause is just!"

 par.12.t:0 "Paraguayan Congratulations!"
 par.12.d:0 "With the end of the conflict, it seems as though we finally have some time to breathe. Letters from Paraguayan citizens, personally thanking the Kingfish for his fight for freedom and against Syndicalism, keep flocking from the small South American nation that regards Long as a true hero."
 par.12.a:0 "Peace is its own reward, but we thank them nonetheless."

 par.13.t:0 "Military Revolt!"
 par.13.d:0 "The recent cut of the military budget was the last straw. Temporary cuts in wages and delays in payments could be accepted, blamed on the situation. But attacking the military of the Paraguayan state, the sole hero of the Chaco War, could not have been done without consequences.\n\nHearing, the news of this plan, the rumors spread among the soldiers, in the barracks across the country, : \"Estigarribia has to go, he betrayed the nation!\". Several patriotic generals and officers took advantage of the situation and presented themselves as the alternative, touring barracks to expose their views and prepare an uprising.\n\nBack in Chile, Rafael Franco wasn't oblivious to the situation at home. Informed by frequent letters of his supporters, he orchestrated from Santiago a violent takeover, repeating his short-lived coup of 1934. In much the same way, his supporters in the army came and go in the barracks, preparing the minds with propaganda and securing the coup regiments by regiments. In this bubbling atmosphere, loyalties weren't gained only by morals, but also with bread. The seditious generals and Franco didn't hesitate to use their personal funds to win over useful regiments.\n\nFinally, several barracks rose up today across the country against our failed economic policies, and it seemed that democracy stood on its knees. The soldiers loyal to the Patriots or to Franco moved against places of power, and the takeover attempt degenerated into open fight in the streets of Asuncion. Some units still loyal to Estigarribia and the Colorado party have, however, sworn their loyalty to the regime, and fought to defend the democratic state. The fights took until dusk in the capital and claimed many lives, but finally the fighting stopped and when dust settled on the presidential palace, there was a clear winner:"
 par.13.a:0 "Morinigo and the Patriotic Officers have saved the Nation!"
 par.13.b:0 "Franco's units have won, and the General was able to return!"
 par.13.c:0 "Units loyal to the Liberals and the Colorado were able to restore order!"

 par.14.t:0 "Huey Long Heading to Paraguay"
 par.14.d:0 "The War in North America took a turn for the worse, and Huey Long was forced to flee with the traitorous forces closing in on him. Nothing would please them more than his death, thus his request for asylum here in Paraguay was accepted immediately. The American hero is scheduled to reach Asuncion shortly. A scheme involving ships with Paraguayan flags will ensure he evades capture by traitors, and once he gets here, he will receive a proper hero's welcome!"
 par.14.a:0 "We are waiting for him!"

 par.15.t:0 "1941 Elections"
 par.15.d:0 "It's election day in Paraguay, and the outcome of these elections is far from being clear, since in the previous ones no one got an absolute majority. The two main contenders are, as always, the Colorados led by Juan Manuel Frutos and the Liberals led by no others than José Félix Estigarribia. The results from the ballots are in, and the winner is..."
 par.15.a:0 "The Estigarribiato comes out on top."

 par.16.t:0 "1946 Elections"
 par.16.d:0 "While the success in the previous elections for the Estigarribiato was a welcome surprise, now it is yet again time for elections. As per usual, the Colorados are the only other party besides the liberals that could achieve a majority, and with the ballots closed, the results are in."
 par.16.a:0 "Unsurprisingly, Estigarribia wins again."
 par.16.b:0 "Juan Manuel Frutos and the Colorados win."

 par.17.t:0 "1951 Elections"
 par.17.d:0 "The liberals were able to secure a majority with ease five years ago, but yet again, the Colorados run for the elections and could achieve a majority in the parliament. The results are in, and the party with a majority in the parliament is..."
 par.17.a:0 "The Liberals again!"
 par.17.b:0 "The Colorados are able to secure a win!"

 par.18.t:0 "1956 Elections"
 par.18.d:0 "Unsurprisingly the only two parties that can hope to achieve a victory in this election are yet again the liberals and the Colorados, with both conducting a very fierce electoral campaign, luckily without violence. Now the election is over, and the results are in."
 par.18.a:0 "The Liberals stay in power."
 par.18.b:0 "A surprising Colorado victory!"

 par.19.t:0 "1946 Elections"
 par.19.d:0 "Despite the success in the previous election, the Colorado rule is anything but secure as the campaign rhetoric ramps up to new hostile levels. While violence was avoided, many worry the elections results may not be recognised, but the Army has already declared it will ensure the elections will be orderly. As the dust settles, the Paraguay's president is..."
 par.19.a:0 "Juan Manuel Frutos, a Colorado."
 par.19.b:0 "Eusebio Ayala, and old school Liberal."

 par.21.t:0 "1951 Elections"
 par.21.d:0 "They say politics makes for strange bedfellows. As the Liberal's struggled to settle on a candidate, Luis Alberto Riart, once deposed from office, tries to run again for that party, running against consistently fierce Colorado opposition. As the ballot counting ends, the winner emerges as being..."
 par.21.a:0 "Raimundo Rolón, a Colorado."
 par.21.b:0 "Luis Alberto Riart, the Old Liberal."

 par.22.t:0 "1956 Elections"
 par.22.d:0 "Two military men meet in the unique battlefield of Paraguayan bipartisan elections. Raimundo Rolón has the backing of the Colorado party behind him, but his opponent has weight all by himself: José Felix Estigarribia wants to become president yet again, this time under a democratic framework. The winner of this battle of battlers is..."
 par.22.a:0 "Raimundo Rolón for the Colorados."
 par.22.b:0 "José Felix Estigarribia, the Old Marshall."

 par.20.t:0 "Paraguay in the Internationale?"
 par.20.d:0 "The tiny South American nation has recently experienced a socialist revolution and after initial stabilisation now looks at its role on the global front. While their contributions to the Internationale will be mostly negligible, an ally is an ally and we are in no position to deny further members to our alliance."
 par.20.a:0 "Welcome!"
 par.20.b:0 "Wasn't it called Uruguay? Doesn't matter, we don't need them."

 par.201.t:0 "France Denies us Membership to the Internationale"
 par.201.d:0 "Calling our nation an irrelevant backwater with no value whatsoever to their alliance, France has denied us membership and sent our ambassadors packing."
 par.201.a:0 "They will regret this!"

 par.24.t:0 "The Status of our Army after the Chaco War"
 par.24.d:0 "Our victory in the Chaco war came with a heavy price, we took on many casualties and left our country bleeding. Our troops were constantly underequipped and undersupplied, we were able to win only because of the fierce determination of our troops and because our generals excelled in leading them. However, many casualties could have been avoided. We need to reform if we want to avoid continuing in this path and suffering such catastrophe as the terrible war of the Triple Alliance again."
 par.24.a:0 "Reform is needed!"

 par.25.t:0 "The Hardship of Building a Modern Army"
 par.25.d:0 "Tanks and bombers. Incredible machinery capable of turning the sides of a war, but they come with a price. A price we can't pay. Our small nation can't afford to produce them since these equipmnets are incredibly difficult and expensive to make. Our few industrial units can't keep up with the cost and expertise needed to produce them. Obviously, this might change one day, but for now we should focus on our expert infantry army. This doesn't prevent us from investing in obtaining these technologies however, as it might be useful one day."
 par.25.a:0 "Let's hope we will see Paraguayan tanks!"

 par.26.t:0 "Snap Elections"
 par.26.d:0 "Adding to the economic crisis, a political crisis developped. The position of the Liberal Party which supports Estigarribia's regime was weakened, and the situation becomes more and more difficult to manage against the opposition. The conservative Colorado Party has been pushing for a while to hold an election to oust Estigarribia out of office. Today, the President announced that their wish has finally been granted, a snap election will indeed be organised. With the instability, Paraguayan citizens will be asked to choose between the security of Estigarribia's liberals and the fresh impetus from the conservative Colorados. Nothing is assured, and the ballots decree that the winner is..."
 par.26.a:0 "Estigarribia is able to hold but has to form a coalition with the moderate Liberals."
 par.26.b:0 "The Colorados are able to come out on top by a slim majority."

 par.27.t:0 "Mining Industries in the Chaco"
 par.27.d:0 "The Chaco war has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While not present in the Chaco Boreal, this region has other resources to offer such as iron, bauxite and copper, very useful for our small domestic industry. Indeed we don't have the capacity to import a huge amount of resources, unlike other nations such as America, Germany or Russia, which have a huge minerary industry and a budget that allows them to trade and import resources without blinking an eye. Winning the Chaco war and acquiring oil helped us move towards that direction, but the deposits at our disposal are still very limited. Still, it's better than nothing, and we expect to be able to increase the amount of resources extracted year after year."
 par.27.a:0 "We shall work on expanding this booming industry then!"

 par.28.t:0 "Oil in the Chaco"
 par.28.d:0 "The Chaco war has been fought over the presence of oil in the region. While initial prospects made us expect to find oil in all of it, we were able to find it only in a small border region with Bolivia, very close to the border, but still in our hands. By controlling the most important resource in the world, albeit in a small number, we expect to be able to gain the upper hand in many negotiations, since almost all of our neighbours don't have oil fields nor have the capacity to import it. While we lack the numbers that Americans or Azeri oil fields can produce, this is still a relatively large amount, enough to be able to supply our small army, and with those refineries we expect to be able to produce even more oil both to export and to use for domestic use. This new industry should give a huge boost to our economy."
 par.28.a:0 "Since oil makes the world move, we might as well get involved in the business."

 par.29.t:0 "In the Hell of the Chaco"
 par.29.d:0 "This movie was shot in 1932 by Argentinean director Roque Funes. It describes the horrors of the Chaco war and how the proud Paraguayan army overcame difficulties until its victory. The movie was thought lost for years, but it has recently been discovered by the Estragó family. It has premiered in Asuncion recently, was positively welcomed by the critics for its narrative and was praised by the army as very accurate and representative of the spirit of the Paraguayan army. This is a historical moment for the cinematographic scene of our nation, and we hope that this will inspire Paraguayan movie makers to be more enterprising."
 par.29.a:0 "Very nice movie, 7.8/10, not enough water"

 par.30.t:0 "Agustín Barrios tours America"
 par.30.d:0 "Agustín Pío Barrios is a famous Paraguayan guitarist who was able to achieve one of his dreams, that being touring America, with the first performance being held in San Juan, on the island of Puerto Rico. During said tour he was even able to play the famous song "Every man a king" with senator Huey Long himself when he toured the beautiful state of Louisiana, in Baton Rouge. Like most Paraguayans, Barrios admires Long for his stand against Bolivian aggression in the Chaco War. In this occasion the Paraguayan ambassador, who was escorting mister Barrios during his tour, expressed his best wishes to governor Long in regards for his presidential campaign, hoping that he will come out on top as the 31st president of the United States of America."
 par.30.a:0 "He was able to play Every man a king on a guitar? Mister Barrios is truly amazing!"

 par.31.t:0 "Snatching the Chaco region"
 par.31.d:0 "Now that Paraguay is busy fighting a war with Argentina, it's our moment to strike and seize the Chaco. While we can't realistically hope to take all of it since our army is still recovering from the defeat of the Chaco war, we can occupy the border region known as the Bolivian Chaco. Considering that the Paraguayan army is busy fighting the Argentineans, we are sure they won't wage war against us if we occupy it."
 par.31.a:0 "Occupy the region."
 par.31.b:0 "No, I don't think I will."

 par.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] occupies the Bolivian Chaco!"
 par.32.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] forces have just occupied the border region known as the Bolivian Chaco while our army is fighting Argentina. While our national pride tells us to retaliate and attack them, reason tells us to let it slide, since we can always come back later and focus on them once we have destroyed Argentina."
 par.32.a:0 "They can keep it, for now, we will come back for it later."
 par.32.b:0 "Screw reason, we won't give up our territory!"
 
 par.33.t:0 "Socialist coup in Paraguay!"
 par.33.d:0 "Worrying news from Asuncion! We have received a report that Rafael Franco returned from his exile and has now couped the Paraguayan government. They have declared they have no interest in continuing being part of an anti-syndicalist defensive pact and the previous treaty is now null. From now on, we will have to rely on one less ally."
 par.33.a:0 "You are joking - not another one! Oh, for God's sake, I can't, this is the second time a socialist coup happens in Paraguay in less than a decade."

 par.34.t:0 "Victory against Argentina!"
 par.34.d:0 "There is no man more heroic than he who stands against giants, and there is no nation more heroic than the small one which defies those that seek to dominate them - and the proud Paraguayan nation has been at the mercy of her powerful neighbors for her whole life. In 1864, she chose to fight to preserve the territory that rightfully belonged to her and assert her right as a sovereign state, a decision that we nearly paid for with our lives. The insistence of Francisco Solano López on fighting to the death has left his legacy fiercely disputed, and our nation deeply traumatized - the sheer death toll the War of the Triple Alliance took was beyond all comprehension.\n\nBut in 1932, Paraguay stood up - once more, we defied the infernal designs of our enemies, wading into a war against Bolivia that the world thought we could never win. In the Chaco War, we shocked the world by routing the Bolivians all the way back to La Paz despite being outnumbered, defending our right to our country and proving that we are a power to be respected. After 60 years, the sorrow of our near-destruction had given way to triumph and renewed pride.\n\nAt long last, our victory is now complete - once again, we have stood against Argentina, and today we have come out the better. The bravery and cunning of our soldiers have cast our enemies from Chaco and Misiones, and have finally returned these long-lost lands to our nation. In the streets of Asuncion and across the countryside, the people shout 'Victory!' and celebrate the avenging of 1870 - no more will we be at the mercy of other nations, no more shall we be cast adrift in the world. Come what may, Paraguay shall fight, against all who would harm her - the Guaranì spirit shall never be destroyed! They will speak the names of the heroes of Paraguay on all corners of the world!"
 par.34.a:0 "Hurrah!"
