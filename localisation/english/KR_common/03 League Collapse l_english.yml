 league_collapse.1.t: "Sun Chuanfang meets with Governors"
 league_collapse.1.d: "Assembled within Nanjing today were some of the League's most important and crucial men within the Southern Zhili Clique. Called to Nanjing by the magnanimous Smiling Tiger, such a scene is standard fare within the management of the League of Eight Provinces. Coinciding with President Cao Kun's Chinese New Year Speech, the League itself is no place for such frivolities such as those within Beijing. Adjourned within the Marshal's Palace, Sun Chuanfang commonly holds such meetings to discuss general League policy, to delegate assignments to League Governors, and to shore up his position within the provinces.\n\nAttending the meeting was that of Governor Qi Xieyuan of Jiangsu, perhaps Sun's greatest ally and simultaneously greatest rival within the League itself. Amassing controversies over the years since his re-adoption within the Southern Zhili, Qi is perhaps the most supportive of the malignant concessions policy within this informal council. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum, both at the conference table and in policy is that of Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, overseeing enterprises in Anhui province. Whilst a fairly recent adoption, Chen positions himself as an anti-concessionist, and openly manoeuvres himself in opposition to Qi.\n\nOf course other Governors were present, such as the brutal Governor Zhou Yinren of Fujian, taking rare leave from his position enacting the encirclement campaigns against the MinGan Insurgency. Similarly, Governor Deng Ruzhuo of Jiangxi, and that of the much derided Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang. Ominously, following through with their boycott of the Zhili, Governors Chen Jiongming, Lu Rongting and Zhao Hengti have scant sent any form of representation, not even a telegram indicating their absence.\n\nNo matter, this is a new prosperous year in the League. Albeit Governors Chen Yi, Qi Xieyuan and Chen Tiaoyuan were clearly uneasy with the presence of the League Marshal's closest confidants, that of Xie Hongxun, Meng Zhaoyue and Li Baozhang. Perhaps attempting to sniff out rats within the Governorship, as Sun's reputation of hyper vigilance has resulted in his most closest associates being friends, enemies, and enemies pretending to be friends."

 league_collapse.2.t: "The ZheGan Railway"
 league_collapse.2.d: "Today demarcates the long-awaited opening of the ZheGan Railway, a venture planned between the League Marshal, Governors Chen Yi, Deng Ruzhuo and the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung. Attempting to further industrialise and bridge the gaps between the disparate railway lines within provincial borders, the ZheGan Railway originally owes itself to the endeavours of the Qing Dynasty. Initially constructed as the Zhuzhuou-Pingxiang Railway, built in 1899, it took six years to finalise, being finished in 1905.\n\nIn 1908, the Zhejiang Railway Company began to survey the railway line selection from Zhejiang to Jiangxi, collaborating with the likes of the Jiangxi Railway Company. However due to the fallout of the Xinhai Revolution, it was indefinitely placed on hold for the time being. Only revisited in 1929 under the League Marshal's auspices, the Zhejiang Provincial Government headed by Chen Yi decided to raise their own funds to modernise Jiangshan County, situated on the provincial boundary between Zhejiang and Jiangxi. With their efforts, they would see a minor railway, the Hangjiang Railway, constructed.\n\nWith the benefits of the Hangjiang Railway bringing immense profits for the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the assembly concluded that it would be an imperative to continue to repair the railway connecting Zhejiang and Jiangxi. With construction starting in 1932 and concluding a year later, the provincial government modernised the rail, renovated 68 bridges and reinforced 16 of them, alongside establishing Yushan Station and Depot.\n\nFinally, conducting a joint venture, Governors Chen and Deng would oversee the a joint venture to connect a series of minor railways, finally integrating Nanchang on a direct line with Shanghai. Albeit the price was costly, with more than 2000 workers dying during its construction, the finalised ZheGan railway has become a noteworthy propaganda piece for Chinese patriotism. Heavily funded by the AOG, but utilising Chinese engineers, the Jingxing society has heralded it as a fantastic success.\n\nAlbeit those less optimistic have been quick to posit the AOG's newfound access to rich mineral deposits, as well as Jingdezhen Porcelain, which is said to fetch high prices in Berlin. Thankfully however, despite concerns to the contrary an attack upon the opening ceremony by the Kuomintang did not take place."
 league_collapse.2.a: "Railways bring prosperity!"

 league_collapse.3.t: "An Unexpected Announcement"
 league_collapse.3.d: "Embracing the fresh air of Nanjing, the League Marshal couldn't help but posit the life he would be living, if he hadn't embarked on the consolidation of the Southern Zhili. Perhaps a commander in Wu's army? Or even a buddhist monk? Such idle thoughts couldn't help but dance in his mind. Being the League Marshal is no easy job, no less when your enemies are within your own camp. Opening his newspaper, a scowl couldn't help but magnify itself across the Smiling Tiger's face. In large, bold capitals: TRAITOR. Followed by an image of the League Marshal.\n\nHardly having time to process such matters, his tranquility would be intruded upon by one Qian Zongze, with his accompaniment of soldiers. A lower ranked commander within his retinue, Qian is in-charge of Zhejiang railway security and provincial police efforts, and so it is quite a bizarre sight for him to be within the Marshal's Palace, let alone discussing matters in such an impromptu manner. Before Sun could enquire however, Qian would beat him to it.\n\n\"Marshal Sun, my deepest apologies, I travelled as swiftly as I possibly could. I couldn't risk this information slipping through the cracks in a telegram. Governor Qi, beyond his authority, has negotiated an agreement with the AOG to publicly acquire and consolidate a series of eastern railways on behalf of the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, one of its component concerns. Including that of the recent ZheGan railway.\"\n\nThe frown on the Marshal's face burrowing deeper, he waved a hand to hush Qian, as he returned to the paper. Perusing its contents, it detailed the agreement between Governor Qi, his open support for such a purchase, and the vengeful retribution by Governor Chen Tiaoyuan. Decrying Qi, and by extension Sun, as a traitor to the Chinese nation, he has rallied forth the anti-concessionist movement. Pouring gasoline on the fire, Qi has all but worked to dash the hopes of those who believed that the new railway might represent a more equal future for Germans and Chinese.\n\nBarking orders, the Tiger prowled out of his den. In the following days many authorities within the League began to cut contact both with Governor Qi and Governor Chen. Similarly, the police response to the anti-concessionist protests has been slower than normal. Undoubtedly, Qi and Chen will reap what they've sown. The Marshal will be sure of that."
 league_collapse.3.a: "One thing the Tiger can't stand. Being called a traitor."

 league_collapse.4.t: "Unrest Spreads"
 league_collapse.4.d: "Unsurprisingly, the wildly publicised consolidation of the Central China Railway under AOG management, and the ensuing media hurricane proliferated by Chen Tiaoyuan and the Anti-Concessionist movement has wrought widespread criticism. With intellectuals from the Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, National salvation Federation, Young China Party and even the Endeavour Society decrying the League Marshal and Governor Qi as sell-outs, traitors, unscrupulous traitors. Their ever so eloquent words are printed in domestic papers, followed by prominent Anglo-American publications out of Shanghai, and echoed by Chinese Syndicalist party periodicals found on factory floors. Even worse, it would appear the truth has been snuffed out by the people's furiosity.\n\nLumped in with the absolute wretch of Governor Qi, Sun Chuanfang has received condemnation from the likes of the Lower Yangtze Merchant Association, and even half-heartedly from his friends within the Jingxing Society. With news spreading rapidly by word of mouth, it has grown into a furious tide of outrage, perhaps even fantastical to behold. The usually capable and adept Smiling Tiger has finally been caught.\n\nOld Wives' tales now describe extensive webs of conspiracy, disappearances of outspoken individuals, the supposed transfer of millions of Yuan into the League Marshal's pockets in the process. The public, naturally, has reacted with predictable furiosity, and protests have already spread from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to the major coastal cities, including within the foreign settlements.\n\nWithin Sun's domain however, lies a comparatively broken man. For all he had done, was this the collapse of his empire? Couldn't be, he was better than this. Surely? Betrayed not only by the peasantry he paternally cared for, but simultaneously by the men of words he respected. Of course he can't sit idly by! The Smiling Tiger has endured far worse, and his ambitions are so much more than this. Despite this, even his closest confidants such as Xie Hongxun and Liu Zongji can see the wear and tear on the legendary Marshal."
 league_collapse.4.a: "Can't they see? I love the country too!"

 league_collapse.5.t: "Attacks on Foreigners"
 league_collapse.5.d: "Roused from a restless slumber, the League Marshal was once again intruded upon by his ever dutiful intelligence staff. Having maintained tabs on the rapidly developing events as of recent, a far more troubling and startling scene has begun to paint itself. Ushered to his desk and handed a series of telegrams, illuminated by the morning dawn, a disturbing narrative unfolded.\n\nBeginning with assaults on prominent German citizens and businessmen, rapidly developing to becoming virtually indiscriminate, attacks on foreigners emboldened by so-called \"patriotic\" citizens have begun to spawn within the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi and Anhui. Worse still, the popular sentiment and hunger for blood has resulted in such actions spreading like wildfire, practically seizing whole counties in fury.\n\nIn response, the German consulate in Nanjing has advised the Kaiser's subjects to arm themselves, with other European governments advising similarly. Implementing warnings that foreigners should only travel when necessary, it would appear even the League Marshal's much loathed allies are beginning to turn on him.\n\nThe impact of these attacks overall on business and investment remains to be seen, but recent history suggests the Shanghai Stock Exchange will not remain unaffected. His enlightened governance, besieged on all sides. Clouds are gathering over Nanjing..."
 league_collapse.5.a: "The House of Cards begins to crack."

 league_collapse.6.t: "Boycotts and Beijing"
 league_collapse.6.d: "Ever unreliable, and always an insistent, opportunistic rat, perhaps the very progenitor of the exaggerated outrage, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan has begun to spurn on discussions within intellectual and peasant circles of a general boycott on all German goods. With such talk travelling swiftly and accompanying the growing protests throughout Eastern China, they have been further pushed onwards from Governor Chen's original message to a full torrent of nigh rebellion by an assortment of Dai Chunfeng's Kuomintang agents, intellectuals and nationalist ideologues.\n\nMost disturbingly however, is the news that some of the local garrisons within Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu have stepped back, allowing the unrest to grow. Unwilling to risk being labelled as \"Hanjian\" or \"race traitors\". Ever loyal however, Governors Deng and Zhou have backed the League Marshal in all matters of state, knowing behind-the-scenes the disgust that Sun retains for the concessions. Governors Lu Rongting and Chen Jiongming have, for their part, remained silent on the unfolding scene, although Sun knows them well enough to be aware of at least Chen's tacit support.\n\nGovernor Zhao Hengti, for his part, has spoken positively on the boycott to Hunan's Provincial Assembly, but has simultaneously given his assurances that he remains committed to Hunan's neutrality. To make matters worse, it appears the unfolding chaos within the League has not passed unnoticed by the Jade Marshal or King of Baoding. With Marshal Sun receiving word that the Northern Zhili may be composing an inquiry. Scarcely truthful reports have made their way to Beijing, and so it is evidently clear the Jade Marshal is trying to pull on his protégé for a clear-cut answer.\n\nIn order to ward off intervention from Beijing, advisors within the Nanking-Kommission, and those such as Zheng Junyan and Xie Hongxun have suggested that the League Marshal publicly, and privately, declare that the situation is under control. Leaving us isolated, it would prevent Governor Xiao of Hubei, or Governor Li of Henan mobilising their forces. Unusually quiet in regards to such events, Governor Chen Yi has finally opened contact with Sun, offering elements of several of his divisions based within Nanjing and Zhejiang to be deployed to cities along the lower Yangtze, where the protests are largest. Simultaneously, provincial garrisons have requested the green light to take whatever action they deem necessary to quell the open dissent."
 league_collapse.6.a: "The Tiger knows when to bring down the hammer."
 league_collapse.6.b: "But I also have a heart, punish only the violent."

 league_collapse.7.t: "Railway Bombings"
 league_collapse.7.d: "Further disturbing news has rang out within the League's provincial territories. It would appear that a series of explosions have rocked several stations and rail lines slated to become part of the Central China Railway, with one bomb shredding a train car in a crowded station at Hangzhou, leaving dozens killed and injured. With such news most vividly shaking civil servants, bureaucrats and governors alike, the deaths and delays leave many families bereaved. Pragmatically however, such blatant acts of anarchical destruction have also left much of the transportation sector to a standstill in many areas, acting as a detriment to Marshal Sun's rapid deployment of additional forces attempting to quell the growing unrest, and put down Governors Chen and Qi.\n\nBlame for the attacks has been levelled against various targets, with Sun's intelligence officers unable to make heads or tails of the chaotic scenery. Local bandits, looking to cause chaos to pillage undisturbed? The Kuomintang, hoping to set the stage for some greater uprising? Governor Qi, or Chen, hoping to prevent retribution from Nanjing? Or even the Japanese, aiming to sow the seeds of dissent further. Some especially conspiracy-minded individuals have suggested German involvement, who they posit are targeting their own possessions to set the stage for an intervention."
 league_collapse.7.a: "Innocents bleed once more..."

 league_collapse.8.t: "Reports from North and South"
 league_collapse.8.d: "It seems as if every new day brings bad news, the Year of the Rat is already proving to be an uncontrollable calamity. Furthermore troubling reports have reached the Marshal's Palace from both Xuzhou and Quanzhou. Within the MinGan Insurgent Zone, it would appear Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army guerrillas have staged a series of increasingly bold raids, striking around the inland cities of Yongding and Longyan. Governor Zhou Yinren has historically long struggled to assert control over his mountainous province, with his actual feasible control often limited to the coast and the larger inland cities.\n\nNow with the NRA's increasing tenacity and developing boldness, Zhou's iron grasp has grown all the more tenuous. Meanwhile within the northern border of Jiangsu, Governor Qi has, rather unusually, sent reports of increased agitation by rural bandits, and apparently the seizure of villages by these clans. Evidently not a fool, Marshal Sun is all too familiar with Qi's charades with so-called \"bandit clans\", which are in reality his own soldiers. A point of long-standing frustration and contention between the Governor and Marshal, their renewed involvement may very well be encouraging the rising unrest.\n\nHowever prudent, Marshal Sun has motioned to dispatch a series of divisions that were aiding in maintaining order in Jiangxi and Fujian to move northwards, eyeing up the odds and preferring that the more valuable Jiangsu remain under the iron boot. Some within his inner circle however, float the idea that the Smiling Tiger is tightening the noose further on Governors Chen and Qi."
 league_collapse.8.a: "That bastard is plotting something!"

 league_collapse.9.t: "A Telegram from Beijing"
 league_collapse.9.d: "Despite our pretences and hand waving, the ever persistent Jade Marshal and King of Baoding have sent a flurry of inquisitive telegrams to Nanjing. The ostensible rulers of the country ever since the Third ZhiFeng War, Marshal Wu Peifu and President Cao Kun carry exorbitant influence, even on the League Marshal. Despite their contention, the nascent arms race between Smiling Tiger and Jade Marshal, and the multi-polar world of the Northern and Southern Zhili, Wu Peifu is after all, still Sun's mentor, and that carries an unshakeable bond. Similarly those within Sun's inner-circle fear Wu's military skill, Cao's political capabilities, and the full might of the Northern Zhili crashing down upon them.\n\nThe message requests a detailed report about the current chaotic situation unfolding within the Southeastern territories. Eloquent, adamant and demanding, the telegram is clearly worded with the intent to force the League Marshal to admit to some weakness or hardship, as an excuse for the Central army to move in and \"re-establish control\". Repeatedly attempting to wrangle, control and extend its influence within the south following the formation of the League in 1928, their efforts have been brilliantly deflected by Sun.\n\nEver a capable statesman, Sun's response must be measured, careful, considerate of all quantities that he must balance. Mentor and protégé, North and South, and the stability of his realm contrasted with the stability of the nation. Collaborating with his close and charismatic advisor Wei Daofeng, the Marshal wrote..."
 league_collapse.9.a: "\"Everything is under control.\""

 league_collapse.10.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
 league_collapse.10.d: "The city of Wuhu, situated upon the outskirts of Nanjing, and ostensibly under the authority of Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, has been a particularly striking hotbed of dissent and unrest. With Nanjing under the League Marshal's direct control, it has remained rather quaint and stable, compared to hotbeds of unrest such as Xiamen or Xuzhou. As a result, most dissenters within Nanjing that desire for their voices to be heard have joined the protest in Wuhu, acting in lieu of any major action directly underneath Sun's nose.\n\nDue to Governor Chen's support and complacency, they have managed to act relatively unhindered, slowly causing the status of the city to devolve into anarchy. With such a deterioration of authority, it was inevitable that the most recent incident would unfold. Within regularly scheduled protests, a now all too common site within the League, held in the afternoon yesterday, it would appear that they received an inordinate surge in involvement. Spurned on by the Chinese Syndicalist party, a series of striking workers from nearby German-owned factories bolstered the riots, quickly escaping police control.\n\nThe garrison, itself reinforced by a section of recently arrived German-trained troops from Nanjing, attempted in earnest to restore order, but in the confused melee a group of individuals started firing. Whilst the culprits remain unknown, the chaos that followed proved disastrous. Within a matter of minutes police, the garrison and their reinforcing troops begun firing on the crowd, receiving returning fire. Over two hundred are already confirmed dead, with four times as many likely wounded, and the resultant outrage has already sparked protests in surrounding areas.\n\nThe situation is made all the worse by the presence of a small foreign settlement within the city. Many are already claiming that lethal force was only used in order to protect these foreigners, and the killings will most likely feature in international newspapers by tomorrow morning. Furthermore, Governor Chen has utilised the situation to formally demand that all League of Eight Provinces soldiers leave Anhui province altogether, pre-empting his likely secession. Such actions have resulted in the League Marshal and his inner-circle believing Chen Tiaoyuan is the one to blame..."
 league_collapse.10.a: "That traitor! For what is there to gain?!"

 league_collapse.11.t: "Anqing Refuses Further Cooperation"
 league_collapse.11.d: "Following up on his demand, Governor Chen has publicised his official secession without a response from the League Marshal. Citing the recent incident at Wuhu, his demand transformed into an ultimatum calling for the complete and utter withdrawal of all non-provincial forces from Anhui province, as well as the immediate hand-over of those officers responsible for the Wuhu Incident. Rather humiliatingly Chen has assured the League Marshal that his own soldiers will continue to \"quell the spreading unrest and disorder\", as if he's done any of that in the first place.\n\nRefusing further cooperation with League authorities, he has furthermore denounced the creation of the Central China Railway, blaming it for \"pushing patriotic citizens to the edge of despair\". Having long been a thorn in our side, it would appear that \"The Fool\" has shown his hand. Aiding and spurning the inferno of popular outcry and outrage against the League and its Marshal, it has become evidently clear that Chen was merely grandstanding for a casus belli to officiate his independence from the Smiling Tiger's grasp.\n\nUnder any normal circumstances, this behaviour would be met with immediate, swift, and brutal retribution. Yet Governor Chen's stance, ties to the anti-concessionists and the media campaign turning him into some sort of nationalist hero has resulted in apprehension from the League Marshal. Decisive action now could very well serve to further divide the now fragile League. Not one to take such intolerable actions sitting down however, League Marshal Sun has formally requested that his most loyal generals Xie Hongxun, Liu Zongji, Meng Zhaoyue and Ma Yuren prepare their soldiers for a clash with the Anhui Army."
 league_collapse.11.a: "His time will come, but not soon enough."
 league_collapse.11.b: "Let us join Governor Chen! (Play as Anqing)"

 league_collapse.12.t: "Secret Negotiations with Shangguan Yunxiang"
 league_collapse.12.d: "With Chen Tiaoyuan's faithless grandstanding and anti-concessionist rampaging to our west, and the Kuomintang's marauding chaos to the south, the primacy of Zhejiang province, beyond its opulence, has become strategically vital towards the League's conduct in the conflicts to come. With it lying just south of Jiangsu, and connecting Jiangxi and Fujian to Nanjing, it is imperative that it remain within the League's sphere.\n\nLong estranged, only owing personal loyalties to Sun Chuanfang, not Qi Xieyuan, Zhejiang Governor Chen Yi has proven his allegiance to be tenuous. With numerous reports of his contact with Chen Tiaoyuan and even the Japanese. His possible defection would be utterly disastrous, as it isolates Governor Deng and Zhou, strengthens Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, and no-doubt would result in some of our brightest commanders following with him.\n\nNonetheless not all those under Governor Chen's command retain similar Zhejiang loyalties. One endeavouring Shangguan Yunxiang, nor a formal subordinate but nonetheless siuated within Zhejiang, has tacitly proven himself receptive towards possible advances. Never content and always ambitious, League Marshal Qi could potentially offer him the governorship, though he is a greedy man and may desire far more than what we could offer. Of course, there is always the choice to trust in Governor Chen and the Zhejiang clique."
 league_collapse.12.a: "Offer him Zhejiang."
 league_collapse.12.b: "Offer him Zhejiang and Anhui."
 league_collapse.12.c: "Chen Yi is trustworthy."

 league_collapse.13.t: "Tension on the Yangtze"
 league_collapse.13.d: "Outrage echoes in the streets of Anhui - 'Justice for Wuhu; expel the foreigners!' Governor Chen Tiayouan has risen to the challenge, and already agents of the Nanjing government are being expelled from the province. Virtually overnight Chen has been branded a defender of the people, but now his forces are locked in a series of standoffs throughout the lower Yangtze, and the question looms- what next? Some have called for a complete overthrow of the Nanjing regime, but more cynical voices point to strategic opportunity.\n\nChen has long been known for his tendency to take calculated risks and this moment is no different."
 league_collapse.13.a: "Long Live the Governor!"

 league_collapse.14.t: "A Request to Wu Peifu?"
 league_collapse.14.d: "With chaos erupting all across the Eight Provinces, Chen is fully aware that his own situation may soon be threatened as well. To avoid immediate collapse or decisive military action by one of our enemies, we will therefore need allies. Wu Peifu, the Jade Marshal and true head of the Qing government, possesses the largest military force in Eastern China and could prove to be an asset, as it is rumoured that he may possess hidden loyalties and wishes to aid our anti-concessionist cause. It may not be wise to immediately ask for his full backing, so instead, we should simply ask him to help provide funding for our troops."
 league_collapse.14.a: "Send the telegram."

 league_collapse.15.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Sends a Telegram"
 league_collapse.15.d: "\"To the eminent President Cao Kun, and Imperial Minister Wu Peifu,\n\nI, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, humbly ask for extrajudicial funding for my troops. As outlined in the constitution of our great nation, it is the responsibility of the national government to provide funds to provincial governors to suppress unrest. With the situation of League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing unclear, I have taken the responsibility of protecting the province of Anhui against bandits and leftist agitators.\"\n\nDelivered in the form of a telegram to Cao Kun and forwarded to Wu Peifu this morning, the tone surprised both men in its boldness, appearing to proposition the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding by holding them to the merits of the constituion. Appearing to have restored order to his province, Chen is clearly gambling for support from the Central Government in order to expand beyond Anhui.\n\nFaced with a rather difficult choice, Chen could potentially remove a chess piece from the board, wipping it clean with a man beholden to his support, as opposed to the rather unyieldy League. However with the baggage of a firm anti-concessionist following, Wu and Cao's support could see the long-term alienation of Germany, something Cao has delicately cultivated for years. At the same time, standing with the anti-concessionists would allow Wu and Cao to once again bend to the opinion of the popular masses, riding the wave of support akin to 1922."
 league_collapse.15.a: "Send the funds, it'll secure our interests."
 league_collapse.15.b: "Refuse. No funds for rebels!"

 league_collapse.16.t: "Wu Accepts our Request"
 league_collapse.16.d: "Marshal Wu Peifu has returned our latest telegram expressing his deep sympathies for the people of Anhui, and his admiration for their dedication to Chinese exceptionalism. In this grandiose letter, however, Marshal Wu never authoritatively states whether Beijing will move to help Anqing. Governor Chen is left with a quandary and little time to decide. Is it worth it to continue to engage with Marshal Wu, or are our precious few days of peace better spent on a different plan for diplomatic survival?"
 league_collapse.16.a: "See? What did I tell you!"
 league_collapse.16.b: "No point. He's little more than a German lapdog."

 league_collapse.17.t: "A Letter Of Thanks From Governor Chen"
 league_collapse.17.d: "Writing in his most eloquent calligraphy and finest ink, Governor Chen has addressed a letter writing his sincere thanks to Marshal Wu Peifu and President Cao, complimenting the Cabinet and Ministries in their dedication and consolidation of Chinese Solidarity. Assuring Beijing of his intentions to truly prioritise the defence of Chinese sovereignty, he has declared the end of Western interference in the Yangtze Valley, lavishly affirming the government's belief in Chinese unification and the ejection of foreign imperialists forces with which they face.\n\nReacting rather reserved in private circles, Wu and Cao conferred a mutual appreciation of relief at the stabilisation of the situation. With the securing of a popular Governor within the League provinces, perhaps a new era of prosperity free of imperialist influence is but on the horizon."
 league_collapse.17.a: "Quite the charmer, isn't he."

 league_collapse.18.t: "Betrayed by the \"Fool\""
 league_collapse.18.d: "In light of the Central Government's attempts to coax and welcome Governor Chen into the Zhili fold, through diplomatic manoeuvring on Cao's front, financial aid from Wang Kemin's banks and military aid from the Jade Marshal, it would appear that Governor Chen has rebuffed our attempts to parley. Growing increasingly distant and out of our reach in our recent contacts.\n\nOne of our own border guards discovered refugees arriving in our lands, carrying pamphlets from the infamous Japanese paramilitary Black Dragon Society. Now in the vacuum of silence from Anqing's leaders, it would appear further disturbing impressions are upon us. Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang Province, infamous for his association with the Black Dragons, has been spotted in Anqing by other refugees. Our intelligence operatives highly suspect that the Governor is attempting to not only betray President Cao, Marshal Wu and the Emperor, but also that of the Chinese nation itself by establishing contacts with Japan's intelligence ring."
 league_collapse.18.a: "Damnable Japanese!"

 league_collapse.19.t: "Wu Refuses Chen Tiaoyuan's Request"
 league_collapse.19.d: "In another letter sent by Marshal Wu, it appears that any common ground between him and Governor Chen has broken down. Marshal Wu's letter chastises Chen for the incredible gamble he is taking with the people of Anhui, and cautions him towards what could only mean Chen's death via appeasing Nanjing. This development has pushed back our attempts to gain support in Beijing considerably, and our time is becoming ever more scarce.\n\nA second opportunity may have opened itself up in the shape of the controversial general Chen Yi however whose rumoured connections with the Black Dragon Society could help us gain an audience with the Japanese ambassador in Tianjin, and through that, the Fengtian Government. [ANQ.GetLeader] is fully aware of the risk association with Fengtian may pose to the goal of the anti-concessionist movement but with Wu still adamantly refusing, we have little other choices."
 league_collapse.19.a: "It is time to visit Fengtian."

 league_collapse.20.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Approaches Chen Yi"
 league_collapse.20.d: "Chen Yi, governor of the powerful Zhejiang province still within the League, has approached Chen Tiaoyuan to discuss possible cooperation. Urging his colleague that the true future of China lies with the Fengtian government and not with the Qing, he promises that if Chen Tiaoyuan pledges himself to Zhang Zuolin, the leader of Fengtian, Chen Yi will offer his full support in the coming war.\n\nAs Chen Yi's position within the Zhejiang does provide him with a sizeable capital and force to back up these promises and with Wu Peifu remaining supportive of Nanjing, it seems that we have little choice but to take the chance and hope for the best."
 league_collapse.20.a: "What choice do we have?"

 league_collapse.21.t: "Anqing Asks Our Support"
 league_collapse.21.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of the Anhui province within the League of Eight Provinces, has asked for our support in their coming struggle against the Qing and the League. Whilst Chen takes a strong anti-concessionist viewpoint and receives most of his support from this movement, he also recognises the position he has found himself trapped in. Either he sticks with his ideals and loses his land, his army and likely his life or he reaches out and comes knocking on the door of the only other national government in China, no matter what foreign powers they may be working with. Urged by the governor of Zhejiang, Chen Yi, to establish contact with us, it seems that he has chosen the latter option.\n\nThis has provided us with an excellent opportunity to secure a potentially powerful ally in Eastern China and cause damage on the Southern flank of the Qing centre of power, something we should exploit as much as possible."
 league_collapse.21.a: "Another piece has entered the board."

 league_collapse.22.t: "Another Offer to Chen?"
 league_collapse.22.d: "Following our refusal of aid to Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique, worrying reports have begun to emerge that he has reached out to Zhang Zuolin, leader of the rogue Fengtian government in the Northeast. Even more worrying is his use of a Japanese interlocutor to facilitate the conversation. Several of Wu's advisors are suggesting the Marshal reach out again to Chen with an offer of direct support in his rebellion, lest we end up with a Japanese lapdog right on our doorstep.\n\nBeyond just Japanese support for Chen, however, it also seems that non-intervention could lead to widespread domestic unrest. Many in both the opposition parties and the Zhili Clique itself are itching for an opportunity to extend our control in the chaos of the collapse, and already small protests in favour of Governor Chen's anti-concessions stance have broken out across urban areas. Staying silent could result in these protests escalating, further destabilising our increasingly unstable regime."
 league_collapse.22.a: "Let's see what he has to say."
 league_collapse.22.b: "This is too risky."

 league_collapse.23.t: "Wu Peifu Reconsiders his Position"

He now offers his full support and praises [ANQ.GetLeader] for his decisive action during China's time of need.

 league_collapse.24.d2: "Despite all pretence to cast Governor Chen to the dogs, it would appear that the Zhili's swift backtracking has saved it from the worst of Fengtian's intrigues within the League. Either swayed by Wu's poignant words, the materiel and funding, or out of almost a full decade of previous support and backing, Governor Chen has granted the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding a green light for a continued cooperative arrangement.\n\nOn the back of this, Zhang Zhitan has informed Luoyang that Dongbei advisors and Japanese officers have already begun to be shuttled out of Anhui, or otherwise apprehended, reinforcing Chen's re-alignment with his true masters."

 league_collapse.25.d1: "With the refusal of Governor Chen's telegram, it would appear that the ambitious, opportunistic Qi Xieyuan has caught wind of the rebuttal. All but usurping Sun Chuanfang's role within the League, Qi has proclaimed himself to be the new \"League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces\", despite Sun having not officially been declared dead to the public.\n\nAddressing a flowery letter to both Cao and Wu, he has directly requested aid in suppressing what he has deemed to be \"a minor rebellion in Anhui province\", despite our intelligence and Chen's telegram clearly indicating otherwise. Insisting that since we are the rightful authority in the Central Government, it is \"only proper conduct that we support the rightful Marshal of the League\".\n\nThe pompous tone has left Wu and Cao suspicious of Qi's request, considering that some sort of upstart warlord who has already caused trouble in 1924 would make demands of them. Even worse Qi could theoretically easily crush Anhui and the Kuomintang Uprising with German Aid alone. However Cao and his advisors, Gao Lingwei among them, still suggests that a strong League and a strong relationship with Germany is the way forward for progress."

### Section 2 - Black Monday Event Chain and Start of the League War ###
 #Black Monday 2.3.36 February 3rd 1936
 league_collapse.50.t: "Black Monday reaches the East"
 league_collapse.50.d: "Thoroughly enwrapped within the global German economic powerhouse since their intervention in 1927, and the following negotiations between President Cao Kun and German Emissaries, the League of Eight Provinces would actually opt to maintain course with the Central Government in relation to the German issue. A patriot and anti-concessionist, League Marshal Sun would only fold to the German bulwark after 1928. As following a build up of tensions between the North and South Zhili, the Smiling Tiger would reach his zenith following the creation of the League of Eight Provinces in 1928, and its further expansion into Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan the following year. Flouting disarmament directives from Beijing, Sun would instead increase the size of his army.\n\nThis would of course, promote a curious dilemma for the League Marshal. Strongly against extensive taxes on the peasantry, he would be backed into a relative corner. Qi Xieyuan and Li Linsi, who had both recently returned to China, would advise the League Marshal on his one sure-fire out of this predicament. Taking on significant loans backed by concessions to the Germans and Legations, he would receive the necessary funding to construct an army to rival that of the Jade Marshal's.\n\nFollowing on from his increased oppression of socialist rebels and democratic thinkers, political manoeuvres in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan would see the League further decline in strength. And so it would be, the anti-concessionist Sun further thrust into the arms of the Germans, much to his personal distaste.\n\nAnd although it began a world away, Black Monday's fallout has already cleaved through Chinese markets. The Shanghai Exchange plummeted before closing at numbers unseen since the financial tumult of 1925, and local institutions are already mobilising what they can to mitigate the damage. Fortunately, the average Chinese citizen, and the nation as a whole, are unlikely to feel any immediate impact. But the AOG, already staggering under an extensive retaliatory boycott faces dire financial circumstances.\n\nIts clerks have already issued notice that it may be unable to pay the usual rents for its various concessions within the League provinces, and that the final payment promised for the ZheGan Railway has been \"indefinitely postponed\". The already despondent Marshal has been sent further into the chasm of darkness, as without this planned revenue, vast swathes of budget cuts are necessary to stay afloat. News even abounds that Governor Chen has begun mobilising forces directed at Nanjing..."
 league_collapse.50.a: "\"The longer I go on, the further I sink\"."

 league_collapse.51.t: "Dissension in the Ranks"
 league_collapse.51.d: "Already within this miasma of misery news has spread rather rapidly. Whilst the League Marshal has taken no direct action insofar economic measures to prevent an absolute halt to business ventures by the Jiangnan Consortium, the news of supposed \"budget cuts\" and suspended pay has travelled by earshot all throughout the League's junior officer corps. Predictably, their reaction has been rather negative to put it mildly.\n\nFor some this signifies the end of their lifestyles of vice and extravagance, at least for the time-being, but for many a common soldier it's the difference between life and starvation. Similarly rumours abound, perhaps spread by Governors Qi, Chen and even the Kuomintang, that the deprivation of pay will be unequal. With many of these whispers insinuating that the League Marshal's elite direct forces under the command of Li Baozhang, Xie Hongxun, Ma Yuren, Meng Zhaoyue and Liu Zongji will retain most if not all of their pay. Similarly it is rumoured that Qi Xieyuan's German trained divisions are exempt from such hardship.\n\nThe officers' grumbling is made all the worse by a small but vocal clique of nationalistic officers led by the young guard of Tang Enbo, Guo Chan, Lin Wei and Ge Jing'en. They rally and argue that the League should never have become so dependent on German \"handouts\" in the first place, albeit their rhetoric is combatted by the likes of Governor Qi, and to a lesser extent Li Rentao and Xu Peigen. In secret of course, the League Marshal agrees with their sentiment, but too much has been staked on the Germans to burn the bridge now.\n\nWorse still, our ever faithful adversaries within the National Revolutionary Army and the Kuomintang's League of Ten continue to hide in the shadows, disseminating propaganda and denouncing \"imperialist collaboration\". Nothing has yet come of these particular activities, but what was once routine unrest is now threatening to undermine the very foundations of the League."
 league_collapse.51.a: "\"It's burning all around me...\""

 league_collapse.52.t: "A Heinous Crime"
 league_collapse.52.d: "Sun Chuanfang's youth was one riddled with hardship. With his father dying soon after Sun was born, his family would be abused by his aunt, resulting in Sun, his mother and his three sisters fleeing to Jinan to pursue some form of meagre happiness. Sun and his mother would fall into the care of Wang Yingkai. With this, the Smiling Tiger would first bear his fangs, shooting up the ranks of the Baoding Military Academy. Throughout his career Sun would meet and befriend numerous people of all shapes and colours, from Yan Xishan to Deng Yanda.\n\nLiked by many, the Smiling Tiger was still after all, a tiger. None knew this better than Zhang Zongchang subordinate Shi Congbin. Engaged in conflict with Fengtian in 1925, Sun's subordinate Xie Hongxun would annihilate the forces of Shi. An old man, Shi saluted Sun Chuanfang when the Smiling Tiger came to meet him. Despite this Sun decreed that Li Baozhang, \"General Guillotine\", should execute Shi immediately to prevent retaliation. Brutally beheaded and left to rot, Sun had far moved on from that event a decade ago. But some have not.\n\nOverseeing a training drill outside his Marshal's Palace, the cool Nanjing air washed over the League Marshal. Soothing the stress and aches of recent events, if only for a moment. Reminiscing idly, staring up at the sky, Sun's mind couldn't help but wander to a place he held so deeply.\n\nWhen he was a subordinate of Wang Zhanyuan, Sun had utterly fallen for a maid of Wang's wife, He Jiexian. Sun would hold He deeply in his heart, and so it was fate that they would be betrothed only a year later.\n\nAnd yet fate is a fickle thing. Jiexian had contracted tuberculosis when she was a maid, and so the joyous life of Madame Sun ended only a year after it began. Forever committed to his one true love, Sun personally buried He, and hid her favourite white handkerchief in his shirt pocket forever. An open display that he was always with his beloved wife.\n\nRecalled back to the present, if only for a moment. A sharp pain would shoot through his body. Yelling, calamity. Turning around he could barely see the serving-woman and her Luger pistol. His bodyguards rushed to overpower and imprison the woman, and yet Sun's body would plummet. He Jiexan's handkerchief. The last memory of her, its stunning purity, its beloved shining white. Stained by a tide of the Tiger's crimson."

 league_collapse.53.t: "A Telegram from Nanjing"
 league_collapse.53.d: "Rushing to his home in the middle of the night, Wu Peifu was awoken by his secretary, Bai Jianwu, and his Chief of Staff, Zhang Qihuang, rousing the Jade Marshal from a restless slumber. Ushering Wu towards his desk, the duo slid an emergency telegram report in front of the Marshal, for his eyes only. Enquiring as to if President Cao has seen the same telegram, he learned that Wang Yujia and Liu Menggeng are already explaining the situation to the President. Glancing his eyes over the confidential telegram sheet, awe washing over his face, it read:\n\n'Sun Chuanfang shot 8:55 AM STOP\nPerpetrator unknown STOP\nIn coma STOP\nUnlikely to wake STOP\nRiots widespread STOP\nFleeing with gold and documents STOP'\n\nTwo hours later, Luoyang became a frenzied hub of activity. Documents concerning Sun's more salacious dealings with Beijing burnt in furnaces, while groups of Jinbao and Luoyang Zhili members argue over the Smiling Tiger's connections. In an unprecedented move, Cao Kun has invited several Manchu nobles, notably the Emperor's brother Pujie, to be present for the drafting of some form of unified statement in response to the assassination, perhaps desiring a united front in these troubling times.\n\nBeyond it all, the Jade Marshal can't help but feel sorrow for the fate that has befallen Sun Chuanfang. His protégé, his original successor, for all they shared in ideology and memory, to be sullied like this?"
 league_collapse.53.a: "\"Farewell, Sun...\""

 league_collapse.54.t: "Spreading Insubordination"
 league_collapse.54.d: "In the absence of the League Marshal, telegrams have begun flooding in all morning, accompanied by the ding of ringing telephones throughout the League Marshal's palace, together they join in communion to paint a rapidly deteriorating situation across much of the League. With supposed reductions or no promise of pay, soldiers in Xuzhou, Nanchang, Quanzhou, and several other cities are either refusing to act or outright joining the spreading violence and looting, while police and garrisons in Hangzhou and Wuxi have gone on strike.\n\nRiots there and elsewhere are gradually escaping all semblance of control, made all the worse by Sun Chuanfang's recent incapacity. Furthermore, Governor Chen Yi has once again begun refusing to maintain contact with Nanjing, with our intelligence operatives reporting increasing contact with Governor Chen Tiaoyuan. Soldiers guarding the northern reaches of Jiangsu have been recalled to Nanjing, with Governors Deng and Zhou reporting defections of units to the Kuomintang.\n\nTroublingly, telegraph lines south of Fujian appear to have been cut, leaving the League entirely in the dark as to the likely worsening situation within Guangzhou and Guangxi. Governor Zhao of Hunan has offered clearly reluctant condolences for the disaster that has struck Sun Chuanfang, granting his condolences but refusing to say anything close to official support in these troubling times. For Nanjing itself? It is now practically in the throes of violent revolution. The League Marshal's inner-circle are scrambling to compose a form of regency council, but Governor Qi might have different ideas..."
 league_collapse.54.a: "Marshal Sun must wake soon..."

 league_collapse.55.t: "Imperial Navy Flees North!"
 league_collapse.55.d: "With the securing of Shandong by hostile forces rampaging and ruining the port of Yantai, alongside Qingdao being under the official de-facto control of Germany's colonial project, the land directly controlled by the Central Government concretely lacks any properly suitable ports to maintain the Beiyang Fleet. In such a sorry situation, the Beiyang Fleet was moved to Nantong, ostensibly within the League, since the end of the ZhiFeng Wars.\n\nWith rioting, civil unrest, and general chaos enveloping the city due to the League Collapse, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Sa Zhenbing, has been ordered to mobilise the fleet to flee the city, heading north for the small ports surrounding the urban city of Tianjin. The fall of the Nanjing docks has resulted in a navy without a home, lacking the shipbuilding capacity to do anything more than maintain the current fleet.\n\nAddressing the Jade Marshal, Sa Zhenbing and Yang Shuzhuang both insisted that the admiralty necessitates the ports of Shandong, or otherwise that of Zhejiang or Fujian, if it is to protect China's coastal waters."
 league_collapse.55.a: "\"That will have to wait, gentlemen.\""

 league_collapse.56.t: "Riots reach the Marshal's Palace"
 league_collapse.56.d: "With the League Marshal's subordinates struggling to put together any sort of front or authority resembling that of Sun Chuanfang's skillset, many local and provincial authorities begging Nanjing for an answer or order have been left afloat and isolated. The Nanjing Police, for their part, have been unable to contain many of the riots spreading across the capital, as radical officers defect to Governor Chen Tiaoyuan or sit idle, and onlookers join in on the chaos; looting and burning homes, businesses, and now government offices.\n\nThe hasty arrival of elite German-trained military units under the command of Governor Qi Xieyuan, who has been watching the situation closely, seemed to have saved the Marshal's Palace from becoming a martyr of revolutionaries. But the roar of flames and the burgeoning crowds are audible even within the chamber where Sun Chuanfang lies, deep in a coma. Receiving visits day in and day out by his closest staff, many have been brought to tears by the state of things, pleading with Sun's unconscious body to awake and fix the situation as he always does.\n\nFor those less loyal however, those who are merely in it for their own gain, they've already begun their great escape. Like rats fleeing from a sinking ship, unscrupulous officials have been observed scurrying away into back streets and alleyways, arms burdened by silver coins, papers, and incriminating governmental secrets."

 league_collapse.58.d: "Long a sticking point for the good conduct of the League, the continued existence of the so-called \"MinGan\" rebellion has time-and-time again proved itself annoyingly resilient. Initially born from the ejection of one Tang Shengzhi in the Northern Expedition, with his 8th Army adjorning remnants of the National Revolutionary Army's 4th Army, the MinGan rebellion would turn into what was practically the genuine authority of some areas following the failed 1932 Shanghai Uprising.\n\nSeeing the famed \"Red Napoleon\" Deng Yanda and Madame Song Qingling join their brethren in Fujian and Jiangxi. Trumping our encirclement campaigns, advised by the Germans and implemented by Governors Zhou Yinren and Deng Ruzhuo, the NRA proved itself an ever reliable foe.\n\nReports are arriving in the Palace of the very same Kuomintang rebels, fighting for the dream of their prized Dr. Sun Yat-sen, successfully beginning a mass general insurrection and uprising in Fujian province. Emerging from their mountains and hideouts, they have managed to seize a number of villages in the province's interior. The MinGan Insurgent Zone was always a known danger, but it was isolated and so deeply alone.\n\nWith the chaos now gripping the League however, there is every possibility that they will cut a path to the coast, opening the way for aid from their Syndicalist allies, and the return of Wang Zhaoming from Parisian exile. At present, Governor Zhou is known to have several of his divisions in and around Quanzhou, but this is unlikely to be enough to stem the revolutionary tide. In conjunction, troops loyal to the Kuomintang have risen up along the border with the Shanghai Concession, threatening the heart of our power. Albeit they are likely to be annihilated by Governor Qi's forces."

 league_collapse.59.t: "Governor Qi Assumes Control"
 league_collapse.59.d: "Still lacking in any legitimate central authority, the League has been in an utter death spiral of its disparate parts. Left to fend for themselves without central management from Nanjing, reports rage about the wild situation within Fujian, Jiangxi, the amassing of even more soldiers within Anhui province, the untenable situation within Shandong, and all other matters of chaos. Indirectly acting in the role of the League Marshal following Sun's coma, Governor Qi of Jiangsu has attempted his best efforts to stem the League's rapid bleeding. Unable to command other Governors due to lacking in authority, his actions have been blunted.\n\nMeeting behind closed doors within the relative safety of the Marshal's Palace, Governor Qi had assembled the military men of Ma Yuren, Xie Hongxun, Zheng Junyan, Meng Zhaoyue, Wang Haoji, Zhou Fengqi, Li Baozhang and Liu Zongji. Closely behind are the intellectuals and bureaucrats of Tang Erhe, Li Linsi, Ding Wenjiang, Wei Daofeng, Yang Wenkai, and of course Qi's right-hand man Tian Wenbing. Having gathered all of the most important, and available, figures within the League into one meeting chamber, the same one the Governors had all met in not so long ago, few had any pretences of what Governor Qi was about to propose.\n\nDrafting a formal petition to those assembled, in lieu of any formal succession, to declare Qi as acting League Marshal, the Governor of Jiangsu has finally shown his hand. Immediately chaos ruptured within the room, with Generals Xie Hongxun, Li Baozhang and Meng Zhaoyue accusing Qi of masterminding Sun's assassination attempt. Similarly Yang Wenkai brought forth the fact that the culprit carried with her a German pistol. Turning his head to Tian, Qi's subordinate nodded, as he disappeared from the chamber for a brief moment. Upon his swift return, he was flanked by a series of Chinese soldiers sporting German weaponry and equipment.\n\nEmerging from the meeting to declare himself acting League Marshal, Qi Xieyuan has broadcasted his intentions to restore order to the fractured League. Already his forces have begun asserting control over Nanjing's arsenal, military headquarters, and major thoroughfares, broadcasting his ascension by megaphone and clearing the streets with enfilades of rifle fire. Cities along much of the Lower Yangtze have already begun declaring for Qi, with Governors Deng and Zhou going along with it. Albeit Governor Chen Yi has wavered on declaring support, with Chen Jiongming, Lu Rongting and Zhao Hengti refusing to acknowledge the news."

With initial silence from both the Marshal and President, small protests began to emerge in the urban centres, spurned on by journalists and intellectuals alike. Clamouring for anti-concessionist intervention, the deafening silence would continue. As a result, the few gatherings would develop into blazing street protests, infernos of popular anger directed at the blood being spilt on the Yangtze.\n\nConvening behind closed doors for numerous days, it was decided that some sort of response was necessary. Sitting at his desk with a microphone pointed at his face, and hundreds of thousands tuning in all across the nation, President Cao Kun would, evidently reluctantly, announce that the Government will not deign to grant any support to either Qi Xieyuan or Chen Tiaoyuan, citing dissatisfaction with both men and their conduct.\n\nWith the protests turning into an inferno of dissent, Beijing and other major cities have become seized by the unrest, utterly paralysed. With both the Germans and people against the government, a sense of dismay has overtaken the Assembly. Near total denunciation of our government lead to our downfall once before, and it is possible it will do so again. With the military police under Wang Yujia having been sent to ensure order, it is perhaps only a moment of time before the situation deteriorates further."

With the broad populace roused up by the anti-concessionist intellectuals, Chen Tiaoyuan's defiance, and the anti-imperialist sentiments that have remained a continuous undercurrent for years, it was nonetheless decided that the storm can be weathered to preserve the special relationship with Germany.\n\nGranted the entirely unenviable job of delivering the news of their intervention to the Assembly, Cao rather reluctantly called forth an Assembly meeting to officiate the intervention on behalf of the League. With Minister Gao Lingwei and Minister Wang Kemin standing with him, Cao began: \"My dear cherished friends, I gathered all of you here today to convey to you rather important new concerning the Government's decision in regards to the unrest in the South\". The assembly perking up with bated breath, he continued. \"Marshal Wu, his command staff and the cabinet have all elected to support League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan in his struggles against the rebellious province of Anhui and its traitorous Governor Chen Tiaoyuan.

Rhenish Wine, Cuban Cigars, and other foreign delicacies were offered to Cao and his assemblymen. Yet met with distant glances and even scorn, few participate in their \"Prosperous\" goodwill.\n\nIn contrast of the usual dour-faced Manchu nobles who would normally greet the President outside of the building, German bureaucrats and representatives from the Southern Zhili kleptocracy welcomed the President with open arms, dressed in the latest Berlin finery and offering even more exorbitant gifts to Harmony Association lawmakers, the likes of Wang Chengbin and Cao's faction within the military would quickly whisk the President away, allowing him to escape the embarrassment."

Notable amongst many other speeches held in the same location, this particular one was transmitted over the radio — a first in China.\n\nCarrying himself with a steeled vigour, President Cao called for the citizens of China to rally together. \"For a whole century of humiliation have we suffered and lamented under foreign oppression! For too long have we been lapdogs to the whims of the British, Japanese, French and Germans! But no more!

A vast mob had formed outside the gates, chanting anti-concession slogans and burning German-made clothes, furniture, and even a hastily-constructed effigy of the Kaiser.\n\nWith the military police swiftly arriving to prevent the scene from turning into a massive diplomatic dispute, the German bureaucrats in the Peking-Kommission have, through their voices in the Prosperity League, announced to the Assembly the immediate withdrawal of the Commission, and the rather unfortunate disbandment of the majority of their support programs for the Government.\n\nWhilst a serious blow for our relationship with Germany, and of great concern for President Cao and Minister Gao Lingwei, it has dealt an even more significant attack on the Prosperity League within the Assembly. With the political grouping all but losing their primary backer and source of funding, a large chunk of their assemblymen have defected to the Political Science Clique, experiencing a resurgence in independent, middle-class liberal members and support."
 league_collapse.66.a: "A small price to pay for National Salvation."

 league_collapse.67.t: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] Pledges its Support"
 league_collapse.67.d: "The League lies weak; smouldering ruins show where German fatcats once dined with Nanjing officials whose armies are disorganised and squabbling amongst themselves. Not only have our troops the courage and dedication to bring our goals to a successful end, but we also have the support of the great Wu Peifu himself, and with him, the Imperial Army. All the pieces have been set in motion; the time has come to put the League out of its misery. As a phoenix rising from the ashes, so will Chen watch over the rebirth of China!"
 league_collapse.67.a: "Mobilise the troops!"

 league_collapse.68.t: "Meeting with Fengtian"
 league_collapse.68.d: "Working in shady backrooms and through the network of the Black Dragon Society, [ANQ.GetLeader] has been able to establish contact with [FNG.GetNameDef]. Although the influence of the Japanese in the affairs of their government threatens to make satire of Chen's anti-concessionist pledges, he is fully aware that he has little choice in the matter and that their request to recognise Fengtian as the sole Chinese government is more than reasonable in exchange for sorely needed support.\n\nNow that the first shipment of gold and small arms has arrived in Anqing, showing that Fengtian is ready to stand by its word and with the Nanjing military mobilising for an invasion of our domain, it seems that the time for waiting is now fully over. We will strike first and we will strike hard, ensuring that the German stooges on the coast will be incapable of oppressing China any longer!"
 league_collapse.68.a: "Declare war on the League!"

 league_collapse.69.t: "Chen Sides with Fengtian"
 league_collapse.69.d: "The collapse of Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces has caused great disarray in China, and with the region quickly slipping into all-out-war, it seems that [ANQ.GetLeader], the head of [ANQ.GetNameDef], has been forced to look beyond Beijing for help. His decision to recognise Fengtian as the legitimate government of China signals a major blow towards the Germans and their Qing lapdogs. By allying with [FNG.GetLeader], [ANQ.GetLeader] has become our ally, yet Chen's anti-concessionist stance stands a major barrier to cooperation and brings to question his usefulness as a proxy for Japanese interests. Nevertheless, discrete support for Chen will weaken our enemies and strengthen our allies - a worthwhile goal."
 league_collapse.69.a: "We will watch with interest"

 league_collapse.101.d_1: "It would appear that our manoeuvres within Zhejiang have been answered gracefully! Governor Chen Yi, estranged at best but nonetheless reliable, has reassured League Marshal Qi of his continued persistence within the League of Eight Provinces. Perhaps convinced by Chen Tiaoyuan's unruly qualities, or valuing provincial stability that can only be ensured by the established political order, Chen Yi and his Zhejiang Clique have mobilised their units for the League once more.\n\nEven better, Commander Shangguan Yunxiang, stationed within Zhejiang, has joined Chen Yi's rallying cry, establishing his forced in the perimeter of Jinhua. Intent on marching west to seize the provincial capital of Anhui, and restore order to the League oncemore. Although we should still remain vigilant, as the entrance of Zhejiang into the conflict leaves the province susceptible to advances from the Kuomintang or Anhui armies."

General Shangguan Yunxiang, estranged at best but nonetheless reliable, has reassured League Marshal Qi of his continued persistence within the League of Eight Provinces. Perhaps convinced by Chen Tiaoyuan's unruly qualities, valuing provincial stability that can only be ensured by the established political order, or enticed by our rewards, Shangguan and his subordinates have mobilised their units to depose Governor Chen Yi.\n\nWith his seizure of the provincial capital, the League now formally controls Zhejiang province. With his forces cemented around Hangzhou a stable corridor south to Fujian and Jiangxi has been preserved, with Governor Deng and Governor Zhou no doubt breathing sighs of relief.\n\nAlthough we should still remain vigilant, as the entrance of Zhejiang into the conflict, alongside the regrouping of the Zhejiang Clique, leaves the province susceptible to advances from the Kuomintang, Zhejiang or Anhui armies."
 league_collapse.101.a: "A fantastic effort!"

 league_collapse.102.t_1: "Shangguan Rises in Zhejiang"
 league_collapse.102.t_2: "Chen Yi Rises in Zhejiang"
 league_collapse.102.d_1: "Shangguan Yunxiang, one of Sun Chaunfang's most capable generals has sided with the Anqing clique in this most desperate hour. His forces have rallied around Jinhua and are preparing to march north to take the provincial capital of Hangzhou and kick out the forces of [LEP.GetLeader]. Shangguan has long chafed under the leadership of Chen Yi, and should we find ourselves victorious, it is highly likely that he will demand his former master's position as governor of Zhejiang."
 league_collapse.102.d_2: "As he promised us, Governor Chen Yi of the Zhejiang province has risen up and joined our forces! With his help, we now control Hangzhou, which provides us with a port to accept Fengtian and covert Japanese supplies. Nonetheless, the Anqing-Hangzhou corridor is far from secure as it forms an easy prey to the superior forces of [LEP.GetLeader]."

 #Shangguan Yunxiang joins Anqing:
 league_collapse.103.t_1: "General Shangguan Rises in Zhejiang!"
 #Chen Yi joins Anqing:
 league_collapse.103.t_2: "Governor Chen Yi Rises in Zhejiang!"
 league_collapse.103.d_1: "Having long been an estranged, borderline isolationist, Governor within the League, Chen Yi has lead one of the nation's most prosperous and financially profitable provinces under a steady hand. However he was no friend to the League itself, with his loyalty cemented only by a personal friendship between himself and Sun Chuanfang. Remaining uneasily neutral in recent months, it would appear that he has finally revealed his hand.\n\nCiting the necessity for the League to maintain stability and order not just within Zhejiang but also within the broader provinces, Governor Chen has joined with the Acting League Marshal in condemning Governor Chen Tiaoyuan's depravity and blatant power grab, blaming him for fanning the flames that led the usually vigilant Sun Chuanfang to immense weakness.\n\nHis news was not well received all throughout his province however, as the infamously not that popular amongst his subordinates. However he retains a retinue of some of the League's best and brightest, and most absolutely will prove a boon for the Acting League Marshal. Nonetheless, General Shangguan Yunxiang, citing the abuses of his superiors, has rallied the Hangzhou Garrison and the units under his command to Chen Tiaoyuan's cause, and agaisnt Governor Chen Yi.\n\nWith Chen reinforcing the city's core and awaiting reinforcements, it would appear that Shangguan's long held shameless ambitions has spurned his defection. This rapid spread of insubordination is increasingly concerning."
 league_collapse.103.d_2: "Having long been an estranged, borderline isolationist, Governor within the League, Chen Yi has lead one of the nation's most prosperous and financially profitable provinces under a steady hand. However he was no friend to the League itself, with his loyalty cemented only by a personal friendship between himself and Sun Chuanfang. Remaining uneasily neutral in recent months, it would appear that he has finally revealed his hand.\n\nUtilising his contacts and pulling on his sympathies to the anti-concessionists, Governor Chen Yi has joined Governor Chen Tiaoyuan in his condemnations of the Acting League Marshal, and the overall state of the League. Rallying his forces in Zhejiang, Chen has accused League Marshal Qi of ordering the botched assassination of Sun Chuanfang.\n\nBroadcasting his official secession from the League of Eight Provinces, Chen Yi has joined forces with Governor Chen in engaging in open hostilities with the League. Chen is a capable commander, and carries with him some of the League's brightest and most talented minds. Albeit not particularly popular amongst his own soldiers, his subordinates are, and his defection to Anhui has utterly decapitated Nanjing from Jiangxi and Fujian province.\n\nGeneral Shangguan Yunxiang for his part, and already active in the area, has assured League Marshal Qi of his unwavering loyalty and commitment to defeating the traitorous Governors. Known for his shameless ambition, Shangguan is surely anticipating more than a medal for his efforts."
 league_collapse.103.a: "Damnable Zhejiangers!"

 league_collapse.104.t: "\"The Fool\" Declares War"
 league_collapse.104.d: "The ascension of Governor Qi to the position of acting League Marshal was naturally not well received by most. With Beijing refraining from comment, as it struggles to handle its own issues, the various provinces have ranged from refusing to acknowledge Qi's authority to downright declaring him a traitor and autocrat. Some magazines and newspapers have started drawing relations between Qi's succession of the League Marshal and his similar immediate succession of Governor Li Chun in the 1920s, after Li's \"suicide\".\n\nNonetheless Qi wasted no time in wielding his sabre, demanding fealty from those Governors whom have not formally granted it. Threatening swift retribution against all those he has deemed traitors, he has demanded recognition from Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi, to no avail. Similarly, he has threatened Chen Yi directly with notions of invasion in order to ensure loyalty within Zhejiang. Most pressingly however is the demands made to the estranged Governor Chen Tiaoyuan.\n\nHaving been militarising the border with the League ever since his informal secession, few understood what Chen's game was. Was he waiting to strike Nanjing when an opening presented itself? Or merely defending his domain against the wave of chaos. Following League Marshal Qi's demand for Chen to submit to League Authority however, Chen retorted with a strike of his own.\n\nCalling upon his fellow governors and the central government to aid him in his cause, Chen Tiaoyuan has denounced Marshal Qi's ascension as \"totally illegitimate\" and a \"farce\", accusing him of planning Sun's assassination and his following grab for power well in advance. This argument, held by many of Qi's new subordinates and former superiors, has already proved convincing. A number of younger officers have begun defecting and deserting to his ranks. With this, a series of units from the Anhui army have begun crossing into the borders of Jiangxi and Jiangsu, intending to render Nanjing under their domain."
 league_collapse.104.a: "Intolerable swine!"

 league_collapse.105.t: "Liangguang Secedes!"
 league_collapse.105.d: "Ominously silent following recent events, Liangguang has long been aloof and disconnected from the broader League structure. Originally the Southern Zhili and Northern Zhili squabbled over the implementation of their own governors within the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. With the Old Guangxi Clique under the aging Lu Rongting having been reluctantly recognised by Beijing, Governor of Guangdong was a free-for-all before the return of Chen Jiongming. With League forces retreating from Liangguang provinces following the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, the League would never again extend any measurable influence within Guangdong or Guangxi, besides nominal fealty.\n\nSilence from the South was formally broken however, as this evening a joint declaration from Governor Chen Jiongming and General Lu Yuguang (speaking on behalf of his elderly father) announced the formal secession from the League of Eight Provinces. With their declaration's effects applying immediately. The Governor and General denounced the League's \"disregard for the rights and needs of the people\", and singled out the Acting League Marshal for special criticism, but stopped short of outright declaring hostilities.\n\nWith Governor Chen Tiaoyuan and his Anhui army already openly engaging in conflict with the League, this turn of events has truly proven disastrous, and in most cases would merit a response. However quite evidently Acting League Marshal Qi is particularly tied up at the moment."
 league_collapse.105.a: "We will extinguish their flame soon enough."

 league_collapse.106.t: "Hunan Secedes!"
 league_collapse.106.d: "Already the most autonomous province within the League, Hunan has lied in wait as events have unfolded since the start of this year. Governor Zhao Hengti being reinstated by Wu Peifu, he only joined the League to secure material support in restoring order in Hunan. The province distanced itself notably in 1932 after a brief scare, when General Ye Kaixin's forces moved to the Jiangxi border to keep the socialists out of Hunan. With the Jade Marshal's intervention, Hunan secured enough autonomy to keep our forces out of the Province, and our grip over Hunan has only faltered since.\n\nBut with Liangguang seceding, Governor Zhao has decided that it is the time to act. Ever the democrat, he presented a Bill to the Provincial Assembly to formally secede from the League. Personally sponsoring the Bill, Zhao gave a speech on how Hunan can no longer tie itself to the corruption of the League, that it's failed to provide any stability, and that if they don't break with the League the fires of war will rage across the entire Province.\n\nThe Assembly seemed to be moved by these words, the majority of it voting heavily in favour of secession, and with the vote Governor Zhao formally declared all agreements Hunan had made with the League Marshal to be null and void. While we'd like to move against Hunan for this intransigence, Chen's army already on our doorstep means we must tolerate this insubordination from Hunan's Governor, at least for the time being."
 league_collapse.106.a: "They can enjoy their autonomy while they still have it."

### Section 4 - Flavour Events About the Collapse ###

 league_collapse_flavour.1.t: "The Sale of the ZheGan Railroad"
 league_collapse_flavour.1.d: "The past few weeks have seen a great deal of economic activity in the League of Eight Provinces, the southern conglomerate of provinces ruled by our nominal subordinate, Sun Chuanfang. Even more heavily influenced by German economic support than we are, the League just finished construction on a major railroad, the ZheGan line. Though funded by the Germans, it was largely built by Chinese labour, leading many to hope for a more equitable relationship between German and Chinese in the League, at least in economic affairs.\n\nA few days ago, in a surprising move, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of their subsidiary group, the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft - including this new ZheGan route.\n\nThis move angered many native Chinese residents of the League, who saw the ZheGan line as a potential building block in an equal relationship between Europeans and Asians. Widespread protests have broken out, inflamed by conspiracies of fraud and embezzlement on the part of Sun's cronies."
 league_collapse_flavour.1.a: "We need to keep an eye on this."

 league_collapse_flavour.2.t: "Widespread Attacks on Foreigners"
 league_collapse_flavour.2.d: "Following the unrest surrounding the ZheGan railroad, a number of German investors and businessmen have been savagely attacked by rabid anti-foreign mobs. To make matters worse, widespread boycotts of German goods have began in the South, and this morning reports reached Beijing of bombings of railway stations in Hangzhou and other cities on the Central China Railway. Transportation has ground to a halt in many regions of the League, and Kuomintang guerrillas within MinGan have used this opportunity to stage increasingly daring attacks on isolated League garrisons.\n\nThe German ambassador in Beijing has demanded accountability, and while the League is largely autonomous from our control, it is still under our auspices officially. Wang Chengbin and other Zhili officials have long pushed to exert greater control over the League, and are urging Wu to use this crisis to leverage greater influence over the south. Wu, having long sought an excuse to contain Sun is currently drafting a telegram to demand accountability from Sun and offer our help should he need it. Unsaid, of course, is the demand for increased control over League affairs should he accept our help."
 league_collapse_flavour.2.a: "Let's see what Sun has to say..."

 league_collapse_flavour.3.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
 league_collapse_flavour.3.d: "Troubling information reached Luoyang and Beijing this morning. While reports are somewhat contradictory, it appears there was some sort of a massacre of peaceful protestors by League and German troops in the city of Wuhu. Some claim German troops simply mowed down the protestors, while others claim a group of Kuomintang radicals attacked the Germans and League troops first. Whatever the cause, the city has fallen into anarchy and protests have sprung up all over the League.\n\nIronically, at the same time as we received this information we received a report from Sun Chuanfang claiming he has the situation under control. Some Zhili generals such as Cai Chengxun are pushing for a major intervention in the south should the situation deteriorate further, but Wu has yet to take a clear position on the issue, fearful of intervention from Zhang Zuolin.\n\nFurther exasperating our problems, Bai Jianwu has informed the Jade Marshal that the Chinese Empire Reform Association have somehow received information on the situation, perhaps from contacts within progressives dotting the legations. It would seem they are planning to hold a scathing speech later in the assembly today, criticising the Zhili's lack of action. Cao Kun's Harmony Association assemblymen are swift at work collaborating with the president on preparing a response, but it would appear we have been caught off guard."
 league_collapse_flavour.3.a: "\"Under control\" my ass..."

 league_collapse_flavour.4.t: "Anhui Breaks Free"
 league_collapse_flavour.4.d: "The province of Anhui, long chafing under Sun Chuanfang's autocratic rule, has essentially declared independence from the League this week. In a widely-distributed pamphlet, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan claimed that the Wuhu incident \"shows that Sun cannot manage this crisis, and essentially abrogates him from any responsibility in Anhui.\"\n\nXiao Yaonan, Wang Chengbin and Li Jichen, governors of Hubei, Zhili and Henan, have unilaterally begun to mobilise their troops against prospective \"Kuomintang incursions\", though Zhang Qihuang has advised Wu that their true intention is likely to prevent the chaos from flooding into the Central Plains, potentially escalating things with Chen, Sun or even [SHD.GetLeader]. Seeking to undercut their opportunity to invade and create another calamitious war in a similar vein to the conflict that pre-empted the Second ZhiFeng War, Wu declared a \"national state of readiness\" this morning to all assembled Beiyang Army Staff, he urging them to ready their troops for \"any possible armed conflict\", and placed the garrisons on the Shaanxi and Fengtian borders on high alert. Confused Zhili troops have largely fallen into line with Wu and any premature attack south was effectively ended before it began."
 league_collapse_flavour.4.a: "Let's hope this keeps them in line"

 league_collapse_flavour.5.t: "Refugees Flee League Chaos"
 league_collapse_flavour.5.d: "With widespread unrest sweeping the League of Eight Provinces, Governor Li Jichen of Henan and Xiao Yaonan of Hubei have telegrammed to President Cao and Marshal Wu, informing them both of increasing numbers of refugees flooding into their provinces, requesting any possible governmental response or assistance. Although it initially started as a trickled, over the course of the last few days the flow has dramatically increased, with whole families fleeing the explosive tornado of violence and banditry.\n\nSending further followup telegrams there afterwards, the Governors have indicated to the Cabinet that after sending their men to organise and interview the refugees, it would turn out that the authority within the League provinces has collapsed far more than what was previously believed. Furthermore, they have requested from Beijing additional food and supplies to handle all of the refugees. Marred by inefficiencies in bureaucracy, provincial government and insufficient finances, any support that the Cabinet deigns to provide would be of great cost, even if it is the humane course of action."
 league_collapse_flavour.5.a: "Terrible news. Send the supplies."
 league_collapse_flavour.5.b: "With a heavy heart, we must refuse."

 league_collapse_flavour.6.t: "Bloodbath on the Yangtze!"
 league_collapse_flavour.6.d: "In spite of their best efforts, the influx of refugees to the southern provinces has proven too much to handle. The Governors themselves have sent numerous telegrams to the Cabinet and President requesting additional assistance to alleviate their overwhelmed governments. Following a province-wide declaration of martial law made in Hubei, Governor Xiao Yaonan has ordered his troops to shut down all bridges and roads leading into the province from the League's former territory, denying all entry to all refugees, A large number of them, dessicated, homeless and angry, began to mass at a bridge over the Yangtze River on the outskirts of Wuhan.\n\nInsisting on entry into the province, it initially began as a peaceful protest, rallying for proper responsible government action. However it quickly escalated into a borderline full-scale riot, as refugees began to react violently against Xiao's troops, chucking rocks at the border guards. Eventually a group of men who had somehow armed themselves with stolen weapons — perhaps due to the carelessness of Xiao's troops — began to shoot at the border guards, who responded by opening fire, first warning shots, and then at the opposing gunmen. Those not actively participating in the fighting fled, stampeding other refugees and leaving their friends or family for dead on the bridge. Such grisly events have been repeated up and down our border with the League, Sichuan and Shandong, as mobs of refugees fleeing civil war and suffering find their way into even more bloodshed."
 league_collapse_flavour.6.a: "A calamity! The horror!"

 league_collapse_flavour.7.t: "Southern Governors Cut Contact"
 league_collapse_flavour.7.d: "With the violence within the League escalating daily, the governors of Yunnan and Guangdong, [YUN.GetLeader] and [GXC.GetLeader] have all but stopped responding to official government requests for information and status reports on the events unfolding within their territories. They have long despised our government, with both being similarly opposed to what they view as petty Warlords stretching their authority too far and corrupt bureaucrats too foolish to see the light — even to the point that Governor [YUN.GetLeader] waged a war in conjunction with Fengtian not too long ago. Whilst not unexpected, and in-fact quite foreseeable given the circumstances, this represents perhaps the final nail in the coffin regarding their official demeanour in regards to our government.\n\nMany in the Zhili's inner circle fear that this heralds a complete collapse of our authority, and news from out of Shanxi Province further confirmed these fears. The traitorous Feng Yuxiang, having once been an integral member of the Zhili Clique himself, was ousted from his control in Beijing in 1926. Exiled to Shaanxi once the Ma Governors of the Northwest came to their senses, he has formally denounced the actions of our government in what is now being internationally termed the \"Yangtze Incident\" earlier in the week. Referring to the recent events unfolding between the provinces of Hubei, Henan and our de-facto land of Shandong and Shaanxi.\n\nDeclaring our government completely unfit, with \"no capacity to rule China\", his nominal ally in Taiyuan, our estranged Governor Yan Xishan, has decried the violence as nothing more than barbarity but has stopped short of condemning the Cabinet, Wu or Cao personally. Clearly not willing to compromise his neutrality. Nonetheless, it is clear that the national order so hard fought for is heavily breaking down."
 league_collapse_flavour.7.a: "The vast inferno of rage devours us."

 #league_collapse_flavour.8 uses loc from league_collapse.57

 league_collapse_flavour.9.t: "The Smiling Tiger Fades Away"
 league_collapse_flavour.9.d: "Shadows have long loomed large over the League Marshal's chambers. Almost delicately, there he lay, Sun Chuanfang, once the third most powerful man in the whole nation, reduced to nothing more than dead weight. At least, that's what his detractors think. To others, to his thousand friends, their sadness is deep, their grief everlasting, and the memories permeable. Visited frequently by his closest associates, his friends, and of course his own children. Weeping rivers of sorrow, they could only hope for Sun's recovery, as German doctors worked around the clock to resuscitate the Tiger, so he could bear his fangs once more.\n\nIn the midst of the night of Nanjing, amongst the echoing firefights, the explosions, the yelling, only a singular figure sat in the room with League Marshal Sun. Playing with a lighter, dressed in the shadows of the room, Acting League Marshal Qi Xieyuan watched over Sun Chuanfang's comatose body. The German doctors of course, were under his retinue. He was the one sustaining Sun's timid grasp on life. And he could so easily snuff it out, like the flame of his lighter.\n\nFlicking his lighter, igniting it, and closing it again. Qi repeated this motion for what felt like hours. Much toyed with the mind of the General. Sun and Qi, they were comrades, truly. Both born of the Southern Zhili, having fought in the Southeast for a decade. Yet Qi never forgave Sun for his inaction in 1925. When Qi needed help most as Governor of Zhejiang, he desperately pleaded with Sun, Governor of Fujian, for help. Together they could've withstood the onslaught of Lu Yongxiang and Zhang Zongchang. And yet, Sun instead built up for a year, instead of immediately counter-attacking.\n\nSuch betrayal, it had cost Qi dearly! Struggling to make his comeback, he would be \"graciously\" accepted by Sun after the formation of the League. Working his magic, Qi did the dirty work for Sun, and now here they are. The helpless Sun, and the all-powerful Qi. Who could stop him? Pulling the plug?\n\nReports flooded in the next morning. Sun Chuanfang finally succumbed to his wounds, having passed in the middle of the night. With the newspapers drafting an eulogy remembering him in a mixed nature, praising his \"authenticity\", patriotism but decrying his brutality. A funeral will reportedly take place once order is restored to the League. Although Sun's demise made the front page of morning headlines, it was surrounded by reports of troop movements, student massacres, and the utter collapse of his empire."

Their skills will surely prove an asset to us."

 league_war.10.t: "Anqing Is Victorious!"
 league_war.10.d: "Great news has been telegrammed to President Cao and Marshal Wu! With the guns in Nanjing having mostly fallen silent, it would appear that Governor, now the newly inducted League-Marshal, Chen Tiaoyuan has successfully ousted Qi Xieyuan's corrupt kleptocratic government, with the German investors, businessmen and Southern Zhili demagogues having either fled to the Legations, German East Asia, or folded into governments more accepting.\n\nSecuring control over territories that are on the periphery of Anhui province, our support in the war no doubt served utterly crucial in Chen's swift victory over the League. Whilst unrest and fighting still continues on in other parts of the former League's territories, the Central Government has earned itself a steadfast ally within China, firmly integrated into our sphere of influence."

Whilst unrest and fighting still continues on in other parts of the former League's territories, the Central Government has earned itself a steadfast, if ideologically corrupted, ally within China, firmly integrated into our sphere of influence."

Despite Qi's extensive support from both our erstwhile German allies and our own capabilities, he has managed to fumble it all into the pit of despair.\n\nWith his machinations behind his rise to power coming to light, it would appear that Qi's ambition was his ultimate downfall. Desiring the League for himself, he would inadvertently doom not just himself but his men alongside him. With his kleptocrats fleeing to the League or into our borders, the League-Marshal himself is reportedly missing, fleeing the capital with as much wealth he and his direct entourage could carry.\n\nWithout League-Marshal Qi to guard our flank and revive the South Zhili, Nanjing and the League provinces are beholden to only nefarious and hostile regimes, all with machinations on Beijing."
 league_war.12.a: "You were a crook, but you were our damned crook!"

 league_war.13.t: "Anqing Is Defeated!"
 league_war.13.d: "Despite their convictions to anti-concessionism, despite their patriotism, despite their valour, it would appear that the noble forces of Governor Chen Tiaoyuan have been utterly crushed and repelled from their home province. With his provincial government all but destroyed, the \"Fool\" General reportedly is rumoured to have died in the fighting, or otherwise fled into the shadows of the urban underworld, or even that of any regime that will accept him.\n\nAs for his lieutenants and intellectuals that backed him, they too have followed a similar fate, fleeing to Hunan or otherwise. Whatever the fate of these men may be, it is a grave, disastrous day for our government, as the victory of the anti-concessionist movement is something many of our leading officers, politicians and intellectuals had placed stakes upon.\n\nWithout Chen, we are left with only potentially hostile regimes to control some of China's most profitable and well developed provinces, leaving a serious security threat on our direct periphery."
 league_war.13.a: "You were a brave man Chen, defeated by ambition."

 league_war.14.t: "Governor Chen is Defeated!"
 league_war.14.d: "Today is a glorious day! Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, fitting of his moniker \"The Fool\", has finally been vanquished! With his Anhui Army utterly helpless against the onslaught of the League's finest, his forces crumbled and fled to the hinterlands. Seeking employment wherever they can. The traitorous Governor is rather unfortunately nowhere to be found, having fled Anhui province upon the encroachment of League soldiers.\n\nNonetheless, the great progenitor of it all, the one who poured gasoline on the fire, the one who surely led to the incapacitation of the great Sun Chuanfang, he has been cast away into the dustbin of history. And with him, the anti-concessionists are sure to follow. Now however, we must continue to look onto the horizons, for League Marshal Qi Xieyuan has many ambitions to fulfil."
 league_war.14.a: "Really was rather Foolish."
