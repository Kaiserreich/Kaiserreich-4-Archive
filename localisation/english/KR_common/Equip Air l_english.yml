 ALB_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 ALB_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Adopted by the Austrian Air Force in 1933, dozens of D.Vs were provided to Albania by the Dual-Monarchy. Basic domestic production on a small scale was also begun."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
 ALB_small_plane_airframe_5: "Letov L.52"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 ALB_small_plane_airframe_5_short: "L.52"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.442"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."

 AUS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 AUS_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 AUS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 AUS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"

 BOS_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 BOS_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 BOS_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 BOS_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 BOS_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 BOS_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 BOS_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 BOS_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 BOS_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 BOS_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 BOS_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 BOS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 BOS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."

 CRO_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 CRO_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead.

 FIN_CAS_equipment_1: "Fokker-VL C.X III"
 FIN_CAS_equipment_1_short: "C.X III"
 FIN_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Adopted by the Dutch in 1933, the Fokker C.X was designed fly low to the ground to avoid anti-aircraft fire and as such had a low stall speed. The Finnish-built series III variant had a slightly modified chassis and redesigned wings as well as a new engine."
 FIN_CAS_equipment_2: "Fokker C.XIII"
 FIN_CAS_equipment_2_short: "C.XIII"
 FIN_CAS_equipment_3: "SAAB A 21"
 FIN_CAS_equipment_3_short: "A 21"
 FIN_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "The Saab A-21 was first a fighter named J 21, but because it shown an inadequate performance for its fighter role. Despite this, the Saab design bureau realised its cell would be an excellent platform for an attacker. Its unique push-pull configuration, its powerful engine and the choice of loadout make it a powerful CAS."

 FIN_fighter_equipment_0: "Gloster Kukko"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Kukko"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "The Kukko is a modified licence-produced Gloster Gamecock Mk II with a new German engine."
 FIN_fighter_equipment_1: "VL Myrsky"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Myrsky"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In the 1930s, Finland realised that it was rapidly falling behind its allies and enemies alike in fighter designs, lacking a steel-framed monoplane entirely. The Myrsky was designed by the Finnish state aircraft factory on the basis of German designs and featuring a Canadian engine."
 FIN_fighter_equipment_2: "VL Humu"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Humu"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "While the Brewster Buffalo carrier fighter was initially rejected for US service and redesigned, the Finnish were immediately interested in the Brewster company's initial model. Before any prototype had ever been produced, Finland placed an order for several Buffalos. Upon arrival in Finland, the planes were retrofitted in their entirety."
 FIN_fighter_equipment_3: "VL Pyörremyrsky"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Pyörremyrsky"
 FIN_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The Pyörremyrsky was designed around later models of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 with substantial changes made to improve the craft's agility, range, and armaments. The Pyörremyrsky is a remarkably quick and manoeuvrable fighter."
 FIN_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "SAAB J 21R"

 FIN_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Blackburn Ripon"
 FIN_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Ripon"
 FIN_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Blackburn Ripon is truly a sight to behold in Finnish service. This is not because the craft is a particularly spectacular naval bomber, but because the Ripon was indeed produced by the Blackburn Union state aircraft company in the syndicalist Union of Britain. How Finland managed to purchase the craft and gain approval and the tooling necessary to license-produce the craft is highly speculated at. The Finnish Ripon is of the Ripon IIF design."
 FIN_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "VL Kotka"
 FIN_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Kotka"
 FIN_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Originally conceived of as a cheaper alternative to the Ripon, the Kotka outperforms the Ripon in nearly every way. Fitted with a new Canadian engine, the Kotka is both fast and capable of low level-low speed flight without stalling - essential to torpedo bombing."

 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "VL Tähti"
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Tähti"
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Developed from the Canadian Beaufort medium bomber in line with Canada's own Beaufighter design, the VL Tähti has been significantly lightened and its armaments and engine retrofitted for its new role. Though, unlike the Canadian Beaufighter, the bombardier's compartment has not been removed. Instead, the Tähti features a rotating front turret."
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Petlyakov Pe-3"
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Pe-3"
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Noting the success of Communard and British heavy fighter designs, in 1941 famed aircraft designer Vladimir Petlyakov and his eponymous aerospace firm began work on a fighter variant of the earlier Pe-2 medium bomber. As with many Russian designs, despite hostility between Russia and Finland, the Finnish government contracted the Petlyakov for a substantial number of the new aircraft."
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "VL Vihuri"
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Vihuri"
 FIN_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "While some accuse the Finnish of copying the design of the Union of Britain's 'Mosquito', the Finnish 'Vihuri' is indeed a Finnish design taking cues from German, Russian, Entente, and Syndicalist models."

 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avro VL Anson"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "Anson"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "The Avro Anson is a medium bomber built from the Canadian airliner, the Avro 652. Unable to afford modern German designs, in 1935, the Finnish opted to adopt the Anson as a stopgap solution to their lack of bomber craft."
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Bristol-VL Blenheim"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Blenheim"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Blenheim medium bomber is Canada's first all-metal bomber. It was adopted by the Finish Air Force following the surprising success of the Anson, which impressed the country's leadership with Canadian aircraft."
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Tupelov SB 2M-103"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "SB 2M-103"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Before the development of the Tupelov SB, Russian firms lagged behind their western counterparts in modern medium-bomber designs. The trials and tribulations of the SB, however, injected much needed innovation into the country. The 103 features several improvements over older production models. While the Finnish adopted variant is not, strictly speaking, a true 103, Finnish SBs have been similarly retrofitted."
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Arkhangelsky SBB-2"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "SBB-2"
 FIN_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Based on a late model Tupelov SB, the Arkhangelsky designed the new SB-RK in late 1940 as a replacement for the SB adapted to dive-bombing rather than low level-high speed attacks. The SB-RK was later renamed to SBB and with the prototype's rejection by the Russian military, the SBB was redesigned, with the new craft designated SBB-2. The SBB-2 was offered to several foreign governments, with the Finnish securing a licence to produce the aircraft."

 GAL_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 GAL_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 GAL_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 GAL_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 GAL_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
 GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"

 GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 GAL_small_plane_airframe_5_short: "L.52"
 GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.442"
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
 GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
 GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero L.44"
 GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "L.44"
 GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "With the reliability of jet engines increasing and competition ever-so fierce, Aero tackled the challenge to design a next-generation fast-bomber, culminating into the L.44 fast bomber."

 GAL_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Avia-Dornier Do.19"

 GER_CAS_equipment_0_short: "Hs 123"
 GER_small_plane_cas_airframe_0_short: "$GER_CAS_equipment_0_short$"
 GER_CAS_equipment_0_desc: "One of the first designs created by the Henschel Flugzeugwerke the Hs 123 proved to be a formidable close-support attack aircraft. Quickly after defeating Fieseler in a design contest the Hs 123 was adopted by the air force thanks to its all metal construction and superior manoeuvrability. Fitted with a BMW 132Dc engine, it is capable of high speeds and nigh vertical dive bombing attacks. On the testing grounds it proved to be highly reliable and particularly easy to repair."

 GER_cv_small_plane_cas_airframe_0_short: "$GER_cv_CAS_equipment_0_short$"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_0_desc: "Mainly due to its short wingspan and easy maintenance work, the Imperial Navy too decided against the Fi 98 and instead ordered the Hs 123. Used by both branches of the Heer, spare parts are easier and cheaper to acquire making the Hs 123 T, some armed with torpedoes, popular among the Admiralty."

 GER_CAS_equipment_1_short: "Ju 87"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_1: "Junkers 87C"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_1_short: "Ju 87C"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "The Ju 87C is a carrier-capable variant of the iconic Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, specially designed for naval operations. Equipped with strengthened landing gear, arrestor hooks, and foldable wings for carrier storage, it retains the accuracy and fearsome dive-bombing capabilities of its land-based counterparts. The aircraft quickly earned a reputation for delivering precise strikes against enemy ships and coastal targets, becoming a cornerstone of the Imperial Navy's strike force"
 GER_CAS_equipment_2: "Henschel Erdkampfflugzeug 129"
 GER_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Hs 129"
 GER_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Having realised the need to upgrade from the outdated biplane design of the Hs 123, the Supreme Army Command ordered a new design for ground-attack airplanes. Designed for interdiction of materiel and logistics, the plane had to be thickly armoured for its low-level head-on strafing runs. While initially Henschel used a low power Argus engine it was later switched to a higher power BMW engine, eventually leading to serial production of the aircraft. Due to its high calibre cannon it is often referred to as 'Büchsenöffner' ('can opener') among the troops."
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2: "Junkers Ju 187 C"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Ju 187 C"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "The Admiralty, having seen the successes of the Hs 129 developed a new iteration of land-based Ju 87. The new design, albeit focused on ground attacks, proved to work well for torpedo attacks and the thick armour makes the planes very durable against anti-aircraft fire and dogfights."
 GER_CAS_equipment_3: "Dornier Jagdbomber 355"
 GER_CAS_equipment_3_short: "Do 355"
 GER_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Seeing the need to replace the old Henschel planes, the High Command ordered the design of new ground attack planes. Dornier, known for his exceptional designs, won the war ministry over, with this unorthodox but highly aerodynamic style. Unlike other planes the Do 355 has one propeller at the front and one at the back as well as its engine behind the cockpit which allows for higher performance and a better roll rate than other aircraft."

 GER_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Designed to replace the Ff 65, the Ff 68 met the most optimistic expectations in terms of handling and agility from the outset. Victory in a training battle against its main competitor Hb 51 finally confirmed the Ff 68 as the next German fighter. While now are mainly outdated planes (despite objections from the Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen side), they are still used as the night fighters by the German military."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen Träger-Jagdflugzeug 68"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Ff 68 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "A well liked biplane, the Ff 68 was selected into service aboard the Kaiserliche Marine's aircraft carriers. Little modification was needed to make them suitable for carrier service, and much like their ground-based counterparts, it received high praise by carrier crews for its docile control characteristics."

 GER_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 109"
 GER_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke responded to a fighter tender with the modern mono-plane Bf 109 design. Despite the generally accepted point of view in German military circles that a fighter must necessarily be a biplane, the Bf 109 fighter, mounting the DB 600 engine, was accepted in service due to its heavier armament and significantly higher top speed compared with other designs, not to mention the ability of recovering from the spin almost at any time."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Träger-Jagdflugzeug 109"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 109 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "With the significantly improved knowledge of aerodynamics and engine performance, the Kaiserliche Marine sent out contracts for a new carrier-borne aircraft. Unsurprisingly, they selected the Bf 109 that won the contract issued by the Heer. Modifications were made to ensure that it was carrier capable, including the wings and control surfaces being lengthened, fitting tailhooks and catapult fittings, as well as the implementation of foldable wingtips."
 GER_fighter_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Jagdflugzeug 190"
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Fw 190"
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Difficulties to produce enough Daimler-Benz inline engines and successes of using radial engines in fighter designs by other nations, made the prospects of building a radial engine powered fighter promising. Developed by the personal initiative of Kurt Waldemar Tank, the chief engineer of Focke-Wulf, the Fw 190 design is notable for the survivability of the structure, ease of management, widespread use of modular assembly methods and ease of maintenance. Outperforming the still good Bf 109, but having child diseases of engine and concerning pilots with its armament, the new fighter was accepted in service after initial tests."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Träger-Jagdflugzeug 190"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Fw 190 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Due to limits of the Bf 109 airframe such as a weak and problematic gear leg, made a new fighter platform necessary and difficulties in developing the Bf 155 project means that producing a purpose-built carrier-borne fighter is out of the question. A conversion of the latest fighter aircraft, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was selected. Modifications were made, much like the Bf 109 T, fitting tailhooks and catapult fittings."

 GER_fighter_equipment_3: "Focke-Wulf Jagdflugzeug 152"
 GER_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Fw 152"
 GER_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "By early 1944, it became apparent that the development potential of the Fw 190 with the BMW 801 engine had dwindled. This became even more apparent with the advent of the new enemy fighters. A heavily modified Fw 190, the Fw 152 design development started in 1942 and has such features as increased fuel tanks alongside with speed and much heavier armament compared with the Fw 190. It's outstanding performance and ensuing popularity with the crews made it the poster child of Germany's air forces."

 HUN_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 HUN_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 HUN_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 HUN_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 HUN_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 HUN_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

 JAP_CAS_equipment_1: "Kawasaki Ki-32"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_1_short: "Ki-32"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "The Ki-32 is Kawasaki's successful response to the Imperial Japanese Army's tender for a completely indigenously designed and constructed aircraft. The aircraft is comparable to the German Hs 123 in terms of capability with similar speed, operating altitude and payload capacity."
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_1: "Aichi D1A2"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_1_short: "D1A2"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "The D1A is the last Japanese aircraft to be designed by a foreign company, as Aichi requested Hansa-Brandenburg to assist in the design process. Revision to the D1A produced the D1A2, improving aerodynamics and powered by a more powerful engine. Slow introduction of the succeeding Aichi D3A meant that it served well into the late 1930s, when it was considerably obsolete."
 JAP_CAS_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi Ki-51"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Ki-51"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "The successor to the Ki-32, the Ki-51 was able to mount a stronger engine, but with largely the same airframe and continuing to use non-retractable landing gears. Despite the outdated features, the biggest redeeming feature of the Ki-51 was that it was able to take off from rough airfields in Taiwan, Korea and China when many other aircraft cannot, being the defining close support aircraft Japan fielded."
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_2: "Aichi D3A"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_2_short: "D3A"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Due to the extensive problems in the first prototype, the Aichi D3A was not accepted into service until well into 1939. The revised aircraft proved better than the Nakajima D3N1, but some directional instability remained until 1940. After resolving this problem, the D3A was found to be highly manoeuvrable compared to other aircraft of similar roles, especially planes used by the Imperial Japanese Army."
 JAP_CAS_equipment_3: "Manshū Ki-98"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_3_short: "Ki-98"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "The unconventionally designed Ki-98 utilises a pusher propeller system and a 2,000 horsepower Mitsubishi engine to reach a top speed of 730 km/h. Originally designed as a high-altitude interceptor, its highly responsive control system made it also suitable for ground-attack, and the 37mm nose-mounted cannon proved to be more than capable of attacking armoured targets in China and Southern Asia."
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_3: "Yokosuka D4Y Suisei"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_3_short: "D4Y Suisei"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Demand and design for a new Carrier-capable dive bomber started in 1940, but a lack of available design staff significantly delayed the introduction of the D4Y Suisei. Early prototypes used a dubiously license-produced German inline engine, while later models returned to radial engines. A slim and highly streamlined fuselage allowed it to reach high speeds in horizontal flight and in dives. This, combined with excellent manoeuvrability, gave the Suisei superior performance to contemporary dive bombers, only losing out in payload capacity."

 JAP_fighter_equipment_0: "Nakajima Type 91"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Type 91"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Designed in 1935, the Type 91 suffered numerous initial teething issues of poor directional stability and centre of gravity. This caused a delay into service until late into 1935 and only entered into widespread service in 1936. Despite the initial problems, the Type 91 was a competent fighter and highly respected."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Nakajima A4N"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_0_short: "A4N"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "The A4N incorporated a 730 hp engine as well as an all-metal design, adapting the Army's Ki-10 fighter and returning to a biplane design. Command staff and pilots significantly preferred the more conventional biplane design even if it sacrificed performance, compared to Mitsubishi's 7-shi carrier fighter prototype which crashed during testing."
 JAP_fighter_equipment_1: "Nakajima Ki-27"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Ki-27"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Just as the Type 91 was introduced, the Imperial Japanese Army was already looking for a monoplane replacement, but with the same armament of two light machine guns. The Ki-27 proved to be able to turn just as tightly as the preceding Type 91 with a low wing loading while also being faster."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi A5M"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "A5M"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After producing a disappointing prototype for the 7-shi carrier fighter tender, Mitsubishi refined the design and produced the A5M. The new plane featured thin elliptical, inverted gull wings and a fixed undercarriage, becoming one of the first monoplanes to be deployed atop carriers."
 JAP_fighter_equipment_2: "Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Ki-43 Hayabusa"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "First built in 1939, the Ki-43 was a disappointment to many pilots, but a progressive series of modifications to the fighter significantly improved its performance, which made it the most popular land-based fighter of the Imperial Japanese Army with its high climb rate and manoeuvrability. However, despite the modifications, little was done to improve the firepower of the Hayabusa, as it only mounted two rifle calibre machine guns."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "A6M Rei-sen"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Just as the revolutionary Mitsubishi A5M started to enter service, the IJN started to look for a successor, with detailed specifications calling for a highly capable and heavily armed fighter. Nakajima pulled out of the competition after reviewing the specifications, while Mitsubishi persevered. The A6M improved on the A5M in all but low-speed manoeuvrability, impressing navy pilots with the overall outstanding capabilities."
 JAP_fighter_equipment_3: "Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Ki-84 Hayate"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Despite the praise the Ki-43 Hayabusa received, pilots reported disappointment over the survivability, speed and armament. The Ki-84 was designed to remedy such issues, and excelled at its role. Armed with up to four 20mm cannons, it is reportedly one of the best fighters of its era one could pilot."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_3: "Mitsubishi A7M Reppū"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_3_short: "A7M Reppū"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Ambitious admirals of the Imperial Japanese Navy sent out a tender for an even more capable aircraft than the A6M Rei-sen not long after its introduction. Mitsubishi's answer to the bid is the Reppū, with a wider wingspan, more powerful engine and significantly heavier armament compared to the A6M."

 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Nakajima J9N Unryū"
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J9N Unryū"
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After a German defector provided pictures and preliminary design plans of the Bf 262 to Japanese intelligence officers, the IJNAF was highly interested. Nakajima, having received a copy of these documents, sought to build their own. They cooperated with Ishikawajima to build the Ne-20 turbojet engine, and designed the aircraft to be more conventional compared to the Bf 262 with straight wings and a more aerodynamic fuselage. The resulting J9N Unryū would superficially resemble the Bf 262, but was otherwise a completely indigenous design."
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Kyūshū J7W Shinden-Kai"
 JAP_small_plane_airframe_5: "Kyūshū J7W Shinden-Kai"
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J7W Shinden-Kai"
 JAP_small_plane_airframe_5_short: "J7W Shinden-Kai"
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J7W Shinden was designed to mount a radial engine, but the potential of mounting a turbojet engine was also kept in mind, such as the Ishikawajima Ne-20 that was still being tested. When the turbojet engines proved their worth on the J9N Unryū, the concept was realised, and the J7W1 mounted the improved Nakajima Ne-230 engines with improvements to the fighter's armament in the form of another pair of 30mm cannons."

 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi G3M1"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "G3M1"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "After Mitsubishi bargained with Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku for backing the G3M project due to its disappointing first flight, the G3M1 was produced. Revisions to the airframe were made to allow it to carry torpedoes in addition to the standard payload of bombs. After the modifications were made, the G3M1's speed and range were unrivalled by any other great power's aircraft."
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Nakajima B5N"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "B5N"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The B5N is the first single wing torpedo bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy, proving to be substantially faster than other models in service, but also highly vulnerable to enemy fire. It was lightly armed with only a single rear facing machine gun, but the carrying capacity and speed of the aircraft remained highly competitive among contemporaries."
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi G4M"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "G4M"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "A further development on the G3M, demanding even longer range and higher speed, the G4M proved to be a worthy successor. It was able to carry a larger payload than the G3M, as well as capable of achieving a higher altitude and speed."
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Nakajima B6N Tenzan"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "B6N Tenzan"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "The B6N design was based on its predecessor B5N, improving the speed and payload capacity without significantly changing the airframe. The engine was replaced with a Mitsubishi model, which improved the Tenzan's speed, but did little to remedy the weak defensive armament and vulnerability to enemy fire."
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Yokosuka P1Y Ginga"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "P1Y Ginga"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The 15-shi design specifications demanded a bomber capable of accompanying the A6M Rei-sen fighters with the same armament of the preceding G4M. The P1Y Ginga would be highly streamlined, allowing it to achieve a speed rivalling single engine fighters during testing. This aircraft would serve mainly as a land-based naval bomber, with variants substituting as a night fighter and interceptor due to the high speed."
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Aichi B7A Ryūsei"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "B7A Ryūsei"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The B7A Ryūsei was designed to be used aboard Japan's new generation of aircraft carriers. The distinctive inverted gull wing allowed it to carry the same payload as a B6N Tenzan but at a noticeably higher speed with much more responsive control surfaces. It also broke Japan's tradition of not mounting forward facing defensive armament on attack aircraft, with two 20mm cannons placed in the wing roots."

 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Kawasaki Ki-38"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Ki-38"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The Ki-38 was a private venture by Kawasaki as a response to the development of twin-engine heavy fighters in Europe, such as the Bf 110. After the IJA was informed of the design and inspected the wooden mock up, they ordered a number to be built and flight tested. Initial testing revealed the plane to be severely underpowered, which was somewhat remedied by fitting the Nakajima Ha-25. The design would see service over the Southeastern Pacific as a long-range patrol aircraft."
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryū"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Ki-45 Toryū"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "To improve the performance of the Ki-38, a series of modifications were supposed to be made. However after realising that the engine would not be powerful enough to propel the aircraft after the modifications, a new plan was drawn up. The resultant aircraft would be reworked so significantly that it was essentially a new plane, and thus it was given a new designation."
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Kawasaki Ki-102"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Ki-102"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Despite externally resembling a Ki-45 Toryū, the Ki-102 was significantly more lethal compared to its predecessor. The 37mm Ho-204, and the later 57mm Ho-401 cannon, mounted in the nose made it a formidable aircraft when it came to bomber interception, where even a short firing pass could rip the sturdiest bombers' wing off."

 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Mitsubishi Ki-2"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "Ki-2"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "The Ki-2 is a Japanese adaptation of a Swedish bomber, originally designed as a German Junkers mail plane. The plane served well in reconnaissance roles and conducting light bombing. Despite being obsolete when introduced, it was still used until the end of the 1930s as a trainer."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi G3M"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "G3M"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The G3M was envisioned as a fast high-altitude all-purpose bomber for the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, the underpowered Hiro Type 91 engine meant that the aircraft could not reach its projected cruising speed, let alone the operating altitude. Mitsubishi would continue to modify the aircraft, but backing from within the Navy was lacking after a disappointing first flight. It necessitated intervention from Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku to make sure the aircraft entered service and was able to prove itself."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Kawasaki Ki-48 Sōkei"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Ki-48 Sōkei"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Experience from developing the Ki-38 and Ki-45 project proved valuable when designing the Ki-48. The plane was lighter than its fighter counterparts and had little technical issues, with satisfactory payload capacity. Dive bomber pilots were surprised by how responsive the controls were and the capability for the aircraft to perform dive bombing."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryū"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Ki-67 Hiryū"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Ambitious specifications for a successor to the Ki-48 Sōkei demanded the successor to be heavily armed to fend off interceptors, capable of high speeds and dive bombing as well as the ability to survive heavy battle damage. The resultant Ki-67 would have significantly better survivability compared to contemporary Japanese aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and many armour plates protecting the crew."
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Yokosuka R2Y2 Keiun-Kai"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "R2Y2 Keiun-Kai"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The disappointing performance estimates of the R1Y led to a new design being commissioned by the IJN, which resulted in the R2Y, mounting the Aichi Ha-70 compound engine. An additional study led to the R2Y mounting two Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines and with extra hardpoints on the revised wings. The newly added hardpoints made the Keiun a highly capable high-speed tactical bomber."
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Nakajima Ki-190 Ryūjin"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Ki-190 Ryūjin"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "A modification of the Ki-67 Hiryū, the Army sought to improve the aircraft's speed further by mounting a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines. Initial mechanical issues aside, the Ki-190 Ryūjin achieved well in excess of 900 kmph for maximum speed during testing and was quickly adopted by the IJA. It would retain many of the features of the Ki-67 Hiryū, while enjoying the high speed provided by a turbojet engine."

 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi Ki-21"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Ki-21"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "After the initial testing and competition with the Nakajima Ki-19 design, the Ki-21 was proved to be better, having better speed. However, production was slow and the type only entered widespread service in 1939, by which the aircraft was considerably outdated and obsolete."
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2: "Nakajima Ki-49 Donryū"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Ki-49 Donryū"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Designed to replace the Ki-21, the Donryū was heavily armed for Japanese standard, with half a dozen light machine guns and a cannon mounted in the rear, while being capable of a higher speed and longer range than bombers in other nations."
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3: "Nakajima G8N Renzan"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3_short: "G8N Renzan"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Despite disastrous results during initial testing and the third prototype accidentally catching fire and being destroyed, the G8N Renzan was one of the most well liked bombers. Fitted with the best turbocharger produced by Hitachi, the Renzan was able to reach a higher altitude than most Japanese aircraft, while the range or speed was comparable to any escort fighters."
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Nakajima G12N Shōri"
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "G12N Shōri"
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Due to the promising results of the turbo jet engine programme, the IJN requested the mechanically plagued G10N Fugaku to utilise the Nakajima Ne-230 engine. This necessitated significant rehauling of the airframe and the resulting aircraft was unrecognisable from the Fugaku, essentially being a new design, thus given a new designation and christened the Shōri."

 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi Ki-46"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1_short: "Ki-46"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1_desc: "A lightly armed and fast aircraft, it outperformed the fighters in service at the time of its introduction, but an even more powerful engine was fitted afterwards. It took well into 1939 for an aircraft that was widely produced to be able to catch up to a Ki-46."
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2: "Nakajima J1N1-C"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2_short: "J1N1-C"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2_desc: "Originally designed as a long-ranged bomber escort, the J1N1 Gekkō was forced into the role of an reconnaissance aircraft after most aircraft firms refused to design a dedicated aircraft due to being overloaded with designing or improving other aircraft. Nakajima suggested modifying the J1N1 Gekkō, and removed most of the forward facing armament, improving the aircraft's speed by a noticeable margin."

 JAP_transport_plane_equipment_1: "Nakajima Ki-34"
 JAP_transport_plane_equipment_1_short: "Ki-34"

 JAP_rocket_suicide_equipment_1: "Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka"
 JAP_rocket_suicide_equipment_1_short: "Ohka"
 JAP_rocket_suicide_equipment_1_desc: "The Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka was a purpose-built, rocket powered human-guided anti-shipping attack plane, designed to be employed should the tides of war turn against Japan's favour."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi J8M Shūsui"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_short: "J8M Shūsui"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_desc: "After much difficulty, the Japanese intelligence services managed to sneak out a number of design plans for a rocket-powered interceptor from Germany. The design plans were inspected by both the IJA and IJN, and the Navy went on to commission Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to reverse engineer a copy of the aircraft, which became the J8M Shūsui, with similar performances to its contemporaries."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_short: "Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_desc: "Typical to the interservice rivalry between the IJA and IJN, the two forces disagreed on the design for the interceptor, with the IJN favouring ditching a cannon for extra fuel tanks and the IJA preferring widening the aircraft instead. Thus, the IJA ordered an independent development of the Navy's J8M Shūsui, widening the wings and creating the Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3: "Mizuno Ki-156 Shinryū"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_short: "ki-156 Shinryū"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc: "The possibilities of ultra-high altitude strategic bombers bombing the Japanese mainland worried the Japanese High Command, and as such, they assigned the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal to investigate the possibilities of a high altitude interceptor. The original specifications were then modified to use the successful Mitsubishi Toko-Ro.2 rocket motor also mounted on the J8M Shūsui, with an additional demand of being able to act as a glider. This would result in the Ki-156 Shinryū, partially designed and manufactured by Mizuno, a sports equipment company that also built gliders."

 NFA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "In 1938, the French government requested a two- or three-seat multipurpose aircraft that could be used as an attack aircraft or for reconnaissance. Bloch proposed the MB.170, a twin-engined, low-winged cantilever monoplane, which was recognised as a very promising aircraft. After initial testing, the ventral dome was removed and the project underwent significant changes, transforming the MB.170 into a heavy fighter, while development of the different versions of the MB.170 was requested."

 NFA_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "In 1929, the French government issued a specification for a four-seat a multi-seat combat aircraft to act as a light bomber, reconnaissance aircraft and long-range escort fighter, on which Amiot suggested its Amiot 140 design. The Amiot 140 is a high-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, with corrugated wing skinning and a fixed tail wheel undercarriage. Adopted in 1934, the modified Amiot 143 was practically retrained into a night bomber, but due to last-minute modifications, it was adopted according to the BCR classification."

The MB.210 is a twin-engined low-winged monoplane with a fixed undercarriage. Although the aircraft has established itself as an extremely durable and reliable aircraft, practically not suffering from any serious defects, it is noted by many that its thrust-to-weight ratio is insufficient, and its engines are unreliable by modern standards."

 RUS_iw_small_airframe: "Biplane Airframe"
 RUS_iw_small_airframe_desc: "Biplanes are considered to be stable and manoeuvrable planes with limited speed. Out of various military biplanes produced in Russia, I-15 is the most successful and legendary. I-15 and its modifications are fast and stable, and are designed to operate together with more advanced I-16 as a wingman. While most biplanes start to be outdated in 1936 as aviation innovation is flying, they still form a decent backbone of the Russian Air Fleet."
 RUS_basic_small_airframe: "Monoplane Airframe"
 RUS_basic_small_airframe_desc: "Seen as the future of aircraft, monoplanes revolutionised speed standards of aviation. From the first proper monoplanes, the most noteworthy model is the I-16, which quickly became a legendary plane among pilots for its high-risk, high-reward maneuverability: aces would wield the I-16 as the deadliest weapon, but for an untrained pilot a single mistake could turn the plane into a flying coffin. \n\nWhile the Air Fleet concentrate their efforts on fighters, first proper close air support bombers are developed due to the Army demands - multi-role BB is the first experiment by the Russian Air Force in a plane that seeks to excel in all roles - as fighter, bomber and a scout plane."
 RUS_improved_small_airframe: "High-Speed Airframe"
 RUS_improved_small_airframe_desc: "As war approached, the Air Force opened a programme for high-speed aircraft. The programme cemented Skorost, Sokol and Duks as main producers of fighters, each with its own approach: Skorost tries to combine civilian quality and military standards, Duks design its planes with speed and heavy armament in mind and Sokol presents mass-produced planes.\n\nAt the same time, the army concentrated their demands on armored close air support due to which such legendary armoured assaults planes BSh-2 and BSh-6 were born."
 RUS_advanced_small_airframe: "Full-Metal Airframe"
 RUS_advanced_small_airframe_desc: "Based on frontline experiences against various enemy plane designs, Russian aircraft developers like Skorost and Seversky concentrated their efforts on standardizing, balancing and fixing minuses of existing planes, instead of developing untested new designs. Wooden aircraft became a thing of the past, while weight and every detail was tested and lightened. Each of the new planes is supposed to be not only a better version of the previous one - but a completely different plane in practice, with almost all aspects of it being perfected."
 RUS_modern_small_airframe: "'Reactive Fighter'"
 RUS_modern_small_airframe_desc: "Initial Russian jet planes were pioneered by Skorost, which managed to beat Sokol in their development - mainly due to successful conversion of the I-30 fighter into a jet plane. While both Sokol and Skorost are primary producers of jet aircraft for the Russian Air Fleet, Skorost planes tend to be more reliable due to its slower process of development and borrowing ideas from other companies, while Sokol often brings unexpected breakthroughs with its revolutionary designs."

 RUS_iw_medium_airframe: "Multi-Purpose Airframe"
 RUS_medium_plane_airframe_0_desc: "The early 1930s Russian R-6 scout from TsAGI is a scouting plane with fighter functions, which can serve as a light bomber with its 500 kg payload. Conceptually it is a 'flying cruiser', flying equivalent of multi-purpose combat ship - large and unwieldy, and master at nothing. As more specialised planes entered production, multi-purpose scout planes started to be relegated to the transport role."
 RUS_basic_medium_airframe: "Dedicated Med. Bomber"
 RUS_medium_plane_airframe_1_desc: "As aircraft technologies developed rapidly, it became apparent that specialised planes are needed. The Russian Air Fleet ordered development of 2 specialised bombers in 1934: the SB - TsAGI's combat plane intended for closer ranges - and the OSOAVIA's long-range bomber DB-3. These give Russia the majority of its air support capacity. The role of medium bombers is growing increasingly important, especially in Russia with its vast operational distances."
 RUS_improved_medium_airframe: "STO Development"
 RUS_medium_plane_airframe_2_desc: "The Special Technical Department (STO) was organized for a short period of time by the military command to develop an ideal frontline support plane. The result of this programme became the Gamayun's '100' multi-purpose airframe with the FB-2 frontline bomber and the TIS-3 heavy fighter being offshoots of it. All STO designs received high praise from the military command and pilots, with new OSOAVIA’s DB-3F and Tsagi’s SB-2 being developed as continuation of specialised projects at the same time."
 RUS_advanced_medium_airframe: "Heavy Tactical Bomber"
 RUS_medium_plane_airframe_3_desc: "As the war progressed, medium bombers became more and more destructive, often armed with both rockets and bomb payloads rivaling those of earlier strategic bombers. However, the experience on the field showed that all previous designs lack in some aspects. DBs are inconvenient to use, PBs need to have higher payload and improved defense, FBs need better engines and TISes suffer from a multitude of issues. All these planes have potential to excel, with diligent development."
 RUS_modern_medium_airframe: "'Reactive Bomber'"
 RUS_medium_plane_airframe_4_desc: "Russian 'reactive bombers' is a never-ending competition between Gamayun and TsAGI. Initially losing to Gamayun’s RFB-2, TsAGI managed to return its position as the main developer of Russian tactical bombers with their RFB-4. Both developers have their pluses and minuses, and their aircraft follows pre-jet patterns - TsAGI develop spiritual successors of FB series, while Gamayun continue to use their DB series scheme."

 RUS_iw_large_airframe: "The Flying Cruiser"
 RUS_large_plane_airframe_0_desc: "The early 1930s met quite an obsession for greater 'flying cruisers', which pinnacle is the 8-engine TK bomber with 12,000 kgs (26,500 pounds) payload, produced directly with Savinkov support in 1935. Though, the most numerous 'flying cruiser' plane in the Russian service is the TB-3 bomber - the basis of Russian strategic aviation. While those planes were outdated even by 1936, and generally quite bad, they were the first Russian heavy bombers used en masse."
 RUS_basic_large_airframe: "Long-Range Airframe"
 RUS_large_plane_airframe_1_desc: "Development of long-range bombers led to the appearance of the TB-7 bomber which is a replacement for outdated flying cruisers. It is the first truly modern strategic bomber in Russian service, with quite a big payload and high range of operation."
 RUS_improved_large_airframe: "Improved TB Series"
 RUS_large_plane_airframe_2_desc: "As strategic bombers are complex to produce, merely having high bomb payload is not enough. They need to be sufficiently armed to defend themselves against much cheaper fighters. To this end, TB-8 series were developed as an attempt to fix the main problems of the earlier TB-7 series. The plane received redesigned nose and tail together with modern engines. While being a worse strategic bomber than suggested by Sikorsky DVB, it is much simpler in production and thus received approval from the military command."
 RUS_advanced_large_airframe: "DVB Series"
 RUS_large_plane_airframe_3_desc: "The late war showed that standard heavy bombers are not up to their primary task of destroying enemy production facilities due to their limited range and ease of being shot down. The DVB series became the results of this revelation: there is no attempt to indulge in accurate targeting against 'military targets.' These planes are designed to be long-range high-altitude bombers, with a small fleet being able to destroy a city in one go."
 RUS_modern_large_airframe: "RTB Series"
 RUS_large_plane_airframe_4_desc: "TsAGI became the only Russian aviation developer specialised in strategic bombers, especially after Sikorsky moved to specialise in helicopters. TsAGI's RTB series is 3-engine aircraft with good flight characteristics and payload intended for continent-wide operations, but lacking range to perform effective intercontinental bombing runs. Despite this, RTB series flight characteristics are unbeatable in its class and the plane has a great room for further modernization."

 SCA_fighter_equipment_0: "Svenska Aero J 6 Jaktfalken"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_0_short: "J 6 Jaktfalken"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "An old interwar biplane fighter built by Svenska Aero first in the '20s, and then by AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning, used in all Scandinavia. Despite its efficiency for patrol and reconnaissance missions, it has had its day in our air force and will be not suitable for the requirements of the modern air warfare."
 SCA_fighter_equipment_1: "Serversky EP-106 J 9"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 9"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "An American built fighter, made by the Serverski company. The US air military chose its competitor, the P-36, from the Curtiss company, but it's reliable and perfectly fills our needs for our missions above Scandinavia. After some negotiations, Seversky sold us the manufacturing rights and the plans, allowing us to produce it."
 SCA_fighter_equipment_2: "FFVS J 22"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 22"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J 22, designed by Kungliga Flygförvaltningens Flygverkstad i Stockholm, is our first locally designed monoplane fighter. Appreciated by our pilots for its maniablity, it is also easy to maintain. It should allow us to defend Scandinavia efficiently from any threats."
 SCA_fighter_equipment_3: "FFVS J 27"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 27"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The air warfare has evolved during the second Weltkrieg, and because of the intensive aerial fights above the Baltic, a lot of foreign planes could not find their way back to their home bases or just crashed on our shores. After there capture (or their recovery for the unluckiest ones), our technical units studied a lot these fighters of a new kind. Because the J 21 didn't met the needed requirements to be an efficient fighter, those studies resulted into the J 27, a modern fighter inspired from German and American designs, but mostly from the British Supermarine 'Spitfire'. A powerful engine, a high maniability, a contra-rotating propeller, powerful armament... our 'Norden Super Spitfire' will be a nightmare for the countries which dare to invade us!"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Kjeller-SAAB J 21R"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 21R"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After years of R&D, we've finally managed to build a jet fighter. The piston engine fighter J 21, which wasn't very efficient as a fighter, that's a fact. But it's a reliable and strong platform. Repowered with a jet engine and armed with 20 mm guns, the J 21R is entirely capable of defending our skies against the air invaders of the next years. No more propellers, time is for jets now."

 SCA_small_plane_airframe_5_short: "Kjeller-SAAB 29"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the good result obtained with the J 21R, time is now to build a new jet fighter, with a new cell and not rebuilt from an old aircraft. The J 29 is the climax of our air industry: it has an advanced radar, bigger fuel tanks, air to air missiles and high speed. If we continue to build planes like the 'Tunnan', the skies of Scandinavia are guaranteed for the future."

 SCA_CAS_equipment_1_short: "KZ IIA"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Within months of its founding, SAI, Skandinavisk Aero Industri, founded by two found technically proficient aircraft enthusiasts, produced two different sport planes. Their second model drew interest from the Danish military, which eventually contracted for the production of a ground attack variant on the craft."
 SCA_CAS_equipment_2: "SAAB B 17"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_2_short: "B 17"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "After studying the latest attacker aircraft designs of the other powers in Europe, we have successfully managed to create a local aircraft capable to conduct efficiently air-to-ground support missions. The B 17, designed by SAAB, is well powered, capable of use a lot of bombs and can perform dive bombing. Its landing gears are also modular, which allows us to install skis and floats."
 SCA_CAS_equipment_3: "Kjeller-SAAB A 21"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_3_short: "A 21"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "The Saab A-21 was first a fighter named J 21, but because it shown an inadequate performance for its fighter role. Despite this, the Saab design bureau realised its cell would be an excellent platform for an attacker. Its unique push-pull configuration, its powerful engine and the choice of loadout make it a powerful CAS."

This acts as a the foundation for future Swedish naval bombers development."

 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "SAAB J 19"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 19"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Our J6 and J 9 fighters are very limited for long range operations. In case of a war, they couldn't be able to escort our bombers or intercept those of the enemy at long range and high altitude. We were forced to study a new design of plane, which resulted in the J 19. Equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks and 20 mm canons, it will be able to catch the enemy, even at a far distance."
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "SAAB J 23"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 23"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of the J 19, we had to improve its design and capabilities. The J 23 is inspired by our neighbours designs and allow our air force to be more efficient. Still no radar, but no more additional fuel tanks. It's definitively a good solution to protect our neutrality from the exterior and keep an eye above the Baltic sea."
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "SAAB J 24"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 24"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Heavier, bigger and stronger, the Saab J 24 is a last gen interceptor. Two powerful engines, a heavy armament, a pressurised cockpit, an advanced radar and a big fuel tank allow it to conduct air interceptions even in the worst flight conditions, wherever the enemy is. It's the best plane of its kind we've ever built."

 SLV_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 SLV_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 SLV_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 SLV_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 SLV_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 SLV_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 SLV_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."

 SLO_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 SLO_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 SLO_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 SLO_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

 SLO_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

 SLO_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

 SWE_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J 22, designed by Kungliga Flygförvaltningens Flygverkstad i Stockholm, is our first locally designed monoplane fighter. Appreciated by our pilots for its maniablity, it is also easy to maintain. It should allow us to defend Sweden efficiently from any threats."
 SWE_fighter_equipment_3: "FFVS J 27"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 27"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The air warfare has evolved during the second Weltkrieg, and because of the intensive aerial fights above the Baltic, a lot of foreign planes could not find their way back to their home bases or just crashed on our shores. After there capture (or their recovery for the unluckiest ones), our technical units studied a lot these fighters of a new kind. Because the J 21 didn't met the needed requirements to be an efficient fighter, those studies resulted into the J 27, a modern fighter inspired from German and American designs, but mostly from the British Supermarine 'Spitfire'. A powerful engine, a high maniability, a contra-rotating propeller, powerful armament... our 'Svensk Super Spitfire' will be a nightmare for the countries which dare to invade us!"

 TRS_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 TRS_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 TRS_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 TRS_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 TRS_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 TRS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 TRS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 TRS_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 TRS_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 TRS_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."

 TRS_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 TRS_small_plane_airframe_5_short: "L.52"
 TRS_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.442"
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
 TRS_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 TRS_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 TRS_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 TRS_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 TRS_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 TRS_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
