While pragmatism has its benefits, the long run the party's leadership must increase its §cRevolutionary Zeal§! lest the party falls back into petty factionalism.\n\n§cRevolutionary Zeal§! can be abstractly thought of as being stored in a common bank account across China. Regional actors may choose to §Rwithdraw§! or §Gdeposit§! this nationalist energy, and in response the central government can choose to §Gmake up the shortfall§! or §Rembezzle the surplus§!.

As we are now able to step back from the propaganda and military stage of the revolution, in accordance with the principles of our great eternal premier - we must now enter the political and economic reconstruction stage of the National Revolution.

The region boasts both the Hanyang Arsenal and the now deprecated Hanyang Iron Works which once accounted for nearly 90% of the steel output in all of China. There is also a revolutionary nature to the Hanyang industries as well as it was a Hanyang Rifle that fired the first shot which ignited the Xinhai Revolution."

 KMT_revive_gansu_machine_works: "Revive Gansu Machine Works"
 KMT_revive_gansu_machine_works_desc: "Formerly known as the Gansu Machine Manufacturing Bureau, the bureau founded in 1872, was the first Westernised military industry in the Chinese Northwest. As the situation in the west eventually deteriorated to the point of instability, the machine works were left neglected and much of its machinery stripped away by the western warlords. The National Government seeks to revive the machine works in order to foster employment and modernise the Northwest."

 KMT_qinghai_cultivation_programme: "Initiate the Qinghai Cultivation Programme"
 KMT_qinghai_cultivation_programme_desc: "Long isolated from the revolutionary sentiments of Fujian and Guangzhou, the Kuomintang's presence in Qinghai is minimal. As we extend our influence and power into the western regions of China, the Ministry of Interior has pushed for a cultivation programme to develop the agriculture practices of Qinghai. This plan hopes to introduce modern agricultural techniques and modern fertilisers while also integrating Kuomintang party structures and organs into the local governments of Qinghai"

 KMT_jinghui_irrigation_canal: "Construct the Jinghui Irrigation Canal"
 KMT_jinghui_irrigation_canal_desc: "The region of Shaanxi is notorious for being dry and susceptible to droughts, frequently causing mayhem in the lives of its people. The hydraulic engineer and Shaanxi native Li Yizhi holds sympathies for the Nationalist Government (in particular, its Hawaii Clique) and has petitioned the Conservancy Department to launch a programme of water conservation. After surveying the region numerous times, he proposed the construction of an irrigation canal and dam to manage and conserve water to improve the livelihoods of those who live in Shaanxi."

 KMT_minsheng_irrigation_canal: "Build the Minsheng Irrigation Canal"
 KMT_minsheng_irrigation_canal_desc: "As the late Dr. Sun wrote, Minsheng is the principle of enhancing the livelihoods of the Chinese, and as such, the National Reconstruction Commission is eager to begin its latest project in the northern Suiyuan province. These regions do not hold much sympathy for our cause. Therefore, the Water Resource Department has proposed funding to begin the construction of a 75 kilometre-long canal to irrigate the farms of the dry Suiyuan region. In honour of the Three Principles of the People, the canal will be named \"Minsheng\", showcasing our determination to help the people of China."

 KMT_complete_the_longhai_railway: "Complete the Longhai Railway"
 KMT_complete_the_longhai_railway_desc: "The mountainous passes of Shaanxi makes transportation often difficult and long for those who need to venture across the province. During the Qing Dynasty, construction began on a railway to stretch from Luoyang to the western province of Gansu. Due to the instability of the warlords, progress on the railway has often stalled. As such, the Nationalist Government's Ministry of Railways has commissioned a new project to finally complete the railway. The railway's end goal is to stretch more than 1700 kilometres and will be led by the railway engineer Ling Hongxun."

 KMT_create_the_lanxin_railway_desc: "In order to improve communications, supply, and overall travel distance between Lanzhou in Gansu and the farthest frontier of Xinjiang, the Nationalist Government's Ministry of Railways has officially approved a new construction project to construct the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway linking Gansu to the Hexi Corridor and all the way to Dihua - a project that plans to run over 1904 km. A second line will also seek to connect Hami to Hotan thus improving communications in the far most western regions of China."

 KMT_appropriate_shenyang_arsenal: "Appropriate the Shenyang Arsenal"
 KMT_appropriate_shenyang_arsenal_desc: "The Shenyang Arsenal has long been renowned throughout China for its quality craftsmanship. It was established in 1921 by the Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin and produced guns, cannons, bullets, shells, explosives, and machinery. At one point, it became the largest arsenal in all of China and was frequently visited by advisors and officers of the Japanese Army. With the Nationalist hold over the Northeast finally secured, the Ministry of Military Affairs has decided to appropriate the Shenyang Arsenal for the purposes of equipping the National Revolutionary Army."

 KMT_finish_fengman_hydroelectric_dam: "Finish the Fengman Hydroelecteric Dam"
 KMT_finish_fengman_hydroelectric_dam_desc: "During the rule of the Fengtian Clique, their Communications Clique began the construction of a hydroelectric dam to generate power for the city of Jilin with the help of the Japanese advisors. With our glorious victory over the Fengtian Clique and the restoration of Manchuria to the Chinese people, we now have an unfinished hydroelectric dam that could surely benefit the people of Jilin. As such the Ministry of Interior has commissioned a project to increase employment and to finish construction of the Fengman Dam."

 KMT_nationalising_manchurian_iron_industry: "Nationalise Manchuria's Iron Industry"
 KMT_nationalising_manchurian_iron_industry_desc: "The Anshan Iron Mines and Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company were once jointly owned by the Fengtian Clique and the Japanese, a terrible reminder of Japan's pervasive influence via Mantetsu into our lands. Due to the prevalence of coal in the region, the company supplied Japan with cheap steel at the expense of exploiting Chinese labour. Throughout their occupation, the Chinese miners of the company were treated brutally and now, we have the opportunity to free them. With our hold of the Northeast firmly secured, we now have the opportunity to fully nationalise and own the iron mines and the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company so that their resources will benefit the Chinese people solely."

Although they may wear the White Sun, they are hardly faithful comrades or worthy successors to Dr. Sun. Thus, we shall cast them down from their high pulpit, and save not only our party but our entire nation in the process."

 RKT_revising_the_three_principles_decision_desc: "Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, while certainly insightful, leave plenty of room for further interpretation - far more than what the party orthodoxy would have us believe.

 RKT_implementing_the_three_principles_decision_desc: "Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People are tantamount to sacred in the Kuomintang sphere.

And yet, despite promises of allowing [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration a free hand in implementing political tutelage over their province, the central government continues to send spies and magistrates to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to undermine our rule and syphon resources for their revolution.

Revolutions are built on love and sacrifice, and just as the brave soldiers and martyrs continue to lay down their lives for the national cause, provinces must also give up their treasure, energies, and resources for the well-being of the nation.

Perhaps Dr. Sun's message truly resonates with the people, giving them hope amidst China's turmoil. Or perhaps his message is easily construed to mean anything the listener wants to hear. Whatever the case may be, clothing our rule with Kuomintang trappings helps to soften the edges. While the Eternal Premier casts a long shadow over most, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s star shines every brighter standing next to him.

 RKT_exhort_national_unity_decision_desc: "The Kuomintang has endured great trials over the decades because no matter how many guns its opponents have or how much gold outside powers funnel in to oppose them, their liberating words truly won the hearts of the people. Still, amid warlordism and disunity, there are always those who would prefer to pursue selfish interests over the needs of the nation. We must enforce the rule of the party-state against reactionaries, quelling internal dissent. It is only in this way that we can rouse the nation against its foes."

 RKT_secure_overseas_donations_decision_desc: "After the doomed Northern Expedition, hundreds of Kuomintang members have gone into exile, setting up bases across Asia and beyond. Whilst an unfortunate result of our previous failures, our overseas comrades maintained their wealth and connections. Even in Dr. Sun's time he would draw support from overseas Chinese communities. Now that the Kuomintang has once again secured a foothold on the mainland, let us recall our comrades to assist in rebuilding China's industrial might."

 RKT_encourage_intellectuals_decision: "Encourage Intellectuals"
 RKT_encourage_intellectuals_decision_desc: "Our revolution can not be won by soldiers and bullets alone, but by the advancements of our research committees. Without their progress we will quickly fall behind our rivals seeking to control China, and so it is more important than ever to make sure we are on the cutting edge of war technology.

 RKT_foster_regionalist_tendencies_decision_desc: "Whether we want to admit it or not, it is a fact that the Kuomintang is now scattered across China, relying heavily on local governors with delusions of grandeur. Though an unfortunate reality, for the time being we may be able to convert this regionalism into a temporary benefit. By encouraging these regionalist tendencies and temporarily assuring local officers that they will keep their positions, we will be able to win loyalty among them."

All will become beholden to the onslaught of terror."

Aimless without guidance from proper authority, they turn to loitering, banditry, or are forced into lives of perennial destitution and servitude. Of course those lucky few, the intellectuals, the sons and daughters of bureaucrats, they can escape. But for those left behind, the party and the army can instil within them new purpose: bearing the torch of their future."

 GXC_coax_the_reluctant_decision_desc: "The Petite Bourgeoisie have always had an uneasy relationship with the revolution. Indeed they often are the most stubborn adversaries of socialism, yet much of the socialist leadership are drawn from this very class. Making some amends is necessary, and it's always good to have skilled and intellectual labour on our side."

 GXC_court_peasant_activists_decision_desc: "The Farmer's Association have begun to entrench their grip over the countryside, a huge boon as long as we can keep them loyal.

With many Cantonese men having served in various Guangdong-based formations over the years, we have a steady pool of soldiers to draw from both for direct service and in auxiliary capacities. Keeping this army supplied is vital for further victories."

 YUN_appease_the_radicals_desc: "Besieged on both the Left and the Right by our fellow party members that clamour for a more \"revolutionary\" form of governance, the tightrope of the Third Army is that of a narrow one. With our own requisite leftist influences rallying for the immediate alleviating of the peasant and worker's ills and wants alongside the remnant Whampoa Cliques insisting upon their own superiority in leading the National Revolution, the government has become rather strained. To prevent a civil war let us approach our fellows of the Party to achieve common ground, for the sake of our shared nationalism."

 YUN_embrace_sanminism: "Embrace Sanminism"
 YUN_embrace_sanminism_desc: "For the vigorous and devoted the Three Principles of the People are but the very tenets by which our revolutionary struggle is fought and bled for. However all across the nation the ideology as laid out by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and interpreted by his loyal followers has undergone a campaign of besmirchment. Whilst true that the party of the previous decade failed to achieve its grand ambitions, the party of the current decade marches forward without such uncertainty. Pure in ideology and pure in mindset, the people must understand what the Party fights for."

 YUN_publicise_landlord_transgressions_desc: "For too long the various petty \"lords\" of the Chinese countryside, be it the gentry themselves or merely landlords, have ruled in a nigh unimpeachable fashion. The labourers till their fields under practical serfdom, and the Party laments. If we are to be the salvation of the proletariat and the downtrodden, we must bring forward a campaign of righteousness against those who mistreat and abuse their positions within the nation."

 YUN_hold_mass_rallies_desc: "All across the Chinese nation the numerous peasant communities and organisations continue to be exploited by their masters. In a similar vein much of the Petite Bourgeoisie of the urban centres, those that form much of the backbone of China's intellectual socialism, remain estranged with the concept of the National Revolution. To celebrate the heralding of a new era of political, economic, and social change we must engage in a mass proliferation of the message of the Party. For the warlords, imperialists, gentry and evil bullies hold no sway over you any longer!"

 YUN_rally_the_whampoa_cliques_desc: "Despite the animosity between the moderates of the Third Army and the Whampoa Cliques descended from the First Army, our shared revolutionary brotherhood remains. Championing the cause of National Revolution like no other, the cliques of Whampoa where born in the cradle of the revolution, and their devotion is absolute. Ever ambitious and conniving, they are nonetheless divided amongst themselves. Let us ring the bell of the National Revolution and bring forth unity between the disparate NRA cliques."

 YUN_invigorate_the_youth_leagues: "Invigorate the Youth Leagues"
 YUN_invigorate_the_youth_leagues_desc: "An ever abounding whirlwind of radicalism and revolution within the Chinese nation, its youth is all but ultimately neglected by the majority of the governmental bodies within China. Aimless without guidance or direction they either develop to live a life of complacency and surrender, or even turn to banditry. of course there remains those of influential families, those are blessed by birth to escape the fate of so many of their fellows. But for those left behind, there all but remains one salvation: the Party's youth leagues."

 YUN_promoting_reformist_continuity: "Promoting Reformist Continuity"
 YUN_promoting_reformist_continuity_desc: "It is not merely the revolutionary parties such as that of the Kuomintang or the Chinese Syndicalist Party that desire modernisation of the nation. There is always the often forgotten yet wise and cautious hand of the stable moderniser, a force that is ever present. For Yunnan province has always been a province born out of the desire for a new nation, a modern nation, a nation built on the virtues and values of Republican government. Let us remind the populace that the stalwarts of reform lie in the successors of Double Ninth's heroes."

 YUN_cultivate_business_ties: "Cultivate Business Ties"
 YUN_cultivate_business_ties_desc: "Relying upon idealism is all well and good, but true military might and goals can only be extracted through materiel backing. Without economic production and burgeoning factories our soldiers on the battlefields would lack rifles, bullets and shells necessary to achieve unification. Let us parley with China's arms producers and magnates to extract from them a favourable settlement, no matter the cost."

 YUN_harkening_back_to_our_legacy: "Harkening Back to Our Legacy"
 YUN_harkening_back_to_our_legacy_desc: "For too long the Kuomintang has been steered onto the path of fervent, bloodthirsty, and rabid extremist ideology. Isolating itself in its failures from the 1920s, the Party has trampled over the sacrifices of the heroes of previous revolutions merely to institute their own reign of unadulterated terror upon the populace.We must work to remind not just the Party but the populace itself that the Kuomintang was born from democratic participation in a democratic revolution, lest China succumb to tyranny paved with good intentions."

 YUN_rallying_the_veterans_of_revolution: "Summoning the Veterans of Revolution"
 YUN_rallying_the_veterans_of_revolution_desc: "\"Trust is earned by many deeds, and lost by only one\".\nThe party may long deride the influence of Political Science in the day-to-day affairs but none can besmirch the dedication to upholding the true ideals of the Xinhai revolution that the clique embodies. Staffed by veterans of the perennial struggle against warlords and despots alike, the Political Science Clique persisted in China's political scene whilst the mainstream Party rotted in functional exile. Let us signal the rightful return of the true idealists of the Kuomintang, those that have not been led astray by authoritarianism."

 LKT_promote_rca_chapters_decision: "Promote RCA Chapters"
 LKT_promote_rca_chapters_decision_desc: "The Reorganised Comrades Association of the Kuomintang is a secret society initially founded by the party's government-in-exile dedicated to ensuring revolutionary discipline, the careful study of the Three Principles, and above all faithfully supporting Wang Jingwei's leadership over the party. While there are plenty of disagreements within the RCA at higher levels, locally their chapters are known for their tight-knit socialist cells and stubborn loyalty to the Chairman. By encouraging them to build ties to [ROOT.GetAdjective] bureaucracy and party cadres, we aid them in their quest to forestall any challenge to Wang's rule."

 LKT_assist_pac_opposition_decision: "Assist the PAC Opposition"
 LKT_assist_pac_opposition_decision_desc: "The Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang was founded during the early days of the MinGan insurgency, an effort to establish an autonomous leadership structure from the distant government-in-exile. Allied with various civilian opposition groups and the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association, the PAC have thrown their weight behind supporting Song Qingling's (widow of Party founder Sun Yat-sen) bid for party leadership. This unlikely alliance has sought our support to prevent a Wang Jingwei dictatorship, but how long it could possibly last should they win is another question."

 LKT_embrace_crs_fanaticism_decision: "Embrace CRS Fanaticism"
 LKT_embrace_crs_fanaticism_decision_desc: "The Chinese Reconstruction Society is a secretive cabal of ultranationalist, totalitarian military officers that have coalesced around General Hu Zongnan's leadership. Incorporating various fraternal circles built from the camaraderie of Whampoa military academy, the CRS is the most visible manifestation of the revolutionary fervour bred by the Kuomintang's military arm. Embracing this spirit into our local forces will have consequences of course, but it may mean the difference between the life and death of the revolution."

 LKT_tolerate_lcs_agitation_decision: "Tolerate LCS Agitation"
 LKT_tolerate_lcs_agitation_decision_desc: "The League of Chinese Syndicalists was founded by non-Kuomintang socialists in hopes of establishing a leftwing counterweight to the party-state. Spearheaded by the Chinese Syndicalist Party, with the reluctant assistance of the anarchist (New) World Society and various independents, the League is an unstable entity that is prone to infighting between its constituent elements. Nevertheless, given the global dominance of syndicalism (or at least syndicalist imitators) among socialist circles, the LCS has played a major role in mobilising support among the common people for the revolution's cause. Allowing them to make a home in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will diminish our support from local power holders, but will buoy hopes in [CHI.CapitalGetCapitalVictoryPointName] and elsewhere that a new, militant day is rising."

 LKT_engage_rcf_dialogue_decision: "Engage with RCF Dialogue"
 LKT_engage_rcf_dialogue_decision_desc: "The Reconstruction Faction was founded in Hawaii by Sun Fo and his remaining supporters in exile. Drawing support from Sun's late father's old support networks in diaspora communities in South East Asia, they have leveraged their financial resources to try and instil their western-inspired liberal values into the movement. Their tendency to court party outsiders and liberal dissidents to the local status quo tends to alienate socialists and warlords alike, but may promote a more positive image for the party on a national and international level."

 KMT_invite_into_economic_sphere_desc: "The destiny of the Chinese National Revolution is that China, as a country imbued with great nationalist feelings is in a better position than any other nation in the East to fight against imperialism.

#Zeal Events
 RKT.zealmechanic.001.t: "Three Principles Revised in [FROM.GetNameDef]!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.001.d: "Dr Sun Yat-sen's writings on national reconstruction, particularly his lectures on the Three Principles of the People and the Three Stages of Revolution, have always occupied a centre spot in Kuomintang ideology. Tantamount to sacred scripture for the party faithful, deviations from this orthodoxy have always been met with great suspicion and deliberate attempts to pervert it for personal gain with deep scorn.\n\nAnd yet, it seems that officials in [FROM.GetNameDef] have begun to do just that, distorting the words of the Eternal Premier in the name of \"harmonising\" them with existing [FROM.GetAdjective] policies. When confronted with this fact [FROM.GetLeader] insists that it is a practical necessity and that the [FROM.GetAdjective] political tradition requires some degree of revision of the Three Principles to absorb it.\n\nThese appeals to the greater good however seem to belie a lack of faith in the Kuomintang vision, and perhaps a broader disloyalty to [ROOT.GetLeader]. Still, what is done is done, and revising the errors of the provincial administration will not come cheap. But sometimes a dire price must be paid to keep the late party founder's vision pure."
 RKT.zealmechanic.001.a: "We must enforce party orthodoxy!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.001.b: "A little flexibility does us no harm..."

 RKT.zealmechanic.002.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Fidelity to the Three Principles"
 RKT.zealmechanic.002.d: "Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People have always proven insightful, cutting deep into the heart of the challenges China faces. Its words carry a certain weight even in places the authority of the central government fails to penetrate. Despite their distance from [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the authorities in [FROM.GetNameDef] have worked diligently to bridge this gap by \"party-ifying\" their administration.\n\nTheir recent obedience to central committee directives and elimination of competing ideas to the party's doctrine has pleased [ROOT.GetLeader] and his staff, a sign of growing [FROM.GetAdjective] submission to our rule. It would be unwise to read too much into these moves, and indeed they remain stubbornly autonomous in administration.\n\nStill, deciding how to best exploit this trend remains in the air. While [FROM.GetLeader]'s intention likely was to improve party morale, we could also use this as a chance to bring him closer to our fold."
 RKT.zealmechanic.002.a: "An opportunity to bring them into the fold."
 RKT.zealmechanic.002.b: "An example for all faithful to behold!"

 RKT.zealmechanic.003.t: "Regional Insubordination in [FROM.GetNameDef]!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.003.d: "The supposed submission of [FROM.GetLeader] to our central government has not stopped them from insisting on their local prerogatives. While we have agreed to allow them some discretion in implementing political tutelage over their province, implicit in this arrangement is that [ROOT.GetAdjective] magistrates  would have the right to oversight over local affairs.\n\nNevertheless our efforts to exert our rightful authority has been met with nothing but sabotage and mistrust by [FROM.GetAdjective] officials, and it is increasingly apparent that this is a deliberate move by [FROM.GetLeader] to stonewall our progress in uniting [FROM.GetNameDef] to our rule.\n\nSuch insolence would be intolerable in any other country, however in this time of crisis the choice is not so easy. Enforcing our rule will destabilise our political arrangement in a time when unity is rare. However, such disloyalty begets further disloyalty, and allowing such provincialism raises questions about our ability to control the warlords."
 RKT.zealmechanic.003.a: "We must bring them to heel."
 RKT.zealmechanic.003.b: "All will submit in the end."

 RKT.zealmechanic.004.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Support for the National Cause!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.004.d: "Allegiance to our national cause comes with certain moral responsibilities. Revolutions are built on love and sacrifice, and just as the brave soldiers and martyrs continue to lay down their lives for the national cause, provinces must also give up their treasure, energies, and resources for the well-being of the nation.\n\nIt seems that [FROM.GetLeader] has understood this lesson well, as evident by the increase (albeit probably temporary) in the flow of tribute from [FROM.GetNameDef] in support of the central government. A rare case of warlord era altruism, this faith in our leadership is a welcome development.\n\nThat said, trust given is trust expected to be returned. But the unfortunate reality is that leaders must be willing to make hard decisions. We could use this inflow in resources to buttress our own position, stabilising our rule even if at the expense of the broader revolution. Alternatively, this increase in revenue can be used to support all fronts of the cause, increasing enthusiasm for the Kuomintang national programme."
 RKT.zealmechanic.004.a: "The reality is [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] comes first."
 RKT.zealmechanic.004.b: "Their heroism helps all patriots."

 RKT.zealmechanic.005.t: "Stolen Party Legitimacy in [FROM.GetNameDef]!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.005.d: "The Kuomintang's popularity has proven resilient over the years, surviving despite multiple resounding defeats. This is because Dr. Sun's message truly resonates with the people, giving them hope amidst China's turmoil. But unfortunately, to many warlords his truth is something that can be easily distorted to mean anything that serves their interests - a deliberate and cruel corruption of what should be a liberating rallying cry.\n\nWhile all warlords do this to some extent, [FROM.GetLeader] and his coterie have been particularly distasteful as of late, clothing his rule with Kuomintang trappings and asserting himself as an equal to our party's inheritance.\n\nThis cynical theft of Kuomintang legitimacy has left a bitter taste in many idealists' mouths, and drawn broader criticism of the revolution as a whole. Reassuring them of our own fidelity and bringing [FROM.GetLeader] to heel will not be easy, but it may be necessary to avoid a broader slump in enthusiasm."
 RKT.zealmechanic.005.a: "We must assure the people we are better than them."
 RKT.zealmechanic.005.b: "The people will see through their charade on their own."

 RKT.zealmechanic.006.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Patriots Rally!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.006.d: "The Kuomintang has endured great trials over the decades because no matter how many guns its opponents have or how much gold outside powers funnel in to oppose them, their liberating words truly won the hearts of the people.\n\nStill, amid warlordism and disunity, there are always those who would prefer to pursue selfish interests over the needs of the nation. So it is rare to see local administrations put our needs above theirs, enforcing the rule of the party-state against reactionaries and quelling internal dissent by those who would prefer the corruption of the old order.\n\nThis act has won considerable commendation towards [FROM.GetLeader] and has allowed us to rouse many to the fight. But now comes the question of where to steer this militant outburst - towards enemies within or enemies without."
 RKT.zealmechanic.006.a: "The warlord and reactionary quake in our sight!"
 RKT.zealmechanic.006.b: "The foreign imperialists shall fear our wrath!"

 KMT_white_sun_desc: "Though the process has been arduous, we have finally consolidated our rule across the nation and can begin the official formation of a new republic under the White Sun. We must now lay the groundwork for the next stage in our revolution, integrating all provinces in China to the organs of our government."

 KMT_tridemism: "Sanmin Doctrine"
 KMT_tridemism_desc: "The Three Principles of the People, or Sanmin Doctrine, is the basis of Sun Yat-sen's political philosophy and the Kuomintang. The Principles guide our government in its policies and decisions, and their importance must be understood by the people in the coming fight."

 KMT_organic_law: "Organic Law of the Republic"
 KMT_organic_law_desc: "While Political Tutelage continues and the final Constitution is drafted, the Organic Law of the National Government has been promulgated. This act reorganised the National Government into five branches, or Yuan, and reinforced the Kuomintang's exercise of sovereign power for the duration of Political Tutelage."

 KMT_minzu_focus: "Minzu"
 KMT_minzu_focus_desc: "Minzu, or Nationalism, is one of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and revolves around a common livelihood, language, religion, customs, and most importantly, a shared bloodline. National unity is paramount to our success, and shall allow China to succeed against other nations in the struggle for supremacy."

 KMT_minquan_focus: "Minquan"
 KMT_minquan_focus_desc: "Minquan, or Democracy, is the second of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Creating democratic institutions and preparing the Chinese people for them is one of the most important objectives of the National Revolution and will, in the long-run, prove that the Party is the best choice for China."

 KMT_legislature: "Legislative Yuan"
 KMT_legislature_desc: "While China is not anywhere ready for full elections, the Nationalist Government needs to begin forming the institutions that democracy will, one day, make its will known through. The Legislative Yuan, staffed by KMT representatives from both controlled and contested territories, will take over legislative responsibilities from the Central Committee."

 KMT_land_reform: "Nationalist Land Reform"
 KMT_land_reform_desc: "Peasants form the absolute majority of the Chinese population yet few of them own the land they work, killing any chance of socio-economic advancement. Land reform is a necessity to improve their livelihoods and reduce social tensions. Until the peasants of China own the land instead of leasing it from corrupt landlords, they will never be free."

 KMT_rent_control: "Land Value Tax"
 KMT_rent_control_desc: "Sun Yat-sen pushed for a Land Value Tax to be adopted in order to improve the country's finances, help push for land reform, and create a fairer taxation and economic system. We must implement his vision to help modernise the country and improve the economy."

 KMT_minsheng: "Minsheng"
 KMT_minsheng_desc: "Minsheng, commonly translated as 'The People's Welfare', is the last of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Following the implementation of a land value tax, social programmes will be created and expanded in order to help peasants and workers improve their quality of life by subsidising food consumption, clothing and housing costs."

 KMT_revive_china: "Revive China Programme"
 KMT_revive_china_desc: "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast programme of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West and alleviate the damaged economy."

 KMT_national_mausoleum: "Build the National Mausoleum"
 KMT_national_mausoleum_desc: "It is long past due to honour those who have fallen in service of Chinese Democracy. A national mausoleum will be constructed outside of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to house the remains of Sun Yat-Sen and other prominent revolutionaries."

 KMT_civil_service: "Expand the Civil Service"
 KMT_civil_service_desc: "To endure in the long run, the Nationalist Government must be more than a warlord clique or a party-state. A civil service that is independent of both the Kuomintang party apparatus and the army must begin formation."

 KMT_academia_sinica: "Academia Sinica"
 KMT_academia_sinica_desc: "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academia Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."

 KMT_national_reconstruction_commission: "National Reconstruction Commission"
 KMT_national_reconstruction_commission_desc: "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide programme of capital investments and standardisations. This programme will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population centres."

 KMT_bopomofo: "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
 KMT_bopomofo_desc: "The current methods for romanising Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardise the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."

 KMT_triumphant_revolution: "Triumphant Revolution"
 KMT_triumphant_revolution_desc: "China has finally been reunited under the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth of the Kuomintang. While there is still a long way to go before we recover from the Century of Humiliation, we have fulfilled the dream of the late Dr. Sun."

 KMT_renovate_whampoa: "Expand the Whampoa Military Academy"
 KMT_renovate_whampoa_desc: "The Kuomintang Military Academy was first founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Whampoa near Guangzhou and created a cadre of politically-conscious officers from those who trained there. While simply restoring it was sufficient previously, the transformation of the NRA into a truly national army requires Whampoa to be expanded in order to fill the need for politically reliable and capable officers."

 KMT_central_military_academy: "Establish the Central Military Academy"
 KMT_central_military_academy_desc: "With the revolution's hold over China secure, there is no longer any need for the Whampoa Military Academy to remain in Guangzhou. The distinguished military school will be moved to our national capital to create a centralised military academy. This will help our central command structure and encourage recruits from all across the country to learn from the best officers China has to offer."

 KMT_standardised_arsenals: "Standardise Arsenals"
 KMT_standardised_arsenals_desc: "For several decades, the arsenals of China have been under the control of different and largely independent provincial and national governments. Now that a number of those arsenals are under our control, the logistical issues stemming from different arsenals producing different arms in different calibre for a single army are substantial and should be rectified as soon as possible."

 KMT_small_arms_development: "Small Arms Development"
 KMT_small_arms_development_desc: "Despite attempts by the numerous national and provincial governments to upgrade, the most widespread rifle in service remains the venerable, yet severely obsolete, Model 88. Making the standardisation on a new, modern rifle a reality rather than a project on paper is a top priority in order to improve our lacklustre military capabilities compared to other modern militaries."

 KMT_artillery_modernisation: "Artillery Modernisation"
 KMT_artillery_modernisation_desc: "Artillery is the king of the battlefield and modern pieces were a luxury in the warlord era. With the capabilities of a united China, we can modernise our guns and bring our firepower closer to the global standard."

 KMT_tank_arsenal: "Armoured Warfare"
 KMT_tank_arsenal_desc: "The development of armoured warfare has certainly been noticed in China, but to develop and use them here was but a pipe dream. Now that we are united and stronger than ever, now is the time to delve into these advanced technologies as an important stepping stone in China's modernisation."

 KMT_new_model_army: "New Model Army"
 KMT_new_model_army_desc: "A professional volunteer army will be the future of the Chinese army: a smaller army devoted to the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution, focusing on quality over quantity. This will create a greater Esprit de Corps and discipline, creating better soldiers that can perform difficult tasks and follow difficult orders."

 KMT_professionalisation: "Instil Army Discipline"
 KMT_professionalisation_desc: "The new Chinese army will be a professional one, focusing on military training full-time, encouraging high levels of discipline and skill. The example of the Iron Army will become a model for modern professional armies comparable to any Western power."

 KMT_peoples_army: "The People's Army"
 KMT_peoples_army_desc: "The Chinese Army should take advantage of its manpower and size to fight wars. It should be a People's Army: One that represents the people and protects it. A pillar of national unification, not one of oppression or repression."

 KMT_conscription: "Unity Through Service"
 KMT_conscription_desc: "Widespread military service brings people from many regions together, giving them shared experiences and helping them see one another as brethren; concrete and true examples of brotherhood instead of vague concepts of nationhood. National unity will be strengthened by it."

 KMT_NRA: "The NRA Revitalised"
 KMT_NRA_desc: "Despite the NRA's problems after the unification, we have succeeded in our reforms to modernise and equip the NRA for future conflicts. Every day, we receive new and eager recruits ready to be taught by battle-hardened veterans of the NRA. As the true army of the Chinese Republic, our armed forces shall be a testament to the success of Chinese modernisation for generations to come. Long live the National Revolutionary Army, long live the Chinese Kuomintang!"

 KMT_aviation_school: "Formalise Aviation Schools"
 KMT_aviation_school_desc: "While there are indeed schools for pilots in China, they are few and relatively disorganised. Formalising these schools and creating a proper curriculum for pilots and maintenance crews will help create a proper air force for China."

 KMT_new_aircraft_factories: "New Aircraft Factories"
 KMT_new_aircraft_factories_desc: "The South of the country has seen a number of small aircraft workshops created in the last decade or two, but remained fairly small, only able to repair what few planes there were. Creating proper factories is another step towards developing a fledgling aeronautics industry, a staple of the modern era."

 KMT_native_fighter_design: "Domestic Fighter Design"
 KMT_native_fighter_design_desc: "There have been a number of attempts at creating a Chinese aircraft, mostly based on foreign designs. With the help of foreign experts and an increasing pool of local technicians, we are now more than ever able to develop our own designs in the hopes of creating a modern air force to defend our skies."

 KMT_naval_bomber: "Naval Bomber Project"
 KMT_naval_bomber_desc: "While ignored at first, naval bombers armed with torpedoes and armour-piercing bombs are quickly becoming a serious threat to even the largest warships currently at sea. This technology might be exactly what China needs: A cost-effective way of destroying a vastly-larger enemy fleet threatening our coastline."

 KMT_medium_bomber: "Tactical Bomber Fleet"
 KMT_medium_bomber_desc: "Medium tactical bombers offer versatility to an air force with the ability to accomplish different types of mission. Of course, designing such a large plane has been unheard of until now and will certainly be a challenge."

 KMT_light_bomber: "Army Air Support"
 KMT_light_bomber_desc: "Light bombers as some kind of flying artillery is the best way an air force can support land operations. It is only logical that we focus on these close-air-support crafts as we forge a modern air force."

 KMT_expand_dockyard: "Expand Republican Dockyards"
 KMT_expand_dockyard_desc: "With the completion of the national unification and the fulfilment of Dr. Sun's vision, we must now take steps to transform our once fledgling provincial naval forces into the new national navy. Let us revive the Republic of China Navy under the flag of the White Sun and encourage the construction of dockyards across the coast of China to meet our growing need for ships."

 KMT_incorporate_beiyang_fleet: "Incorporate the Beiyang Fleet"
 KMT_incorporate_beiyang_fleet_desc: "As a result of the unification wars, some of China's best admirals and naval officers now find themselves out of work since the National Unification. We shall offer them full government amnesty so that these naval officers can train and lead the next generation of Chinese sailors on the high seas as part of China's new revolutionary navy."

 KMT_destroyers: "Modern Destroyer Flotilla"
 KMT_destroyers_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of any modern navy, especially one as fledgling as China's. They will protect our coasts, shipping lanes and larger warships from submarines and small attack crafts."

 KMT_submarines: "Develop Submarines"
 KMT_submarines_desc: "Submarines are proving to be indispensable in modern naval warfare. For a navy as limited as ours, they may prove to be a life saver, allowing us to attack far stronger enemies by raiding their shipping lanes and harassing their larger fleets."

 KMT_cruisers: "Cruisers for our Fleet"
 KMT_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are important for scouting and screening and, realistically speaking, may be the largest warships we are capable of building at this time."

 KMT_coastal_defence: "Focus on Coastal Defence"
 KMT_coastal_defence_desc: "It would be insane to start planning for a large fleet capable of rivalling the naval Great Powers. As such, we must focus on a more flexible navy capable to protecting our long coast and interests in the Pacific."

 KMT_grand_fleet: "A Grand Fleet"
 KMT_grand_fleet_desc: "If China is to be considered a Great Power as it rightfully should be, a navy is indispensable. While it will certainly be a very long-term plan, our great navy must start somewhere and it must start now."

In the latter, he saw a beloved mentor, and in Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, he exploded into national prominence when he attempted to assassinate the Zaifeng regent (father of Emperor Puyi) despite his failure and imprisonment.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Wang was freed, but he refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the disillusioned Sun, who had found himself sidelined by national politics and the warlords. He instead travelled to France but returned shortly after Sun's triumphant return to Guangzhou in 1921 to participate in the newly founded Kuomintang's revolutionary government. Wang was present at the party's reorganisation in 1924, and slowly began to represent the party's growing leftist wing, although he hardly fancied himself as a socialist ideologue. When Sun died in 1925, Wang was present on his deathbed and helped write his will.\n\nThe triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei quickly became one of the Kuomintang's most contested and bitter power struggles. Wang emerged the victor following Hu Hanmin's exile to Moscow and Chiang Kai-shek's assassination following the failure of the Northern Expedition, but the collapse of the expedition forced him and his political allies to flee to Europe in the hopes of one day returning to carry out Sun's revolution\n\nIn his exile, he had long consolidated his position as the leader of the Kuomintang's Leftist Central Committee, in rivalry to Hu Hanmin's own Rightist Committee, and with the backing of the Internationale and the insurgency in MinGan, had hoped to claim the mantle of Chairman of the Kuomintang.\n\nHowever fate would not have it that way, and with the collapse of his own movement, Wang has utilised his knack for political survival to pivot from a representative of socialism to that of a mere Left Nationalist, hoping to find his footing within his rival's Kuomintang.§!"

 CHI_song_qingling_advisor_desc: "§YBorn:§! January 27th, 1893, in Shanghai, Shanghai International Settlement\n§YAlignment:§! §gPAC§!\n§YBackground:§! §L A rebel from her youth, Song Qingling explicitly challenged her parents' opposition to her marriage to the late and honourable Dr. Sun Yat-sen, going as far as to run away from home to elope with the revolutionary statesman. Western-educated, fluent in English and Chinese, graceful, elegant, and charitable - she demonstrated her utmost loyalty to the revolutionary cause when she told Sun to flee ahead of the warlord Chen Jiongming's bombardment, despite reportedly suffering a miscarriage and never being able to bear children again.\n\nLoyal to his side, she was with Sun when he agreed to work with the Third Internationale and was present at his deathbed when his final will was read aloud. And then came the Northern Expedition, in which she participated, untouchable and unchallenged by anyone within the Kuomintang due to her status as the widow of the great Dr. Sun. But when the expedition failed, she refused to see it as the revolution's failure. Instead, she and other leftist Kuomintang generals fled to the MinGan Insurgent Zone, where she spent her time travelling between the insurgent zone and Shanghai to secure aid and support for the guerrilla war against the despicable Zhili warlords.\n\nServing alongside her had been none other than her close friend - Deng Yanda. The two had been together since the halcyon days of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government and found themselves united, a brother and a sister in the revolutionary struggle. Together they formed the Provisional Action Committee, with the belief that it must be up to them to fully realise the dream of the late Dr. Sun.\n\nAnd yet, it would not be them who would carry out the will of her late husband. Despite her continued resistance against the likes of Hu Hanmin's Kuomintang, the pleading of the likes of Chen Youren and her own brother, Song Ziwen, have convinced Song to at least begrudgingly grant her support to the new government, with Deng Yanda following in kind.§!"

 china_events.800.d: "It is true that the Party's Propaganda outlets are largely led by revolutionary ideologues, party apparatchiks, or otherwise intelligence agency officers, however one of the most strikingly curious cases of intellectual and artist participation in revolutionary Kuomintang propaganda has to be that of Liang Dingming. Born in Shanghai in 1898, he would enter the Nanyang School of Surveying and Mapping in 1915, learning perspective techniques through courses, and his study of painting at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. Selling portraits in Xiamen, he would win second place at a local company calendar poster competition, and thereafter enter the advertising department of the Shanghai Anglo-American Tobacco Company. With his eldest brother Liang Dizhong travelling to France to study art courses, he would send picture albums back to China, allowing his three younger brothers, Dingming included, to study and learn from them.\n\nResigning from his job in 1925, Liang would travel to Guangdong to start his revolutionary career, becoming editor-in-chief of the Revolutionary Pictorial in 1926. That same year he opened the Suishi Township Art Studio in Dashitou, completed the blood-stained painting of Shaji, and began to document the struggle of the revolutionary soldier through large-scale war paintings. From 1926 onwards he served as the lieutenant colonel art section chief of the Political Department of the General HQ of the NRA, and of the 8th Route Army, alongside the General Political Warfare Department.\n\nTravelling to Russia, Belgium, Germany and Austria on orders of the Central Executive Committee in Moscow, Liang would study art and return in 1930 to setup a Memorial Hall for the NRA in Guizhou, alongside a historical painting studio. In 1934 he became a Political Instructor of the Guizhou Political Training Department, and in 1937 became a Dean of the Academy of Fine Arts. With the unification of the nation under the Right Kuomintang banner, many of Liang's works have achieved a new spotlight, noting their role in boosting morale of the common people and soldier."
