 AFR_the_German_Remnants: "The [AFR_FormerOverlord_ADJ] Remnants"

 AFR_Analyse_their_Equipment: "Analyse their Equipment"
 AFR_Analyse_their_Equipment_desc: "In the [AFR_FormerOverlord_ADJ] administration, our men were not taught the know-how of using modern equipment that our colonial masters used to keep the [ROOT.GetAdjective] nation subjugated. Although much of this equipment has fallen into our hands, we must learn how to use it before applying it to the battlefield."

 AFR_Petition_French_Republic: "Petition the French Republic"
 AFR_Petition_French_Republic_desc: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] needs guns, and this seems like the most obvious place to turn."

 AFR_a_Homegrown_Industry_2: "A Push for Infrastructure"
 AFR_a_Homegrown_Industry_2_desc: "Under our [AFR_FormerOverlord_ADJ] overlords, infrastructure was neglected.

 AFR_materiel_from_benefactor: "Materiel from [?AFR_benefactor_tag.GetNameDef]"
 AFR_materiel_from_benefactor_desc: "Not all of the ammunition we need can be produced domestically, nor can we find all of it lying on the ground somewhere. Petitioning our benefactor for guns will help us greatly."

 AFR_join_iedc_desc: "Without our [?AFR_benefactor_tag.GetAdjective] friends, our nation would likely not have prospered to the extent it has.

However, we may repay them by formalising our entry into their economic bloc, the Imperial Economic Development Council."

 AFR_join_cairo_pact: "Join the Cairo Pact"
