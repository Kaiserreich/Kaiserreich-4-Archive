 # Russia starts the war
 worldnews.1.t: "Russia Invades the Reichspakt"
 worldnews.1.d.starts_wk: "For two decades, Germany and Russia have been at peace. Despite the animosity left by Russian defeat in the Great War, the price of five years of foreign and civil war was steep - and neither side wished to pay it again. Not everyone was convinced that this would last.\n\nToday, the sceptics were proven correct: after years of military rearmament and revanchist sentiment, Russia has repudiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and proclaimed their intent to forcefully reverse what they describe as German overlordship over Eastern Europe. As Germany and her allies mobilise against this long-feared threat, Russian artillery strikes have been reported on German positions across the Russian border - the inauguration of the second great war in a generation to shake the continent of Europe."
 worldnews.1.d.joins_wk: "While long anticipated, the outbreak of war between the Internationale and Germany was a dramatic shock - the last time there was war between the great powers of Europe, it quickly spiralled to include the entire continent. Even if they wouldn't act instantly, it was already obvious that Russia, Germany's long-bitter eastern nemesis, has been growing more belligerent in recent years.\n\nAfter much anticipation, [RUS.GetLeader] made a speech early this morning declaring that, in light of recent years, German hegemony over the world has never been more of a myth. While it only obliquely referenced the war, the speech was otherwise bellicose - and was followed by aggressive army postures along Russia's border. Once more, Germany must fight a war on two fronts."
 worldnews.1.d.sov: "For two decades, Germany and the Third Internationale have been at peace. Despite their ideological opposition to each other, the horrors of the Great War weighed on all - and neither side was prepared to repeat them. Not everyone was convinced that this would last.\n\nToday, the sceptics were proven right: after years of military rearmament and revanchist sentiment, Russia has repudiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and proclaimed their intent to forcefully reverse what they describe as German overlordship over Eastern Europe. As Germany and her allies mobilise against this long-feared threat, the rest of the Internationale has issued mobilisation orders of their own in support of their ally - the inauguration of the second great war in a generation to shake the continent of Europe."

Despite their ideological opposition to each other, the horrors of the Great War weighed on all - and neither side was prepared to repeat them. Not everyone was convinced that this would last.\n\nToday, the sceptics were proven right: after years of rising revanchism and military expansion, the French government in Paris officially declared that it was no longer bound by the Treaty of Versailles, and has proclaimed revolutionary war to reclaim its lost territory and liberate the German proletariat, with Berlin denouncing France as a rogue state in response. Already, French and German forces have traded fire along Alsace-Lorraine - the inauguration of the second great war in a generation to shake the continent of Europe."

 worldnews.7.d.pluralism: "During the Austro-Hungarian Ausgleich of 1937, the Austrians promised the autonomous states of their empire that the minorities in Transleithania would also receive autonomy. The Hungarians, however, were unwilling to oblige with the dismantlement of their state and privileges within the Monarchy.\n\nIn consequence, the Austrians have announced their intention to both humiliate Hungary and liberate the Slovaks, Transylvanians and Ruthenes by force, and already skirmishes have begun along the Austro-Hungarian border.\n\nOnly time will tell the fate of the former Dual Monarchy."
 worldnews.7.d.illyria: "During the Austro-Hungarian Ausgleich of 1937, the Austrian delegates promised their Hungarian counterparts that the historic Kingdom of Croatia - added to the newly created Kingdom of Illyria a decade ago - would be returned to the Transleithanian half of the Empire. The Hungarians soon attempted to move into Croatia-Slavonia, but were met by Illyrian troops on the border, who refused to allow the Hungarians into their land.\n\nSkirmishes between the Hungarians and Illyrians have now spiralled into a war that pits the two powerhouses of the Dual Monarchy in Austria and Hungary against the former autonomous components, all of which are fearful of renewed Dualism. Galicia-Lodomeria, however, is being eyed by its neighbours..."

 worldnews.13.t: "\"Our Finest Hour\""
 worldnews.13.d: "British politician and former Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill has published a new book, part of an emerging genre known as \"alternate history\", and concerning the Great War.\n\nThe story takes the perspective of a young British soldier returning from a victorious Gallipoli campaign amid a world radically different from our own. In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic. Churchill has commented that \"Something like this could have happened in another universe\"."

While this pact puts a lot of focus on cultural discussion and preserving Balkan identities, it is also a military alliance between the participants, seemingly directed at the country separating them and holding their \"ancestral lands\".\n\nThis new development is a big thorn in Bulgarian domination of the Balkans, but only the incoming reaction of the other Central Powers can determine whether it will yield any fruit."

This kingdom for all Bulgarians was born with bloodshed and war, though, defeating Serbia, Greece and Romania in the Weltkrieg, a move that these three nations are still bitter about today.\n\nThis tension led to the formation of the Belgrade Pact, and this alliance of Balkan states has now declared war on the Tsardom, throwing the region into conflict yet again.

 worldnews.121.t: "War over Haute-Savoie!"
 worldnews.121.d: "The world has watched with looming apprehension as the Commune of France has made increasingly aggressive demands for control of the Swiss-occupied region of Haute-Savoie. The region has been occupied by Swiss forces since the end of the Weltkrieg, and Bern's refusal to recognise the Communal government in Paris as the rightful owner of the territory has inflamed tensions between the two nations ever since.\n\nToday however, instead of continued negotiations and diplomatic action, it was artillery fire that marked the next steps in negotiations as French troops crossed the border into Switzerland. Negotiations have broken down and it seems the French are willing to retake their prize by force if need be."
 worldnews.121.enemies: "In response to revolutionary activity in the western Swiss regions of Romandie and Haute-Savoie, Swiss military forces have moved in to quell the uprising.\n\nThe revolutionaries have requested aid from the neighbouring Commune of France, who issued an ultimatum to the Swiss government in Bern to halt their suppression of Syndicalist elements in the nation.

Switzerland has long had a problem with syndicalist activism in its western French-speaking regions of Haute-Savoie and Romandie, but never have they ever had revolutionary forces act so openly against the government.\n\nWith the speed and effectiveness of the revolutionary forces, many suspect the direct involvement of the French Commune, who have long agitated for the cession of French-speaking land.\n\nWhile there is fighting in and around other parts of the country, it seems that Syndicalist forces hold the capital for now."
 worldnews.122.enemies: "Chaotic reports are coming from the small mountain republic of Switzerland stating that Syndicalist revolutionaries have seized the western regions of the Romandie and occupied haute-Savoie following a Swiss military crackdown in the region. Supporting the successful Swiss revolutionaries, French troops have quickly moved in to occupy the region, and the Swiss military has held a defensive posture, unwilling to advance into the French guns.\n\nIt seems that the speed of the revolutionary action has caught the Swiss government off guard, and they are unwilling to escalate the violence into a full war with France. It remains to be seen what the Swiss will do next."

The original Confederation between Peru and Bolivia, viewed by its many regional enemies as a potential threat, was torn asunder by a victorious Chile after the Battle of Yungay in 1839. Still, this new Confederation could unlike its predecessor prove able to sustain itself in these unstable times in South America and the wider world.\n\nObservers both overseas and domestic have noted however there are a number of key issues that must be worked out between La Paz and Lima before this new polity can truly be called a united nation."

Now a renewed hope for the Entente is lit in the forges of the Russian war machine - all along the border between the Russian and French spheres, Sir Winston Churchill's \"Twilight Struggle\" has erupted into a struggle for world order so bloody it seems to put the war of 1940 to shame.\n\nBeyond the frontlines, the citizens of the warring powers are in danger like never before, with the advent of aerial death machines that threaten to obliterate whole cities within hours of declarations of war. As both sides mobilise, the few remnants of the pre-war peace wonder - will Europe ever rest?"

Seeing the Japanese distracted by their war for Germany's East Asian colonies, [CUF.GetLeader] made a bold gamble by declaring war on Japan and [716.owner.GetAdjective] allies.\n\nThough still heavily divided among themselves, public pressure has forced many warlord governments to band together into a Chinese United Front to fight Japan in their moment of vulnerability. The United Front still faces long odds, but they hope to have caught the Japanese overstretched. It remains to be seen if Tokyo or [CUF.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] made the greater mistake."

When war broke out between the Fengtian and [china.GetNameDef], it was haunted by the prospect of Japanese intervention, should [FNG.GetLeader] fail to deliver success.\n\nAs the war dragged on and the Fengtian Government found victory slipping further and further away, these fears were vindicated when they were forced to call upon their benefactor in Tokyo for aid. [china.GetLeader] has already denounced [FNG.GetLeader] as a \"Japanese lapdog\" and claimed that foreign intervention is proof of his subservience. The two ancient civilisations have found themselves at war once again."

 worldnews.459.d.japan_versus_fengtian: "Japanese interests have long been tied to Manchuria, with Tokyo providing military and economic aid to the ruling Fengtian Clique in return for Zhang Zuolin, its leader, promising to respect Japanese interests. This relationship, however, was fraught with difficulty as Marshal Zuolin attempted to keep the Japanese at arm's length.\n\nNow, [FNG.GetNameDef]'s refusal to accommodate any further Japanese demands has led to a breakdown in the relationship between the two countries. The Empire of Japan has vowed to remove [FNG.GetLeader], declaring his current administration \"out of control\", while [FNG.GetNameDef] has officially adopted an anti-concessionist stance and promised to drive the Japanese from China once and for all."
 worldnews.459.d.default: "Negotiations have broken down between Japan and [china.GetNameDef], after the Chinese stated that they would no longer tolerate Japanese intrusion into the continent.

The nation now faces the greatest peril in her two millennia long history as the Western intervention seems unlikely, those powers struggling to fight off their own crises.

Despite the Entente's rhetoric, whether or not the old imperial powers will be able to even land on their mainlands is an open question, and depends in large part on their old German foe's luck and generosity."

Mere hours ago, the Marine National's Mediterranean patrols suddenly changed their bearings - directly towards Communard waters. While maritime standoffs between the French governments aren't unheard of, the approaching vessels are making no attempt to change course.
