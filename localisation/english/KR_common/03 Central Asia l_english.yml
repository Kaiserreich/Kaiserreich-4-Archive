## Ideas ###
 central_asia_preparation_level_1: "Failure of the Preparation Campaign"
 central_asia_preparation_level_1_desc: "Like the exotic flightless birds of faraway lands, we have determined to stick our heads deep within the sands, ignoring the urgent need for reform within our military. Whether it be through government mismanagement and inaction, or active backlash from the conservative and traditional elements of our nation, the reforms proposed in last years have failed entirely, leading to an assortment of bandits and militias which can barely be called an army, more likely to rob our own populace than face an enemy in battle."
 central_asia_preparation_level_2: "Preparation Campaign Subverted"
 central_asia_preparation_level_2_desc: "In the ancient Persian tale of the scorpion and the turtle, even as the turtle works diligently in the service of itself and its friend the scorpion, the scorpion cannot help but do its best to kill them both. Such is the nature of the scorpion, and such is also the nature of the Tribal headman and Basmachi warlord, who knows nothing more than to hoard power personally and to resist any attempt to reform our military into a modern fighting force. By stifling our attempts to reform our army, these men have secured their positions as headsmen, all while dooming themselves and their nations to foreign conquest and failure."
 central_asia_preparation_level_3: "Preparation Campaign Ineffective"
 central_asia_preparation_level_3_desc: "Great strides have been taken to reform our military, cutting away the dead wood within our ranks and the rotten core of corruption among our officers. However, initial optimism has given way to the realisation that as inspired as our reforms may be, they have fallen quite a bit short in their implementation. While some avenues of change have snuck past the wary eye of the traditionalists and we have been able to iron out some of the most egregious examples of inadequacy, corruption and mediocracy still reigns supreme in our military."
 central_asia_preparation_level_4: "Preparation Campaign Rushed"
 central_asia_preparation_level_4_desc: "It is better to take the time to do something correctly on the first attempt than to rush ahead and fail in the endeavour. Usually this maxim is applied to carpentry or architecture, wherein the worst results of mismanagement results in lopsided hovels or ill-aligned furniture. In the case of our army reform efforts, however, the results are slightly more weighty, with the defence of our nation now jeopardised by our inability to follow through. Significant deficits have been left to fester in the core of our army, and the corruption which has plagued our officers has been bruised but not truly dealt with."
 central_asia_preparation_level_5: "Preparation Campaign Truncated"
 central_asia_preparation_level_5_desc: "While there were high hopes for the success of our military preparation campaign from both our leaders and commanders, the sudden outbreak of war in the region has dashed any hope for truly comprehensive reform. If the peace had held even for another few years, we may have been able to crack down on the remaining excesses and deficits and been able to finalise our reforms, but as it stands our efforts have been herculean and the results satisfactory. Some elements of our armed forces have been truly reformed, though problems remain within the majority of our units, and the culture of corruption has been tempered, though not fully stamped out."
 central_asia_preparation_level_6: "Preparation Campaign Fruitful"
 central_asia_preparation_level_6_desc: "No matter how successful an endeavour may be, there will always be room for an even greater victory. We have done what many considered impossible by moulding the listless bandits of our realm into the semblance of an army. While there are still some lingering elements of corruption and incompetence among our officers, logisticians, and army bureaucrats, many of the worst offenders have been purged, and the rest cowed by their fall. As for the soldiers in our ranks, their bellies and ammo boxes are full, they know which end of the rifle to point at the enemy, and they stand prepared to take on any and all of our enemies."
 central_asia_preparation_level_7: "Preparation Campaign Triumphant"
 central_asia_preparation_level_7_desc: "The frenetic campaign to prepare ourselves for war has made exceptional progress in the last year, and our army has come a long way from its sad state mere months ago. Thanks to an aggressive move towards modernisation and professionalisation and significant investment into all elements of our armed forces, we have turned over a new leaf. There are still elements of corruption and mismanagement within our forces, no doubt! Only a fool would believe that the great ship of state can turn in a year's time. Regardless, the days of pervasive bribery, crime, and nepotism are long past, and there is a bright future in store for our armies, should they survive the next months."

 central_asia_ottoman_cavalry_advisors: "Ottoman Cavalry Training"

 central_asia_land_of_wanderers: "Land of Wanderers"
 central_asia_land_of_wanderers_desc: "Our society is traditionally quite nomadic, consisting in large part of wandering tribes migrating alongside their herds of livestock. The rise of railroads has revived many of the old cities and created new ones, though the recent settlement of foreigners has done much to disrupt our way of life. We will have to face facts, however, that the age of the nomad is coming to a close, and if we want to compete on the world stage we will have to adapt to the new industrial age."

## Shared Focuses ##

 CA_poisoned_wells_and_burnt_grass: "Clearing Poisoned Wells and Burnt Grass"
 CA_poisoned_wells_and_burnt_grass_desc: "The war in Central Asia has left our lands scarred and our people barely scraping together the means to survive. Villages have been reduced to burnt out husks, their people scattered across the region, rail lines are torn apart, and bandits roam the land, preying on those who survived. To restore political stability, we must repair the economic devastation of the conflict."

 CA_focus_on_light_industry: "Wines and Fabrics"
 CA_focus_on_light_industry_desc: "Turkestan is famous for its fabrics which are appreciated by everyone from Berlin to America, and our fruits and grapes can be utilized to create new sorts of wine and canned food. These exports will form the foundation of our economy, one that we require before we can dream of further industrialisation."

 CA_push_for_heavy_industry: "Mines and Factories"
 CA_push_for_heavy_industry_desc: "Like any other under-developed region, Central Asia is ripe for considerable industrial development. Вased on the inexhaustible reserves of hydroelectric power, especially on mountain rivers, a network of powerful power plants will be built that will provide new large mining centers. This is an unprecedented ambition for a country where raw mineral materials have not even been explored before."

 CA_reclaim_plantations: "Restore the Plantations"
 CA_reclaim_plantations_desc: "While conflict began in Central Asia, a number of foreign landowners and absentee planters fled the region or otherwise abandoned their valuable and productive holdings. We cannot hope to restore these plantations without the expertise they once provided, but it is good for us that many local experts are willing to replace these Russian or German planters and start their business anew."

 CA_repair_the_rails: "The Turkestan Railway"
 CA_repair_the_rails_desc: "Russian built railways crisscross our lands, which long served as vital arteries for trade and communication, and acted as the backbone of their imperialist project. Now, after our victory, the importance of these rail lines has not been diminished in the slightest, and their repair and maintenance is a priority. For this goal all railroads on our territory will be reorganized into the Turkestan Railway and transferred under direct control of the newly created Railroad Office."

 CA_revitalise_the_cities: "One Thousand and One Cities"
 CA_revitalise_the_cities_desc: "The vast majority of Central Asia is rural, if not desolate. That is not to say there are no industrious cities native to our lands. Cities born in river valleys and oases dot the land, and serve as hubs of production and trade, and as an urban counterbalance to the vast swathes of steppe and farmland. We should not allow ourselves to become beholden to the whims of the burghers, but we cannot afford to just ignore these engines of economic growth."

 CA_fund_local_initiatives: "Bankroll Local Initiatives"
 CA_fund_local_initiatives_desc: "We cannot hope to manage the entirety of our economic recovery from our capital, as the needs and opportunities in each region are unique and complex. By pushing some funding to more local governors and chiefs, we can better provide for our recovery and secure the loyalty of those outside our immediate political reach."

 CA_looking_outwards: "Looking Outwards"
 CA_looking_outwards_desc: "Central Asia sits at the crossroads of empires, and the crossroads of markets. With Russian interests retreating, and new governments rising in China and the Middle East, we may once again develop serious trade connections with our neighbors. We must promote new diplomatic ventures to develop connections and secure our role as a trade partner."

 CA_unification_by_wire: "Unification by Wire"
 CA_unification_by_wire_desc: "Central Asia is dominated by plains, deserts, and highlands, all which have forced the region into a form of political decentralization. When it takes weeks for news from the capital to reach our isolated settlements, it is impossible to bring these villages into the fold. Our rail network presents us with a new opportunity to further connect our lands through telegram networks."

 CA_strive_for_autarky: "Strive for Autarky"
 CA_strive_for_autarky_desc: "Central Asia has the unenvious position of being surrounded by a number of rising great empires, each looking to make it a pawn in their violent games of geopolitical control. We cannot rely on the peace and prosperity of our neighbors to fuel our young and struggling economy, and we cannot risk reliance on foreign goods and foreign guns."

 CA_academy: "Reform the Madrasas"
 CA_academy_desc: "More than anything else, Central Asia lacks Western technical skills and techniques, both in industrial and military spheres. The present system of higher education in our country is heavily based on the religious Madrasa school system. We need to reform and secularise the system by hiring out foreign experts and sending young Turks to study in distant lands to build the foundations of a homegrown network of modern technical and military education."

 CA_exploit_our_resources: "Exploit our Natural Wealth"
 CA_exploit_our_resources_desc: "Central Asia has boundless natural wealth, with significant and largely untapped sources of key natural resources. Taking advantage of these boons will be key to any form of economic investment, both as a means of fueling our own nascent industry, and as a means of injecting much needed foreign capital into our coffers."

 CA_waking_the_tulpar: "Waking the Tulpar"
 CA_waking_the_tulpar_desc: "The last few centuries have not been kind to our home. In the many generations since the dizzying heights of Central Asian wealth and power in the 13th and 14th century, we have collapsed into a poor and weak backwater. For too long, our natural resources have been left untouched, our fields fallow, and our great minds driven away. It is time for Central Asia to wake up!"

 CA_ensure_our_defenses: "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 CA_ensure_our_defenses_desc: "After the brutal violence of the last two decades, the peace which has slowly settled on our homeland is a welcome respite. However, there is no question that such a peace cannot last forever. We must prepare for the next great conflagration which will inevitably consume our nation."

 CA_rectify_our_weaknesses: "Rectify our Weaknesses"
 CA_rectify_our_weaknesses_desc: "Our military forces are disjointed, poorly trained, unmotivated, and wholly unprepared for the rigors and dangers of modern warfare. While we managed to punch above our weight in our most recent conflict with our neighbours, we will need to fundamentally reform our military forces if we wish to retain our sovereignty."

 CA_railway_warfare: "Railway Warfare"
 CA_railway_warfare_desc: "We saw firsthand the importance of railways in modern warfare during the Civil War, where the Tashkent Soviet and Ashgabat Rebels used their control of rails to outflank their enemies and support their expeditionary forces. We will need to fully integrate rail lines into our offensive and defensive planning, and knock some sense into those too stubborn to correctly use them."

 CA_russian_artillery_tactics: "Adopt Russian Artillery Tactics"
 CA_russian_artillery_tactics_desc: "Much of our exposure to artillery tactics have come through our experiences with Russian and Russian-trained forces, who forged a versatile and in-depth artillery doctrine in the fires of the Weltkrieg. By focusing on the development of a solid artillery park and the adoption of these well-tested tactics, we will be able to effectively punch above our weight."

 CA_win_the_war_of_attrition: "The War of Attrition"
 CA_win_the_war_of_attrition_desc: "Should one of the great powers attempt to militarily exert control over our lands, we will need to engage them as a modern army, using modern tactics to bleed them of their soldiers and willingness to fight. While static battlefields and artillery battles breed horrors native only to the modern age, it is to our advantage that these tactics are well suited to defending our home."

 CA_play_to_our_strengths: "Play to our Strengths"
 CA_play_to_our_strengths_desc: "While our army may not have the training, supplies, weapons, or tactical prowess of the great powers, we are blessed with unique advantages, including our mastery of animal husbandry, knowledge of our homeland's terrain, and command over the skirmish and encirclement tactics which dominated the battles of the Civil War and following Crises."

 CA_mastery_of_the_steppes: "Mastery of the Steppes"
 CA_mastery_of_the_steppes_desc: "For hundreds of years, the tribes of Central Asia earned their reputation as preeminent riders and skirmishers, and the horse continues to be the backbone of our elite soldiers. We should continue to develop our unique knowledge and skills surrounding mounted combat, so that our horsemen may continue to crush and harry our opponents."

 CA_basmachi_behind_each_bush: "Basmachi Behind Each Barchan"
 CA_basmachi_behind_each_bush_desc: "When the Tashkent Soviet seized control of the Turkestan Autonomy, they quickly found out that coloring in lines on a map does not mean that you control the land. Guerilla raids with the support of local hamlets and nomads can break the back of an enemy offensive, meaning that we can sacrifice ground, picking only the battles we know we will win."

 CA_win_the_war_of_annihilation: "The War of Annihilation"
 CA_win_the_war_of_annihilation_desc: "The best way to defeat an enemy who is stronger than yourself is by concentrating your strength to gain local superiority, breaking up their line, encircling their isolated forces and then destroying them outright. Concentrated elite cavalry forces, supported by local militias with intimate knowledge of the local terrain, will be the deadly point of our cutting edge."

 CA_prepare_the_next_generation: "Prepare the Next Generation"
 CA_prepare_the_next_generation_desc: "Most of our commanders come from hereditary lines of military service, though in the recent times of strife many low-born warriors and brigands rose to grandiose heights of command, making a name for themselves in the battles of the Civil War. It is time for a new generation of men who have proven their worth to take up positions of responsibility."

 CA_horse_drawn_field_guns: "Reinforced Cavalry"
 CA_horse_drawn_field_guns_desc: "The open plains and rough steppe of Central Asia make mobility key to victory, meaning that the heavy guns favored by the great powers are often too cumbersome to properly come to bear. By relying more heavily on lighter field artillery, we will be able to better support our soldiers with indirect fire."

 CA_armoured_reconnaissance: "Armour of the Steppes"
 CA_armoured_reconnaissance_desc: "The introduction of new technologies bring forward new strategies of warfare, most notably the mechanization of armies. While we may dream of a future army of gleaming war machines streaming across the steppes, an armour is good for the one who has it, and bad for the one who does not have it at the right time."

 ### Foreign Intervention ###

 cacrisis.101.t: "Berlin Offers Advisors"
 cacrisis.101.d.buk: "Berlin, feeling that a conflict between the nations of Central Asia is imminent, has offered to send a cadre of retired officers from their ancient and backwards military. Our Russian advisors have already assured us that this is merely the latest in a long line of attempts by the Germans to sow dissent among Russia's long-standing allies, and to ensnare us into the Prussian web. We need only look to the nations of eastern Europe to see the fruits of such devil's bargains.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that these German advisors would be greatly beneficial to our military's development. There are some within the Emir's court who whisper that they may even serve as a vital counterweight against the overbearing influence of our Russian advisors, perhaps allowing us a small bit of wiggle room to manoeuvre out from under Moscow's thumb. Of course, accepting these men could just as easily lead to a swift and punitive Russian response – no matter what we do we should tread very carefully."
 cacrisis.101.d.trk: "Berlin, feeling that a conflict between the nations of Central Asia is imminent, has offered to send a cadre of retired officers from their highly prestigious military. These officers would help to train our soldiers and provide vital support towards the modernisation of our military. Each potential advisor has years of experience in fighting a modern war, and most bring first-hand knowledge of Russian tactics and strategy, having fought against them in the last great European war. Obviously, accepting these advisors may invoke the ire of Moscow, but there is little denying the benefits they may provide us!"
 cacrisis.101.d.khiwzaitsev: "Berlin, feeling that a conflict between the nations of Central Asia is imminent, has offered to send a cadre of retired officers from their highly prestigious military. These officers would help to train our soldiers and provide vital support towards the modernisation of our military. Each potential advisor has years of experience in fighting a modern war, and most bring first-hand knowledge of Russian tactics and strategy, having fought against them in the last great European war.\n\nUnfortunately, accepting this offer would seriously jeopardise our relationship with General Ivan Zaytsev, and through him our relationship with Russia more broadly. Such a threat is nothing to blink at, and there are many who would have suggested a different course forward – we could instead request that the Germans provide additional support to our smuggling networks. Zaytsev has already made clear his ambivalence towards our arms smuggling, and German arms may prove just as useful as German men."
 cacrisis.101.d.khinozaitsev: "Berlin, feeling that a conflict between the nations of Central Asia is imminent, has offered to send a cadre of retired officers from their highly prestigious military. These officers would help to train our soldiers and provide vital support towards the modernisation of our military. Each potential advisor has years of experience in fighting a modern war, and most bring first-hand knowledge of Russian tactics and strategy, having fought against them in the last great European war.\n\nWith General Zaytsev out of the picture, there is little stopping us from moving forward with the German's deal. However, some of our advisors have suggested a different course forward – we could instead request that the Germans provide additional support to our smuggling networks. After all, German arms may prove just as useful as German men!"

 cacrisis.102.d.buk: "The Emir of Bukhara has accepted our offer to aid him with German advisors, but requests that their welcome not be widely reported by us, and informs us that they will not be paraded around Bukhara upon their arrival. It appears that the Emir is terrified of a punitive response from the puny Russians! Regardless of this slight, this mission will provide us with much needed experience about Russian capabilities and information regarding the state of modern war, and will provide support to those who (hopefully) oppose our enemies!"
 cacrisis.102.d.khismugglers: "Junaid Khan, the dictator of Khiva, has requested that we help to develop his arms smuggling network instead of providing military advisors to his court. While this is slightly unusual, his diplomats explained that they cannot afford to provoke a Russian response at this moment, but are committed to the cause of liberty in the region. It is true that a sizable amount of the armaments making their way into the hands of Central Asian freedom fighters comes through Khiva's ports, and there is little point in hindering their efforts, even if we have less to gain from developing this element of their military apparatus."

This will bring needed experience about Russian capabilities and the state of modern war to Germany, and will provide support to those who oppose our enemies! While there is little that our military forces can learn from the meagre armies of Central Asia, it is true that any conflict in Central Asia will involve light infantry and cavalry manoeuvres on the steppe - a fantastic simulation of what may soon occur on our front in Eastern Europe. If we can look to the last war for insight, it is clear that the war in the east will be one of terrain and movement - subjects that the Basmachi fighters of this region are well versed in."

 cacrisis.103.d.buk: "Writing in response to our generous offer to aid his military with our expertise, the Emir of Bukhara has launched a scathing, and in parts hilarious, attack against us. He accuses us of attempting to orchestrate a coup against his rule with our military mission, of trying to drive a wedge between Russia and her ‘most loyal allies,' and of cavorting with devils and atheists. It seems like the Bukharan Emir is firmly within Russia's camp, and we suspect that any efforts to dislodge them will result in more headaches."
 cacrisis.103.d.normal: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has shocked our diplomats, declaring that they will not accept our military mission. They claim that with their current position relative to Russia, they cannot risk provoking a military response by openly coordinating with us.

Our military mission has had its hands full in organising Madamin Bek's forces, but von Niedermayer is requesting that we send more significant aid.

Having had extensive experience in Afghanistan and Russian Turkestan, von Niedermayer is an infamous adventurer and German interloper, and his presence in Turkestan as an advisor to [TRK.GetLeader] betrays a developing German mission there. Based on our intel, von Niedermayer is directing the training of [TRK.GetLeader]'s forces, as well as bringing German supplies into the rogue state. We could attempt to intervene by applying diplomatic pressure on Germany - after all, few countries recognise the Turkestan Republic, putting von Niedermayer's mission into a nebulous position and making him a party to rebels, rather than an independent state. However, these manoeuvres could blow up in our face if not properly received by bringing further attention to the brewing conflict in Central Asia."

In the note, disseminated publicly through newspapers, they demanded Germany to respect Russia's territorial sovereignty, including territory currently occupied by rebel forces. While Russia has unofficially agreed to tolerate the independence of Turkestan, they still officially view the country as an autonomous region of Russia, and have recently categorised Madamin Bek's government as a bandit insurgency. Bearing this interpretation in mind, Russia has accused us of openly supporting foreign rebels through our mission led by Oberst Oskar von Niedermayer, and has called on neutral states to pressure us to withdraw from the region by pulling out our military advisors in Madamin Bek's service. They have attempted to gain brought foreign diplomatic support to pressure us to withdraw, claiming that our support is tantamount to German imperialism on Russian soil."

Once the Russians had evidence of the German military mission in Tashkent, garnered through reconnaissance and espionage through Russian military intelligence, Moscow was able to threaten Germany with international repercussions should they maintain formal support for our regime, calling us an illegitimate bandit state. Instead of defending us from this slander, the Germans instead decided to withdraw from the region, abandoning us to Russian domination. If only we had expanded our breadth of diplomatic contacts - we may have been able to better defend against this type of attack against our foreign supporters."

The new group is composed of both officers and technical experts, bringing with them a few plane-loads of modern military equipment including radios, submachine guns, mortars, binoculars, and signalling equipment. In quick order, the Germans have begun outfitting our most valuable and loyal soldiers with these modern marvels, and have begun training our forces in their maintenance and use.

Instead of forcing Germany to walk back, we have instead opened the door for an international movement in support of the rebels plaguing our southern border!

 cacrisis.109.a: "Damn."

 ### Shared Decision Events ###
 cacrisis.200.t: "Dealing with the Fergana Kurbashi"
 cacrisis.200.d: "The warrior bands of the Fergana Valley cut their teeth in the Russian Civil War, fighting against repeated Communist attempts to take control of their valley fiefdom. In the aftermath, these men carved up the most fertile land of Central Asia into their own little fiefdoms, only held in line by the threatening hand of Madamin Bek. With Madamin Bek gone, these little lieutenants have descended on each other like animals, fighting with one another while periodically banding together to frustrate any attempts to extend any serious control over the region. We will need to root out this hornets' nest or the Kurbashi bands will ceaselessly venture forth from their valley hideouts, attacking settlements which have accepted our suzerainty. Additionally, should anyone Kurbashi exert their control over the whole region, they could be an incredibly dangerous rebel figurehead. We have two paths forward to deal with these troublesome remnants of Madamin Bek's bandit state: either mobilise a massive operation to clear out the Fergana Valley, or offer to pardon some of the more ‘flexible' rebel leaders in exchange for their cooperation in pacifying the region - in exchange for our guarantee that they retain their own autonomy and power."
 cacrisis.200.a: "Crush them!"
 cacrisis.200.b: "Negotiate with them."

 cacrisis.201.t: "Handling the Kyrgyz Tribes"
 cacrisis.201.d: "Even at the height of his power, Madamin Bek had limited control of the eastern highlands, the homeland of the fierce and nomadic Kyrgyz Tribes. While many tribesmen joined Madamin Bek's bandit army, the majority were able to slip back into the mountains following his defeat, bringing with them rifles and a newfound willingness to band together to retain their near-independence. It will be staggeringly difficult to force these tribal groups into line, but if they are left to their own devices, they will likely only further dig in. Of course, there is the argument that it is not worthwhile kicking the hornets' nest, only to tighten our grip on some distant goat herders. We can either push into these lands with an army, enlisting the support of those smart enough to bend the knee and crushing those too stupid to, or instead secure our grip on the foothills, closing the pores in our borderlands while abandoning any attempt to rule over the fiercer tribes."
 cacrisis.201.a: "Send an expedition!"
 cacrisis.201.b: "Entrench the foothills."

 cacrisis.202.t: "Dealing with the Turkmen Tribes"
 cacrisis.202.d: "The Turkmen tribes surrounding the Aral Sea are a fiercely independent group with a history of violent resistance to outside rule stretching back centuries. Their violent conflicts against the Russian Tsars and Uzbek Qungrat Khans have only sharpened their resolve. Even under the Turkmen supremist rule of Junaid Khan, many leading tribes agitated against any form of outside domination, creating loose alliances of village headsmen and clan leaders to further their interests and pool their militias. At present, Koshmamed Khan, Yakshi Geldy, Shamurad Bakhshi, and Gulyam Ali have created a coalition of Turkmen, together presenting a dangerous insurgency, one which could strike out from their villages to eliminate weak the garrisons and caravans of our nascent and expanding administration. We will either need to convince a few of these headsmen to betray their kinsmen, as Junaid Khan did a generation ago to seize control over the region, or otherwise eliminate them piecemeal before they can band together."
 cacrisis.202.a: "Approach the weak links."
 cacrisis.202.b: "Crush them all!"

 cacrisis.203.t: "See to the Khivan Royals"
 cacrisis.203.d: "Even at the height of Junaid Khan's personal rule of the Khivan Khanate, the Uzbek nobility held sweeping control over the city of Khiva and the apparatuses of state which the Turkmen warlord assumed at the height of the Weltkrieg chaos. While the puppet khan Sayid Abdullah was slain in the fighting which swept through the old city, his issue and allies remain, lurking in the shadows. They are savvy political operators, having marshaled their power and control through decades of heavy handed Russian and Turkmen domination. Their strength comes from their web-like network in the city, which gives us a way forward. If a few key links are eliminated, the others would be listless and unable to mount any real resistance. Of course, we can always simply opt to leave their network largely intact - after all, who better knows how to run Khiva than those who have for the last century and a half."
 cacrisis.203.a: "House arrest. Exile. Firing squad."
 cacrisis.203.b: "Give them Khiva, so long as they give it to us."

 cacrisis.204.t: "Manage the Urban Tajiks"
 cacrisis.204.d: "The great cities of Central Asia are melting pots of peoples - Turkic tribes, Persian Jews, Russians and Germans. No one group is more simultaneously influential and demeaned than the Tajiks, those Persian speaking Muslims who have long suffered under the yoke of the Bukharan Emirs. Of course, the line between the “settled” Tajiks and roaming Turks has become much less clear, as thousands have flocked to the great ruins of ancient cities, learning the languages of their neighbors and picking up newfangled trades. To truly rule the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, the Tajik leaders must be accommodated for or cowed into submission. The oppressive rule of the Emir has led to serious concerns among the people of the cities that any new ruler only seeks to squeeze the life-blood out of their homes. Having thrown out the emir, we will want to ask the most rebellious city elders to meet with us..."
 cacrisis.204.a: "...to gather all the fish in one barrel."
 cacrisis.204.b: "...to hash out a degree of autonomy."

 cacrisis.205.t: "Handle the Bukharan Bureaucrats"
 cacrisis.205.d: "The Bukharan court was a motley mixture of Russian advisors, Uzbek tribal and religious leaders, Jadid gadflies, and the family of the odious Emir - all jostling against one another for influence and control over the organs of state. With any semblance of unifying power eliminated, these groups have been reduced to little more than squabbling clans of administrators, experts, bandits, and numerous useless ‘grand poobahs' no longer able to leech off the power of the Emirate. Though they are largely bereft of purpose and power, these groups have deep connections in the city, and their support would be invaluable to secure our rule. Of course, many would argue that it was the misrule of these petty penny-counters which allowed Bukhara to fall in the first place, making any reinstatement a dangerous acquiescence to rot and corruption. To truly control Bukhara, they argue, the old families will have to be dethroned."
 cacrisis.205.a: "Elevate the Jadid reformers"
 cacrisis.205.b: "The old guard's experience is invaluable."
 cacrisis.205.c: "Burn it down and build on the ashes."

 cacrisis.206.t: "Reeling in the Remnant Riders"
 cacrisis.206.d: "As armies clashed and units scattered, a great number of Kurbashis, tribal chiefs, and even just lowly soldiers found themselves far from home, with little idea of who their leader was, who their enemy was, and why they should march into the jaws of death when there was a perfectly good village to plunder down the road. Even as the open fighting has died down, reports stream in from far-flung hamlets of roving bands of violent thugs, sporting the mockery of military insignia in some long dead army (or, more embarrassingly, in one of our own units). We cannot simply stand by and watch as these ghosts continue to undermine us and harass our lands, but some argue that we should not attack these up-jumped bandits. After all, with cunning warriors in short supply, why continue fighting a war long won? Most of these men would agree to simply return to their homes, should we grant them safe passage, and chances are that were they offered a place within our army, they would be happy to join us, rather than fight us. Of course, the loyalty of these lost riders would be dubious at best, and pardoning vagabonds does not exactly lend our government the legitimacy it desperately needs."
 cacrisis.206.a: "Crush them all!"
 cacrisis.206.b: "Demand they go home and lay down their arms."
 cacrisis.206.c: "Recruit them, we could always use ‘flexible' warriors."

 cacrisis.207.t: "Crushing the Opportunists"
 cacrisis.207.d: "Whenever the armies of Central Asia turn against one another and the roads go unguarded, the usual suspects of petty crime and highway robbery slowly slink out from the woodwork to harass caravans and disrupt trade. As time goes on, petty criminals band together into dangerous gangs, and the ambitions of these roving bands of highwaymen grows to threaten even the most well protected merchant convoys. Now that we can refocus our military on the homeland, rounding up these miscreants will not be challenging, but we will need to then figure out what to do with them. Every educated man would agree that the hudud punishment for thievery under Sharia is the amputation of the right hand, but there are some that have championed that these men be subject to the cross-amputation and crucifixion which is an applicable punishment for some forms of highway robbery. While the image of miles of road adorned with the crucified corpses of thousands of bandits is tempting, application of this punishment is not universally accepted among the Ulemma and pressing for its widespread implementation may upset some religious figures."
 cacrisis.207.a: "No mercy for those profiting from our misery!"
 cacrisis.207.b: "They are thieves, nothing more - give them Allah's mercy!"

 ### Enver Pasha ###

 cacrisis.300.t: "A Curious Crew of Turks"
 cacrisis.300.d: "While Khiva is no stranger to bands of secretive visitors filling the city's tea houses and caravansaries with an ocean of hushed tones and foreign garbs, a group of recent arrivals from Baku have raised eyebrows. They lack the typical look of merchants or fugitives, and have gone around the city, asking confusing questions regarding troop movements and operations during the Russian Civil War in distant accents and broken Uzbek. Many within the Royal Court have become convinced that these men are foreign spies. An investigation headed by Aziz Khan has come up with a bizarre explanation for these figures, however: their leader, an Ottoman Turk named Baha Said, is a former Ottoman researcher and aircraft inspector with close ties to the disgraced Unionist movement and the underground anti-government Karakol Society. Our own agents have some tertiary experience with this secret society, as several former members of Enver Pasha's ill-fated Army of Islam made Khiva their home after it was crushed in the Caucasus - smuggling funds through our network of clandestine trade in Anatolia while supporting our rearmament programme with contacts and connections.\n\nCalling in some of our agents, we managed to organise a meeting between Baha Said and Junaid Khan to determine the purpose of this expedition. These men are searching desperately for the corpse of their long lost leader, Ismail Enver Pasha, who disappeared in Central Asia more than a decade ago. With the concerns of Ottoman spying assuaged, Junaid Khan attempted to remember the fate of the exiled general, who had passed through Khiva by way of Baku. He had trumpeted his arrival as the coming of the true “General of Islam” who would unite the Turks and crush both the Red and White Russians, before departing down the Oxus towards Bukhara. The rumours claim that he did not make it much farther, and that he found his end on the Bukharan Emir's executioners block. Undeterred by Junaid Khan's cautionary tale, the Karakol expedition excitedly packed their things and departed, presumably towards the realm of Emir Alim Khan."
 cacrisis.300.a: "What an eccentric group..."

 cacrisis.301.t: "A Bizarre Band of Turks"
 cacrisis.301.d: "At the height of the Russian Civil War, a band of Ottoman ex-soldiers made their way into our city, led by a once famed and then disgraced Ottoman general, whose commitment for the Islamic cause was matched only by his vanity, pride, and sinful ignorance of proper Muslim conduct. This foreign general, the blowhard Enver Pasha, carried strange and heretical books on sorcery, soul binding instruments, and, like most devil worshippers, immediately took to the company of Jadidists and radicals, leading the valiant Ibrahim Bek to imprison this dangerous revolutionary.\n\nWhen it came to our attention that he was son-in-law to the former Caliph, however, our infinitely generous and gracious Emir freed the Ottoman ne'er-do-well. Instead of returning to his homeland, Enver Pasha fled east with a growing personal army, waylaying the countryside and spreading a violent revolutionary theology. He further made a mockery of good Muslim conduct by taking the laughable titles of “Emir of Turkestan” and “Representative of the Prophet,” all while his gang of marauders coerced Mullahs and clashed with the valiant Mujahideen defending Turkestan from the Red menace.\n\nRecently, a new gang of Ottoman vagabonds have entered our realm, bearing ill omens and making clear their interest in the resting place of the Ottoman dog Enver Pasha. The leader of this band, some minor Ottoman official named Baha Said, was apprehended by our loyal guards whilst painting detailed depictions of Bukhara's old city. While Ibrahim Bek has called for the execution of what could only be inexperienced Ottoman spies, Emir Alim Khan worried that such an act could strain the relationship between the Porte and the Ark. The Emir, in his boundless wisdom, has determined that the best course of action is forceful exile. These fortunate fools have immediately set off eastwards, chasing the trail of their equally stupid martyr."
 cacrisis.301.a: "Good riddance!"

 cacrisis.302.t: "A Pugnacious Party of Turks"
 cacrisis.302.d: "At the height of the Civil War, when the Basmachi commanders were joining their forces against the Tashkent Soviet and Jadid domination, a foreign general rode into our councils at the head of a band of rowdy bandits. Though his army was farcical and his mannerisms nonsensical, this Enver Pasha garnered the hesitant support of many Kurbashi with his connections to the Caliph and the Ottomans. As more commanders acknowledged his influence, however, he began to give himself grandiose titles, calling himself the, “Commander-in-Chief of all the Armies of Islam, Son-in-Law of the Caliph and Representative of the Prophet,” and it was not long before he alienated his supporters and returned to the mountains as a glorified highwayman, his medal-bedazzled chest hiding a weak heart. With his plans of a Pan-Turk jihad crushed, he would head west with the intention to return to his native Anatolia, though rumours say that he never made it past Khiva, cut down by Junaid Khan's men on the orders of the Russians.\n\nFew of the remaining Kurbashi remember the strutting form of the late, vain commander, but recently his name has floated up the grape vine, reaching the ear of Madamin Bek. Supposedly, a group of haggard and combative Ottomans have passed into our lands, searching for the corpse of the old “Supreme Commander of all Muslims.” While we know precious little about the whereabouts of the man's corpse, we were able to direct this band to seek their answers in the Khivan court of Junaid Khan."
 cacrisis.302.a: "They didn't seem to appreciate our answer..."

 ### Samarkand Crisis ###

 cacrisis.401.t: "Cutting out Dead Wood"
 cacrisis.401.d: "With the vast majority of administrative and political positions across Bukhara, eligibility for service and promotion depends much more on who you know, rather than how capable you are. Most governors, or Beys, are drawn from long dynasties of local political control, with their familial networks forming the basis for their control over the distant provinces which make up the Emirate. Bukhara's acquisition of Samarkand during the Tashkent Crisis created a sort of administrative conundrum for the Emir and his Beys, however, as there was a question of whether the city and its surroundings would be administered as though it was a part of the Emirate proper, and if so, who would reign as the Bey of such a unique region? At the advice of his advisors, Alim Khan modeled the new Samarkand administration on that of the city of Termez in the south, which split its governance between a Bey and a Russian dominated city-council. In Samarkand, while the Emir would appoint a Bey to take up the powers formerly vested in the Russian Military Commissar to the city, the leading figures of Samarkand would choose the lower positions in the provincial administration, notably the Devonbeggi (finance minister), the Mirab (water collector), Amin Sardar (overseer of construction), and Paygirchi (tax collector). Placing the patriarch of the influential Ostanakul dynasty in charge of Samarkand seemed like a good idea at the time, as he was experienced as the governor of various eastern Beyliks and well respected.\n\nThe last decade has not been kind to the eldest Ostanakul, however, with his mind slipping into elderly befuddlement in his advanced age. The incapacity of the Emir's representative in Samarkand has been a godsend for the citizens of Samarkand, who have taken this opportunity to secure control of their own affairs, especially with the appointment of outspoken regionalists and reformists as the Devonbeggi, Mirza (court secretary), and Mirshab (regional garrison leader) of the province. Though this arrangement has been quite the boon for the city elders of Samarkand, the reign of the ministries under the feeble hand of the weak Ostanakul Bey has more or less dismantled any semblance of Bukharan control over the city. The time is ripe to reverse this humiliating state of affairs, by replacing the Bey with a new, younger and more energetic governor, drawn from within the most important family of Bukhara itself. Alim Khan's youngest son, Rakhim Khan, is a bold commander, committed to his father's vision of Samarkand and unafraid of the entrenched Samarkand oligarchs. With support from his father, and some luck, he will certainly clean up the defunct Beylik!"
 cacrisis.401.a: "Anything he needs, he shall receive!"

 cacrisis.402.t: "Rakhim Khan Purges His Ministry"
 cacrisis.402.d: "Time spent as a governor in distant provinces is vital for the development of a potential Bukharan Emir, giving a young prince the experience necessary to govern. Alim Khan himself spent fourteen years serving as the Bey of Nasef and later Karmana before ascending to the throne, and during that time he learned much, though these provinces were quiet hamlets in the outskirts of the capital. His son, Rakhim Khan, has instead been thrust into the hornets' nest in Samarkand, contending with a powerful city hostile to his rule. Years of neglect has allowed a number of powerful families to place lackeys in every level of the traditional provincial administration. Almost immediately upon his arrival, Rakhimkhan uncovered corruption across the ministries, with the city's Devonbeggi and Amin Sardar siphoning tax funds into elaborate projects to benefit their patrons, while the Mirshab “misplaced” ammunition as it arrived at the arsenals. Obviously, this poisonous corruption is the very heart of the reason for Rakhimkhan's appointment, and the young prince has reacted to the revelations of these misdeeds by jailing the responsible officials and replacing them with men loyal to him as Bey.\n\nThe leading elders of Samarkand have risen in uproar against this decisive strike against corruption, claiming that without trials the officials should walk free, and that the Emir has acted against the spirit of the agreements made nearly a decade ago. Many have written letters to Bukhara condemning Rakhim Khan's “meddling” and issuing demands ranging from the reinstatement of those imprisoned to the appointment of a new, more agreeable Bey of Samarkand. Alim Khan is not about to turn his back on his son at the whims of some upjumped coin counters, however, and has written to his son with instructions to continue his course."
 cacrisis.402.a: "Start by imprisoning those complaining!"

 cacrisis.403.t: "Rumours of Amu Darya Smugglers"
 cacrisis.403.d: "The Amu Darya River, historically known as the Oxus, is a vital conduit, running from the mountains of Pamir into the Aral Sea. Many of the greatest cities of Central Asia have been built along its banks, and it remains as one of the main conduits of trade in the region. Bukhara and its sister city of Samarkand both lie on the Amu Darya's tributary, the Zeravshan, which forks off deep within Khivan territory. Rumours abound of small riverboats smuggling arms along this river route, bypassing Bukharan patrols to deliver goods upstream in Samarkand or Turkestan. A preliminary investigation has revealed a small fortified base on the far side of the Khivan border, where these smugglers have been loading and outfitting their craft.\n\nWhile we could easily request that Khivan ruler Junaid Khan move to crush this little elicit operation, he will likely ignore us. The Khan has never really been a friend of Bukhara, and recent tensions between Khiva and our shared Russian overlord have done little to warm things between us. Additionally, many in our government view any diplomatic moves toward Khiva as a sign of weakness, and an embarrassment to the Emirate. We could also opt to impress the tribal leaders residing on the banks of the Dargom Canal, where the river narrows significantly, to intercept and destroy these smugglers as they make their way north. Either way, these vagabonds must be dealt with, and the stream of arms they bring eastward must be stopped!"
 cacrisis.403.a: "Request Khivan intervention."
 cacrisis.403.b: "Call on the tribes to crush them!"

 cacrisis.404.t: "Envoys Arrive from Bukhara"
 cacrisis.404.d: "Messengers from the neighbouring Emirate of Bukhara have recently arrived in our court, bombastically demanding that we ‘take care of' a band of smugglers operating out of our lands. While we owe these arrogant losers nothing, telling these smugglers to temporarily cease operations may cloak our more expansive designs against Bukhara. If the Emir were to think we were united in our efforts to stop smuggling, or even scared into submission by his bluster, it would give us more leeway to poke and prod at the Emirate without arousing suspicion. After all, one must think you are behind them, before you can stab them in the back."
 cacrisis.404.a: "Stop the smugglers."
 cacrisis.404.b: "The Emir does not rule here!"

 cacrisis.405.t: "Khiva Agrees to Stop Smugglers"
 cacrisis.405.d: "Luckily, Junaid Khan agreed to eliminate the smugglers operating from the banks of the Khivan Amu Darya. Either he, like us, wishes to cleanse the region of instability, likely to cement his own rule, or otherwise we were able to scare him into compliance. Of course, this doesn't mean that we trust this upjumped cutthroat, but we are happy to receive whatever help he'll provide. Regardless, we have already received reports that the smuggling boats trickling east have been stopped."
 cacrisis.405.a: "Great news!"

 cacrisis.406.t: "Junaid Khan Pleads Ignorance"
 cacrisis.406.d: "Junaid Khan, the undisputed ruler of the Khivan Khanate from his post as Serdar Karim, has sent away our couriers from his court, denying knowledge of any smuggling base in his realm. This oxheaded buffoon clearly thinks we are idiots, or is just trying to bait us into an embarrassing overreaction to his clear insult. Unfortunately, there is little we can do now to stem the tide of these gunrunners, especially as Khiva actively mocks our efforts to suppress them."
 cacrisis.406.a: "That bastard!"

 cacrisis.407.t: "Eastern Tribes Destroy our Enemies"
 cacrisis.407.d: "Ibrahim Bek has marshalled a number of the most murderous eastern tribal bands to patrol a couple of narrow points on the Zeravshan River, hoping to intercept some of the smugglers which have recently plagued our Emirate. We were happy to hear that a few days ago, they were able to catch one of the boats, capturing and torturing the crew, before marking the shores with their corpses. It appears that the others have gotten the message, as there has since been no reports of smuggling. Of course, the weapons recovered have all but disappeared, presumably into the hands of the men who intercepted them."
 cacrisis.407.a: "Grisly, but effective."

 cacrisis.408.t: "Eastern Tribes Ignore our Pleas"
 cacrisis.408.d: "While Ibrahim Bek generally has the ear of the eastern Uzbek tribes, he is generally unwilling to cash in any significant portion of his political clout with them, unless he benefits greatly from the exchange. In the present case, the tribes have ignored our call to come west and aid us, and Ibrahim Bek has declined to push them to act, leaving us wholly impotent. Unfortunately, there is precious little we can do - our own warriors are stretched thin or training, and we simply cannot compel the tribes, outside of promises of loot and favour. While we sit bickering with our own Atalyk and his tribal warriors, the smugglers continue eastward, unmolested."
 cacrisis.408.a: "Those bastards!"

 cacrisis.409.t: "Muted Responses from Bukhara"
 cacrisis.409.d: "While Bukhara is technically recognised as an independent nation, with its own protected sovreignty and domestic policy, the truth is that it is firmly within the Russian sphere, bound by treaties of alliance and friendship and monitored by a veritable cadre of Russian advisors and agents. These emissaries of Russian rule are integral to the maintenance of the Bukharan state, but it is equally true that their loyalties lie squarely with Moscow, and that they monitor their hosts closely for any signs of independent minded ambition.\n\nOur recent reports from our agents in Bukhara have streamed in as normal, detailing anti-bandit campaigns in the countryside, hostile troop movements on the Turkestan and Afghanistan borders, and demonstrations in the city of Samarkand. However, there are some worrying signs within - notes that the reporting ‘advisor' was not invited to a response meeting, vague allusions to increased influence of anti-Russian figures within the court, and some typical reports outright missing. It appears that while there have been no serious moves to undercut our control, the Bukharans are purposefully boxing out our levers of power within their government. Of course, we cannot exactly invade our ally because our feelings are hurt, but we can begin preparing a response, just in case this situation escalates."
 cacrisis.409.a: "Concerning..."

 cacrisis.410.t: "Conflict in the Ark"
 cacrisis.410.d: "The Bukharan court is an asthmatic and frail old beast, limping forward despite its numerous irreparable deficiencies. More than anything else, it has been frozen by the factionalism which dominates the Emirate's politics - with years of Traditionalist entrenchment building up their hold over the offices of governance, the fear of any sort of change has led the Kushbeggi, stalwart conservative Nizamuddin Urganji, to periodically align with the reformers to push through much needed life-support. Most recently, conflict arose in the palace over the distribution of water rights using canals the late Grand Prince Nikolay Konstantinovich dug into the Oxus, with some bureaucrats advocating for temporary leases of the rights distributed by the central government, and the traditionalists warning against the usurpation of any of the traditional rights held by the noble Beys. Both parties have a leg to stand on, and it will likely be up to the Kushbeggi to come up with any form of compromise, if he is able to.\n\nWhile technically this sort of government infighting is exact where the Emir is supposed to serve as an arbitrator for the differing factions, unfortunately Alim Khan is not particularly interested in this element of his responsibilities, generally delegating - either to Urganji or, more damaging, to his Russian advisors. In the present case it is unlikely that any sort of accord will be reached - no matter what someone is going to be unhappy."
 cacrisis.410.a: "Keep things exactly as they are - we don't want to upset the natural balance of things."
 cacrisis.410.b: "An innovative funding idea during our time of fiscal need? Implement the reform!"
 cacrisis.410.c: "Perhaps we could make some limited allowances in a couple of key spots?"

 cacrisis.411.t: "Spies and Saboteurs"
 cacrisis.411.d: "Our trusted Atalyk Ibrahim Bek has come before us with deeply unsettling information. He informed the court that during the vigorous interrogation of a pair of known dissident intellectuals, they revealed a web of connections between a number of members of the Samarkand City Duma and figures outside of our Emirate, in the Turkestan Republic and further abroad. Our relationship with the Samarkand Duma has grown increasingly strained as a result of our more proactive stance towards handling Samarkand, and our relationship with the native Jadid reformers has long oscillated between frosty distrust and outright murderous hatred. Even still, it comes as a surprise that they have turned towards spying for foreign republican snakes. Ibrahim Bek has pitched this new information as the discovery of a vast and worrying fifth column, one which has supposedly infected all elements and divisions of our administration, especially that of the rebellious city of Samarkand. He has drawn clear and specific connections to foreign villains like Mustafa Shokay, Alihan Tura, and Madamin Bek, who actively conspire to destroy our realm.\n\nPerhaps the time for negotiation with the Samarkand Duma has passed - they have shown themselves to be too dangerous and radical to be reasoned with, and Ibrahim Bek makes solid arguments that these godless subjects will be sated by nothing short of the beheading of the Emir himself. On the other hand, our loyal Kushbeggi Nizamuddin Urganji has requested we not rush to smoke out the remaining conspirators, instead requesting that we attempt to foster a couple of confidential informants among their ranks to determine who poses the greatest threat, before rushing ahead to kidnap and torture the most outspoken radicals. The Atalyk argues that any informants would be inherently untrustworthy, as Samarkand is filled entirely with godless snakes."
 cacrisis.411.a: "Jail the loudest troublemakers!"
 cacrisis.411.b: "Let Urganji call in some favours."

 cacrisis.412.t: "Samarkand City Councillors Arrive in Tashkent"
 cacrisis.412.d: "Following a recent crackdown against Samarkand politicians within Bukhara, a small delegation of councillors from the Samarkand City Duma have come to our capital, to plead their case with our own assembly, as well as with Madamin Bek personally. The brutality of the Bukharan court has surprised even us, and there are many within our republic who see the people of Samarkand as wayward siblings of our new republican independence movement, forgiving these councillors their role in tearing the city away from our republic in its infancy. Behind closed doors, Madamin Bek is delighted to see the Emir alienate and provoke his Samarkand citizens - after all, should he push them too far they will become valuable allies in a fight against our southwestern neighbour, and a potential casus-belli for intervention into the region. Of course, we will need to be careful to not overplay our hand, as an overeager response to these developments may appear inauthentic, and more concerningly could tip our hand to Moscow. We could give these leaders private assurances of our commitment to their cause and promise future assistance and aid, or instead leverage our allies in the Tashkent Duma to make a scathing attack on the Bukharan government, detailing all of the alleged crimes and attempting to call out the Emir and his allies. This will certainly escalate matters, but may embarrass the Emir's government to the extent that he is forced to walk back some of his efforts, further winning us support among the people of Samarkand."
 cacrisis.412.a: "Give them private assurances and promises of future help."
 cacrisis.412.b: "Push a formal declaration through the Duma, and demand a Bukharan response."

 cacrisis.413.t: "The Tashkent Duma Speaks Out!"
 cacrisis.413.d: "Following our recent string of imprisoned Samarkand dissidents, the city has been relatively quiet, leading us to think that perhaps their rebellious urges had been sated, and their most aggressive leaders safely jailed or otherwise scared into submission. It was for this reason that we were shocked when news came of a damning indictment from the Republic of Turkestan, detailing the ‘crimes' of our government against the people of Samarkand. This expose was clearly targeted at Moscow, and it appears to have worked, as already their agents have pushed hard against our efforts to strangle this Samarkand insurrection in its cradle. This leaves us in an incredibly difficult position - now, more than ever, we know that the rebels in Samarkand are colluding with Turkestan. Armed with this information, we would like nothing more than to imprison the entire Duma so that we may truly find who is in the pocket of foreign powers. On the other hand, we have just been firmly warned that the Russians will not tolerate any more ‘embarrassing mistakes' in our handling of Samarkand, and rumours indicate that certain segments of the Russian government would rather reclaim the administration of Samarkand, so that they may rule the city themselves. Even as mere rumours, such talk is dangerous, especially if the dissidents in Samarkand were to hear and begin petitioning Russia for intervention. We must sit tight, apologize to the correct figures, and make a conclusive plan towards dealing with Samarkand. We cannot afford any more half-measures."
 cacrisis.413.a: "Damn, we cannot afford to lose face like this!"

 cacrisis.414.t: "Our Informants Expose Dirty Money"
 cacrisis.414.d: "Delightful news from Samarkand - Kushbeggi Urganji's contacts within the Samarkand Duma have dug up some dirt on a few of their colleagues, prominent local politicians who have long advocated for Samarkand independence and Pan-Turk unity. In one case, a councillor ‘sold' a small enterprise to a buyer from Kokand - the only catch being that the company he was selling did not exist! In another, an exporter had a series of purchases with a counterpart in Tashkent that were simply too lucrative to not be some form of graft. Others have simply accepted bribes from foreign merchants - a practice that is more or less commonplace across the region, but is valuable information regardless. Armed with this ammunition, we can legally and formally eject a few of the most vocal opponents of our dominion over Samarkand. Of course, all the illicit dealings we uncovered among councillors favouring our governance will remain in the dark, unless they happen to change their mind in the future. We will be sure to let them know, just in case."
 cacrisis.414.a: "We'll play by their rules - all legal like."

 cacrisis.415.t: "Our Informants Reveal Nothing"
 cacrisis.415.d: "While Kushbeggi Urganji was supposedly successful in his pursuit of informants within the Samarkand City Duma, the weeks since have borne no fruit. These informants have each produced a number of excuses for their failures - they were shut out of a meeting, or missed an important drop, or were cut off from their own informants...all lies and excuses. The truth appears to be more sinister - not only have a number of the men we enlisted to uncover dirt on their colleagues actively not attempting to find the information we requested, they have also tipped off the individuals that we were pursuing, warning them of our interest. At this point, there is little we can do, and our failed gamble has incensed the Duma against us, turning members who remained on the fence away from our administration and into the hands of these vagabonds. It appears that Urganji and his friends could not pull this manoeuvre off."
 cacrisis.415.a: "Useless, the whole lot of them!"

 cacrisis.416.t: "Colonel Iskander Recommends Seeking Aid"
 cacrisis.416.d: "Colonel Aleksandr Nikolayevich Iskander is a roguish prince of a disgraced and forgotten branch of the Romanovs, who stands today as one of the Emir's closest advisors. His father, Grand Prince Nikolay Konstantinovich, was the younger brother of Tsar Alexander II, making him the eighth in line for the throne upon the abdication of Nikolay II. This venerable Grand Prince had been rocked by scandal, however, after he stole jewels from his mother, leading the royal family to declare him insane and exile him to Turkestan, where he built a family and palace in Tashkent, far from the view of the court in St. Petersburg. It was there that he was allowed to take the name Iskander, as he was not allowed to go by his regnal name for fear of embarrassing the House of Romanov further. As a scion of Tashkent, Aleksandr Iskander would play a central role in the failed Osipov Coup against the Tashkent Soviet, briefly fighting with Madamin Bek in the Fergana valley before travelling to the court of Emir Alim Khan to pledge his service to the Emirate's cause. Since then, the Prince's familial dacha has been requisitioned by the Turkestanis (who made it the workplace of their executive offices) and has rebuilt in Bukhara, using his father's immense wealth to make a name for himself as the primer manufacturer of cotton gins in the region, as well as a man with the ear of the Emir.\n\nIskander has requested that we inform Moscow of the depth of our concerns regarding the growing insurgency in Samarkand, and ask them to send Russian soldiers to help us put down any rebellious movements. He argues that while our local native army is capable of maintaining our borders and repelling raids from Turkestan or Afghanistan, should the people of Samarkand fortify their city and repel us, we would not have the heavy weapons or mass to push through their defences. What the young Prince is not as concerned about is the diplomatic and political nightmare bringing additional Russian soldiers into the region would be for us. First off, it would send the Atalyk into an apoplectic rage, as well as being a poisoned pill for our legitimacy as a formally independent state. Beyond that, there is the issue that, should the Russians take Samarkand by force, they may simply decide to stay there, reorganising the city so that it is under direct Russian control. We simply cannot afford to bring Russian soldiers into the equation, no matter how tempting it is, and we will continue to direct our officers and allies to downplay the Samarkand threat."
 cacrisis.416.a: "We cannot afford to look weak in front of Russia!"

 cacrisis.417.t: "A Delegation from Samarkand Arrives"
 cacrisis.417.d: "This morning, a delegation of politicians from Samarkand arrived in the city of Bukhara, bringing with them a petition of grievances against the Emir and a list of demanded reforms which they wish for our regime to carry out. More importantly, these men bear the news that the city has imprisoned their Bey, Rakhim Khan, the son of the Emir and have exiled or imprisoned our guards and bureaucrats in the city, closing the gates and letting only friends and traders in. Such impertinence cannot be tolerated! These brigands spit in our faces, and then make outrageous demands of us like self-rule, democratic representation, and a guarantee of rights! Beyond the insult they threw against us with this impetuous act, we cannot be seen to be cowed by our own subjects - should we begrudgingly accept their demands we will be opening the door for every town, tribe, and ethnic minority to come, hostage in hand, requesting their own set of rights and privileges.\n\nUnfortunately, we only really have two options to deal with this odious new development: we can raise an army and smoke them out of Samarkand so that we can purge this liberal disease from our realm, or we can instead try the work their delegates down to a more reasonable set of requests in return for the restoration of Rakhim and the restoration of normal relations. Should we choose the former, we have no use for the men assembled before us, and Ibrahim Bek is more than excited to be rid of them.\n\nIn fact, this crucial decision to manage the unfolding Samarkand Crisis has become yet another battleground for the sectarian factions of the Bukharan court - the Kushbeggi and his allies have pushed hard for negotiations with the delegates, while Ibrahim Bek has presented equally forceful arguments in favour of their untimely demise. With the court divided, it will be up to the Emir to decide."
 cacrisis.417.a: "Behead them and be done with it!"
 cacrisis.417.b: "Let's hear them out - maybe there is an easy way out of this?"

 cacrisis.418.t: "Who Will Lead the Grand Host?"
 cacrisis.418.d: "Having ‘dealt' with the delegation of Samarkand notables, the time has now come for the Emir to select who shall lead the grand host we are currently marshalling against the rogue city. An assembly of the warbands and army will require a firm and respected leader at its head, otherwise the hundreds of minor chiefs, lieutenants, and Beys will not submit to the will of their commander, leaving the host unwieldy and undisciplined. With this in mind, there is only one figure truly fit for the role: Ibrahim Bek. He alone is able to whip his subordinates into shape and ring this host to bear.\n\nHowever, there are some within the court who believe that sending the fiercely anti-Russian Atalyk forth will send the wrong message to our allies in Moscow, as he will likely make no exceptions in his fury for those waywards souls who happen to be Russian-borne. They have petitioned us to position Russian advisors  as the leaders of the wings of Ibrahim Bek's formation, forcing him to temper his vitriol towards the christians and cooperate with our closest allies. Of course, shackling him to these men may prove to be challenging for Ibrahim Bek, but they are both capable military commanders, bringing their own skill and abilities to the table, and their coordination on the field will prove to be a phenomenal propaganda coup with our contacts in Russia."
 cacrisis.418.a: "Our Atalyk will lead alone, of course!"
 cacrisis.418.b: "Give Colonels Iskander and Stremkovsky command of the flanks."

 cacrisis.419.t: "Citizens Take to the Streets!"
 cacrisis.419.d: "While generally the anti-Russian sentiment in our Emirate is found in the hearts of the traditionalists, who fear the dangerous foreign influences these advisors and colonels from Russia bring into our nation, today it was the reformists who took to the street to protest our decision to involve Russian commanders in our march against Samarkand. Unfortunately, while Ibrahim Bek is normally itching for a reason to arrest, maim, or gun down a few godless protesters, he is personally quite upset with the arraignment, and does not exactly appear keen to crush protesters he agrees with. Our Russian officers, on the other hand, are eager to take to the streets - but we have barred them from doing so. After all, what would it look like for Russian soldiers to gun down our own citizens?\n\nLuckily for us, these protesters did not need an external force to be eliminated - disagreements within the protesting groups began to rear their head only days after the unrest began, splitting the groups and leading to their eventual disintegration. With their leadership split, these protests have all but petered out, but the damage has already been done, in some ways. With the city frozen and disagreements between our military leadership on full display, the veneer of our invulnerability has been chipped away, and the morale of our enemies are empowered by our failures."
 cacrisis.419.a: "A near miss, but a miss nonetheless."

 cacrisis.420.t: "Disaster at Ishikhon!"
 cacrisis.420.d: "While the locus of the rebellious action in our realm is Samarkand, this cancer of dissent has spread to a few outlying areas, infecting them with the violent spirit of socialism and idolatry. One of these pockets of rebellion is Ishikhon, located between Bukhara and Samarkand, blocking our path to the rebel city. If we merely passed this stronghold without eliminating the threat it posed, it could serve as a base to harry our supply lines or sally out to pin our forces from behind. Instead, we would be best served by smoking out the insurrection at the heart of the city, crushing our enemies and securing our control over the region.\n\nThat is, of course, if our commanders could agree with one another. During the battle at Ishikhon, Colonel Iskander and Subcolonel Stremkovsky attempted to encircle the town with mobile soldiers, while Ibrahim Bek led the main force to storm the centre of the town. When the bulk of the rebel forces attempted to make a break for the road, abandoning the settlement, they ran directly into Stremkovsky's outriders. When he demanded help from Ibrahim Bek's forces, well positioned from the high ground in the town to pin these rebel columns down and reinforce his cavalry, he was rebuffed, with Ibrahim Bek claiming that the majority of the rebels remained in the town. While his forces went door to door, looting and burning homes, Stremkovsky was forced to retreat his blocking position, allowing the rebels to escape south to the Zeravshan River, where they were able to regroup and disembark to Samarkand.\n\nStremkovsky is furious, and has already resigned his command, leaving the field to presumably return to Moscow. Of course, his anger is balanced only by his shame at a defeat against disorganised rebels, and luckily he has declined to turn this nightmare situation into an international incident. For his part, Ibrahim Bek continues to maintain that the main body of the rebel force was eliminated by his soldiers in the town, and that Stremkovsky was routed by a small contingent of fighters, a statement which has done little to improve relations with Colonel Iskander."
 cacrisis.420.a: "What was he thinking!?"

 cacrisis.421.t: "Arrogance of the Atalyk"
 cacrisis.421.d: "Having heard of the deliberative process which has brought him into his current position as sole leader of the Bukharan host, Ibrahim Bek has clearly allowed our recent snub of Russian officers in favour of his leadership to go to his head. It appears that built up resentment has boiled over into court behaviour, as our Atalyk has purposefully disregarded and ignored a number of comments and suggestions from various members of our administration, often missing important and valuable information and aid. Additionally, he has managed to anger a number of key figures, leading some minor nobles to go as far as to leave the capital, returning to their estates with excuses of injury or illness.\n\nThis issue has gone as far as to reach the ears of the Emir, who has personally gone to meet with the Atalyk about his antagonistic, arrogant, and high-handed behaviour. Whatever occurred in that conversation, it did not seem to be overly effective in damping down Ibrahim Bek's negative behaviour. Of course, to Ibrahim Bek's credit, the court is filled with some of the thinnest skinned nobles, councillors, and bureaucrats found within our region. Regardless, every day new figures are offended or alienated from our cause, weakening our forces and thus strengthening the enemy."
 cacrisis.421.a: "Does he not see that he is hurting our cause?"

 cacrisis.422.t: "Filling the Jail Cells"
 cacrisis.422.d: "It was not exactly surprising to us that our recent actions regarding Samarkand would trigger some protests from those upset with our government, and just as we expected there were some concerted efforts to organise mass demonstrations against our handling of the brewing Samarkand Crisis. These demonstrations were directed specifically towards Ibrahim Bek, who has been given the moniker, “the Butcher of Bukhara” and who has been lambasted by these protestors.\n\nIn response, Ibrahim Bek has expertly cracked down on these protesters, sweeping the streets and jailing a number of ‘leading agitators' and dispersing crowds through beatings and threats of gunfire. In this operation, Ibrahim Bek has proven his capabilities as a military leader, with his response expertly executed using a number of units in coordination to box in and corral the protestors into manageable groups, while preventing the escalation of these protests into a full blown revolution.\n\nUnfortunately, while the arrests were successful in practice, they have caused serious issues for our government: our jailhouses are full, and more importantly this has significantly damaged our government's reputation. Some merchants and socialites uninvolved in the protests were roughed up by our forces during the crack down, and others have close allies among our political elite and our allies in Russia, who have already filed formal complaints against our actions. Additionally, our government has been rocked by sweeping unrest and threats of mass protest (of those remaining out of prison) forcing us to pull significant forces to maintain the rule of law. Additionally, many of those freed will likely leave to join the rebel cause in one way or another, regardless of their position prior to their violent arrest at the hands of our soldiers."
 cacrisis.422.a: "I suppose we were simply too effective at dealing with these dissidents."

 cacrisis.424.t: "A Long Day in [GetMonth]"
 cacrisis.424.d: "As the negotiations between Samarkand and Bukhara dragged on, so too did the anger brewing in the hearts of the young officers of the rapidly expanding Bukharan army. Their leader, second only to God, was the great warrior Ibrahim Bek, just in his cruelty, wise in his dogma, and generous to all those he felt shared in his frenetic commitment to the tenets of Islam and his duties to the Emir. The Atalyk, father to all the nation, the Emir included, was a guiding light for those who had once found themselves tempted by the siren's call of western imperialist thinking - the decadence and hedonistic obsession of the European courts. Where the progressives offered confusion and anger - all aimed at addling the minds of the young so that they may be corrupted - the Atalyk offered true certainty. Certainty of mind, certainty of body, and certainty of action.\n\nThe traitors in Samarkand needed to be destroyed. Those weak enough to be convinced by devils' words to support these traitors must also be destroyed. The whole of Central Asia needed to be cleansed of the rot and filth which had taken root, imported by Russian masters in an effort to further chain their Turkic slaves. Thousands may need to die for this cause, but they will die as martyrs, in the service of a better and brighter realm.\n\nThe young officers worked tirelessly - officials would be assassinated, noble generals lost in ‘accidents,' and activists publically strung up. The revolution in Bukhara would not come from the disease of the left, but from the medicine of the right - the righteous followers of Ibrahim Bek.\n\nWhen the cards had all been aligned, and the pieces put into careful order, the last order was given - throw the Kushbeggi from his lofty post and sequester the Emir, so that he may be shielded from those who would wish him harm with weapons and words alike."
 cacrisis.424.a: "The sun rises over a new Bukhara."

 cacrisis.425.t: "Ibrahim Bek Prepares a Host"
 cacrisis.425.d: "While the Kushbeggi and his allies have been successful in convincing the Emir to attempt negotiations with the envoys from Samarkand, that has not stopped the Atalyk from assembling a host of warriors under his command. Those within the Kushbeggi's camp wonder whether he is rebelling against the orders of the Emir like a petulant child, or if instead he received a whispered order from Alim Khan following his public repudiation - to serve as a secondary option should talks fail, but also as a threat to hang over the heads of all of those men negotiating in the palace - both the Samarkanders and the Kushbeggi.\n\nRegardless, Ibrahim Bek has made great progress in assembling an army, and has begun drilling his men relentlessly. He acts as though the negotiations have already fallen through, as if he has the power to will our failure into reality. Should his dreams come true, he will certainly have a formidable host at his disposal, handbuilt by his allies and underlings, and loyal only to himself and the Emir. In the meantime, we will simply endeavour to reach some sort of accord with the people of Samarkand, a proposition which looks harder and harder by the minute, made no easier by the looming threat of Ibrahim Bek's growing encampment."
 cacrisis.425.a: "We work in the shadow of butchers."

 cacrisis.426.t: "Negotiations Drag On"
 cacrisis.426.d: "The unfortunate truth is that if a wound is left to fester for years, even the most concerted efforts to heal the damage dealt may prove unsuccessful. The people of Samarkand have lived as second class citizens in the Emirate for nearly a decade, watching as their wealth funded extravagant projects in Bukhara, while their infrastructure grew old and their leaders grew weary of empty promises. By now, the people of Samarkand have compiled a list of demands which can only be described as ‘unrealistic,' and they have proven themselves to be stubborn negotiators.\n\nThey act like they hold all of the cards, making bombastic demands and refusing any reasonable compromise, demanding the lasting empowerment of their city duma over our governor, the creation of an independent Samarkand army, and the release of the city from most of their financial obligations to the Emirate. Yet their comrades cower behind the walls of Samarkand, awaiting a very real response from a very real army bent on crushing their little insurrection!\n\nDo they not know that we are the only thing keeping the Atalyk's vast host from bearing down on their homes? Do they really think that their stubbornness and inability to see reason will save them from the headsman's block? Perhaps they wish to be martyrs - a wish that Ibrahim Bek and the Emir will be happy to oblige. If they have a deathwish, I just wish they would drag us down with them!"
 cacrisis.426.a: "We've tied ourselves to madmen, clearly."

 cacrisis.427.t: "A Bloody Conclusion"
 cacrisis.427.d: "The negotiations of the last few days had looked promising, and after weeks of circular conversations and missteps, serious efforts to find common ground and foundations for agreement had begun in Bukhara. While there were some concerns over the ground which was given by the Kushbeggi's men, the general consensus in the room was that the door was finally and truly open to a reorganisation of the relationship between the Emir and his subjects in Samarkand, and that there was hope for a successful conclusion to our weeks of hard work. Perhaps it was the growing desire among those who had assembled to truly make a change in the way the peoples of Central Asia dealt with one another, or perhaps it was the growing fear of the Atalyk's ever increasing power and rabid demands for military intervention, but whatever drove them, on this sunny morning the assembled envoys and diplomats began to feel hope.\n\nThe negotiating room fell silent suddenly, as all present suddenly became aware of the resounding silence of the square outside. The cries of the bazaar hawkers, the calls of the city birds, and the mirthful squeals of children had been replaced with the quiet and rhythmic shuffle of footsteps, like the rolling patter of a muffled marching drum. Some of the assembled figures stood to go to the windows, looking for any sort of explanation for the phenomenon, but did not make it, intercepted by the bombastic entrance of a dozen soldiers into the room, brandishing rifles and sabres and screaming orders at the diplomats and bureaucrats assembled before them. The envoys from Samarkand were separated from their Bukharan counterparts, and arrayed against the far wall. After some terse deliberation, a couple of Bukharan natives were roughly thrown into their midst, selected seemingly at random by the tallest and loudest of the interloping soldiers. The remaining Bukharan negotiators were forced out of the room by a pair of guards, and as the door was shut behind them the reverb of a hail of gunfire shook the building.\n\nOn the streets, the criers shouted in unison - Samarkand had sent spies and saboteurs into our city, aiming to destroy our Emirate from within. It was only the bravery and genius of the Atalyk which saved the realm, purging out the foreign poison and the native rot which was infected by it, and it is only the Atalyk who can now lead the Emirate to victory. He will march on Samarkand, and exact our collective revenge for the evil and underhanded acts of these devilish rogues."
 cacrisis.427.a: "We march for order and peace!"

 cacrisis.428.t: "Protecting our Flank"
 cacrisis.428.d: "While our focus is set squarely on the growing insurgency in Samarkand, we must remain vigilant of the danger posed by Junaid Khan's regime in Khiva. Khiva is nominally an ally of Russia, bound by the same treaties of friendship and cooperation that have tied us to Moscow since our formal independence in 1918. However, the Turkmen dictator of Khiva has been anything but loyal, repeatedly attempting to expand his realm and leverage his independence at the expense of us, the Alash Autonomy, and Russia itself. Junaid Khan's lands are close enough to our capital that, should he know that our flank is undefended, we would be at serious risk of a raid upon our capital itself.\n\nThe only real defence against his manoeuvres is the Amu Darya and Zeravshan Rivers, which would bottleneck any attempted raid by forcing Junaid Khan to cross at a few key points. Our military planners have pointed to the crossing at the town of Chardzhuy as a viable point to fortify to slow or stop Junaid Khan's advance. However, pulling any units to Chardzhuy would weaken our main host, threatening to undercut our efforts to bring the rebel city to heel, just to sit and watch a river. Most figures agree that while Junaid Khan is a warmonger and an opportunist, he is also cautious, and was repeatedly humbled by smaller forces during the Civil War and Tashkent Crisis, perhaps stemming the tide of his bloodlust."
 cacrisis.428.a: "Post a fresh brigade on the bridge."
 cacrisis.428.b: "Junaid Khan is far too cautious."

 cacrisis.429.t: "An Opportunity in Bukhara"
 cacrisis.429.d: "Words on the wind proclaim that the Bukharans have lost their grip on Samarkand - the crown jewel of Central Asia. While the Emir and his cronies scramble to gather some sort of army to recapture their ill-gained territory, the focus of the Bukharan court shifts precipitously eastward, revealing an exceptional opportunity for us. With the entire Bukharan war machine aimed toward Samarkand, the back door to the Emirate has been left wholly unguarded, and our scouts and spies report that a raid deep into their rich territories will go largely unopposed. A number of our chiefs, led by Serdar Oraz Geldy Khan, have already begun assembling an expedition of hardened riders, well-equipped to move quickly through the lightly defended hamlets and villages of the western Emirate. Should they be successful in their endeavours, they will lightly return to our lands with exceptional wealth and new found glory for our realm.\n\nOf course, we must weigh the temptation of our success against the dangers such a manoeuvre will pose. Should the defences of Bukhara be more formidable than expected, or - even worse - should the Bukharans be laying a trap, the losses could be severe. If we are successful, we may be able to simply walk away wealthier and otherwise untouched - the Bukharans will likely back down from an open confrontation, and the Russians will be forced to accept it as a ‘tussle between the backwaters.' But should we fail, we would invite a military response from Bukhara, or even Russia, and have nothing to show for our losses."
 cacrisis.429.a: "Pull together a band to test these Bukharan waters."
 cacrisis.429.b: "We cannot risk entanglement in this brewing stagmire."

 cacrisis.430.t: "A Prickly Reception from the Khans"
 cacrisis.430.d: "Following our decision to not press the opening presented by the rebellion at Samarkand to humiliate and humble the Bukharans, a number of Turkmen Khans, led by Oraz Geldy Serdar, have demanded a meeting with Junaid Khan. While these Khans know that any should any individual chief openly disrespect Junaid Khan, they will be met with anger and violence, by meeting with Khiva's de-facto ruler as a united front they were able to action their will.\n\nThese men have been adamant that we march on Bukhara, claiming that this is the best and only opportunity to leverage a real advantage against the Emir and his forces. Even Aziz Khan, normally the voice of caution and reason, has been supportive of an intervention - especially in consideration of our new alliance with Turkestan, who appears to be interested in their own expedition into Samarkand. It appears that though we will remain aloof for the moment, we will have to commit soon towards a grand raid on Bukhara, if only to keep the chiefs in line."
 cacrisis.430.a: "Hopefully a few of the louder ones will die on the battlefield!"

 cacrisis.431.t: "Junaid Khan Rebuffed at Chardzhuy"
 cacrisis.431.d: "Like a wolf drawn to the scent of wounded prey, Junaid Khan saw our predicament, committed to an intervention against the Turkestani puppets in the east, as the perfect opportunity to hone his edge and fill his coffers. The Turkmen general clearly saw us as an easy target for his band of raiding riders, expecting next to no resistance to a lightning fast attack on our flank. What he was not expecting, however, were the newly built fortifications at the Chardzhuy crossing. Our machineguns ripped through his outriders, forcing him to withdraw and regroup, and stemming the tide of his attack deep into our territory. While the villages of the borderlands still burn and Junaid Khan returns to Khiva laden-heavy with our property - he has received a bloody nose he'll not soon forget. Regardless, we cannot afford to let this transgression go unpunished. We will have to defeat Junaid Khan and bring him to justice for his banditry, right after we deal with the rebellious Samarkanders and the Turkestani dogs who are bankrolling them."
 cacrisis.431.a: "The next time he comes, he will not return home."

 cacrisis.432.t: "Junaid Khan Raids Bukharan Outskirts"
 cacrisis.432.d: "While the bulk of our forces were committed to heroic pacification of the east, the monstrous Turkmen raiders of Khiva used our moment of weakness to sweep over our largely undefended western borderlands. Without any serious obstacles to block their advance, they looted several villages in the hinterlands and, most importantly, a few hamlets in the shadow of Bukhara itself. The Emir has grown increasingly paranoid that the capital is under threat, calling for the recall of some elements of our grand host to reinforce this flank and refusing to leave the confines of the Ark of Bukhara - the formidable fortress at the heart of the city. While the damage to our lands is immense, the damage to our credibility is immeasurable, and we cannot afford to let this transgression go unpunished. We will have to defeat Junaid Khan and bring him to justice for his banditry, right after we deal with the rebellious Samarkanders and the Turkestani dogs who are bankrolling them."
 cacrisis.432.a: "Can we not just catch a break?"

 cacrisis.433.t: "Victories in Bukhara!"
 cacrisis.433.d: "Our raid against the exposed Bukharan flank, the brainchild of our genius Serdar Karim, has gone off without a hitch. We met next to no resistance in the villages, and were able to act with impunity throughout the western reaches of the Emirate, carving a path through the Emir's lands all the way up to the gates of Bukhara. When the city shot back at us, we returned to our homes, laden with gold and loot from the numerous villages and hamlets we put to the torch. While we have long been assured of Bukhara's weakness, the sheer degree of vulnerability put on display these last few days has been staggering. Judging by their response to our attack, a concerted effort to crack open the walls of Bukhara would likely prove successful if we assembled a genuine army, rather than a raiding party.\n\nWhile we may be slightly leary about committing to a full-scale invasion of Bukhara, we have already committed our forces against them, and should they survive their battle against Samarkand, they will likely turn back to punish us for our movements against them. Why not, then, eliminate the Bukharans while they are weak?"
 cacrisis.433.a: "Onwards, for gold, glory, and God!"

 cacrisis.434.t: "Our Raid Rebuffed"
 cacrisis.434.d: "While our raid against Bukhara initially bore significant fruit, we were unable to crack through their defences at the Chardzhuy river crossing. We have returned to Khiva, our band laden heavy with loot gathered from the outlying villages, and must now decide our next steps. The truth is, we did not expect to get as far as Chardzhuy before meeting any real resistance from the Emirate -  and the weakness of the Emir's army has shocked even the most optimistic of our chiefs. Now, there is a concerted push among the Turkmen Khans for us to regather our forces into a genuine army, and to march on Bukhara not as raiders, but as conquerors!\n\nWhile we may be slightly leary about committing to a full-scale invasion of Bukhara, we have already committed our forces against them, and should they survive their battle against Samarkand, they will likely turn back to punish us for our movements against them. Why not, then, eliminate the Bukharans while they are weak?"
 cacrisis.434.a: "Onwards, for gold, glory, and God!"

 cacrisis.435.t: "Khiva Marches Against Us"
 cacrisis.435.d: "A flurry of reports have reached us from our outposts in the west - a massive host of riders is assembling on our border with Khiva, led by the dog-general Junaid Khan. It is becoming increasingly clear that these men are not preparing for a raid - no, they are gathering to march on our lands as conquerors. We will need to muster up whatever forces we can afford to stem the tide of their assault, to man the walls and the guard posts, to fight against this apocalyptic scourge to the last man. The warriors of Khiva are devils in disguise, and Junaid Khan is their satanic ringleader - our battle against them is a fight against evil itself. We will not let these dogs of war tread freely on the soil we call home, but instead face and fight them at every turn and every opportunity."
 cacrisis.435.a: "We fight for his glory, and for our survival!"

 cacrisis.436.t: "The Grand Host Marches on Samarkand"
 cacrisis.436.d: "The grand host assembled in the farmlands surrounding Samarkand is unlike any which has been seen in Central Asia for years - a massive collection of militias, soldiers, and tribal levies, all under the watchful command of our loyal Atalyk, who leads vigorously from his tent in the centre of this enormous and unwieldy collection of military power. While our assembled army is neither cohesive nor disciplined, it remains an impressive display our our resources and resolve, a veritable horde of fighters committed to our cause.\n\nWith these resources available to him, Ibrahim Bek could easily surround Samarkand and choke the city through a siege - the sheer size of his forces would allow us to block off each of the paths in and out of the ancient city without fear of being locally overwhelmed by the meagre rebel forces. However, Ibrahim Bek is keen to put our might in full display by bottling up the defenders before moving into the streets, smoking out all resistance and taking back the city in a resounding assault. It is not just pride that guides him - a lengthy siege would attract the attention of Junaid Khan and Madamin Bek, who watch with opportunistic eyes on our borders, and would additionally do much to provoke anger and disappoint in our Russian friends, as their interests in the city would be irreparably damaged by the starvation and destruction of a long-maintained encirclement.\n\nThere is no time now for regrets for what led us here - either our host will break the will of the rebels or be shattered upon the great bulwark of Samarkand. We have full faith in our commanders and our soldiers, and our spirits are buoyed by the knowledge that our cause is pious and true. It is the will of heaven that the wayward souls of our realm be brought back into the fold!"
 cacrisis.436.a: "The die is cast!"

 cacrisis.437.t: "Victory at Samarkand"
 cacrisis.437.d: "On the day of the assault on Samarkand our forces availed themselves beautifully on the battlefield! Fierce fighting in the streets of the New City tempered our initial push, but small victories on the side streets allowed us to outpace the defenders, cutting off a pocket of defenders near the old Russian embassy. Our artillery, covered by the bulk of our army, made short work of the western gatehouse, giving us the path into the heart of their fortifications. To the east, a local rout towards the north of the city allowed a significant number of our forces to storm the eastern walls, forcing a disorganised defence from rapidly mobilised red militias. With their units scattered and their defenders confused, Ibrahim Bek made the decisive decision to push for Registan Square, capturing the heart of the city and further cutting the pockets of resistance off from one another. Realising their defeat, a number of units to the north retreated through the northern gates, fleeing in towards Turkestan in the shadow of the Zeravshan Mountains - we can only hope that the force we sent northward will intercept them on the far side of the mountains. Regardless of this minuscule hiccup, the rest of the assault went off without a hitch, as the last vestiges of rebel resistance were crushed and smoked out by our numerically superior and better equipped soldiers. With our victory secure, the men have taken to some mild looting - a reasonable impulse and a fitting reward for their brilliant victory today!"
 cacrisis.437.a: "Let us press our advantage!"

 cacrisis.438.t: "Siege of Samarkand Drags On"
 cacrisis.438.d: "While our assault on Samarkand initially bore great fruit, heavy resistance in the streets of the New City forced us to slow our advance and regroup in the outskirts of the city proper. Unsurprisingly, based on their socialist heritage, these militias were well fit for street warfare. This city is their home, and they took great advantage of their knowledge of the twisting alleyways and hidden paths to ambush our forces in the flanks. In the east, our harrying forces were forced to withdraw from the field following unexpectedly high losses against the garrisoned forces patrolling the eastern wall. With our position in the New City threatened by their barricades and counterattacks, we had no viable position to set up our artillery, forcing us to pull them back from the field. With our victory in the east delayed by their unexpected resistance, Ibrahim Bek has determined that we will need to reposition our guns onto the northern highlands and reform our main thrust of attack to reflect this new orientation. While our victory is all but assured, we will simply need a couple of weeks to bring our artillery to bear."
 cacrisis.438.a: "These setbacks will not demoralise us!"

 cacrisis.439.t: "Siege of Samarkand Stalls Out"
 cacrisis.439.d: "While our assault on Samarkand initially bore great fruit, heavy resistance in the streets of the New City forced us to slow our advance and regroup in the outskirts of the city proper. Unsurprisingly, based on their socialist heritage, these militias were well fit for street warfare. This city is their home, and they took great advantage of their knowledge of the twisting alleyways and hidden paths to ambush our forces in the flanks. In fact, they inflicted irreparable damage to our forces following a false withdrawal of their defenders, drawing our units away from our increasingly vulnerable artillery, which was slowly moving forward behind our advance. Once they had a clear window, the Red dogs struck out from the flanks, surprising the wings of our assault and allowing the rebels to destroy a number of our larger artillery, removing our ability to crush their defences with our long range guns. Without our heavy artillery, we cannot break their walls without unacceptable losses, forcing us to pull back from the city so that we can reorient our army to prepare a long siege. While the failure of our first attack is disappointing, we still have the initiative - we can always look for a new approach to strike at the heart of Samarkand. Even if we cannot find an opening, the defenders have nothing to look forward to but slow starvation in their doomed city."
 cacrisis.439.a: "We must regroup and attack!"

Once they had a clear window, the Red dogs struck out from the flanks, surprising the wings of our assault and managing a breakthrough towards our rear. While their target became clear when they destroyed some of our more heavy artillery, they soon realised the strength of their new position, digging in to split a significant chunk of our frontline units off from the bulk of our lines, before they constricted our pocket until its effective elimination. It was only with the courage of Ibrahim Bek, who led a bold series of revitalising cavalry counter-charges, that our trapped army was not entirely broken, and our commander was able to reconnect our forces before we completely lost the field. Regardless of our eventual victory in the New City, with the tip of the spear shattered we are not only unable to push forward, but may, in fact, need to pull back. It appears that the forces in Samarkand are significantly stronger than our reports indicated, and should they bring their forces to bear against ours now we may be forced to cede the field."

 cacrisis.443.t: "Samarkand Exiles Call for Aid"
 cacrisis.443.d: "As we expected, the Bukharan Emir and his violent toadies have put the beautiful city of Samarkand to the torch at the first sign of any spirit of revolution. Their brutality on the streets of the ancient city have shocked even the most cynical members of our government - with many demanding answers as to why our armies were not stationed within the rebel city to protect them from Ibrahim Bek and the devils he rides with, who looted and burned their way through the greatest jewel of Central Asia. Obviously, we have placed great stock into the revolutionaries in Samarkand, funding and supplying these valiant freedom fighters throughout the last year as conflict between the city and Bukhara itself became more and more certain. While we are disappointed by Bukhara's victory in the city, the question remains as to what the next steps our government will take to respond to this wanton destruction and aggression over our borders.\n\nA large band of remnant Samarkand revolutionaries, having escaped from the north of the city following the encirclement of the Samarkand Citadel, have since arrived in Kokand, seeking aid and retribution for their cause. While they have received exceptional support from the populace in Kokand and Tashkent, as well as the personal support of a number of Kurbashi leaders (especially those who were exiled from the Samarkand region in 1929), there is little our government can do now aside from the wholesale invasion of Bukhara. Such a manoeuvre would be incredibly risky - certain to provoke the ire of Moscow and not guaranteed to quickly succeed. However, ignoring our new guests would be domestically dangerous, as the Bukharan treatment of Samarkand and her citizens has shaken the political order of our republic, and the vast majority of our population are hungry for the Emir's head, propelled in part by years of Pan-Turkist and anti-Bukharan language. It will be impossible to thread the needle - we will have to commit to a forceful position one way or another."

 cacrisis.444.d: "As the situation between the Emir's government and the people of Samarkand has worsened, we have paid increasing attention to the building revolutionary movement in the city and the brutal and violent Bukharan responses to their calls for liberty. Most recently, our reports have painted out a great Bukharan siege of the city - which has held out valiantly in spite of Bukharan bombardment and attempted assaults. While the citizens of Samarkand are keen to keep their city and their heads, it is only a matter of time before they run out of ammunition and food and are slowly ground down by the overwhelming numbers of the attacking host. The revolutionary militias will need more than a cause worth fighting for if they should hope to win against the onslaught they face today.\n\nThere is a huge movement within our republic to intervene in Samarkand to break the Bukharan siege and save the Samarkand rebels - stemming both from those ideologically driven to the defence of these patriots as well as from those who see this as a perfect opportunity to devastate the Bukharans and expand our sphere of influence, while maintaining a relatively low profile. A battle against the Bukharans in Bukhara would certainly get the attention of their Russian overlords, but it is possible that a battle on the outskirts of Samarkand, which is fighting for their mere survival against Bukharan aggression, would place the Russians into a bind should they wish to intervene. Of course, there is also a contingent of our regime who hope, either secretly or loudly, that our intervention would provoke the Russians. If they are right, we would certainly want to hurry - we will need the help of every man holding the walls of Samarkand if we should hope to face the might of the Russian army. Then again, we can always back down from this Bukharan aggression so that we may better prepare for conflict, though there may not be a better opportunity than the one in front of us today."

Most recently, our reports have painted out a great Bukharan siege of the city - which has held out valiantly in spite of Bukharan bombardment and attempted assaults. In fact, against all odds, the people of Samarkand have managed to outmanoeuvre and outfight the Bukharans, knocking the Emirate's monumental host off balance and forcing their embarrassing withdrawal from the region.\n\nThere is a huge movement within our republic to intervene in Bukhara, pressing the advantage built by the blood, sweat, and tears of the brave defenders of Samarkand to finally crush the Emir. For years, the Emir and his cronies have dominated the region, leading hundreds to flee their homes to join our republic. These exiles have formed the nucleus of a stalwart anti-Bukharan bloc of intellectuals, Kurbashi, and merchants - with significant influence within the party and our government. They are, of course, joined by the Pan-Turkists and the militants, both who feel our position is inherently threatened by Bukharan-Russian coordination. They see Bukhara as the lynchpin of a developing Russian plan to invade and destroy our republic, and feel that our best course of action would be to strike first against the rotten Emirate.\n\nOf course, any sort of attack against Bukhara would be certain to invoke the ire of Moscow - after all, they do not wish to lose their last remaining loyal asset in the region. While most recognise the danger such an intervention thus poses, there is a contingent of our regime who hope, either secretly or loudly, that our intervention will actually provoke the Russians into an unpopular attack against us and our allies. Of course, we can always back down from this Bukharan aggression so that we may better prepare for conflict, though there may not be a better opportunity than the one in front of us today."

 cacrisis.446.d: "It was by no means an easy choice for Madamin Bek to hold back from intervening into the conflagration in Samarkand - the opportunity presented by the battle at the walls of the ancient city was buttressed only by the danger and intervention would pose to all of the well laid plans that Turketan had laid among the Kazakhs and Khivas for more than a year. Should our republic spring the trap of Samarkand, we would risk giving the Russians a genuine reason to march against us, and an excuse for our allies in Khivan and Alash lands to abandon our cause with good cause.\n\nOf course, the people of Turkestan do not see it this way - for the first time in ages, the whole of the party is united behind the cause of the Samarkand revolutionaries, demanding action from their president. The unfortunate truth is that Madamin Bek's position is held in place by his role as a bridge between the disparate wings of the Union of Muslims - should these factions join forces against him, there is precious little he can do to resist their demands. However, he can always expend some of his personal authority and spend his precious political good will to buy some time and prepare properly to make a definitive decision on the matter of Bukharan intervention."

The mere idea of these men agreeing on a course of action is unimaginable outside of the intermittent nightmare which plagued Madamin Bek.\n\nOf course, our recent decision to delay any sort of Turkestani intervention into the fighting between the rebels of Samarkand and the Bukharan Emir has managed to do the impossible, and today these men stand before the Amir ul-Musliman demanding action. Each man approaches the issue from their own angle: intervention is the best course for destroying the Emirate, the people of Samarkand deserve to be free, our interests are intertwined with Samarkand, there is gold and glory to be found in western Bukhara. However, the refrain was the same among them all - should the President not act in the interest of the rebels in Samarkand and the people of Turkestan, they would be forced to call into question the President's position as the defender of Central Asian liberty and the leader of the great Turkestani experiment. While no man is willing to outright say it, the message is clear - either Madamin Bek will lead an intervention against Bukhara, or the men assembled will find a man who will."

Just as we expected, the Turkestanis have begun mobilising on the borders, gathering their Kurbashi bandit bands to prepare for a grandiose raid against us. With our fight against our own people settled, for better or for worse, the time has come to turn to Moscow for aid - our independence is worth nothing if the Ark is torn asunder by Turkestani soldiers. We will send a band north to call for Russian aid, praying that they are able to push through the now hostile lands surrounding us to reach our allies in the Alash Autonomy. In the meantime, we will need to steel our resolve and array our forces to defend against this new attack on the very heart of our nation. This is a fight for the very survival of our nation, but also our only opportunity to face our longstanding enemy in battle.

His so-called Republic of Turkestan, little more than a den of snakes and bandits, tried their hand at conquering Samarkand nearly a decade ago, and has spent the years since their defeat seething. Recent insurrectionary action among the Kazakhs has also been linked to Turkestani efforts to undermine our administration and foment revolt, protected only by the thin veneer of plausible deniability. This most recent insult is the final straw.\n\nSamarkand is guarded by Emir Alim Khan, our closest ally in the region, but his position is shaky and he will not be able to hold out against the Turkestanis on his own. It would be politically unacceptable to allow the petty warlord of Tashkent to get away with destroying the greatest stronghold of Russian support in the region without a military response.\n\nWe began preparing for an intervention against Turkestan since they first rose up against us years ago, and it would not be difficult for us to move up our planning, starting the invasion prematurely. While some are concerned that without proper logistical support our attack may be ineffective, General-Fieldmarshal [RUS_GetArmyChief] has repeatedly demanded a green light for an immediate invasion."

 cacrisis.450.d.khi: "Reports from the north have confirmed our worst fears: the Russian government, likely spurred on by its powerful military leadership, has committed to an intervention to support the government of Bukhara's corpulent Emir. While such an intervention was not unheard of, we had hoped that our own special relationship with the Russian government would lend us some cover from their proposed intervention. It appears that this hope was misplaced, as the Russians have no desire to spare us following our recent diplomatic spats over the forced retirement of General Zaytsev, and the subsequent escalation over Russian influence in our government. It has become increasingly clear that Moscow was more than happy to stoke tensions between our nations, giving them the justifications necessary to move against us in violation of their own treaties - after all, a treaty is only as good as the paper it's written on.\n\nNow that the Russians are mobilizing in the border provinces, we will have no option but to cash in on the secret agreements we forged with the Turkestan Republic, who is similarly threatened by Russian invasion. They have called for an emergency meeting between leading figures in our khanate, the Kazakh conspiracy, and their republic in the town of Pishpek to plan our responses and defenses. While we are not exactly thrilled to tie ourselves at the hip to another nation, we have little other choice but to play ball, strengthening our position so that we may better petition Germany and the Ottomans for aid, and to give us more leverage to negotiate a (hopefully) rapid peace with Moscow."

While such an intervention was not unheard of, Russian hesitation in 1929 had given us the impression that they would likely pull back from muddling in Central Asian affairs, especially with Germany watching them closely. Then again, perhaps it was the embarrassment of ‘29 which now drives the Russian General Staff forward at an alarming pace, as generals seek to undo the mistakes of their predecessors.

 cacrisis.451.d: "The city of Samarkand is built on the bones of civilisations long dead and forgotten, leaving the ghostly ruins of the past as reminders of its former glory. The ruins of the old city walls stand about two miles west of the city proper, and it was here that our host first met concerted resistance. After less than a day of fighting the rebels were forced to withdraw, opening the way to Samarkand for our host. Ibrahim Bek has positioned the majority of his army in the old city ruins, sending one smaller contingent to secure the southern roads and another to trek around the great Zeravshan Mountain Range to block off the city from the east.\n\nIbrahim Bek's plan for the assault on Samarkand is straightforward, if not slightly unwieldy. He will send the thrust of his forces in the shadow of the Russian Quarter and New City, denying his opponents a clear line of sight to fire upon him from the city walls, while his southern force advances up Timur's Road to pressure the vast southeastern stretch of Samarkand's walls and block off the easiest route of retreat. Once artillery can be brought forward into defensive positions in the New City, Ibrahim Bek would be able to begin his assault on the Citadel, breaching the walls at the point closest to the fortress and catching the enemy off balance. While the walls of Samarkand stood tall against countless invaders, they are no match for modern, Russian-made cannonry. Meanwhile, the southern force will launch harrying attacks on the eastern walls, drawing fire away from the Citadel and Registan Square, and  testing for any weakness which could be exploited into a second breach.\n\nWhile he had initially hoped to regroup in the old city for some time to fully gather our army and prepare for the assault, reports of the possibility of a Turkestani mobilisation from our spies in Tashkent lit a roaring fire beneath Ibrahim Bek and his subordinates. They will launch the assault on the morrow, while our host still has the initiative."

The nobles and commanders met and argued over maps, while the merchants desperately attempted to sell the last of their wares so that they could flee to more peaceful lands. Families rushed to collect food - any food - which they could expect to last. This was not Bukhara's first war in living memory, and everyone knew better than to believe the Emir's claims that his armies would bring victory within the week.\n\nAt the height of this week of madness, Ibrahim Bek rode and ran through the city like a madman - seemingly simultaneously at every camp and chamber, demanding excellence from all those around him. More than anything else, he went to survey small bands of his soldiers, speaking to them of the righteousness of their cause and their duty to God to ride behind him. The soldiers clamoured for his attention, basking in the glow of his view and the conviction of his voice, crawling over one another to catch sight of him, to speak to him, to touch his saddle. Until suddenly, the soldiers who were once prostrated before him sprang after him, knives in hand, slashing at the general like men possessed. They called out: “Death to Ibrahim Bek! Death to the Emir!” The general, a once godly figure, fled the square, uncertain on his horse, bleeding from a number of shallow wounds, and crying out for the death of his assailants.\n\nWhen the spell was shattered, the square erupted into violence as the mass of soldiery grappled the would-be assassins, gutting them on the spot with bayonets and parading their corpses through the square, loudly proclaiming that the enemy was among them, that the socialist and the heathen would be found and eliminated, and that Samarkand would burn. Ibrahim Bek may have been shaken by this attempt on his life, but he is anything but discouraged, demanding that reports be brought to his bedside, and that he still be allowed to lead the forces of Bukhara against the men who would have him killed. If anything, he is fuelled by newfound rage, driving him forward against these godless socialist dogs."

Yet even the finest army could not stand against the odds arrayed against us.

The options were simple: win or die.\n\nWhile the main thrust of Madamin Bek's message is old news to Aziz Khan, the meeting has provided for interesting discussion among the various Kurbashi commanders and militia leaders within the different camps. Of most interest to Aziz Khan were the Kazakhs, who promised that serious Kazakh insurgent action will disrupt and slow Russian advances. They are prepared to generate significant protests in major Kazakh cities to disrupt Russian mobilization, stopping trains and holding up convoys with the sheer mass of anti-Russian sentiment recently inflamed by renewed Cossack settlement within the Alash Autonomy. Additionally, they intend to sabotage Russian shipping and logistics, drawing soldiers away from the front to police the Autonomy, all while maintaining the ‘innocence' of the broader Kazakh militias.\n\nSuch actions would be incredibly effective in uprooting Russian power and disrupting their invasion of our lands. Of course, the Alash militias may not fully understand what they are getting themselves into: the Kazakhs remained relatively untouched by the horrors of the Civil War, prosecuting a mild pacification campaign against a smattering of red terrorists in the fringes of their realm. They do not know the Russians like we do - but they soon will. When they bomb a train line, the Muscovites will burn a village. When they riot in the cities, the Russians will not respond with words.\n\nOf course, Aziz Khan has no intention of alerting the Kazakhs of the danger they are in - the hotter the fires of the Alash Autonomy burns the better off we will be. They will certainly learn soon, we can only hope. In the meantime, we will gather our forces and prepare for our stand against the rolling tide of Russians, arm in arm with those poor fools stupid enough to have joined us in this nigh-impossible endeavour."

To maintain order, the forces of the 60th Cavalry Regiment had moved to secure the large Kazakh city of Karaganda, centered around the city’s vital rail hub which has recently become a focal point of our planned intervention south. Unfortunately, the presence of these soldiers has proven to be disastrous, as violence has erupted in the city between the cavalry and a vast mob of protestors. The agitation began peacefully, as protestors gathered outside the railyard, demanding the withdrawal of the 60th Cavalry Regiment and the release of a number of Kazakh nationalists recently jailed for anti-government actions.\n\nUnfortunately, the soldiers were unable to contain the mob, and were eventually forced to fire into the crowd, dispersing the growing riot and arresting nearly a hundred agitators, but unfortunately at the cost of the lives of six protestors who were killed in the crossfire. The relationship between our government and the Alash leadership, already strained, has been pressed to its breaking point, and the newspapers across the autonomy and its Central Asian neighbours cry out against, “the Karaganda Massacre.” The native security forces will surely be unable to handle the rising discontent, and we will likely need to reinforce our position in the autonomy by force of arms."

Dulatuly took the opportunity afforded by the session to call for Yermekov to take strong action against Moscow, releasing Kazakh political prisoners and demanding the withdrawal of all non-Kazakh soldiers, or to otherwise step down. While Dulatuly initially found support among a number of Alash delegates and threw the entirety of his political capital into the fray, Yermekov was able to maintain the support of the moderates, maintaining his grip on the party.\n\nWith Dulatuly’s gambit upset, the government has cracked down on him and his supporters, jailing Dulatuly for anti-government action and scattering a number of his closest allies. For his part, Yermekov has appealed to the unity of the Kyrgyz people, arguing that pro-Turkestani warmongering will only lead to the misery and destruction of the Kazakhs. With the Alash Party culled of its insurrectionist elements, the Autonomy’s government has completely thrown itself behind our efforts to hold the lid down on the growing insanity in the region.

Throwing the entirety of his political capital into the fray, Dulatuly was able to garner the support of just over half of the delegates present, who began demanding the resignation of Yermekov for 'neglecting his duties to protect the Constitution of the Autonomy.' For his party, Yermekov took advantage of his control over parliamentary procedure to close the assembly before a conclusive vote could be taken, locking Dulatuly and his allies out of the Assembly.\n\nThey have departed en masse towards Karaganda, where they have promised to form a rival government headed by Dulatuly. While we were able to intercept a number of these gadflies on their way to the rioting city, we will likely be unable to quash their false government without triggering a mass revolt of the Kazakh people. These insurrectionists have repeatedly voiced their support for the Alash government, but our sources indicate that they are more likely allied to Amanzholov and his separatists. It is increasingly clear that should push come to shove, a significant portion of the native Alash government will turn its back on our government and rise in support of independence."

When we began cracking down against Amanzholov and his Kazakh separatists, they largely retreated into this region, unthroning our Cossack guards with the support of their old contacts and pushing Ataman Aleksandr Ionov to retreat north to recollect his forces, losing most of his arsenal and heavy weaponry.\n\nWith the snake Mustafa Shokay’s Turkestan National Army forces marching to meet the Kazakh secessionists from the east, the two traitors have declared a new Kazakh Republic in the lands surrounding Verny. We do not have the units on hand required to crush this revolt, giving militias from across the Alash Autonomy the opportunity to rapidly organise and march to join Amanzholov and his allies in the Land of Seven Rivers.

For generations, the military of our realm has been characterised more by widespread corruption, as nepotism and outright bribery determined the composition of our leadership, and the mismanagement of our rank and file is counteracted only by their loyalty to their tribal brethren.

A little bit of the Atalyk's justice will likely scatter them, though unfortunately Ibrahim Bek himself will not be able to witness the cleansing of the streets, considering his role as the commander of our grand host. While the Emir would never admit it, he would feel considerably more comfortable if his preeminent commander was within the city – he has not seen a demonstration of this magnitude since the height of the Civil War, and then the Emirate only escaped civil war by the skin of its teeth."

In Samarkand, the butchers of Bukhara, led by the murderous chief Ibrahim Bek, has put the city to the torch, following a brutal siege of the Citadel. His horrific victory would be short lived, however, as the city of Bukhara has erupted into a full-scale leftist revolution under the leadership of Young Bukharan leader Fayzullah Khodjaev.\n\nThis leaves us in a difficult position as the remnants of the Samarkand garrison arrive in Tashkent. With the Bukharans scrambling to deal with their internal conflict, the opportunity is ripe to march back on Samarkand, securing the city for our allies and undercutting the support of the Emir and his lackeys. However, we also need to feel out the alignment of the Young Bukharans. While our allies in Samarkand assure us that they are aligned with our cause, we are deeply concerned that their hearts may instead belong to the socialist government in Moscow. Though the Russians are not their brothers, the leftists have a habit of abandoning their countrymen to join the preeminent Red power, a truth which we learned repeatedly and painfully throughout the Civil War.\n\nWe will need to feel out the newly militant Bukharan opposition. After all, we do not want to restore our left-leaning allies in power over Samarkand, only for them to pledge themselves to a Russian puppet government. Then again, there is no guarantee that the revolutionaries in Bukhara will succeed, and they may need our support to do so.

Even as the city of Bukhara erupted into a full-scale leftist revolution under the leadership of Young Bukharan leader Fayzullah Khodjaev, Ibrahim Bek and much of his host of Bukharan butchers arrayed themselves against the brave defenders of Samarkand, subjecting the city to brief siege before attempting to assault the citadel with artillery. When our allies outmanoeuvred his vanguard and forced his retreat, we celebrated a valiant victory, but none of us could have expected what came next. A small army, loyal to the upstart revolutionaries in the capital, blocked his retreat, allowing Samarkand's defenders to bear down on his rear. Pinned between the two armies, the Bukharan Atalyk's host disintegrated, abandoning their heavy weapons, ammunition, and wounded and scattering into the mountains.\n\nWhile this victory has been monumental, it has left us in a slightly awkward position. The revolutionarily aligned forces have joined with our allies, and the Samarkand government has welcomed them with open arms, while simultaneously inviting our army to reinforce their position. These leftist militias have argued that we should seize the advantage and march on Bukhara to dethrone the Emir in favour of Khodjaev and his revolutionaries, but cannot help but be somewhat weary of these socialists. While our allies in Samarkand assure us that they are aligned with our cause, we are deeply concerned that their hearts may instead belong to the socialist government in Moscow.

In fact, it appears that the host must have been pinned down by a joint socialist attack, as the revolutionaries in Samarkand joined with the godless heathens now at our gates. We can only imagine the brutality our brave and loyal soldiers faced at the hands of these godless heathens. Already, it appears that the nobles of our realm have turned on us, casting their lot with the dogs in Khiva, while the guards of the Ark slowly and silently slip away in the night.

The truth is, without the support of Moscow our regime was never going to survive in the midst of Turkestani and Khivan aggression. We are a young republic, hampered by resistance from within and without - a conservative military apparatus, low political activity among the citizens, and destructive factionalism within the government. In many ways, the one element that drove all parties forward was a faith in the superiority of our Russian allies and the inevitability of their victory, and with that shared belief stripped away the whole facade is quickly coming apart.\n\nTo the brave souls who led the charge for freedom, liberty, and equality of all men, it is hard to feel any sort of regret - they ended generations of oppression under the boot of the Manghuds, even if their experiment in socialist democracy was short lived. If only they had more time - there was so much work to be done, so many slaves to liberation, so many oppressors to dethrone. However, there was no point in dreaming of what could have been - the revolution in Bukhara was well and truly dead, choked out by Turkestani arms and Russian indifference. Regardless, the great idealists of Samarkand and Bukhara could not afford to mourn the death of their beautiful experiment - the cause would not die with them!"

While Alim Khan continues to feel confident that we could outmanoeuvre our enemies, he is merely the figurehead of a vast array of squabbling nobles and bureaucrats. In many ways, the one element that united these disparate groups was a shared faith in the superiority of our Russian allies and the inevitability of their victory, and with that shared belief stripped away it did not take long before Beys took to the hills, fighting over the scraps of a dying kingdom. At the eleventh hour, Emir Sayid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan acquiesced to his inner circle and began preparing for a flight to Afghanistan, where he could regroup and determine a next course of action.\n\nAs he boarded the coach breaking for the border, Alim Khan could not help but shed a tear for his lost homeland. As he peered back towards the palace looming on the horizon, the thought of a long exile choked him - an Emir without a homeland is pitiful and insignificant.

For every great victory the Muscovites have claimed, they have been forced to hide a hundred humiliations. Regardless of the pieces on the game boards and the lines on the map, there is no doubt that the Russians have been defeated by our forces. The world laughs at their stubborn attempts to maintain the pretenses of their imminent victory, and their people chafe against the body bags returning to their cities, as well as the news of their commanders’ failures, smuggled into their minds through foreign newspaper reports.\n\nThe Russians have offered to come to the negotiating table for a reasonable truce, and we would be fools to agitate them when they are offering us everything that we could want.

It appears that the last five or so years have been so profoundly disastrous for the Russian Army that it is unable to reclaim their government from the hands of the red radicals, and the people have been so profoundly disconnected from their political prospects that they would willingly hand away their government to a socialist dictatorship.\n\nWhether or not this development is positive or negative for us is up for debate - this new Russian government is by no means a friend of our government, seeing us as ‘backwards reactionaries' who need to be ‘liberated' by Russian colonialists. We will need to continue in our defence against the Muscovite scourge - but take into account the potential changes this ideological shift may have on our dynamic with our neighbouring countries. Most critically, the Emir of Bukhara must be absolutely quaking in his boots - bereft of allies and patrons, his weak Emirate will surely crumble in the face of any concerted opposition!"

With his support cut away, the tide appears to be shifting against our state - though hope is not all lost!

 cacrisis.581.d: "The recent rise of our socialist movement has certainly not gone unnoticed by the wider world - but we were somewhat surprised to receive a small diplomatic envoy hailing from the Emirate of Bukhara. These men were not representatives of the Emir, however, who has remained profoundly silent (likely waiting for a ‘White counterrevolution' which will never come). They instead hailed from the socialist movement in the Bukharan city of Samarkand, which has been on the receiving end of violent reactionary oppression for the last few years. While the Emir is happy to whip his subjects into some form of submission, it appears that his harsh actions have bred considerable resentment, and the underground Samarkand socialists are supported by much of their city.\n\nUnfortunately, these revolutionaries have also aligned themselves with the Samarkand's bourgeois and reactionary religious leaders, and even more concerningly with the government of conservative warlord Madamin Bek. While they have clearly suffered for their cause, their links to reactionary movements are worrying - indicative of both their limited control of the city and their ideological impurity. Of course, such shortcomings can be overlooked, and we should certainly send them home with some aid in their quest for liberation against our shared enemy in the region. The question is simply - how much?"

 cacrisis.582.d: "The position of the Officers Conspiracy in the Alash Autonomy has always been somewhat jeopardised by the broad scope of its membership. With allies among both the militias and party, there has always been plenty of potential for compromising leaks, especially considering the factionalism which has long plagued the Alash Autonomy. As the conspiracy grew in size and scope from a small cell centred around general Sadyk Amanzholov's inner circle of militia leaders into a vast web of military and government figures, the Amanzholov and his closest cronies have grown more and more concerned of the dangers of betrayal from the civilian elements of their underground movement, and more and more vocal in their opposition to a ‘broad movement.' They instead wished to silently build support among the militias, eschewing Mirzhakyp Dulatuly and his ‘Alash Patriot' faction.\n\nIt appears that these men have been proven right, as the conspiracy has been undone in days, the result of sweeping treachery among the civilian members of the independence movement. According to our sources, in the days following the rise of a socialist government in Moscow, a conspiracy had brewed within the bounds of the conspiracy, as some of Dulatuly's allies were tempted by socialist promises of sweeping and real autonomy. These lower-level members have clearly crossed over to the side of the government, and are most assuredly sharing their knowledge and information on the brewing insurrection with Alimkhan Yermekov and his new Russian overlords. Without the element of surprise, the conspiracy will need to take action immediately, or else they will certainly be choked out by Russian and Alash intervention."

 cacrisis.583.d: "Not long after we laid out our plans for extended autonomy for the Kazakh people of the Alash Autonomy, a small group of Alash officials approached us, warning of an underground movement among some Alash militia leaders who sought to overthrow the Alash government to implement a reactionary independence movement in the region. While we initially believed that this was merely the bark of a spat between Kazakh rivals, we heeded their warnings and moved to isolate and remove the figures named.\n\nIt is lucky that we moved when we did, because it appeared to catch the plotters unawares - forcing them to spring into action half-cocked. Calling for a mass revolt against what they called, ‘neo-bolshevik tyranny,' The militias, led by disgraced Kazakh military leader Sadyk Amanzholov, were almost immediately beaten back, with significant elements of the planned attack snuffed out or encircled. With our commitment to Kazakh democracy and autonomy, the people of the region, which the plotters clearly relied on for support, declined to join in this foolish and dangerous endeavour. Hopeless outmatched and outgunned, and without the support of the populace, the conspirators who survived the initial battles fled southward in droves, entering the rogue reactionary republic in Tashkent with the tacit support and approval of warlord-turned-president Madamin Bek."

Having been defeated on the battlefield, with some leaders arrested before they were able to even muster their men, these brave Kazakh patriots have fled south to our borders, seeking to join in our fight against Russian domination across Central Asia.\n\nThey are joined by Mustafa Shokay, famed leader of the Turkestan National Army, who ruled our republic from the shadows for nearly a decade, deposed by Madamin Bek's coup and exiled north. While he is a bit of a dangerous snake, he has become wholly committed to Turkestani independence in his exile, and he is a capable leader with a significant following. With his current goals aligned closely with our own, he can be trusted for the time being, though he is anything but loyal to Madamin Bek or the Union of Muslims. Regardless, his Legion, as well as Sadyk Amanzholov's militia remnants, will be critically important in our struggle against Russia. With a red flag flying over Moscow, it is only a matter of time before they will cast their eyes angrily towards our nations, proud of their Muslim traditions and the defence of liberty.

 cacrisis.585.d: "The news from the north is far from pretty - a series of purges have followed the revolution which has deposed the old ‘white' government of Russia, decapitating much of the Muscovite military leadership. While this is ultimately good for us - weakening our enemies and emboldening local ethnic Russian leaders to our cause against the Russian government -  we cannot help but feel sorrowful for those old hands of Russia who were forced into an early retirement or driven abroad. These were men who gave their lives to their home, only to be discarded, disbanded, and disappeared by a government which hated what they stood for. Today, they are largely broken, lacking the fire and spirit which carried the Russian Army through the darkest days of the Civil War.\n\nOf course, not all Russian generals have given up on their homeland. One group of exiles, under the leadership of Generals Aleksey Nikolayevich Grishin and Vladimir Sergeyevich Tolstov, have pledged themselves to our service. Ironically, they see our nation as one of the last vestiges of the White movement, though not even a year ago these same generals were likely tasked with drawing up plans to invade our nation. These men have brought with them the ‘Turkestan Volunteer Corps,' a band of exiled soldiers largely formed out of Russian Cossacks, along with some veterans of Central Asian actions in the Civil War and Tashkent Crisis. These soldiers and their leaders are experienced, but more importantly they are driven by the type of fervent and mad energy which only the nihilistic and the exiled can obtain. They will fight to the last man if it brings them any closer to restoring their homeland - after all, once you take away that hope, what reason do they have to live?"

 cacrisis.586.d: "The recent political upheaval in the capital has rippled out across our nation, uprooting a number of our commitments and forcing us to reevaluate several military and diplomatic policies and stances. In a vain attempt to prop up the oppressive government of Bukharan dictator-king Alim Khan, the previous government plunged our army into a harsh war of attrition in the steppes and deserts of Turkestan and Transcaspia. The brave young men of our nation perished in droves, all for the benefit of a foreign autocrat and the cotton barons he answered to. There is little doubt in our mind that the people of  Central Asia will one day need to be liberated of the backwards warlords and petty monarchs who rule over them, but that day simply cannot be today.\n\nOur revolution has left us with extensive military confusion and lingering questions over the trustworthiness of the present army leadership. Due to this unstable military and political situation, we have little option but to fully withdraw from the Central Asian quagmire. Perhaps in the near future we will be able to once again muster the political will and the necessary logistics to finish what our predecessors began."

 cacrisis.587.t: "The Russians Abandon Us!"
 cacrisis.587.d: "Following an unprecedented socialist revolution in the heart of Russia, and an embarrassing acquiescence of the military to these red thugs, the dynamic between our Emirate and our longstanding ally and protector has catastrophically shifted in the course of days. In a humiliating turn, the Russians have hastily negotiated a settled peace with our enemies, bowing to their weakened domestic position. While we still have hope that a White counterrevolution is just days away, and we trust that our allies within the army will once again back us, for the time being we are wholly alone, left to face our neighbours without any hope of external salvation.\n\nAlready, the mood among many in our government is dour, and our military leaders have begun preparing for a withdrawal into the southern highlands, or further yet into Afghanistan. While we have no intention of abandoning the capital, with defeatist sentiment rising, drastic action will be needed to salvage the situation."

While all present seem to know that the people of Central Asia will only remain free if they band together, no one is willing to make any sort of sacrifices to achieve that goal. For their part, the Kazakhs have expressed interest in a future together, either through alliance or unification, with Mustafa Shokay assuring us that he only needs a few more weeks in the young republic to convince General Amanzholov. On the other hand, Junaid Khan has promised nothing, and demanded everything - arguing that the Turkmen people may join our republic, so long as they are afforded full sovereign rights, have no obligations to the rest of said federation, are allowed to hold their own army - which must be led by him or his son, that he be afforded a specific salary from federal coffers, and on and on. Madamin Bek can only pray that he may come to see reason in time, but regardless these issues must be resolved. With the support of Mustafa Shokay, Madamin Bek has decided that the best course of action would be to call for a summit at Karmana to hash out the various parties' differences."

Kurbashi and tribesmen bicker over looted gold and guns, while the men at the top argue over lines of delineation, no better than their underlings. The Kazakhs have returned north so that they may build a new home for themselves, and Junaid Khan wishes them well, so long as they stay north. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Madamin Bek, who cannot help but stir trouble, bandying about with words of ‘unification' and ‘federation.' The truth that no one wishes to admit is that there will be no peace in Central Asia so long as Madamin Bek broods in Tashkent - the Turkmen people will never be safe and free so long as he views them as little more than ‘citizens' waiting to be conquered. Junaid Khan knows in his heart that the future of Central Asia will be settled on the battlefield, and he plans to be prepared, even if everyone else is too cowardly to join him."

After all, why would we possibly wish to free ourselves of one master, only to shackle ourselves to a new one? Additionally, it does not take a genius to see that further conflict is on the horizon - Junaid Khan and Madamin Bek have quickly flipped from erstwhile (though uncomfortable) allies to vehement enemies.

In doing so, they have deliberately spit in our faces - they know as well as us that Karmana was a point of contention between us while determining possession of the borderlands, and now they mean to flaunt their victory in our faces by forcing us to meet in their lands, in territory which is rightfully ours. Frankly, the time for words is over, and Madamin Bek has proven time and again that he will never respect us as an independent partner or neighbour. However, that is not to say that we could not use this proposed summit to our advantage. We could demand that both leaders are only joined by small units of guards, and if we managed to convince one of Madamin Bek's lieutenants to aid us it would be easy to corner and eliminate the rogue president on the border, leaving his republic rudderless, allowing us to support the rise of a newly indebted Kurbashi\n\nEnter stage left the powerful warlord Shermuhammad “Kurshirmat” (meaning dark-glasses, for the sunglasses he is never seen without) Bek, a deputy of Madamin Bek who may be the only person that hates Turkestan's president as much as we do. He has constantly been politically and militarily humiliated, squandered, and rebuffed by his commander, and many report that he is keenly pursuing...new employment.

In fact, he has accepted, with requests far more reasonable than the ones he has made in the past weeks, namely demanding that both parties limit their guards to a small handful of veterans (ostensibly to prevent any violence between the lower ranks) and that we exclude the Kazakhs from this initial meeting. Obviously we are disappointed that this summit will not host all interested parties, but it is a starting point, and hopefully a less complex meeting between our two leaders, those with the most contensions, will allow us to build a solid foundation to work with in the future. As far as our security is concerned, we are happy to limit Madamin Bek's personal guard, especially as it will allow us a free hand to reinforce the border with trustworthy Kurbashi. If Junaid Khan were to try anything, he would be stuck on the wrong side of the border, and any attempted disruption or incursion from any of his wild underlings will be met by a frightening torrent of machine gun fire from our newly laid fortifications in the key border towns. Hopefully, Junaid Khan will come to his senses in Karmana - realise that his position is weak, and that if he refuses our attempts to unify peacefully, those same machine guns may need to be turned against his homeland."

 cacrisis.603.t: "Kurshirmat Reveals Khivan Skulduggery"
 cacrisis.603.d: "Kurshirmat has never been a close ally of Madamin Bek - in fact, the two men cannot stand each other. Funnily enough, both are the distant descendants of old Kokand nobility, born and raised in the shadow of old Margilan. Further still, both were made fugitives by their actions against the Tsarist authorities in the opening days of the Great War, and both then raised themselves to great fame and prominence in the opening days of the Basmachi revolt. Of course, while Madamin Bek went on to famously defend Russian peasantry in Turkestan, and to rule magnanimously and clemently, Kurshirmat developed his reputation by prosecuting a fierce and brutal campaign against Russian settlers and for his cunning and cruelty in battle against the Reds.\n\nIt is little wonder then that in the post war years, Kurshirmat developed his own base of power outside of Madamin Bek's prying eyes and woeful concerns, and the two rarely coordinated outside of curt discussions of military strategy. Madamin Bek spends most of his time trying his best not to listen to Kurshirmat, but when the ambitious warlord came forward with an audacious accusation of murderous Khivan trickery, Madamin Bek could not help but listen closely. According to Kurshirmat, Junaid Khan's agents attempted to enlist him in a plot to kill Madamin Bek at Karmana, by falsifying an attack to draw away our border units, so that a host of Khivan warriors could descend on Karmana undetected, before cutting the lines of communication and descending onto the city. Kurshirmat again pledged his loyalty to Madamin Bek as the Amir ul-Musliman, and requested that we allow him to ride west to ‘avenge the honour of Turkestan against the dog Junaid Khan.' Behind the bluster, there is no doubt that the plan is genuine - Kurshirmat produced maps we had delivered to Junaid Khan himself months ago, with specific marking indicating the Khivan general's planned route to Karmana. Additionally, he has a very frightened Khivan envoy who has been quick to corroborate his story."
 cacrisis.603.a: "Junaid Khan will answer for this on the battlefield!"

 cacrisis.604.t: "Betrayal at Karmana!"
 cacrisis.604.d: "The Summit at Karmana was progressing about as well as anyone could have expected - modelling it after their meeting in Pishpek, the leaders and their small bands of guards came together in a teahouse to work through the issues of the day. Junaid Khan was as abrasive and difficult as always, pushing back against every concession, suggestion, or compromise offered - but shockingly the Turkmen general seemed engaged and willing to reach solutions, even if he took hours to reach even the simplest compromise. In the darkness of the night, just as the gathered parties prepared to encamp for a night of rest before another day of diligent negotiation, one of Madamin Bek's sentries burst into the negotiations shouting bloody murder. He loudly claimed that a vast host of Turkmen warriors were bearing down on the village, instantaneously shattering the spirit of cooperation. As if possessed, Junaid Khan roared in response that we were attempting to trap and betray him, and his guards sprung into action, opening fire into the room.\n\nAs the smoke settled, Madamin Bek, bleeding from a bullet wound in his arm but fairing better than most of his men, fled through the back rooms of the tea house before stumbling out onto streets now running red with the blood of Turkmen raiders and his meagre forces. Lucky for Madamin Bek, he was quickly recognised by a local who bundled the wounded president into his home joined only by the company of two loyal guardsmen. The bleeding Amir was silently treated and once again smuggled by townspeople, this time to the riverbank, where he and his remaining retinue embarked. Only a few miles east of the city, their tiny band drifted by a bustling encampment along the riverbank, bearing the banners of Turkestani Kurbashi Kurshirmat. Madamin Bek's compatriots entreated him to land their craft, so that he could muster a counterattack against the Khivans at Karmana, and so that he may be treated properly by the Kurbashi's doctor. Madamin Bek, expecting trickery, bid them to be quiet, and to respond to sentries as fishermen. His order was proven proper soon after, as Turkmen warriors streamed into the camp, not as enemies, but as allies.\n\nAs Madamin Bek faded in and out of consciousness in the bottom of a fishing boat, there was one thought which would not leave him: the betrayers would be killed, and Junaid Khan alongside them."

 cacrisis.605.t: "Kurshirmat Betrays Our Plans!"
 cacrisis.605.d: "Any plan which leaves the hands of its originator must be judged, in great part, by its adaptation and execution by third parties. Since the earliest days of his experience raiding against the Khivan khan's caravans, Junaid Khan has learned that a trustworthy subordinate is worth more than a hundred riders. Perhaps blinded by the brilliance of his most recent plan, Junaid Khan may have willingly lost sight of this wisdom, pitching his tent with the brutal and cunning Uzbek warlord Kurshirmat.\n\nUnfortunately, this Turkestani war dog has gone back to his master, informing Madamin Bek of our intentions at Karmana. More surprising still, the Turkestani leader appears to have trusted these accusations levelled against us, and is clearly preparing to make war against us. We will need to quickly mobilise our forces, so that we can meet him squarely on the battlefield."
 cacrisis.605.a: "I mean, we picked him because he was untrustworthy..."

 cacrisis.606.t: "Madamin Bek Escapes Our Trap"
 cacrisis.606.d: "Initially, our plans to pin down and eliminate Madamin Bek at Karmana went off swimmingly - the warlord president of Tashkent sequestered himself with us in a cramped tea house, guarded only by a paltry gang of elderly veterans. We expertly hemmed and hawed on the various issues of the day, trickling down concessions to Madamin Bek like a fisherman loosens his line, if only to keep his catch hooked. As the sun set, we prepared ourselves for the coming conflagration - our riders would arrive from the west at first dark, joined after by Kurshirmat, who would swoop in from the east to catch up any who managed to flee, before taking up the mantle of Turkestani leadership.\n\nUnfortunately, a lowly sentry was able to spring the alarm directly before our forces made it to the village, leaving us forced to spring the trap long before our riders were in position. The disastrous battle which followed allowed Madamin Bek to escape with nothing more than a wound, and blew away any chance of us escaping Karmana with our hands (relatively) clean. Already, Madamin Bek has rallied his forces to meet our armies on the battlefield, and there is little we can do now but oblige him."
