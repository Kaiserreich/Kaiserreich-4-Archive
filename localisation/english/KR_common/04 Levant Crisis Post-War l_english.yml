### Events ###
 levant_crisis_events.1.t: "End of an Era"
 levant_crisis_events.1.d: "As the Arab forces push through the Taurus Mountains into Anatolia, we must concede that the golden days of the Sublime Porte are now definitively over. Refusing to give up their homes, various Turkish and Kurdish irregular organisations are waging a war of resistance in the south of Anatolia, but their attempts will likely be in vain. Therefore the Sultan has called the cabinet to his side to discuss terms of an armistice and afterwards of surrender.\n\nTalking in the grand halls of Dolmabahce Palace, the gathered men can only ponder the future of their once immense empire as air raid alarms blare near the Galata Tower and families, with tears in their eyes, wave their goodbyes to sons and fathers headed for the Anatolian front."
 levant_crisis_events.1.a: "Dark times are ahead of us"

 levant_crisis_events.2.t: "The Treaty of Antalya"
 levant_crisis_events.2.d: "What once may have seemed impossible has finally happened, as the crumbling remnants of the Ottoman army officially surrendered at 16:15 hours today to the armies of [EGY.GetLeader]. With this victory, however, comes a new phase of doubt and envy as the rich lands of the Mashriq will now find themselves carved up between the various partners of our alliance. They will expect us to keep our promises and are likely to react poorly to any attempts to stifle their self-determination."
 levant_crisis_events.2.a: "Support the Syrian regime"
 levant_crisis_events.2.b: "The Levant belongs to Cairo!"

 levant_crisis_events.3.t: "Egypt Accepts the Ottoman Surrender"
 levant_crisis_events.3.d: "Taking charge of the surrender negotiations, the regime in Cairo has signed peace in our name and carved up the Ottoman Empire like a turkey. In accordance with our claims, they have granted us considerable concessions from the Sublime Porte and hope to maintain friendly relations in the future."
 levant_crisis_events.3.a: "A time for healing"
 levant_crisis_events.3.b: "We desire more land!"

 levant_crisis_events.4.t: "The Status of Syria"
 levant_crisis_events.4.d: "With our victory in the Levant assured, the time has come to determine the future of Syria. Whilst the local population is heavily supportive of the interim republican regime that has been set up in the former Ottoman lands, many in Egypt believe a partnership of equals isn't in their best interests and are instead urging for the installation of a puppet regime spearheaded by a member of the royal family, which will do its best to extract as much from the new lands as possible for the benefit of Cairo."
 levant_crisis_events.4.a: "Syria shall be our partner"
 levant_crisis_events.4.b: "Syria lacks guidance and we can provide it!"
 levant_crisis_events.4.c: "Damascus will guide the Arab world! (Play as Syria)"

 levant_crisis_events.5.t: "Egypt Betrays Us!"
 levant_crisis_events.5.d: "Had we had such a clear view on Egyptian treachery before we agreed to partake in their imperialist schemes, we may have never sent thousands of our fathers, sons and brothers to their needless deaths.\n\nNot only has Egypt blocked us from any substantial gains in the war, they are furthermore taking steps to strengthen our enemies and rivals, betraying the trust we placed into their hands. It is a dark day for our people."
 levant_crisis_events.5.a: "Cut all ties with Cairo!"
 levant_crisis_events.5.b: "We have no choice but to accept this"

 levant_crisis_events.6.t: "Participation in the New World Order"
 levant_crisis_events.6.d: "With Ottoman power decisively crushed, it took less than a month for Egypt to take their position as supreme power in the Arab world. Yemen, throughout history being part of its own sub-region instead of the grander Mashriq, never intended for the unification of the Arab peoples, nor for the creation of a new supranational structure to decide on its policies and decrees. Therefore, there has been strong pushback from both the population and the ruling class to withdraw from the Cairo Pact before it stops being a temporary alliance and more a federation led by Cairo."
 levant_crisis_events.6.a: "Yemen stands alone!"
 levant_crisis_events.6.b: "We will stand together with our Arab brethren"

 levant_crisis_events.7.t: "The Iraqi Declaration of Independence"
 levant_crisis_events.7.d: "Distanced from the main fighting in the Levant, parts of the Ottoman Sixth Army and Iraqi notables have ever since the nearing collapse of Ottoman authority plotted a quick and peaceful transition of power to a new, Iraqi, state. An alliance of Northern Sunnis and Southern Shiites, the main aim of this state is not to form a unified religious or ethnic state, but to thwart Iranian aggression in the Levant and to ensure that the Arabic-speaking lands of Mesopotamia remain outside of the authority of Teheran.\n\nOfficials in Egypt were quick to recognise the new state, a move that, some observers have noted, might soon lead to war between the two regional powers, stating that the self-determination of the Arab peoples is in the best interests of everyone and that it is not up to Persians to decide on the matters of Arabs."
 levant_crisis_events.7.a: "Congratulations!"
 levant_crisis_events.7.b: "Baghdad shall guide the Arab world! (Play as Iraq)"

 levant_crisis_events.9.t: "Our Finest Hour"
 levant_crisis_events.9.d: "The moment we feared for years has finally arrived. Our numerous enemies have bonded together and sallied forth in an effort to liberate the Middle East from our so-called oppression. We will however not go gently into the dark night and will throw everything we have at the invaders to preserve the House of Osman and the Empire that may last a thousand years."
 levant_crisis_events.9.a: "To arms!"

 levant_crisis_events.10.t: "End of the Empire"
 levant_crisis_events.10.d: "With chaos reigning supreme in our ranks and the Middle East lost to foreign invaders, Turkish nationalists have rallied behind their cause and deposed the Sultan. While it is unclear what will happen next to our now disintegrated empire, one can only assume it will not be pleasant."
 levant_crisis_events.10.a: "Long Live Turkey!"

 levant_crisis_events.11.t: "The Death of Abbas II"
 levant_crisis_events.11.d: "Cries could be heard in the Royal Palace in Cairo last night as the great Khedive, Abbas II, passed on to the afterlife. The Khedive, whose life has been rocked by first navigating the muddy waters of the British occupation was radically changed when during the Weltkrieg he was deposed by the British occupiers and replaced by his brother.\n\nAlthough Egypt would soon afterwards regain its independence, there would be no place for the former Khedive, seen by the establishment as an Ottoman traitor and far less pliable than his successor. Ottoman military might would change this as their resounding victory in the Levantine war restored the exiled Khedive to his throne.\n\nWith his death, the throne has passed to his son Muhammad Abdel I, who had been groomed as heir for many years and who will hopefully guide Egypt towards a better future."
 levant_crisis_events.11.a: "Good luck!"

 levant_crisis_events.12.t: "Mustafa Kemal Takes Up Command"
 levant_crisis_events.12.d: "Although our Grand Vizier resigned from the army to pursue a career in politics, it is well known that the Pasha never really abandoned the army, and always maintained close relations with the armed forces, even personally directing operations in Iraq and Eastern Anatolia. Now that the Empire once more finds itself entangled in a large-scale war against enemies on all sides, the Vizier has declared in the Ottoman Parliament that he will once more take up his position in the army and lead us, like he did in the Weltkrieg, to final victory.\n\nNone doubt the strategic genius of the man, but a few were quick to point out that this is in direct contradiction to an Ottoman law the Vizier himself signed, which forbids holding both a political and military mandate. Furthermore, the health of our Vizier, buckled under severe stress and bad habits, has taken a plunge in recent years and caused various figures in the army to question whether the Vizier can really endure the Spartan lifestyle of the Ottoman army."
 levant_crisis_events.12.a: "Guide us to victory, Ghazi!"
 levant_crisis_events.12.b: "Military and political affairs should remain separate"

 levant_crisis_events.13.t: "Formation of the Eretz Israel Defence Forces"
 levant_crisis_events.13.d: "With their settlements under attack and the entire future of the Zionist project in jeopardy, various Jewish groups have taken it upon themselves to form a militia army and ward off Arab offensives. Heavily outnumbered, outgunned, and with even the most diehard Zionists questioning their odds, one of their main leaders, David Ben-Gurion, has approached the Ottoman army in Syria with an offer of cooperation.\n\nAlthough the Ottoman army would normally automatically refuse their offer for support, fearing that it would cause great unrest amongst its Muslim foot soldiers, the ever-escalating crisis in Syria has made the Ottoman high command seriously reconsider their position. Besides Ottoman doubts about the possible risks involved in cooperating with the Zionists, it furthermore remains unclear what power Ben-Gurion really has over his forces, with extremist organisations such as the Irgun unlikely to ever compromise with the Ottoman authorities."
 levant_crisis_events.13.a: "One struggle!"
 levant_crisis_events.13.b: "We do not want nor need their assistance!"

 levant_crisis_events.14.t: "The Cypriot Issue"
 levant_crisis_events.14.d: "Although our armies stand victorious over the Arab and Persian hordes, the predominantly Greek island of Kibris continues to prove itself as thorn in our side after they ousted the Ottoman garrison during the early stages of the war. With our armies unable to make a dent in their well-defended positions and a successful naval invasion growing more and more unlikely by the day, the Cypriot temporary government has extended an offer of peace. Demanding that we recognise their independence, they promise to work out a suitable arrangement for the Turkish minority on the island, possibly proposing a population exchange which would include some of the remaining Greek communities in Anatolia.\n\nMany in the army however have reacted with anger to this proposal, pointing out that with the threat in the East and South gone, they will soon make short work of these troublesome upstarts. After all, Kibris is and shall always remain a Turkish island!"
 levant_crisis_events.14.a: "Let's spare ourselves the embarrassment..."
 levant_crisis_events.14.b: "Muster the armies, ready the ships and launch all fighters, Kibris shall be ours in a fortnight!"

 levant_crisis_events.15.t: "Our Relations with Cairo"
 levant_crisis_events.15.d: "With the downfall of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt has thrust itself into a new position of prominence, taking up the mantle of the leader of the Arab world. However, this has caused significant concern from our populace, as many are afraid that this development shall change our fundamental relationship with the Cairo Regime from mutual cooperation to that of a tributary, and that continued membership in their alliance will put in jeopardy the autonomy we have shed so much blood to gain."
 levant_crisis_events.15.a: "Tripolitania shall stand on its own legs!"
 levant_crisis_events.15.b: "Egyptian protection is required for our continued existence."

 levant_crisis_events.16.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] Annexes Iraq"
 levant_crisis_events.16.d: "In a blatant display of aggression, our former 'allies' have denied the peaceful and kind-hearted Iraqi population their right for self-determination and have instead swallowed them up whole in their cheap caricature of the Ancient Persian Empire. Naturally this has engulfed the entire Mashriq in protests and political actions, demanding of its governments to fight the Shiite oppressors. Youngsters, often armed with their forefathers' 19th-century rifles at best are amassing in resistance movements and militias, crossing the Iraqi border in the darkness of the night to assist their Arab brethren in their most righteous cause."
 levant_crisis_events.16.a: "They must evacuate the region immediately!"
 levant_crisis_events.16.b: "We'd rather not fight the Persians..."

 levant_crisis_events.17.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands the Liberation of Iraq"
 levant_crisis_events.17.d: "Outraged by our perhaps rash act, their government demands an immediate withdrawal of our forces from the Iraqi region and grant the Iraqi population their right to self-determination as agreed upon at the Third Arab Congress only a few months earlier."
 levant_crisis_events.17.a: "If they want Iraq, they can fight for it."
 levant_crisis_events.17.b: "We cannot fight them."

 levant_crisis_events.18.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Demands"
 levant_crisis_events.18.d: "The heretics of the East have seemingly refused our demands, stating that they are perfectly within their rights to occupy foreign territory—citing Egypt's annexation of Sudan—and have shown that they are willing to die fighting for it, if need be. Still, they would much rather prefer a peaceful resolution, one in which they retain all their goals and we sacrifice ours."
 levant_crisis_events.18.a: "Then war it shall be."
 levant_crisis_events.18.b: "Drop the matter."

 levant_crisis_events.19.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Withdraws from Iraq"
 levant_crisis_events.19.d: "As was expected, the cowering Iranian dogs have withdrawn from Iraq when faced with the full brunt of our united Arab potential. Let this incident be a warning to all that the Arab world stands together and will let no foreign group, be it Turk or Persian, decide its fate!"
 levant_crisis_events.19.a: "Excellent!"
 levant_crisis_events.19.b: "(Play as Iraq)"

 levant_crisis_events.20.t.victory: "Victory Against [EGY.GetNameDef]"
 levant_crisis_events.20.d.victory: "Obvious right from the start, it seems that the Egyptian dogs can bark but lack the capacity to bite and in showing our formidable strength, we have bloodied their noses. Their armies are crushed on the battlefield and our hold over Iraq has never been stronger. Now is the time to force Egypt to the negotiation table and once and for all decide the fate of Iraq."
 levant_crisis_events.20.t.defeat: "Faltering War Effort!"
 levant_crisis_events.20.d.defeat: "The war against Egypt began with promises of a decisive campaign in which the enemy's army would be utterly annihilated, politicians and generals alike assured the public of imminent victory, but now, these increasingly appear to be nothing more than false hopes. Our armies have been pushed out of Iraq, while Egyptian forces draw closer to the Iranian heartland day by day. With victory out of our grasp, top military and political leaders have urged [PER.GetLeader] to negotiate a conditional surrender, so that we may preserve what we have left."
 levant_crisis_events.20.a: "Demand Egypt recognise our gains."
 levant_crisis_events.20.b: "No, we shall crush them!"
 levant_crisis_events.20.c: "We must end this war."
 levant_crisis_events.20.d: "We can still win this!"

 levant_crisis_events.21.t: "Peace with [FROM.GetNameDef]?"
 levant_crisis_events.21.d.victory: "All of the Arab world weeps in joy as the cowardly Iranian vermin surrenders its control over Iraq to our united forces. Radio broadcasts throughout the entire region are filled with patriotic music and messages of support whilst on every town square from Tripoli to Mosul, people celebrate the great victories of our armies."
 levant_crisis_events.21.d.defeat: "Although we started off well, it seems that the Persians were able to outperform our armies on the field of battle. Suffering defeat after defeat, we have little choice now but to surrender Iraq to their clutches. It is truly a dark day for the Arab world."
 levant_crisis_events.21.a: "We accept their terms."
 levant_crisis_events.21.b: "No, they shall be crushed!"

 levant_crisis_events.22.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Peace"
 levant_crisis_events.22.d.victory: "With a heavy heart, the Egyptian diplomats were forced to sign the Baghdad treaty and have recognised our rule over Iraq as legitimate. Celebrations all throughout Iran have erupted in response whilst in Cairo a sombre mood has taken over the city. It is unlikely that this will be the end of our troubles in the region but for now Iran stands victorious."
 levant_crisis_events.22.d.defeat: "With a heavy heart, our diplomats were forced to sign the humiliating Baghdad treaty, recognising the independence of Iraq. Celebrations all throughout the Arab world have erupted in response whilst in Teheran a sombre mood has taken over the city. Whilst they may celebrate tonight, Iran will have its revenge..."
 levant_crisis_events.22.a: "Excellent."
 levant_crisis_events.22.b: "We had no choice."

 levant_crisis_events.23.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
 levant_crisis_events.23.d: "In their foolhardiness, the Egyptian forces have refused to accept our terms and have sworn that they will not stop until the total destruction of Persia has been achieved. An absurd idea, our own generals have announced that they are more than ready for their challenge and that it will be Cairo that burns at the end of this fight."
 levant_crisis_events.23.a: "A fight to the death, then."

 levant_crisis_events.24.t: "Georgia Occupies Batum"
 levant_crisis_events.24.d: "Benefiting from our temporary moment of weakness, the Georgian rats have used this opportunity to enact a border correction in their favour. The crucial harbour of Batum, largest east of Trebizond and the main harbour of the Western Caucasus, was attacked in a coordinated strike by the Georgians as their navy cut off its naval access and infantry battalions paraded through the streets. Although an Ottoman garrison was present in the city and still has not surrendered, no fire has been exchanged just yet as the Sublime Porte debates whether it should retaliate in force or concede the city to the Georgians."
 levant_crisis_events.24.a: "Seems like Georgia has a lesson to learn!"
 levant_crisis_events.24.b: "A coordinated withdrawal would be in our best interests"

 levant_crisis_events.25.t: "Ottomans Withdraw from Batum"
 levant_crisis_events.25.d: "Without firing a shot, our army has succeeded in retaking the historically Georgian port of Batum as the Ottoman garrison in the city was ordered by Kostantiniye to withdraw towards Rize. Although this a grand victory for Georgia, not all are convinced by the choice to kick the Turks whilst they are down. Pointing out dark shadows up North, they fear that should the Turks survive their ordeal, the sovereignty of all Georgia might have just been compromised."
 levant_crisis_events.25.a: "A glorious day!"

 levant_crisis_events.26.t: "The Ottomans Hold in Batum"
 levant_crisis_events.26.d: "Surprisingly, and in spite of the dire circumstances they are currently in, the Porte has chosen to hold fast in Batum, and has issued an ultimatum for our troops to leave or face war. If we are to regain the port of Batum, our only choice left now is to officially declare war on [FROM.GetNameDef] which, however, is most likely to anger our allies."
 levant_crisis_events.26.a: "War it is, then."
 levant_crisis_events.26.b: "We should give in and withdraw to our territory."

 levant_crisis_events.27.t: "The Question of Conscription"
 levant_crisis_events.27.d1: "The current war threatens to remove the Ottoman Empire from the map forever. No one calling themselves a man can stay at home when his homeland is threatened. If they do not go freely, it is time for the laws to change, and give them some motivation."
 levant_crisis_events.27.d2: "Our enemies are numerous, and so must we be. Luckily conscription is already in place across the Empire, leaving us well prepared to face both fronts in this war. With both superior numbers and equipment, we will make easy work of the upstarts trying to destroy the House of Osman."
 levant_crisis_events.27.a: "The Sultan calls."
 levant_crisis_events.27.b: "We were well prepared."
