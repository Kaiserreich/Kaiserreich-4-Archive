### Decisions ###
 LOAS_Arab_League: "$league_of_arab_states$"
 LOAS_Arab_League_desc: "United by language, the Arab people have always formed a distinct group within the empires they inhabited. Some people, however, feel that this connection doesn't go far enough and that it's the destiny of the Arab world to reunite as it did in the times of the great Caliphates. They believe that through the creation of such a united Arabia, the entire region will finally experience its true renaissance and regain its rightful place in global politics.\n\nTo hasten this unification, a supranational organisation (§Y$league_of_arab_states$§!) has been created and granted significant power. Should the dream of a Pan-Arab state ever be realised however, we will need to convince the other Arab states to partake in this initiative and surrender part of their sovereignty."
