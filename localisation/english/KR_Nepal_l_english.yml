### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_TRIBHUVANA_DESC:0 "King Tribhuvan ascended to the throne of Nepal at merely five years of age. Tribhuvan, however, was born king in name only, in reality, the boy-king was nothing more than a figurehead for the powerful Rana family. As he has grown into a man, Nepalese politics have become increasingly defined by the antagonistic relationship between the king and the Ranas. Time alone will reveal the victor of the struggle both politically and economically."

### Events ###
 nepal.10.t:0 "Nepal Winning the War"
 nepal.10.d:0 "Impossibly, the Nepalese Gurkhas have streamed out of the mountains and are turning the tide against us. Perhaps the time has come to give in to their demands and sue for peace?"

Surely [NEP.GetNameDef] knows that, given enough time, we would win... but at what cost?"
 nepal.21.d.noclaims:0 "The war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Envoys from the [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us and asked that we sue for peace - the [Root.GetFactionName] would surely win in the long term, but at what cost? They say the war isn't worth pursuing further."

 nepal.22.d.noclaims:0 "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has ground down in the mountains, as we knew it would, but we are a long, long way from victory.
