 YUN_market_liberal_party_long: "Southwest Industrial Group (Xi'nan Shiyexi)\n§LYunnan Province may be regarded by the rest of China as primitive and backwater, but despite its underdeveloped nature it has been a prime spot of investment for industrialists and bankers. War requires money, and plenty of profits have been made on the backs of Tang Jiyao's wild ambitions. The Southwest Industrial Group are a clique of businessmen who collaborate with Tang's regime, but they're quite flexible, and would gladly be willing to lend their funding and their properties to a higher bidder or more powerful warlord...§!\n"

 YUN_social_conservative_party_long: "National Foundation Army (Jian Guo Dian Jun), the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army\n§LThe NRA may be ostensibly pledged to upholding the ideals of nationalism, democracy and justice, but desperate times have called for desperate measures. Sometimes the Three Principles of the People must be temporarily suspended to protect the revolution. Thankfully for the progressives, the death of Chiang Kai-shek and the disgrace of many key military figures within the Kuomintang has largely discredited this cynical way of thought.§!\n"

 YUN_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Public Interest Party\n§LThe Zhongguo Zhigongdang, or China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party of China) is the main political party of the Federalist movement in China. Founded in 1925 by Chen Jiongming and Tang Jiyao, the party united disillusioned Kuomintang politicians and Overseas Chinese (especially Freemasons of the Hongmen), calling for the reform of the Republic of China into a proper federal state and multiparty democracy. While these hopes were quickly dashed by the Qing Restoration, they remain a significant force, albeit banned in Qing/Zhili-controlled lands for their explicit republicanism. Their platform, outside of federalism and republican democracy, espouses progressive social and political views from land and education reform to elected assemblies for all government levels.§!\n"

 YUN_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Army of National Pacification (Jing Guo Dian Jun)\n§LTang Jiyao has ruled Yunnan for decades, maintaining a steadfast bastion of Republican revolutionaries in spite of the monarchy's restoration. In some ways, his diligence and his ambitious nature is quite respectable. His officer corps is loyal to him, even if they sometimes aspire for higher stations. Yet as the balance of power in China continues to change, it remains to be seen if Tang Jiyao can change with it, or if he will be smothered by the tides of history, the last of Cai E.§!\n"

 YUN_national_populist_party_long: "Minority Nationalists\n§LYunnan Province is home to dozens of ethnic groups and religious beliefs, its frontiers have long been an untamed, rebellious backwater that the Kunming administration has struggled to suppress. The various tribes, chieftains and religious sects have long felt that their ways of life were under attack from China's Han and Manchu elites. With the legacy of great wars like the Panthay Rebellion still looming over the province, it would not take much to provoke the tribes to take action, especially if they sense a moment of weakness from Kunming.§!\n"

Even if it meant having to turn on his own brother, he undertook the necessary measures to entrench his administration in Kunming and hold the city. Now that the dust has settled after this period of brief civil war, it remains to be seen if this young, ambitious Yi General has what it takes to rebuild Yunnan.

### Ideas ###
 YUN_Tangs_rule: "The Rule of Tang Jiyao"
 YUN_Tangs_rule_desc: "Tang Jiyao has governed the province of Yunnan since Cai E's removal by Yuan Shikai in 1913, but he has nevertheless supported many Republican expeditions throughout the continent for the last two decades. These expeditions have come at a price, which Tang has regretfully had to pay with an expansion of the opium trade and high taxes for the peasantry. This has triggered a slow but steady growth in civil unrest in the province, at the same time as once loyal generals and newly-found rivals now team up to scheme against Tang, preparing for the perfect time to strike. Nevertheless, with his sights set on expanding Yunnan's borders and with a weakening grip of the German government over Chinese affairs, Tang may hold greater ambitions for the mountainous province..."

 YUN_opium_exports: "Yunnan's Export Economy"
 YUN_opium_exports_desc: "The province of Yunnan is home to vast amounts of resources, both agricultural and mineral which has made our province a key exporter through both Burma and Indochina. However, the province is subject to a monopoly in transportation by German railways through both the League of Eight Provinces' railways and the Kunming-Haiphong Railway in Northern Vietnam. With little reason to change our dependence from Germany, we currently exchange many of our goods, like opium and tin in exchange for German products and licences."

 YUN_AOG_tin_control_over_us: "German Economic Control over Gejiu's Tin"
 YUN_AOG_tin_control_over_us_desc: "Yunnan's tin production, focused mainly on the town of Gejiu, is one of the highest of all of China, which has made the French and now the Germans being particularly interested in keeping the Kunming-Haiphong railway alive and active. While tin trade is incredibly profitable, there are major issues with our tin production which greatly reduce the income we receive from it. These revolve around a lack of purity in our tin, which we are unable to fix with our current equipment, which in turn forces us to sell it to the Germans at outrageously low prices. This cheap tin is then taken to the AOG where it is re-smelted to improve its purity, and then resold in the international market at a higher price. If we ever hope to take those profits back from the German monopolies, significant reform will have to be undertaken, and our economy may not be ready for such an endeavour..."

 YUN_country_intro_header: "Status of the §aYunnan Clique§!"
 YUN_country_intro_content: "The decision to found §lYunnan Military Academy§! in 1909 gave birth to the §aYunnan Clique§!. Since the 1911 §lXinhai Revolution§!, the province of §aYunnan§! has been known for its elite army and loyalty to §lChinese republicanism§!. In 1915, §aYunnan§! alone declared the §lNational Protection War§! against §PYuan Shikai§! and toppled his empire. The victorious §aYunnan§! then pursued an expansionist policy, exerting control over its neighbours. §aYunnan's§! ephemeral hegemony came at a price, however, as the province lost control of many units deployed outside of §aYunnan§!. The military's adventures in §aSichuan§! were nothing but failures and caused a major civil conflict within the §aYunnan Clique§!. General §aGu Pinzhen§! temporarily ousted §aTang Jiyao§! from power, but §aTang§! regrouped and returned with his loyal troops, managing to secure a victory over §aGu§!. However, since then the §aYunnanese army§! has no longer been a unified force; old classmates and brothers-in-arms rapidly became rivals.\n\nDuring the Northern Expedition, §aYunnan's§! leading warlord, §aTang Jiyao§!, kept his distance from the §RGuangzhou Nationalist government§!, while other §aYunnanese§! troops in exile, led by general §cZhu Peide§!, rallied behind the banner of §RNational Revolution§! and became the pillar of §RSun Yat-sen's§! military force. When the Northern Expedition tragically ended, the desperate generals of the §RNational Revolutionary Army§! decided to return to the south, back to §aYunnan§!. The attrition was heavy, and many of them ended up at the door of §aGuizhou§!, §aTang's§! recently conquered land. §aTang§! wanted to seize the chance and annihilate his old enemies right there, but his generals, led by §PLong Yun§!, strong-armed §aTang§! into offering sanctuary to the defeated §RNRA§!. The coexistence of former rivals was not easy, but they knew that the new rulers of §lChina§!, the §PZhili Clique§!, and their §mGerman patrons§!, would not tolerate an autonomous §aYunnan§!, and that they could only survive through cooperation. Despite its formidable battle commanders and elite army, the lack of a unified military command had cost §aYunnan§! dearly when it audaciously joined the §YFourth Zhili-Fengtian War§!.\n\nAs a new year starts for the southern province, §aTang Jiyao's§! authority over the §aclique§! is far from assured. His long decaying rule, lack of pursuit of his §cFederalist§! ideals, and continued grandstanding, alienates many high-ranking officers, including §PLong Yun§!. §aTang's§! decision to submit to §c[QIE.GetNameDef]§! has also undermined his prestige, and he holds nothing but nominal control over the former §RNRA§! troops. With the ever-mounting political tension between the officers in §aYunnan§!, §aTang's§! next misstep may prove to be his last..."

### Events ###
 yun.2.t: "Long Yun Takes Over!"
 yun.2.d: "After gathering his troops at the south-eastern entrance of the city of Kunming, Long Yun led his troops through the East of the Dian Lake until breaking through the city's outer wall. Foreseeing an encirclement, Tang Jiyao attempted to flee northwards through the northern residential area in order to escape towards Sichuan, but was cut off by officers loyal to Long Yun before he was able to flee the city.\n\nWith the capture of Tang, the remaining loyal forces fighting Kunming surrendered before dawn, and a committee was hastily assembled by Long Yun in order to judge Tang. However, the coup has caused great upheaval amongst the many factions in Yunnan, and Tang's trial had to be rushed due to fear of him escaping custody in case of a clash near Kunming. Accused of endangering the people of Yunnan, overall incompetence as a leader, favouritism over capable officers, treason to the Republican ideals of the province and embezzlement of public funds, Tang was forced to sign his resignation and to retire from public life.\n\nThis isn't the end of Yunnan's woes, unfortunately. While Long Yun entrenches in the capital and reinforces the Kunming Arsenal and the Yunnan Military Academy, Zhu Peide in the South-East, Hu Ruoyu in the West and Lu Han in the North-East mobilise their forces for a final showdown for the control of Yunnan."
 yun.2.a: "The fate of Yunnan hangs in the balance..."

 yun.3.t: "The Battle of Chuxiong"

Taking advantage of the Kunming Arsenal's supplies, Long Yun has decided to take the offensive westwards and secure Dali. However, the small town of Chuxiong stands in the way of Long Yun's conquest. With the enemy entrenching in the city, and few bridges where the defenders can bottleneck the attackers, Long Yun and his officers are forced to rethink their strategy.\n\nA group of young officers argue that the best way to flush out the defenders is to surround the village along the Longchuan River, and then storm the village on all sides. Another group of more experienced officers have proposed to wait for artillery pieces to be moved forward, and give the defenders one last ultimatum: Surrender to Long Yun or face the consequences. As the final details of each plan is laid out, it's Long Yun who will decide what shall be the fate of the Chuxiong..."
 yun.3.a: "Surround and storm the village."
 yun.3.b: "Bring up the artillery."

 yun.4.t: "The Battle of Qujing"
 yun.4.d: "As Long Yun secures his power elsewhere, his enemies start converging in the east, threatening to retake Kunming while the bulk of his force remains in the west. Without a lot of troops to spare, the small town of Qujing has been chosen for the Kunming defenders to make a stand against the enemy\n\nHowever, the geography of the territory presents an interesting challenge for the defenders. If they protect the entrances to the main valley, they can look over the enemy routes into and out of the city by controlling the nearby mountains, but that would force the defenders to spread out. On the other hand, protecting the town itself could prove to be easier, as the enemies would face a more concentrated defender force which can fight tooth and nail for every street and every house, although it could lead to higher civilian casualties and the loss of the higher ground around the town, which could be used by enemy snipers to decimate our army. As Long Yun receives reports from runners that his East flank is exposed, he has decided to..."
 yun.4.a: "Protect the valley's entrances, we need the high ground."
 yun.4.b: "Fall back into Qujing, we need the extra ground to delay the enemy."

 yun.5.t: "The Capture of Anshun"
 yun.5.d: "As Long Yun marches through the north-eastern roads towards Qianzhong, he has sent a detachment southwards to secure the province of Guixi before facing off his enemies at Bijie. The harsh terrain in the area has made the officers leading the detachment increasingly wary of possible ambushes. However, as the detachment came close to the Nanma River, a small group of soldiers carrying a white flag approached the detachment.\n\nThe soldiers had been sent to negotiate by one of Long Yun's rivals, and requested to give the city another day in order to allow for the woman, the children and the elderly to be evacuated to a safe area. In exchange, the soldiers promised the defender forces would retreat as well, allowing the detachment to capture Anshun without firing a shot. The officers leading the expedition requested the soldiers to give them a few minutes to discuss the matter internally. While the proposition seems noble, Long Yun's officers are distrustful of the soldiers. They could be buying time for reinforcements to arrive from Qianzhong, and some even argue that a direct attack now, while costly for the civilian populace, would strike a killing blow at the factionalist forces. By the end of the deliberation, the officers told the soldiers sent to parley that..."
 yun.5.a: "They are given a day to complete the evacuation, but no more."
 yun.5.b: "The attack will begin in the afternoon and they should return before hostilities resume."

 yun.6.t: "The Battle of Bijie"
 yun.6.d: "After Long Yun's forces reach the Salaxizhen village, the valley opens up in several paths, of which the Central one leads directly towards Bijie. Long Yun's scouts have informed him that the city has been fortified and it's waiting for a direct frontal attack.\n\nWhile Long Yun can't abandon the main road as it would expose his forces to being flanked, he can split up his forces and lead a diversionary attack in the entrance of Bijie, while the bulk of the force is split and attacks through the north along the Daotian River and through the south following the Shibahe River. Many officers have objected to this plan, claiming that splitting the forces would make the overall army weaker, and since the valleys on the sides weren't secured, the detachments would risk facing a superior force and being decimated, while a direct frontal assault, while costly, could allow the army to punch through and ultimately scatter the bulk of the factionalist forces defending Bijie. At the end of the discussion, it's Long Yun who will have the final word."
 yun.6.a: "Split our forces, we need to fight smart."
 yun.6.b: "Concentrate our forces, we can punch through."

 yun.7.t: "The Defence of Bijie"
 yun.7.d: "After reports of factionalist forces gathering in the Guixi province, Long Yun has decided to take the initiative and take over the Qianzhong province in order to encircle and destroy his enemies. With a swift strike, the defenders of Bijie were no match for Long Yun's forces, but as the night slowly set in, it was decided for the detachment to rest in the town before continuing the march towards Zunyi in Qianzhong. However, during the night the forces have been caught off guard by an attacking force, and the defence of the town will have to come as a priority if the force wishes to reach its objectives.\n\nAn Attack coming through the Southern Entrance is slowly edging its way into the city, but the roads to the sides are also being attacked by an unknown number of attackers, and the detachment risks getting encircled in the city. As the chaos ensues during the night firefight, orders come from Long Yun himself and the force decides to..."
 yun.7.a: "Defend the roads, we need a way to escape."
 yun.7.b: "Defend the city, we'll crush their main force first."

 yun.8.t: "The Storming of Guiyang"
 yun.8.d: "As our battered forces converge on the city of Guiyang, the South-Western army of Long Yun has to face an uphill battle as they have to cross the Honfeng Lake in order to reach Qingzheng and from there stage the final assault on Guiyang.\n\nAs the Northern Detachment reaches the northern entrance of Guiyang, the South-Western one is mostly pinned down at the crossings of the Hongfeng Lake and they are taking heavy casualties. However, most of the defending force has shifted towards Qingzheng, leaving Guiyang largely undefended. The issue arises now that the city could be hastily taken without clearing all enemies from it, risking a possible counter-attack from the rear as the bulk of the group is engaged in helping the South-Western detachment, but encircling the defending force in Qingzheng may prove to be decisive in order to swiftly beat the factionalist force before another group strikes at Kunming. As the battle ensues, the final decision is..."
 yun.8.a: "Secure Guiyang first, we can't allow them to attack us from the rear."
 yun.8.b: "Storm Guiyang and head straight into Qingzheng."

 yun.9.t: "Battle of Jinghong"
 yun.9.d: "As Hu Ruoyu's forces secure Kunming, General Ruoyu is worried that the rebels will get material support through the Mekong River in the south through Siam, and has decided to quickly mobilise his force southwards in order to cover the border. After a seemingly long journey through valleys and forests, Ryouyu's army reached the gates of the town of Jinghong. However, scouts have informed that a large enemy contingent is in the city and it is prepared to defend it. While a direct attack might prove effective, one of the scouts has pointed to a path through the southern forest of Fuben, which would allow us to storm the town from several directions, but would take time to get our troops into position, time which might be vital to retaking the area and securing our grip in the region..."
 yun.9.a: "Split the attacking force."
 yun.9.b: "Storm the city now!"

 yun.10.t: "Allocating our Supplies"
 yun.10.d: "With the control of the Kunming Arsenal, we have the supply advantage over the other factions wreaking havoc around Yunnan. This advantage won't last forever, specially if the rebel forces manage to secure foreign support, and so General Ryuoyu has decreed a full scale offensive throughout the country. This offensive has managed to seize Guiyang and Zhaotong, finding little resistance along the way. However, these easy victories are overshadowed by an evident realisation: Our enemies weren't retreating, they were regrouping. As our soldiers dig foxholes and our officers draw plans for the defence of both cities, we find ourselves with a severe supply shortage. With both cities in danger of being attacked by our enemies, we will have to choose which city to prioritise in order to give them the necessary supplies to defend it."
 yun.10.a: "Send the supplies to Guiyang."
 yun.10.b: "Send the supplies to Zhaotong."

 yun.11.t: "The Defence of Chuxiong"
 yun.11.d: "As our forces advance through the Cuihu park and finally secure our position, our enemies are beginning to make their move near the old city of Dali. Due to our enemy's numerical advantage, General Hu Ruoyu has ordered his troops to lure the enemy into the city of Chuxiong, along the road between Kunming and Dali, and wait them there.\n\nMost of Hu Ruoyu's officers agree that an attack is imminent and preparing a defensive strategy would be best, but not how said defensive is meant to be carried out. One group of officers argue that a static defence on the Northern bank of the Longchuan River, paired up with trenches and small fortifications will be enough to repel the enemy. While usually the Weltkrieg textbooks with which the Kunming academy trains indicate that this model may be the best defence, our current shortage of Machine guns render this strategy weak in case the enemy outnumbers us, so another group of officers has recommended maybe adopting a more flexible defensive strategy, setting up several fallback lines and attracting the enemy into a protracted battle might be a better choice. Regardless of their discussion, Hu Ruoyu's orders is what settles the defensive plan."
 yun.11.a: "Adopt a flexible defence, we can't risk getting overrun."
 yun.11.b: "Dig in, we can take them!"

 yun.12.t: "Battle of Jinghong"
 yun.12.d: "As the battle continues elsewhere, General Ruoyu is worried that the rebels will get material support through the Mekong River in the south through Siam, and has decided to quickly mobilise his force southwards in order to cover the border. After a seemingly long journey through valleys and forests, Ryouyu's army reached the gates of the town of Jinghong. However, scouts have informed that a large enemy contingent is in the city and it is prepared to defend it. While a direct attack might prove effective, one of the scouts has pointed to a path through the southern forest of Fuben, which would allow us to storm the town from several directions, but would take time to get our troops into position, time which might be vital to retaking the area and securing our grip in the region..."
 yun.12.a: "Split the attacking force."
 yun.12.b: "Storm the city now!"

 yun.13.t: "Battle of the Luojiang River"
 yun.13.d: "As our soldiers marched on from the town of Bijie to face off the warlord forces near Zunyi, scouts have reported a large formation of enemies mobilising to the Northwest of Zunyi, in one of the many valleys of our province. However, unlike most of the terrain in Yunnan, this area is mostly flat land, used mainly for agriculture, and a few spread forests. With barely any hills to overlook the enemy, and them having the advantage of being able to access cover, our only advantage is the surprise factor. After a long session of deliberations, Hu Ruoyu has ordered from the capital that the area must be taken in order to secure the advance towards Zunyi, regardless of the casualties. As our officers draw the plans, a question has come up: Considering the enemy cannot be destroyed, merely pushed back from the area, in what direction should our army try to push them towards? Some officers argue that pushing them north will put a strain on our rear guard as we will need to leave a considerable group to guard the area, and we would also be leaving them right next to the Sichuan Clique, which could try to support them to our detriment, but would separate them from the main fighting force. Other officers however, point out that perhaps pushing them off Eastwards while we still have the advantage will allow us to better make use of our tactical advantage. What should we do?"
 yun.13.a: "Push them east, towards Zunyi!"
 yun.13.b: "Push them north, towards the valleys!"

 yun.14.t: "Skirmishes Near the Lancang River"
 yun.14.d: "As plenty of our forces march Eastwards to reinforce Qianzhong, concerning scout reports have arrived from the West, indicating that a large enemy contingent is preparing near the town of Baoshan. General Ryuoyu managed to quickly assemble a task force to send to the area, but near the Lancang River, they were ambushed crossing a makeshift bridge, causing severe casualties to the detachment and stopping their advance dead in its tracks. Their leading officer has reported back to Kunming that their soldiers were outmanned and outgunned from the other side of the river, with even artillery fire raining over the area and has requested to retreat and regroup. While taking Baoshan and stopping the enemy forces from concentrating is vital for our survival, we can't risk another decisive defeat on the area or the enemy will grow bold and attack us where we are weak. Since we need to act fast, the message has to be dispatched as soon as possible."
 yun.14.a: "Fall back, we need to focus on defending."
 yun.14.b: "Take Baoshan no matter what!"

 yun.15.t: "Offensive Planning"
 yun.15.d: "While our forces have managed to push back the enemy from Kunming, we can't remain in a defensive stance forever, and we should try to move to secure the rest of Yunnan. However, with our limited resources and even more limited manpower, we have to choose whether to attack Bijie in order to take Qianzhong or move towards Guiyang in order to take Guixi. Both targets will prove tough nuts to crack, as our scouts have spotted Long Yun's forces near Guiyang, and our KMT sympathisers have reported Zhu Peide moving towards Bijie. With both heading towards Kunming, we need to face one or the other before its too late and both converge on our position. Perhaps, if we strike at one of them now, we might be able to disperse them..."
 yun.15.a: "Attack Bijie."
 yun.15.b: "Attack Guiyang."

 yun.16.t: "Enemy Forces Threaten Yuxi"
 yun.16.d: "Concerning reports from our officers in the area south of Kunming state that they're slowly but steadily being overrun by a hostile force, being able to only pose an organised retreat with some combat delays. If this keeps up, they'll be at the gates of Kunming before the week is out. Our loyal officers have presented Lu Han with two choices: Reinforce the front and hope it will hold, or push Westwards towards Dali. While holding the front seems like a more immediate solution, we are stretched thin with our forces also being occupied with other battles in the East. By contrast, attacking westwards might be a gamble, but it'll likely force the enemy in Yuxi to retreat to try and prevent us from seizing the main cities of the West. Either way, the decision rests with Lu Han..."
 yun.16.a: "Send the troops westwards!"
 yun.16.b: "Reinforce the front line!"

 yun.17.t: "Songshan Mountain Defence"
 yun.17.d: "For a long time, the mountain pass next to the Songshan Mountain has been a vital path to move between Baoshan and Licang avoiding the main roads, and hence, avoiding detection from normal patrols and defensive detachments. However, Lu Han foresaw his rival, Zhu Peide, would move the Western Detachment of the NRA through the mountain pass in order to seize Baoshan and expose Dali to an attack. With little time to prepare as other warlord armies regroup, a defence has been hastily assembled but reports of a large enemy force approaching from the Nujiang River has made their officer panic and he is currently requesting to withdraw from the area to avoid getting encircled. While holding that pass could prove to be vital to hold on to Western Yunnan, we can't afford our forces to be encircled. What should we do?"
 yun.17.a: "Order a retreat."
 yun.17.b: "Order them to dig in regardless."

 yun.18.t: "The Bijie Gamble"
 yun.18.d: "As our forces mobilised to the East to take over Qianzhong, our scouts have reported two large hostile forces fighting on the outskirts of Bijie. While their numbers are vastly superior to our meagre forces, the fighting is fierce and our officers are confident we can take on one of the forces while pushing the other back. However, it's hard to really ascertain which one to go for first. The Kunming government will have to make the decision."
 yun.18.a: "Push against the warlord forces."
 yun.18.b: "Push against the NRA forces."

 yun.19.t: "The Qianzhong Sympathisers"
 yun.19.d: "Among the NRA forces led by Zhu Peide, there are several sympathisers to Lu Han's cause, and some of them have contacted Kunming to pledge their allegiance to Lu Han. However, while their loyalty is appreciated, they are unfortunately way beyond our reach and behind enemy lines and we have no means to support them. They have proposed to seize the surrounding areas to the town of Zunyi and then move downwards to Guiyang, but it's a very risky move and they'll have to act independently from our command. However, if our gamble is successful, we will manage to gain a major foothold in Qianzhong."
 yun.19.a: "Ask them to stay undercover."
 yun.19.b: "Ask them to attack."

 yun.20.t: "The Yulong Mountain Skirmishes"
 yun.20.d: "With our troops being spread thin, the detachment sent to secure Lijiang in the province of Dali has been forced to set camp at the foot of the nearby Yulong Mountain. Around midnight, they were attacked by large enemy opposing force from the Jinsha River, and their situation is dire. With heavy casualties, they managed to get a small squadron to escape to Kunming to request for reinforcements, and chances are that the battle is still raging. However, scout reports indicate that another large force is gathering near Honghe with the intention of knocking us out of Kunming. While a relief force can be organised, that manpower might be better used here."
 yun.20.a: "Relieve the defenders."
 yun.20.b: "Focus on defending Kunming."

 yun.21.t: "The Guixi Garrison Debacle"
 yun.21.d: "Despite the capital being under our control, the National Revolutionary Army remains scattered around the Yunnan, and as our enemies mobilise around us, forming a cohesive front line may prove to be the decisive factor. With barracks of the NRA being located all round, from Qianzhong to Dali, the time has come to finally consolidate and push our enemies out. When we first marched into the capital, a significant group of our army remained in Wenshan, and with our forces now secure in Kunming, we can perform a pincer movement towards Qujing, where we have received reports from our allies in Anshun that a force is gathering to mount a counter-attack on Kunming. However, there are also reports of a force assembling in the old city of Dali, but redeploying our troops to cover the Western side may open us to the possibility of a two front attack, one that we may not be able to hold..."
 yun.21.a: "Perform the pincer movement, we can worry about the west later."
 yun.21.b: "Redeploy the forces in Qujing, we need to hold Kunming."

 yun.22.t: "The Chuxiong Gamble"
 yun.22.d: "Our scouts have reported that a large enemy force has moved from Dali to Chuxiong, and they are poised to attack Kunming at any given moment. In order to tackle them, a traditional static defence is already been setup, with machine guns and artillery pieces being brought from the city to the border of the Tanglang River. However, a few cavalry officers from the NRA have suggested we take the initiative away from the enemy. Instead of digging in, they propose we send one detachment northwards, towards the village of Yuanmou, and another southwards, following the Huanian River, and then have both move towards Chuxiong. As they put it, they'll be able to encircle the enemy before this one can pierce through our lines, but the plan is risky. They want to take away too much of our force, and such a manoeuvre will take days, perhaps even more than a week, and we don't know if we have so much time..."
 yun.22.a: "Send the detachments, we'll be able to hold."
 yun.22.b: "It's too risky, dig in and prepare."

 yun.23.t: "The Zunyi Uprising"
 yun.23.d: "As we consolidate our hold on Kunming, reports from the town of Zunyi have reached our positions, saying that a Kuomintang-aligned garrison has taken up arms for us, and that it's now facing off an enemy attack from Guiyang. While relieving them is our top priority, there are many roads towards Zunyi, and the staff has found itself debating on which approach would be best for the situation. The faster path towards Zunyi would be through Bijie, which would be lightly defended and would allow us to relieve our forces faster, but taking a southern road towards Anshun and then Guiyang would allow us to catch the enemy force off-guard, although doing such a thing would require more time, time that the garrison in Zunyi may not have. At the end of the debate, General Zhu Peide weights his options..."
 yun.23.a: "Go through Anshun to Guiyang."
 yun.23.b: "Go straight to Zunyi through Bijie."

 yun.24.t: "Songshan Mountain Offensive"
 yun.24.d: "For a long time, the mountain pass next to the Songshan Mountain has been a vital path to move between Baoshan and Licang avoiding the main roads, and hence, avoiding detection from normal patrols and defensive detachments. However, it seems that someone foresaw that Zhu Peide would move the Western Detachment of the National Revolutionary Army through the mountain pass in order to seize Baoshan and expose Dali to an attack. With little time to prepare as other warlord armies regroup in the East, an offensive has been hastily assembled, and reports of a small enemy force defending the Nujiang River has made our officers confident and are currently requesting to carry out an attack on the pass in order to clean up enemy resistance and move on to Baoshan. While taking that pass could prove to be vital to hold on to Western Yunnan, the casualties could prove staggering, as the area is easily defensible from the pass..."
 yun.24.a: "There has to be another way..."
 yun.24.b: "Our soldiers know the meaning of sacrifice."

 yun.25.t: "The Siege of Xingyi"
 yun.25.d: "With the National Revolutionary Army having secured the western bank of Kunming, we are now preparing to stage a full front offensive on the East of Yunnan. The Southern force was meant to quickly seize the town of Xingyi and move up to Anshun in order to reach Zunyi in time to perform a pincer movement with the Northern Force headed through Bijie. However, what was supposed to be a clean and quick capture of the city has turned into a siege, almost reminiscent of the siege the town was put through during the Panthay Rebellion almost a century prior. As the siege drags on, the Southern Group has sent a message back to Kunming asking for orders, as they may not meet the deadline to reach Zunyi if the Siege continues, but not finishing the Siege may expose the rear to a counter-attack from the town. While many officers are drawing parallels to the failed siege of Wuchang which became Chiang Kai-shek's downfall and are begging Zhu Peide to order the siege to take priority, the Northern Army will still need support..."
 yun.25.a: "Leave a part of the Army in Xingyi and continue towards Guiyang."
 yun.25.b: "I will not repeat Chiang's mistakes, finish the siege!"

 yun.26.t: "The Capture of Zunyi"
 yun.26.d: "The Northern Army of National Revolutionary Army is finally closing in on its target: the town of Zunyi. After marching through Bijie facing little resistance, it was predicted that Zunyi would be a much tougher bone to gnaw, as the enemy forces have definitely regrouped in the area and had enough time to dig in properly. As our forces wait on the western bank of the Luojiang River, a report from the front line commanders have reached Kunming. Scout reports indicate that several trench lines, machine guns and even artillery pieces are aiming at the Western entrance of Zunyi, making a frontal assault nearly a suicide attack. Instead, a group of officers have suggested to take half the force north, to the Huichan valley entrance into Zunyi, and create a diversionary attack in order to give the frontal force time to attack. However, this move would take time, and the Southern Force could be fighting in the south before they make it, and our experts predict the southern area may also be fortified enough that it may completely halt the southern force if not relieved from our side in time..."
 yun.26.a: "Send the detachment, they can make crossing both entrances easier."
 yun.26.b: "Forget that, attack straight away!"

 yun.27.t: "Long Yun Secures Yunnan!"
 yun.27.d: "With the last of the rebel forces being driven out of the province and the rest surrendering unconditionally, Long Yun has managed to achieve total victory, and his forces march back towards Kunming to celebrate the salvation of Yunnan from all those who may threaten to put it in danger."
 yun.27.a: "Hurrah!"

 yun.28.t: "Zhu Peide Secures Yunnan!"
 yun.28.d: "With the last of the rebel forces being driven out of the province and the rest surrendering unconditionally, Zhu Peide has managed to achieve total victory, and his forces march back towards Kunming to celebrate the consolidation of what now seems to be the main Right Kuomintang's base of operations."
 yun.28.a: "Hurrah!"

 yun.29.t: "Zhu De Takes Over the Yunnan Academy!"
 yun.29.d: "As war rages outside of the city of Kunming, the retired General Zhu De, who resides in the Kunming Military Academy, has grown tired of the power struggles of petty warlords of the region and has decided to take action. Using his academic contacts, he has taken over the Academy with large support from the junior officers still training within it and then moved on to secure the rest of Kunming with the help of his friend, General Jin Handing.\n\nAfter gathering as many troops as they could gather, the small army was split into 2 large units With Handing leading a unit moving along the Yangzong Sea and Zhu De leading the other moving along the Dian Lake, they have pushed in a pincer movement towards the heart of the city, securing the residential area in the southwest near the lake and the industrial area in the east, both blockading the southern and eastern railroad exists from the city. With these positions secured, Jin Handing then moved on to secure the commercial district in the east, while Zhu De secured the Kunming Cultural Area in the west. With the enemies on full retreat, only some loose defenders had been left on the city centre as Zhu De and Jin Handing began pushing towards the Cui Hu Park, securing the final capture of the city and the capitulation of the garrisoned forces.\n\nWith this victory, Zhu De has consolidated his position, and has proclaimed that he will bring stability back to the people of Yunnan, no matter the cost. With his proclamation, many eager volunteers sign up for his army, as the Founder of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Bojun, sponsors Zhu De's intervention, with both keeping close contact in order to secure the homefront with the ultimate goal to restore stability back to Yunnan."
 yun.29.a: "We shall not allow some Petty Warlords to weaken our nation any further!"

 yun.30.t: "Zhu De's Forces March Westwards!"
 yun.30.d: "With a newly found army, Zhu De has recalled all of his military contacts back to Kunming, from where he's planning to do a quick campaign Westwards first, which should knock down the possibility of forces coming from Dali to seize the capital, and then focus quickly Eastwards to secure the remainder of Yunnan. General Fan Shisheng, a close friend of Zhu De, was assigned to lead the an army group towards Dali and into the Cang Mountains. With a swift advance through Anning and Chuxiong, Shisheng managed to reach the southern gate of the old city of Dali, where they faced off a weary group of defenders. Weariness of the recent conflicts however had set in, and many of the enemy soldiers quickly deserted to join Zhu De's forces, with the city of Dali formally surrendering before midnight. Now Fan Shisheng will continue to hunt down our enemies along the Cang Mountains in order to secure our flank while we focus eastwards into knocking down our remaining enemies."
 yun.30.a: "Excellent news."

 yun.31.t: "Zhu De's Forces Retake the East!"
 yun.31.d: "An Eastern Expedition, led by the charismatic Jin Handing under the orders of Zhu De, first retook the city of Qujing, leaving a sizeable garrison in order to hold out enemy counter attacks, and then proceeded northwards to secure Qianzhong. Facing weary but still dangerous opponents, Handing managed to first capture Zhaotong, then encircle the town of Bijie and then struck a blow at Guiyang, where the fighting devolved into intense urban combat. With the fall of Guiyang, the Bijie garrison surrendered before the assault on the city was conducted. The Qujing garrison was ordered to move forward towards Anshun by an emboldened Zhu De while Handing pushed southwards towards Anshun in order to perform a pincer movement and deal with the last rebel forces. With this final display of tactical superiority thanks to the Kunming Military Academy backing, both forces were able to storm Anshun and expelled the last rebel forces from Yunnan. Now it'll be up to Zhu De to decide what will the future hold for our great province."
 yun.31.a: "Wonderful."

 yun.32.t: "Lu Han Takes Over!"
 yun.32.d: "With the help of a few local Tusi militias, Lu Han as managed to seize Kunming, and has begun strengthening his lines with sympathetic KMT civilians that refuse to acknowledge Zhu Peide's command of the Third Nationalist Army. As his numbers strengthen, his enemies make their move, and it is unknown if Lu Han will be able to match them..."
 yun.32.a: "We can only hope for the best."

 yun.33.t: "Hu Ruoyu Takes Over!"
 yun.33.d: "After successful push from the Cang Mountains, Hu Ruoyu has managed to seize Kunming, first taken Bijizhen and then moving through the Western bank of the Dian River until reaching the Cuihu Park. With Hu Ruoyu and his clique in control of Yunnan, forces are quickly mobilised by the other factions to take out what seems to be nothing more than a common warlord..."
 yun.33.a: "Will he be able to bring stability to the nation?"

 yun.34.t: "Zhu Peide Takes Over!"
 yun.34.d: "With the help of the 3rd Nationalist Army of the Kuomintang, Zhu Peide has managed to seize Kunming with a swift strike from the East. Now in control of the heart of Yunnan, Zhu Peide has begun preparing to make his move and restore order to the rest of Yunnan once and for all..."
 yun.34.a: "We can only hope he's successful."

 yun.35.t: "Long Yun Retakes Kunming!"
 yun.35.d: "After being initially pushed out of his seat of power, Long Yun has managed to regroup with his forces and performed a counter-offensive on the city, seizing it with the help of his vast array of connections and his huge personal army. With the city back under his control, he now has to prepare to oust his rivals if he hopes to stay in control of the situation..."
 yun.35.a: "There seems to be no end in sight..."

 yun.36.t: "Tang Makes an Announcement of War!"
 yun.36.d: "With the collapse of the League of the Eight Provinces, Tang has decided that it was time for Yunnan to remove the autocratic despot Yuan Zuming in Guizhou and has issued a public statement for the country to begin preparations for war. With this statement, civilian unrest is growing rapidly as the current economic situation in the province is less than ideal, and many are beginning to think that the peace and stability, which have become so strange in China, may once again leave Yunnan and bring back the fires of war to the mountainous province. With many factions considering this to be last straw, Tang's control over the nation grows even weaker."
 yun.36.a: "His generals won't like this..."

 yun.37.t: "Long Yun Storms Out of Kunming"
 yun.37.d: "After several unending days of heated discussions between Tang and his staff, it has become evident that no one can convince Tang that an ousting of Yuan Zuming will disturb the fragile peace that has kept Yunnan united for so long. After facing hours upon hours of pointless debate, Long Yun has finally decided to give an ultimatum to Tang: Resign from his position or face the consequences. Tang refused, asserting his right to see the Federalist movement to its conclusion, causing Long Yun to immediately storm out of the city followed closely by his clique of loyal generals. With them gone and their destination unknown, their loyalty to Tang is now called into question..."
 yun.37.a: "This sounds bad."

 yun.38.d: "Tang has announced publicly today his intention of centralising power and sideline and reduce the influence of the many local governors, chieftains and general. With this, he promises to oppose the Qing menace with renewed strength, and to fight the enemies that both China and Yunnan face. Several high ranking officers and politicians are outright decrying Tang's actions as the ones of a tyrant. Nevertheless, the preparations for his reforms are under way, and the fate of Yunnan remains uncertain."
 yun.38.a: "I thought Yunnan was a Federalist province..."

 yun.39.t: "Long Yun Storms Out of Kunming"
 yun.39.d: "After the outrageous public statement, mass demonstrations in all the major Yunnanese cities and open criticism from most if not all the general staff of Yunnan, Tang has been forced into the negotiating table at the Kunming government house, where on the opposite end of the table sits Long Yun, representing the demands of those who have taken offence of Tang's proclamation. Their demands are simple: Tang shall resign from his post as governor, where the demanders shall assure his personal safety and allow him to keep his honour, or face the consequences for his folly. Tang has refused to accept their terms, for which Long Yun and most of the General staff have stormed out of Kunming. With their whereabouts and their intentions unknown, it seems like the instability of China has finally caught on our peaceful province."
 yun.39.a: "What is Tang doing?"

 yun.40.t: "Tang Refuses the Ceasefire"
 yun.40.d: "Despite our generals protests, Tang has refused to acknowledge Sichuan's ceasefire proposal, and is adamant about continuing the war. While some fervorous nationalists support his stance, the High Command at large disapproves of his actions..."
 yun.40.a: "What is he doing?"

 yun.41.t: "Long Yun Storms Out of Kunming"
 yun.41.d: "With the High Command openly opposing Tang's decision to continue to campaign into Sichuan, Long Yun was sent to the Capital in order to dissuade Tang from continuing. After facing hours upon hours of pointless debate, Long Yun has finally decided to give an ultimatum to Tang: Resign from his position or face the consequences. Tang refused and even mocked the Yi General of being a coward, causing Long Yun to take offence and immediately storm out of the city followed closely by his clique of loyal generals. With them gone and their destination unknown, their loyalty to Tang is now called into question..."
 yun.41.a: "This is a bad sign..."

 yun.42.t: "Long Yun Takes Over Kunming"
 yun.42.d: "Seeing Tang's regime as corrupt and that the government of [QIE.GetNameDef] is the legitimate government of China, Long Yun and many other officers of the Yunnan Clique have staged a coup against Tang. After gathering their troops at the south-eastern entrance of the city of Kunming, Long Yun led his troops through the East of the Dian Lake until breaking through the city's outer wall. Foreseeing an encirclement, Tang Jiyao attempted to flee northwards through the northern residential area in order to escape towards Sichuan, but was cut off by officers loyal Long Yun before he was able to flee the city.\n\nWith the capture of Tang, the remaining loyal forces fighting Kunming surrendered before dawn, and a committee was hastily assembled by Long Yun in order to judge Tang. However, the coup has caused great upheaval amongst the many factions in Yunnan, and Tang's trial had to be rushed due to fear of him escaping custody in case of a clash near Kunming. Accused of endangering the people of Yunnan, overall incompetence as a leader, favouritism over capable officers, treason to the Republican ideals of the province and embezzlement of public funds, Tang was forced to sign his permanent retirement from public life.\n\nWith the High Command rallied behind Long Yun's cause, it seems our small province shall evade civil discontent for now."
 yun.42.a: "Long live Long Yun!"

 yun.43.t: "Yunnan's Ambitions in Zhenyuan"
 yun.43.d: "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, an opportunity has appeared for us to remove our long antagonising rival Yuan Zuming in Guizhou province. Tang Jiyao insists on launching such a campaign, despite the internal instability, and the now palpable economic downturn Black Monday represents for our country's industries. Long Yun has advised Tang not to attack the province until said unrest has passed, but the discussion between the general members of the staff has gone sour, with many members of the cabinet threatening to outright resign if Tang decides to attack Guizhou right now. In the end, Tang Jiyao holds the final word."
 yun.43.a: "Prepare to attack Zhenyuan."
 yun.43.b: "Let's focus on reforms first, we can get them later."

 yun.44.t: "Black Monday Hits Yunnan!"
 yun.44.d: "With the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, Black Monday's ripples have travelled around the world and finally reached our beloved province. While we benefit from the great reduction in the prices of German imports thanks to the crisis, our exports are now being taxed excessively for their transport outside of Yunnan. Although we can still keep most of our industry afloat, the sudden increase in taxes and transportation costs through the Kunming-Haiphong railway and the slight reduction of tin acquisition from the international market have still hurt us badly. While we deal with the fallout, anti-German sentiment is on the rise in Yunnan, and many wonder if there is a way for our commerce to become less reliant on their economy."
 yun.44.a: "Maybe this could be a chance to break free..."

 yun.45.t: "Endorsing the Society of the Bamboo King"
 yun.45.d: "While not a popular move with the Han population, our government has deemed necessary to seek a new approach to our ethnic policy. With the endorsement of the Society of the Bamboo King, we have elevated the Society to a state organisation, which shall create a united ethnic council which will coordinate the different ethnic minorities to oppose the Han slight majority and 'supervise' the creation and enforcement of ethnic equality laws which shall, hopefully, bring the ethnic amalgam that is Yunnan closer together."
 yun.45.a: "Let's hope this was the right choice..."

 yun.46.t: "Sinicisation Policies Restart"
 yun.46.d: "While Yunnan's ethnic composition of more than 25 ethnicities has been troublesome for the previous administrations, the acquisition of Guizhou has made our Han population possess a slight number advantage. With this in mind, we should double down on the benefits Han Chinese get in order to promote immigration and colonisation as to finally secure Yunnan as Chinese province once and for all."
 yun.46.a: "Let's hope this was the right choice..."

 yun.47.t: "Agricultural Reforms Begin"
 yun.47.d: "Our first step in our plans to modernise the Yunnanese agriculture is to begin a province-wide land assessment. Our land measurement statistics date back from the days of the Xinhai Revolution and renewing them would go a long way into helping us understand the current issues in our agricultural system as well as help us draft clear goals for our reforms."
 yun.47.a: "Let's begin."

 yun.48.t: "Land Assessment is Complete"
 yun.48.d: "With the assessment of land complete, we have determined that there is plenty of room for improvement regarding the distribution and usage of arable land in our province. With this information, we have drafted a development scheme with the ultimate goal of promoting our provincial self-sufficiency, stately administer and store grain and increase the amount of overall arable land across the board."
 yun.48.a: "Onwards!"

 yun.49.t: "First Signs of Progress from our Agricultural Reforms"
 yun.49.d: "With our investments into inventory managers and storage spaces for grain as well as improving the provincial irrigation system, we have finally started to see improvements into our overall food production. Although the plan is far from complete, the effects of our reforms are starting to benefit our farmers."
 yun.49.a: "Great."

 yun.50.t: "The Next Step of our Reforms"
 yun.50.d: "With our investments complete, we have managed to establish 10 water supervision areas controlled by provincial authorities loyal to us, as well as renovating 6 large-scale water reservoirs which have in turned increased the irrigation area for our farmlands in an estimated two hundred thousand square metres. However, while our reforms have clearly improved the overall production effectiveness, it hasn't improved the life of small land owners and peasants in our province. In order to do so, we shall start preparing a series of fiscal reforms in order to reduce the overall taxation of our farmers which shall hopefully improve the amount of the capital they can dispose of, and by extension, be able to afford better livelihoods by themselves."
 yun.50.a: "It may mean fewer taxes for us, but it's more money for our farmers!"

 yun.51.t: "Finalising our Agricultural Reforms"
 yun.51.d: "The tax cuts have been a success and they have increased the overall life conditions on our province and the previous reforms have brought our agriculture to the top of China. With Sichuan embroiled in the recent chaos, our analysts agree that Yunnan has become the main Chinese province in terms of production of food and staple foods. Today is a great day for our nation!"
 yun.51.a: "All hail [Root.GetLeader] and his wisdom!"

 yun.52.t: "Yunnan Threatens Us!"
 yun.52.d: "Yunnan has begun allocating their troops along our border and are starting to prepare to face our forces. It seems like conflict may be inevitable and we should start making preparations for our defence."
 yun.52.a: "Let them come"

 yun.53.t: "The Master of the East Continent"
 yun.53.d: "Thanks to Yunnan's valiant efforts during the War of National Protection, all of China was saved from a power-hungry tyrant. For our service, Yunnan was granted huge swaths of land in compensation, which made our relatively isolated clique a hegemon in China. However, after the German intervention, several wars, skirmishes and border conflicts, Yunnan has been greatly weakened and reduced, and Tang Jiyao knows this. While he had proclaimed that he'd toe the line to keep the fragile peace we have kept with the Qing for nearly a decade, in secret meetings he has begun requesting his generals to start drawing plans. While today there's no chance of breaking the Zhili Clique's dominance, we can still prepare for when the time is right to take them down..."
 yun.53.a: "One can never be too prepared!"

 yun.54.t: "An Opportunity Presents Itself"
 yun.54.d: "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, several new provincial cliques have banded together and formed new provincial entities. While we are friendly to some, like Guangxi, Guangdong and Hunan, there are others that directly contest our sphere of influence, namely Guizhou. Now, while they are still reorganising, it would be the perfect time to strike. However, our high command has opposed this idea, citing the recent economic downturn that Black Monday has imposed on Yunnan as the reason why we should wait until we sort out our internal issues before attacking. Despite their protests, Tang has a reputation for opportunism and there has never been a clearer opportunity for eliminating a good rival in the recent years..."
 yun.54.a: "Guizhou shall be ours!"
 yun.54.b: "We should wait and see..."

 yun.55.t: "General Staff Refuses to Take Action!"
 yun.55.d: "With Tang's declaration for our armies to prepare to fight Hunan, the majority of the senior military staff of Yunnan has declared itself against such a course of action, and have ordered their troops to stand down and remain in their barracks. As tensions escalate, Tang's closest advisors have recommended him to exercise caution and to try to reach an agreement with the generals and drop the matter for the time being, even if that means allowing Yuan Zuming to slip away from our fingers. Tang, however, has not received the reports well, and has seemingly secluded himself in his home at Kunming for the time being, allegedly to reflect on the situation in order to come up with a solution."
 yun.55.a: "Let's hope he knows what he is doing..."

 yun.56.t: "Mobilising the Troops"
 yun.56.d: "With a campaign on Hunan still on the table, Tang has ordered the deployment of troops all around Yunnan to face off with the Old Guizhou troops. However, many bases have dismissed the order and have chosen to have their soldiers remain in their barracks. While this is a clear act of defiance to our government, a general without an army is a general that is only bound to be overthrown considering the chaotic nature of Chinese politics, so we need to find a way to convince them out of their barracks and to support Tang's efforts against the High Command."
 yun.56.a: "Increase their pay checks."
 yun.56.b: "They must do their duty for Yunnan!"

 yun.57.t: "An Unfortunate Price"
 yun.57.d: "Provided Black Monday's mark on Yunnan's economy, when the disobeying officers made their demands clear that they wanted their wages paid at once after months of delay, we were almost unable to pay them. However, in a lucky turn of events, Tang managed to kill two birds with one stone: Huge stockpiles of seized opium are mounting up on Yunnan's deposits, whereas our stockpiles of gold and silver are dwindling. In order to get rid of the opium in a way that would contribute to the economy and satisfy our soldiers, Tang has managed to negotiate a deal exporting the seized opium for currency.  While we were sceptical this trade deal might have gone through, it has resulted in a great success and inflow into the treasury. With this, the troops are marching out of their bases and heading towards the front line."
 yun.57.a: "Can't believe that worked!"

 yun.58.t: "Communications Break Down!"
 yun.58.d: "Our communications towards the other parts of the province have been cut off. With no way to ascertain the situation, Tang has sent out messengers to check in on the nearby cities, but we suspect betrayal from our army."
 yun.58.a: "We must prepare for the worst."

 yun.59.t: "General Meeting"
 yun.59.d: "A delegation led by the General Long Yun arrived to Kunming yesterday, allegedly representing the several officer cliques within Yunnan who presented their complains via the Yi General. As requested, the meeting with Tang Jiyao is to take place today. The Generals have set their terms clear to Tang: None of them wishes abide for an attack against Guizhou, as it is almost unanimously both politically and economically disadvantageous for the clique as a whole, and would endanger the 'Last Bastion of True Republicanism' to a crushing and humiliating defeat. While deliberations have been long, Tang has finally decided that..."
 yun.59.a: "They are right, we have bigger issues to focus on."
 yun.59.b: "They are wrong, the time is now!"

 yun.61.t: "Campaign of Disrepute Against Tang Begins"
 yun.61.d: "Scandal has been sparked today as hundreds, if not thousands, of fliers mocking Tang as an autocrat have been dispersed all over Kunming and other major cities of Yunnan. While we have been unable to track the specific source, it is believed that this is being done by other political factions opposing Tang Jiyao's rule. While disrepute campaigns aren't exactly a novelty in China, the sheer scale of it this time is concerning, and public unrest, which seems to be encouraged by our enemies, is mounting exponentially. We must act quickly if stability is to be maintained in the province."
 yun.61.a: "It seems that rats surround us..."

 yun.62.t: "The Guangdong Delegation"
 yun.62.d: "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces and the formation of new cliques near our immediate vicinity, the Yunnanese government has finally decided to organise an expedition to visit the Liangguang Clique. After a few days of travel, and silence from our delegation, they have finally reported that they have reached Nanning and have established contact with the Liangguang government. However, they are uncertain of the overall stance they should take towards them and have requested our direction. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Guangdong and Guangxi bent the knee to the Qing and fell under the jurisdiction of the League, and while Tang and Chen never officially broke off relations, it was clear that holding them at such a time would've been disadvantageous for both. As years have passed since then, the delegation wonder whether we should still treat them as our friend and ally..."
 yun.62.a: "We Federalists must stick together!"
 yun.62.b: "Even now, Chen turns away from the cause."

 yun.64.t: "Hunanese Delegation"
 yun.64.d: "While the Yunnan Clique has long been a serious contender for hegemony in southern China, there has always been one province it hasn't been able to secure: Guizhou. Despite valiantly defeating the Guizhou Clique, the interference by the Zhili lapdogs in the League of Eight Provinces prevented us from seizing control of the entirety of the province for ourselves. As such, we still hold a formal claim to the region of Zhenyuan. However, since then, the League of Eight Provinces has collapsed, and the Hunan Clique is now in possession of that land. So far, it doesn't seem like the Hunanese are hostile to us; in fact, they seem committed to the cause of Chinese republicanism. Nevertheless, they still find themselves in possession of land that is rightfully ours..."
 yun.64.a: "We don't need it, their friendship is enough for us."
 yun.64.b: "Re-state our commitment to unite Guizhou under Tang Jiyu and oust Yuan."

 yun.65.t: "Left Kuomintang Rapprochement?"
 yun.65.d: "After the failure of the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army ended up taking refuge in Yunnan. While this has been a great manpower and experience boost to our armed forces, it has been barely enough to deter the Zhili Clique from taking action against us despite our hostility towards them and the Monarchy. However, with the collapse of the League, it seems the veil of hegemony they had over China has finally been lifted, and we can finally once more dream of a free Chinese Republic. Conveniently for us, the Left Kuomintang has risen up against the League of Eight Provinces, and are quickly becoming a major thorn at the Zhili's side. As such, it may be in our best interest to keep amicable relations with them, although it may rub the surviving members of the Right Kuomintang in Yunnan the wrong way..."
 yun.65.a: "Comrade Wang shall help us save China from disgrace!"
 yun.65.b: "Zhu Peide and Li Zongren are the real leaders of the KMT!"

 yun.66.t: "The Fengtian Delegation"
 yun.66.d: "In the years before the Zhili managed to consolidate their hold on China, Tang Jiyao and Zhang Zuolin shared their goal of a unified republican China, with Tang even offering his help to Zhang during the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, managing to make gains into Hunan and Sichuan before the supply lines became over-extended, forcing the Yunnanese army to fall back to our current borders. While our defeat in the war may have been a major setback, there's no reason why it should be a source of mistrust between our governments, and as such, a delegation to their government has been proposed to re-establish formal ties."
 yun.66.a: "Send the delegation."
 yun.66.b: "We won't endorse Japanese bootlickers!"

 yun.67.t: "Seeking Support from the Left Kuomintang"
 yun.67.d: "While far from the dominant Republican faction in Yunnan, the Left Kuomintang still holds a strong informal presence in the region through people in our government like Liu Angong or Jin Handing. However, their ideological stance appears dangerous to many, as the idea of a revolution sweeping China as it swept through Russia, France and the United Kingdom still frightens many generals and public officials. As such, seeking their help to reinforce Tang's authority, while of valuable help, may yet prove counter-productive with the major Right Kuomintang groups in Yunnan..."
 yun.67.a: "It doesn't matter, let's have a toast for our socialist friends!"
 yun.67.b: "We won't associate with such rabble-rousers."

 yun.68.t: "Seeking Support from the Right Kuomintang"
 yun.68.d: "While it is clear that the group that would benefit the most from instability in Yunnan is the surviving remnants of the National Revolutionary Army, there's no denying that their influence stretches far and wide into our province. However, the loss of their leader a decade ago has certainly made an impression on their forces, as their leadership, split now between Zhu Peide and Li Zongren, has fallen victim to factionalist squabbles. Perhaps, instead of trying to antagonise our republican friends, we should instead try to mend the rift that has been wedged between us over the years. While they may never accept Federalist ideas, we can still prove to them that we are at the very least a necessary evil in order to rid China of foreign influence once and for all."
 yun.68.a: "The National Revolutionary Army is made of patriots and everyone should know that!"
 yun.68.b: "Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang are wrong."

 yun.69.t: "Rallying of the Yunnanese Federalists"
 yun.69.d: "Our first option to ask for support in order to consolidate Tang's rule is the Federalists. Loyal to Tang Jiyao since his early days as governor of Yunnan, the Federalist supporters have organised a rally on Kunming to prove their support for the governor of the province."
 yun.69.a: "Your support is greatly appreciated!"

 yun.70.t: "Public Discontent Soars"
 yun.70.d: "With our attempts at trying to rally support behind Tang having failed, now the unthinkable is happening. The local assemblies are all asking for Tang to resign, with public demonstrations occurring on almost every city, town and village around the province asking the army for Tang's removal. While none is yet bold enough to make a move against the Governor, it's only a matter of time before the enraged crowd encourages them..."
 yun.70.a: "Is this the beginning of the end?"

 yun.71.t: "Purging the High Command"
 yun.71.d: "Having reached an impasse with the High Command, Tang Jiyao's patience has run out, and unwilling to postpone his invasion of Guizhou, he has ordered his trusted officers to begin a purge of dissenting officers from Yunnan. In Kunming, officers who didn't take refuge in the Kunming Academy or fled outwards are being rounded up and imprisoned. However, the purge is reported to be fairly self-contained to Kunming. Most assemblies and officers have refused to imprison their comrades, and are now acting in defiance of Tang Jiyao's orders. As the situation continues to deteriorate, only time will tell whether Tang will be able to survive the chain of events he has just started..."
 yun.71.a: "It's a necessary move."

 yun.72.t: "Centralising Power"
 yun.72.d: "Having failed to rally any significant Republican support in the Yunnan assemblies, now any attempts that Tang makes of passing new laws or orders are constantly trumped. As such, he has staged a self-coup in the Kunming assembly, and declared the old Provincial Constitution he himself made as null and void. While this move, if successful, could centralise the province enough to grant him enough power to carry out any reforms he desires, it's also extremely illegitimate, and the assemblies of the other cities in Yunnan have already denounced his actions, as well as many other officers within the Yunnanese Army. Whether Tang will be able to weather the storm remains uncertain..."
 yun.72.a: "Federalism has failed, we need a stronger government."

 yun.73.t: "Long Yun Arrives at Guizhou"
 yun.73.d: "With our attempts at rallying the Left Kuomintang unsuccessful, as their forces now lie broken, demoralised and scattered throughout China, we have also exposed ourselves to the ire of our own assemblies and officers. With civil discontent suddenly becoming high, and seeing a potential chance to seize power for himself, General Long Yun has arrived at Guizhou, and has started assembling loyalist forces in order to march on Kunming. While we have already dispatched an army in order to meet his forces head on it remains uncertain whether our frail support base will actually remain loyal to us as the well known and respected General marches ever closer to our capital..."
 yun.73.a: "We beat him once, we can beat him again."

 yun.74.t: "Long Yun Marches Over Kunming"
 yun.74.d: "Arriving from the East, Long Yun's initial move was to surround the city of Kunming, seemingly preparing for a siege. However, by the time of his arrival, the Kunming government had already evacuated the city through the Kunming-Haiphong railway, and an emissary from within the city walls delivered the surrender of the town to the Yi General. Without firing a shot, Long Yun managed to enter Kunming and re-proclaim himself as the Governor of Yunnan in front of the Cui Hu Park, and he has promised to bring back stability to the province, once and for all."
 yun.74.a: "Wánsuí Long Yun!"

 yun.80.t: "The Yunnanese Economy"
 yun.80.d: "Yunnan is still one of the less economically developed areas in China in terms of its overall economic power, due to its mountainous terrain and poor communication with the outside world. Yunnan depends mostly on its agriculture and mining to sustain itself, and it has overall grown especially reliant on opium production and other cash crops like tobacco or sugar in order to provide for its peasants. In Kunming, the establishment of the Kunming Arsenal and textile industries in the decades prior, have also led to the development of a small industrial base for what is essentially a far-away corner of China. These seemingly unrelated economic characteristics have now grown relevant again; as Black Monday's effects have greatly destabilised the province, economic experts like Miao Yuntai have brought up huge reform plans in order to push the province out of the crisis and forward into the future.\n\nMiao Yuntai, a longtime expert on Yunnan's economy and one of China's most renowned economists, has been one of the harshest critics of Tang Jiyao's economic policies over the years. Supporting an aggressive industrialisation programme and a complete overhaul of the agricultural production in the province, Miao has presented a reform plan for Yunnan which is split into two: the agricultural and the industrial reforms. While Yunnan has, in the long run, the capacity to complete both, he argues that undertaking both programmes simultaneously would both greatly reduce our economic capabilities as well as hinder the effectiveness of the reforms. As such, he advises that, whichever reform we choose to do first, we fully commit to its completion before moving on to the next."
 yun.80.a: "We must choose carefully, then."

 yun.81.t: "Miao Yuntai Proposes Banning Opium Usage"
 yun.81.d: "Despite the reliance on the opium trade Yunnan has had for the last 20 years, minister Miao Yuntai, with a lot of support of the Kunming Assembly, has proclaimed that the opium trade has to be eliminated from Yunnan. His main argument is that, historically, Yunnan has been the second largest producer of opium in the region, being dwarfed by Sichuan which is the greatest opium producer in all of China. As such, we had never been able to keep up with their production, and they took the majority of the market's demand. On the other hand we cannot abandon it immediately, as our the majority of our governments revenue depends on it. Thus it is proposed to outlaw the usage of the drug to curfew its influence, rake in some additional money through the fines and start government programmes in order to help the Yunnanese addicts to move past their addiction. However, the final decision rests on [Root.GetLeader]..."
 yun.81.a: "Ban it!"
 yun.81.b: "Not just yet..."

 yun.82.t: "A General Abandons his Opium Addiction"
 yun.82.d: "Thanks to the efforts of our government, one of our generals formerly addicted to opium has undergone rehabilitation and is now clean of the influence from the drug."
 yun.82.a: "Leadership by example to its finest!"

 yun.83.t: "A General's Opium Addiction Worsens"
 yun.83.d: "As our reliance on the opium trade remains, it seems that the lingering effects of it in the Yunnanese society at large is starting to permeate our General staff. One of our generals has been discovered consuming great amounts of opium, clouding his ability to exercise proper front line judgement. While normally this would be grounds for expulsion from the army, and maybe even execution, we live in exceptional times and a loss of an experienced battlefield commander is unacceptable, regardless of the grounds in which it happens. As such, it falls to [Root.GetLeader] to decide what should be done with the General..."
 yun.83.a: "He probably has it under control..."
 yun.83.b: "Pay for his rehabilitation."

 yun.90.t: "Zhu Peide's Proposal"
 yun.90.d: "With the power of Zhu De secured in Kunming, Zhu Peide has sent a delegation to the capital in the name of the National Revolutionary Army. The delegates have thanked Zhu De for his assistance in securing the province, and request that he grants the seat of power over to the Right Kuomintang, particularly to Zhu Peide. While Zhu De stepped in to stop the growing civil war that was ensuing in the province, Zhu Peide invoked Zhu De's previous loyalty to the NRA and his assistance during the Northern Expedition as grounds for both men to find common political ground. However, considering their defeat on the open battlefield, this could be the perfect chance of cleaning the province from their influence..."
 yun.90.a: "The Right Kuomintang will restore China to its rightful state!"
 yun.90.b: "Zhu Peide has failed Yunnan and the Yunnanese people!"

 yun.92.t: "Zhu De Re-Unites with his Daughter"
 yun.92.d: "With all the carnage and devastation desolating China, good news have become rare to come by. As such, local newspapers quickly picked up on the search carried out by Zhu De to find his daughter in Sichuan, as his search progressed in the last few weeks. For those foreign to his search, an interview with Zhu De revealed some details of his search: Before leaving to Germany, Zhu De had married He Zhihua after meeting her in Shanghai, and in 1926, they both had a daughter, which he named Sixun. However, He Zhihua broke up with Zhu De shortly after returning from Germany, taking Sixun with her. While Zhu De had received a few hints of information on Zhihua's whereabouts over the years, he only learned relatively recently that Sixun was not with her, and so he decided to begin his search for her daughter. The failure of the Northern Expedition confined his search for young Sixun to Yunnan, but with the recent events in Sichuan, Zhu De has been able to extend his search in that area as well. Luckily for him, He Zhihua's sister had been tasked with taking care of young Sixun, now renamed Feifei by her mother, and she happened to live in Chengdu and read up on Zhu De's search posters. While the meeting took place privately and away from the press' eyes, the story has moved many amongst the Yunnanese public, who now support Zhu De's rule."
 yun.92.a: "Truly a joyous occasion."

 yun.93.t: "Zhu Peide's Condition Worsens"
 yun.93.d: "Zhu Peide has long been afflicted by anaemia, and his work as the Governor of Yunnan were bound to have a negative effect on his health. However, Zhu Peide's commitment to handling the situation personally have considerably affected his health for the worse, appearing pale and weak, and growing ever thinner with each passing week. The officers of the National Revolutionary Army have stated concerns that he may be overworking himself to death, and have sent a letter to his commander in order to convince him to take a very deserved break."
 yun.93.a: "They are right..."
 yun.93.b: "Just one more meeting..."

 yun.94.t: "Zhu Peide has Died!"
 yun.94.d: "Disaster has struck our beloved leader! Before a meeting of the Kuomintang Third Plenary Session, Zhu Peide's condition grew increasingly worse and he was asked to stay at home. However, the General, dedicated to restore China to its natural state, decided that his presence was necessary, and injected himself right before the meeting with anti-anaemic drugs he had acquired from German experts. While at first the meeting was carried out normally, it was clear the General was suffering sharp pain in his body, and was quickly taken to the Kunming Hospital. It was unfortunately too late, he was diagnosed of blood poisoning due to the injection, and there was little the doctors could do for him other than sedating him to soothe the pain. He passed away this afternoon, and now the Kuomintang has been thrown into disarray. Despite the fact he was seen injecting himself with the drugs, many are saying that his death may have been a political assassination, and the fact vandals painted 'ZHU PEIDE - A MAN WITHOUT HONOUR' in his residence in Kunming only further increase the public's suspicions. As a provisionary measure, Bai Chongxi has been nominated provisional governor of the Yunnan Province, but it remains to be seen what his plans are, and if they aligned with Zhu Peide's vision at all..."
 yun.94.a: "These are dark times..."

 yun.95.t: "Bai Chongxi Appointed as Governor of Yunnan"
 yun.95.d: "After Zhu Peide's death the Kuomintang branch in Yunnan has appointed Bai Chongxi as his provisional successor. While it is yet unclear if he will stay in this position for a longer time he gladly accepted the post. Given his proximity to Li Zongren and the New Guangxi Clique this should at least turn out to ease the tensions between our two provinces, if not give us some more direct control over the Kuomintang as a whole."
 yun.95.a: "Safe travels."

 yun.101.t: "Yunnan Sends us a Rifle Shipment!"
 yun.101.d: "As we face the German menace in the jungles, cities and forests of our nation, the Yunnan Clique, which has long been a safe heaven for sympathisers of the Indochinese anti-imperialist crusade, has decided to send us a Rifle shipment. Considering the trek from the mouth of the Mekong River must have surely been long and fraught with danger of it being stopped by the Germans, their support for our cause should be greatly appreciated, even though they may just be using us to get rid of the Germans and hence reduce the costs of utilising the Kunming-Haiphong Railway..."
 yun.101.a: "Xièxiè!"

 yun.105.t: "Sending the Ultimatum to Sichuan"
 yun.105.d: "With our preparations ready, it's now time to draft an ultimatum for Sichuan. If they acknowledge our rule, then we shall spare them, but otherwise, we shall teach the Sichuanese a lesson they won't soon forget..."
 yun.105.a: "Onwards to victory we shall march!"

 yun.106.t: "Yunnan is Threatening Us!"
 yun.106.d: "News have arrived from the South as a controversial ultimatum has reached our officials. The Yunnan Clique has issued an ultimatum, demanding us to recognise their government as the real government of China. While this is a preposterous ultimatum, the warmongering ways of the Yunnan Clique shouldn't be underestimated..."
 yun.106.a: "We won't bend to their demands."
 yun.106.b: "We have no choice..."

 yun.107.t: "Sichuan Refused our Ultimatum"
 yun.107.d: "The Sichuanese government has refused our fair and just terms for peace. While public support for the war is rather scarce, we are confident that we can defeat Sichuan given their administrative mismanagement and recent political factionalism. However, while backing out now would be humiliating, there may still be a way for peace..."
 yun.107.a: "War they shall have."
 yun.107.b: "Maybe now is not the best time..."

 yun.108.t: "Sichuan Caves In"
 yun.108.d: "Surprisingly, the Sichuan Clique has accepted the terms of ultimatum and caved in entirely to our demands. While certainly an unexpected, it's not an unwelcome one by the general staff, and our armies are already moving across the border to secure that there are nor second thoughts..."
 yun.108.a: "Splendid."

 yun.109.t: "Yunnan Backs Down!"
 yun.109.d: "In an incredible turn of events, Yunnan has decided to back down from their invasion despite their ultimatum. While this is certainly an unexpected outcome, it's not unwelcome by our government."
 yun.109.a: "It seems we'll be safe for now."

 yun.110.t: "The Sichuan Government Wishes to Surrender"
 yun.110.d: "With our successful campaign on Southern Sichuan, it seems that the Sichuanese Government has finally cracked and they have decided to send over a delegation to negotiate terms of surrender. While we have an oath to bring the [SZC_puppet_faction] to power in Sichuan as our friends and allies, we could also just look into annexing Sichuan into Yunnan..."
 yun.110.a: "We will take all of Sichuan!"
 yun.110.b: "Let's negotiate the terms."

 yun.111.t: "Yunnan is Winning the War"
 yun.111.d: "The Yunnanese Army has pushed past the border and taken the major population centres of our provinces. Mountain a defence now would be pointless, as a counter-attack in those areas would prove fruitless and even counterproductive for the people of Sichuan caught in the crossfire. We have no choice but to seek an arrangement with Yunnan."
 yun.111.a: "We have no choice but to surrender."

 yun.123.t: "Our Objective in Burma is Complete"
 yun.123.d: "With our successful crossing of the Burmese border and the capture of both Northern Shan and Kachin, our objectives in Burma are now complete. Should we continue forwards towards Rangoon or should we end the conflict and consolidate our hold in the region?"
 yun.123.a: "We've had enough, send the enemy our terms."
 yun.123.b: "We shall achieve total victory!"

 yun.124.t: "Yunnan Makes its Demands"
 yun.124.d: "After their successful offensive into Burma, the Yunnanese government have declared that they have no intention of continuing the conflict beyond their captured territory. They have offered their terms for a peace deal, which include the annexation of Northern Shan and Kachin and the creation of a new Burmese government aligned with Yunnan's governance. What should our response be?"
 yun.124.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 yun.124.b: "We refuse; this war is not over yet!"

 yun.125.t: "The Peace Treaty has been Signed"
 yun.125.d: "As stated in our terms of peace, Northern Shan and Kachin shall be annexed by our government and Burma will become nothing but a puppet for Yunnan. Today is a great day for the Yunnanese government!"
 yun.125.a: "Excellent."

 yun.126.t: "Yunnan Imposes New Government!"
 yun.126.d: "As Yunnanese troops entered Rangoon, the previous government was detained and new politicians appointed to lead a new Burmese government, which seems doomed to be subservient to Yunnanese interests. Today is a tragic day for our nation."
 yun.126.a: "It's like with the British all over again..."

 yun.127.t: "Yunnan Controls our Piece of the Shan States"
 yun.127.d: "With their successful crossing of our border and the capture of Southern Shan, Yunnan has achieved their objectives in Siam. We could offer them a peace-deal in order to save us from a protracted war, or we could continue to conflict and risk total defeat. What should we do?"
 yun.127.a: "We've had enough, send the Yunnanese our terms."
 yun.127.b: "No, we shall achieve total victory!"

 yun.128.t: "The Siamese Sue for Peace!"
 yun.128.d: "The Siamese Government has finally realised they cannot win this war and have sued for peace. We will retain Shan and they will retreat back to the Lanna Region."
 yun.128.a: "We shall accept their terms."
 yun.128.b: "We will teach them a lesson they will not forget!"

 yun.129.t: "Yunnan Accepts the Terms!"
 yun.129.d: "The Yunnanese Government has accepted the terms we laid out in the surrender, and they'll be retreating beyond the Southern Shan border soon."
 yun.129.a: "Peace at last."

 yun.130.t: "Unconditional Surrender to Yunnan Proposed"
 yun.130.d: "With the loss of the Lanna region to the Yunnanese forces, public support for the war has dropped considerably and we are forced to seek peace terms with the attackers if we wish to survive."
 yun.130.a: "We have no choice."

 yun.131.t: "The Siamese Government Offers Unconditional Surrender!"
 yun.131.d: "The Siamese Government has offered to surrender Shan at no cost for our forces after driving them back beyond the Lanna Region. With their defeat, the Southern Shan Province is finally under our control."
 yun.131.a: "Excellent."

 yun.132.t: "Siam Surrenders Shan"
 yun.132.d: "The Siamese Government has chosen to willingly surrender Shan to our government. Today is a great day for both our province and our nation!"
 yun.132.a: "Another piece of China reunited."

 yun.671.t: "Yunnan has Occupied Tonkin"
 yun.671.d: "Long Yun's warlord army has managed to seize the entirety of the Kunming-Haiphong Railway from our grasp. We should decide whether it's worth to continue this war or if we should just give up on controlling northern Vietnam and focus on more pressing matters."
 yun.671.a: "We've had enough, let's end this embarrassment before it gets even worse."
 yun.671.b: "Surely we can turn the tables on this one."

 yun.672.t: "Peace for Vietnam"
 yun.672.d: "As our forces are seemingly unstoppable we have been offered peace in exchange for full control of the Kunming-Haiphong Railway. With this we will be truly free from foreign dominance over our exports and can even attempt to build up our own merchant navy."
 yun.672.a: "A fair price for a well-fought war."
 yun.672.b: "Let's finish this war properly and control the entirety of Vietnam."

 yun.673.t: "Yunnan Accepts the Terms!"
 yun.673.d: "As Yunnan's forces have overwhelmed Tonkin without serious resistance we have been forced to give up on northern Vietnam. We can only bide our time and hope that a chance to strike back arises."
 yun.673.a: "Finally it's over."

 yun.134.t: "Yunnan Wants to Negotiate for Chamdo"
 yun.134.d: "The Yunnan Clique has approached our government in order to negotiate for transferring the province of Chamdo to them. While the negotiations were amicable, it's clear that Yunnan intends to take those lands by force if diplomacy doesn't give them what they want..."
 yun.134.a: "We don't need the province, really."
 yun.134.b: "No, Chamdo is rightful Tibetan land!"

 yun.135.t: "Tibet Accepts our Terms"
 yun.135.d: "The Tibetans have agreed to give us back Chamdo and are currently retreating back to the Eastern part of Tibet as our Army peacefully marches into the region."
 yun.135.a: "A victory for the people!"

 yun.136.t: "Tibet refuses our terms!"
 yun.136.d: "The Tibetans have refused to give us back Chamdo, and are currently starting to fortify the border to face us. How should we respond?"
 yun.136.a: "We have bigger fish to fry."
 yun.136.b: "We will take it back, by force!"

 yun.137.t: "Peace with Yunnan?"
 yun.137.d: "Having completely lost control of Chamdo, and finding it ever difficult to take it back, we have now no reason to continue fighting against the Yunnan Clique, and many in our cabinet have suggested that perhaps we should end the war now before more blood is needlessly spilled."
 yun.137.a: "We've bled enough for such a trivial territory."
 yun.137.b: "We will win or we will die!"

 yun.138.t: "The Tibetans Sue for Peace!"
 yun.138.d: "The Tibetan Government, seeing the predicament of their situation, has decided to sue for peace. How should we respond?"
 yun.138.a: "Agree to their terms."
 yun.138.b: "We will march on Lhasa!"

 yun.139.t: "Yunnan Accepts our Terms!"
 yun.139.d: "The Yunnanese Government has accepted our terms, and will be retreating back to their territory as soon as possible. Peace, once more, reigns in our nation."
 yun.139.a: "Excellent."

 yun.150.t: "Miao Yuntai Requests to Hire Canadian Tin Experts"
 yun.150.d: "As part of the ongoing economic reforms in Yunnan, the subject of the tin trade has been brought up repeatedly to Tang's attention. While there is no denying that the tin trade is extremely profitable for the province, a lack of interest and constant instability in the province have made any progress into increasing the profitability of our endeavours in tin grind to a halt. However, since the recent downturn has allowed Miao Yuntai to reach a relevant political position, he has once again pointed to the book he authored back in the early twenties: 'Outline of the Gejiu Tin Industry'. In it, he detailed how to strengthen our gains from the mining industry, and how to reduce the hold of German economic interests over our precious tin. As a first step of his plan, he has requested to bring to Yunnan a tin mining expert from Canada in order to assist in assessing the changes that will be required in order to make Yunnan's tin industry greater than ever."
 yun.150.a: "He has our blessing."

 yun.151.t: "Miao Yuntai Authorises the Renovation of Tin Production"
 yun.151.d: "With the advise of the Canadian tin expert and [Root.GetLeader]'s carte blanche, Miao has authorised the purchase and importation of modern ore washing and smelting furnaces. The modern smelting machinery would, as he put it, remedy two key weaknesses of the Gejiu tin exports. The first one would be the tin purity. The new electric furnaces, if properly operated, could raise the purity of the Gejiu tin to international standards and provide a uniformity of tin content that is necessary for direct international sales, which would allow us to bypass German economic consortiums that work as our liaison with the international market. Direct international tin sales would allow us to exclude the Guangzhou middlemen and the necessity of re-smelting, thereby concentrating the profits of the tin trade in the hands of the provincial government and our local tin producers. However, with our current lack of a foreign economic office to handle direct sales, we will be forced to utilise German intermediaries for the time being, although the new methods of tin purification will greatly enhance our income."
 yun.151.a: "Let the money flow!"

 yun.152.t: "The Yunnanese have Acquired new Tin Production Equipment"
 yun.152.d: "With the advise of a Canadian tin expert and [Root.GetLeader]'s carte blanche, Yunnanese Economic expert Miao Yuntai has authorised the purchase and importation of modern ore washing and smelting furnaces through the Kunming-Haiphong railway. While this didn't sound alarming initially, German mining experts have suggested that the modern smelting machinery would remedy two of the key weaknesses we exploit in order to cut a profit from the Yunnanese tin trade. The first one would be the tin purity. Their new electric furnaces, if properly operated, could raise the purity of the Gejiu tin to international standards and provide a uniformity of tin content that is necessary for direct international sales, which would allow them to bypass our economic consortia that work as a liaison between Yunnan and the international market. While we will still earn large profits from Yunnanese tin thanks to their over-reliance on our trade offices in Guangzhou, it may be just a matter of time before they realise this and further escape our hold..."
 yun.152.a: "We will have to keep an eye on them."

 yun.153.t: "The Fu-Dian Bank Opens their Offices in Hong Kong"
 yun.153.d: "With our successful implementation of new furnaces a year ago, Miao Yuntai began working on expanding the Fu-Dian bank's offices to Hong Kong. The reason to do so is so that these offices could realise and oversee the transactions between the Yunnan Tin Company and the buyers from the international markets without having to utilise Proxy German Mining consortia as intermediaries. With the new offices open for business, our profits from the tin trade have nearly doubled, and the profit growth seems to show no signs of stopping!"
 yun.153.a: "Break out the champagne!"

 yun.154.t: "The Fu-Dian Bank Opens their Offices in Hong Kong"
 yun.154.d: "As part of their economic reform plan, the Yunnanese government has funded the opening of new offices for the Fu-Dian Bank in Hong Kong, as a way of bypassing German companies in the tin trade industry. As their investments pay off and their offices open, so do our profits began coming from their activities in the ex-British Colony"
 yun.154.a: "'Pleasure doing business with you."

 yun.155.t: "The Yunnan Tin Company Terminates their Trade Contracts with German Companies!"
 yun.155.d: "As predicted almost a year ago, the Yunnan Tin Company has made great efforts towards increasing the purity of their tin, so much in fact that they have no longer been using our re-smelters in Guangzhou for a long time. While this change was predicted, the opening of the Fu-Dian Bank's offices in Hong Kong was not, and as a result, the Yunnan Tin Company has seen fit to rescind their contracts from German companies. The contracts stipulated that, while the Yunnan Tin Company would have complete control of the mines in Yunnan, the selling of the tin would be handled via German intermediaries. While the control of the Kunming Haiphong Railway still allows us to cut a profit from their trade via tariffs, this is a severe blow to our mining companies' interests in the region."
 yun.155.a: "I guess we can always just increase the tariffs."

 yun.156.t: "The Germans No Longer Control the Kunming-Haiphong Railway"
 yun.156.d: "After more than a decade of unfair taxation policies over our trade outwards through the Kunming-Haiphong Railway, the Germans have finally been driven out of South-East Asia. While relations with the new owner of the railway may be still shaky, there is no denying that it is a marked improvement over the German exploitative shackles of the past."
 yun.156.a: "We're finally free of the shackles of colonialism."

 yun.157.t: "The Tusi Debacle"
 yun.157.d: "The Tusi leaders of the Frontier have always presented a challenge for the provincial government. While they are generally respected in their communities, their interests usually clash with each other and our administration very often, which leads to unpleasant confrontations. So far, we've upheld their independence and we haven't tried to incorporate their domains into our government. However, as the frontier is filled with resources, perhaps it's finally time to put an end to their pseudo-feudalist rule and integrate their areas to our government..."
 yun.157.a: "It'd be better if we just ensure their loyalty."
 yun.157.b: "Attempt to integrate the Tusi to the government."

 yun.201.t: "Muhammad Ma Jian Requests Funding for Hui Schools"
 yun.201.d: "The renowned Islamic scholar and Arabic glossator has been an influential figure in the Yunnanese Muslim community, serving as a popular spokesperson for the Hui minority. While initially a student in Shanghai and comrade to the Kuomintang, his political connections and involvement with the Shanghai uprising put the esteemed theologian out of the new Central Government's good graces. Ever since, he has been a refugee back in his birthplace of Yunnan, often requesting our regional government for funding to maintain his cultural and religious projects. His latest plan is to open a new series of Sino-Arabic schools throughout the countryside, teaching the Hui both the language of Allah and the language of the great Chinese nation, and has requested our government for funding once again."
 yun.201.a: "He will have his funding."
 yun.201.b: "He'll have to help himself."

 yun.202.t: "Ma Jian Seeks to Promote Egyptian Cultural Exchange"
 yun.202.d: "Another proposal has been put forward by the famed Hui scholar, resurrecting a decades old idea Ma Jian had planned for creating a Chinese-Egyptian cultural exchange. Although nearly successful, the collapse of the British Empire and their hold over Egypt faltering saw Ma Jian unable to secure any passports to the now independent Kingdom of the Nile from the British consulate in Shanghai. Him and his students were left stranded in China, but years later he is now hoping to cash in his favour with our regional government to finally make the journey. He has petitioned us to pay for the travel expenses for a trip to Cairo, where Ma Jian will represent our both the Yunnan Clique and China as a whole, cultivating greater relationships with the Arab Nations."
 yun.202.a: "Fund his expedition."
 yun.202.b: "We don't have the funds for this."

 yun.203.t: "Ma Jian Visits Cairo"
 yun.203.d: "While contact with the Far East exists to a degree in a web of scattered embassies, it's not every day that expeditions are sent from one nation to another from each region. Today, we find an exception to this rule, as the renowned Hui scholar from China, more specifically the Yunnan province, has arrived today at Cairo with the blessing of his provincial government. With a small following of around a dozen students, they have toured the city's most important parts, and requested to remain in the city for a couple of months, where he wishes to learn arabic and began his transcription of the Qu'Ran into Chinese."
 yun.203.a: "They are welcome to stay."

 yun.204.t: "Ma Jian visits Mecca"
 yun.204.d: "While contact with the Far East exists to a degree in a web of scattered embassies, it's not every day that expeditions are sent from one nation to another from each region. Today, we find the exception to this rule, as the renowned Hui Scholar from China, more specifically the Yunnan province, has arrived today at Mecca with the blessing of his provincial government. With a small following of around a dozen students, they have toured around the city and finished their tour visiting the Kaaba. While some disagreements have been born from misunderstandings between the Chinese students and some arab scholars, it's clear that the expedition has nothing but benign reasons to visit us, and they have asked us to give them permission to tour the region for a bit before returning to China."
 yun.204.a: "They are welcome to stay."

 yun.205.t: "Ma Jian Seeks to Travel to Mecca"
 yun.205.d: "After finishing his pilgrimage around Yunnan and helping found some Hui Schools in the Frontier, Ma Jian has requested funds from our government once more to travel to Mecca. While many Muslims in Yunnan would be glad to receive news from the home of Islam after the recent news of turmoil in the region, it's not something we necessarily need to afford."
 yun.205.a: "We shall fund it."
 yun.205.b: "Who does he think he is?"

 yun.206.t: "Ma Jian Publishes Arab-Chinese Dictionary"
 yun.206.d: "Having travelled to the Middle East, Ma Jian received instruction in the region about the Arabic language, and with that knowledge, he has returned to Yunnan and drafted the first Arab-Chinese dictionary. Considering Chinese and Arabic cultural exchanges have long been plagued with issues due to the language barrier and difficulties in translation, such dictionary is bound to be helpful not just to our Muslim citizens, but for all Muslims in China."
 yun.206.a: "That's nice."

 yun.207.t: "Ma Jian Publishes the Chinese Qu'ran"
 yun.207.d: "Having long suffered from poor transliteration and standardisation, Ma Jian has finally published his own translation of the Qu'Ran, utilising his knowledge in Arabic translation to Chinese to more accurately display the teachings of Islam in the Hui schools of the province."
 yun.207.a: "I wonder if it will actually become the standard..."

 yun.208.t: "Dinosaur Bones Found in Road Works!"
 yun.208.d: "Surprising news has come from one of our road works in the area of Kunming. Apparently, as some dirt was being removed to construct the road, the workers uncovered the fossilised remains of an extinct animal. Geologist Bien Meinian was quickly contacted about the discovery, and he came rushing in to the area. After quickly conducting some analysis and with the help of some workers, he uncovered the rest of the fossilised remains of the animal. Dubbed IVPP V15, the remains are now being transported to Kunming for further analysis. As palaeontological interest in area is now surging, Bien Meinian is now conducting some land surveys on the area to examine the possibility that we have found a sedimentary rock formation that may potentially harbour even more examples. While his work did come for free, the transportation costs had to be covered by us, and while the road works have already resumed, the small delay still carries a monetary cost."
 yun.208.a: "Let's hope they find something interesting."

 yun.209.t: "Palaeontologists Flock to Yunnan"
 yun.209.d: "Led by palaeontologist and zoologist Yang Zhongjian, known as C.C. Young outside of China and the bright pupil of German Professor Friedrich von Huene, many intellectuals are now flocking to Yunnan to examine the remains of IVPP V15. While only a partial skeleton, many are comparing its sauropod-like appearance to the discovery of the Brachiosaurus altithorax, a massive Late Jurassic sauropod discovered in 1903 in Colorado. However, early measurements from Bien Meinian show that the bones most likely come from the late Triassic, causing even further enthusiasm from experts in the subject as the majority of the sauropods are not believed to have evolved until the early stages of the Jurassic Period. Still, many are sceptical, and point out that the surrounding geology may imply a somewhat later date more in line with previous findings. Another point that has brought interest to the fossils is the fact that the skeleton doesn't seem to belong to any of the known sauropod species categorised in China, and many are excited to see if this new skeleton belongs to a yet undiscovered genus entirely."
 yun.209.a: "I wonder if we can profit from this popularity..."

 yun.210.t: "Lower Lufeng Series Officially Discovered"
 yun.210.d: "Today, the National Southwestern Associated University has officially declared the Lower Lufeng Formation Series discovered in Yunnan. While the initial samples showed the area as an Upper Triassic Formation, further analysis has led Bien Meinian and other geologists to define it as a Lower Jurassic formation, clarifying that the bones of IVPP V15 could definitely belong to a sauropod. On that end, Yang Zhongjian has also finally concluded that IVPP V15 belongs to a new species of dinosaur that hadn't been found before, and named it Lufengosaurus huenei, with the first name referring to the Formation, and the second name as a homage to his tutor, Friedrich von Huene. With this announcement, dozens of small archaeological teams from different parts of China and surrounding nations have been flocking into the province to begin exploration of the area. While this doesn't represent a massive change for our government, the scientific community of the province is sure to benefit from the influx of new geologists and palaeontologists."
 yun.210.a: "Just what we needed, more intellectuals..."

 yun.211.t: "The Shockwave Out of Beijing"
 yun.211.d: "In a stunning self-coup, the emperor Pu Yi has been 'restored to power' by monarchist gunmen. As Cao Kun and Wu Peifu lay dead on the floor of the palace, the new regime was forced to contend with Wang Chengbin's Zhili remnants who had retreated to the south and Luoyang — yet their doomed resistance does not concern us. No, the dream of the Jade Marshal is dead with him, and it is the revolutionary cause that blossoms in Yunnan.\n\nFrom universities, students pour onto the streets to demand an end to traitors and the restoration of republicanism. Declaring that outdated monarchies must end, these youthful radicals urge our government to action; others, in a thousand private conversations, mutter grimly about a return to the days of anti-Manchu violence, when the Manchu Quarter of nearly every major city ran red and hundreds of Manchus hurled themselves into wells so that they might escape revolutionary fury. Notably, Beijing was almost entirely spared that onslaught — if it would be so lucky a second time is doubtful indeed.\nMany remember the federalist dream, too, and the less sensitive among them mourn Wu and Cao — false republicans, no doubt, but at least they kept the visage alive.\nTo the surprise of none, a growing number of groups also call for national revolution and brotherhood with the KMT (such as they are). Now no one knows what form the new government might take, and questions abound, but one thing is certain: Yunnan stands united as never before, in hatred of this if nothing else, if only for an ephemeral few days."
 yun.211.a: "Is there no end to indignity?"

 yun.212.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Integrates Itself into [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 yun.212.d: "Our ally, Tang Jiyao in the republican stronghold of Yunnan, has decided to fully commit to the Federalist cause by officially joining the new government in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. It will take some time for Yunnan to be fully integrated as a true Federalist bastion, but at least we can now be sure of Tang's loyalty to our cause. With the Yunnanese army having joined us, a period of reorganisation will be necessary to ensure our fighting force is not compromised. [ROOT.GetLeader] has announced his best wishes to the people of Yunnan and promises to uphold the province's autonomy."
 yun.212.a: "The Federalist movement grows stronger!"

##Shan and Kachin Events

#yun.300
 Yunnan_KAC_colonizing_1_t: "Resistance in Kachin"
 Yunnan_KAC_integrating_1_t: "Unrest in Kachin"
 Yunnan_KAC_colonizing_1_d: "With our colonisation efforts starting, many people have gathered in the city of Myitkyina, considered by many as the de-facto Capital of the Kachin people, in order to protest our advances into their territory. While hardly dangerous for our administration all the other way of the Cang Mountain Range, it still supposes a setback for our colonisation efforts in the region, specially as it may grant the protestors even greater support against us if we fail to contain them. What should we do?"
 Yunnan_KAC_integrating_1_d: "With our integration efforts starting, a demonstration has gathered in the city of Myitkyina, considered by many as the de-facto Capital of the Kachin People, in order to make their demands clear to our administration. The demonstration advocates for greater rights to be granted to the Kachin people, so that they may walk along the Chinese as equals, unlike the treatment they received from the Burmese before us. How should we respond to such demands?"
 Yunnan_KAC_colonizing_1_a: "Repress this demonstration before they gather other troublemakers."
 Yunnan_KAC_integrating_1_a: "Give them whatever reassurances we can for the time being."
 Yunnan_KAC_colonizing_1_b: "They're our subjects now, we should treat them as such, even if we are colonising them."
 Yunnan_KAC_integrating_1_b: "Send a delegation over to analyse the situation and hear their concerns."

 yun.301.t: "Status of the Kachin people"
 yun.301.d: "After a gruelling and intense campaign in the high terrain that is northern Burma, the region of Kachin has come under our control. Home to various ethnic groups such as the Shan, the Jinghpaw, the Bamar, and many others - ensuring that each group's demands are met will be a difficult task. As our efforts to colonise and bring civilisation to the state of Kachin intensifies, the question of ethnic autonomy remains. While forcefully integrating them will allow us to solidify our control over the Kachin people, the peoples of the Kachin region will most definitely prefer to maintain their ethnic independence and autonomy. What shall we do?"
 yun.301.a: "Grant them full ethnic autonomy! This is how we unite the nation!"
 yun.301.b: "Autonomy? Full integration at all costs!"

 yun.302.t: "Legislative Measures"
 yun.302.d: "As we complete the integration of Kachin, the question of local laws and customs remains. While we have our own methodology and government structure in Yunnan, the local Kachin are accustomed to their own tribal customs and laws. So as we begin to crack down on civil dissent and unrest, the question remains - shall we allow them to keep their own local customs or full integration of our government system?"
 yun.302.a: "Allow them to practise their own laws, we aren't uncivilised."
 yun.302.b: "What nonsense is this? Direct rule from Yunnan!"

 yun.304.t: "The Kokang Dynastic Crisis"
 yun.304.d: "While the process of integrating the Wa Princely states is moving swiftly, it seems that we have accidentally landed right in the middle of a dynastical spat in Kokang. While the Burmese had kept the situation under control by awarding keeping the province under shared leadership, now contesting sides of the Kokang government have approached us asking for recognition. With the death of the Myosa Yang Chun Yon in 1927, power in the area has been so far hotly contested between his son, Yang Wen Pi, and his brothers, Yang Chu jin and Yang Chun Pei. While Chu Jin and Chun Pei have shown signs of wanting to collaborate, Wen Pi has directly sent a letter to our government, stating that, so long as Yunnan protects the interest of Kokang from the 'Empire setting its sights on the Shan', he'd support our cause. With little choice between two squabbling brothers, we have sent out a small police detachment to support Wen Pi in his consolidation of power, and hopefully, this will grant us his loyalty once he becomes Saopha."
 yun.304.a: "Let's hope we don't regret this later."
 yun.304.b: "We shouldn't meddle into princely affairs."

 yun.305.t: "The Hsenwi Split"
 yun.305.d: "After the Burmese defeated Hsenwi in the 19th Century, and with the British Colonisation of Burma, the state of Hsenwi, once desired by the Qing dynasty during the Sino-Burmese war of 1765, is now a shadow of its former self. Split in half and given to opportunist loyalists in the Burmese court, we now have the ability of correcting this wrong, and give a united Hsenwi back to its rightful owners!"
 yun.305.a: "So long as they stay loyal..."
 yun.305.b: "On second thought..."

 yun.306.t: "The State of Mongmit"
 yun.306.d: "After the death of Sao Khin Maung Gye in early 1936, Hkun Hkio, now Sao Hkun Hkio, became the Saopha of Mongmit. However, unlike some of his princely co-rulers, Hkun Hkio attended university and is a recognised Bachelor of arts. While a known Burmese patriot, our experts in the region have advised that, if we guarantee the safety of his family and the continuity of his rule in the area, then perhaps we may secure the loyalty of yet another Saopha..."
 yun.306.a: "A small price to pay for loyalty."
 yun.306.b: "We'll look for other alternatives."

 yun.307.t: "Hsipaw's Princely Debacle"
 yun.307.d: "As our efforts to integrate other Shan states into Yunnan continues, we're finally on the gates of Hsipaw, one of the largest Shan states of the region. Led by Saopha Sao On Kya, the princely state is, strangely enough, very well organised. A British Loyalist, Sao on Kya is known as a benevolent ruler, who has created several social assistance programmes and whose experience in the British Education system before the revolution has drastically shifted his ideas away from the average Princely state. However, while his reputation in the area is enormous, his demands for his loyalty clearly show us his true colours. Apparently confident that his British ties will give him the upper hand in negotiations, he has demanded us to pay for the damages caused during our invasion, and to help further Hsipaw's welfare system. While some of our advisors say we should just agree to his request, perhaps assassinating him and putting a regency in charge until his son, Kya Seng, comes of age, may be more fruitful in the long term..."
 yun.307.a: "Agree to his demands; we're not here as conquerors, but liberators."
 yun.307.b: "I bet his son will be more cooperative..."

 yun.308.t: "The Padaung Coup of Mongpai"
 yun.308.d: "Mongpai, for a long time a crossroad for the Shan and the Padaung people of the Kerenni states, has recently suffered a coup d'etat, and its prince has been forced to flee to Rangoon. Apparently a side effect of our invasion in Burma, the area became destabilised, and the local Padaung launched a coup, led by Dai Bahan. Under their leadership, they have claimed a personal union with the Karenni State a bit to the south of Mongpai, and while this doesn't necessarily affect our administration, we are forced to put our own stance on the issue as the Prince could prove loyal to us, and a strong Karenni State perhaps would mean secession of this area in the future..."
 yun.308.a: "Restore the Prince."
 yun.308.b: "Let Dai Bahan keep his prize."

 yun.309.t: "The Anger of Pinlaung"
 yun.309.d: "Unrest towards our conquest and integration of the Shan region has led to disgruntled Pa'O to rise up and occupy the Mway Daw Pagoda and the Nam Hoo Kyaung Tike Temple. While they are lightly armed, they do have quite a lot of gunpowder given the traditional Pa'O practice of harnessing fire rockets. Shall we move in and crush them or perhaps let them agitate."
 yun.309.a: "What are a few monks and firecrackers going to do to us? Leave them alone!"
 yun.309.b: "Shut it down!"

 yun.310.t: "Hsatung and the South"
 yun.310.d: "In Hsatung, following the destabilisation caused by our invasion, local bandits have taken to raiding farmers' rice crops and the farmers are often powerless to do anything. They have appealed to [Root.GetLeader] for aid - what shall we do?"
 yun.310.a: "How is this our concern?"
 yun.310.b: "They are now our people and thus have our protection."

 yun.311.t: "Mongmau and Mehsakun"
 yun.311.d: "In the event of our invasion and victory, freedom fighters from the Siamese Shan have crossed into our territory and our agitating locals for fighting against our rule. While we do have the resources necessary to defeat them...are they really that big of a concern that we must waste our valuable resources?"
 yun.311.a: "No, I don't think I will."
 yun.311.b: "Monitor the border at once!"

###Flavour Events for Tang###
 yun.316.t: "Rumours that Tang is a Monarchist Spread"
 yun.316.d: "With the recent smear campaign against the government picking up steam, Tang has become the target of mockery by several parties who treat him as a Zhili bootlicker, and even worse yet, a monarchist. While Tang has refused to acknowledge these accusations, it's clear that some people are buying into the theories, and the longer this flurry of insults keeps on, it'll be impossible to secure Tang's legitimacy to the people."
 yun.316.a: "Damn it!"

 yun.317.t: "Director Maxu Weibang Contacts Tang for Another Movie"
 yun.317.d: "While many outside of Yunnan are unaware, Tang Jiyao had starred in a movie as himself back in 1923. The movie itself is known as the 'Battle of Hongxian', and was the first movie produced in the province. While ages have passed, Yunnan finds itself yet again on the spotlight of national protection, and the director of the 'Battle of Hongxian', Maxu Weibang, has contacted Tang once again with a proposal to do yet another movie. This time it'll focus on the Yunnanese efforts to seize Guizhou during the last Zhili-Fengtian war of the twenties, and while the name is yet to be drafted, it's a move that could solidify Tang's legitimacy. However, it may require some provincial funds..."
 yun.317.a: "Of course! Set the studio up for a star!"
 yun.317.b: "We can't afford this right now."

 yun.318.t: "'The Battle of Guiyang' Releases!"
 yun.318.d: "After a year and half of effort, Tang and Maxu Weibang's new movie, dubbed 'The Battle of Guiyang' has released. The movie, showing Tang as a front line commander taking the city from incompetent Zhili generals, while slightly inaccurate to the actual events, still has become a good piece of propaganda for our government, and while the movie is certainly not a massive hit in all of China, its provincial screenings have made enough proceeds to justify its cost."
 yun.318.a: "Hopefully it captured Tang's heroism..."

###Long Yun###

 yun.320.t: "Socialists in Yunnan Organise a Strike in Kunming!"
 yun.320.d: "While socialists are seemingly an unknown force outside of Kunming, today they have staged a strike near the Cuihu Park to demand for better working conditions and wages in the Textile factories. While Long Yun has refused to issue public statements on the matter, it was clear from inside sources that he felt deeply insulted and is preparing a form of retaliation. As for what kind, it remains to be seen..."
 yun.320.a: "What a strange occurrence..."

 yun.321.t: "Foundation of the Blue Party"
 yun.321.d: "The Blue Party, ironically named Qing despite being completely unrelated to the Qing Dynasty, was founded today in Yunnan, in no small part thanks to Long Yun funding his efforts. While the party seems more like a paramilitary than a proper party, considering the province only has local level elections, their leader has stated that they stand in harsh rejection of the recent strikes that took place in Kunming, and advice further rabble-rousers to stay at home or face justice from the Blue Party."
 yun.321.a: "So this was Long Yun's plan...?"

 yun.322.t: "The Blue Party Disperses a Strike"
 yun.322.d: "Despite the threats issued by the Blue Party, yet another strike was organised in Kunming, in no small part thanks to the help of the Xindianshe and their leaders. This time, with some tin miners that wanted higher pays in Gejiu as opposed to Textile workers. However, as the strikers attempted to march once more towards Cuihu Park, they were met by the Blue Party members, most of them ex-soldiers, staunch supporters of Long Yun or simply ardent anti-socialists, and a brawl quickly ensued. While the strike was dispersed, the Socialist influence reduced and there are no reported dead, there are many injured. However, Long Yun has responded positively to the news, and the fact the Blue Party's actions can't be traced back to him strangely make this an isolated incident in the eyes of the public despite him indirectly helping the Blue Party organise the brawl..."
 yun.322.a: "His bid paid off."

 yun.323.t: "Long Yun and the Cinema Scene"
 yun.323.d: "Long Yun's wife, Li Peilian, has long since been an influential figure in the Yunnanese cultural sphere. Coming from a Western Education, Li Peilian has taken a personal interest in renovating the Theatre and Cinema sections of Kunming, having funded other art exhibitions in the past. Now, with the help of Gu Yingqiu, otherwise known as 'Yunnan No.1 Beauty', and many other smaller investors and upper-classmen, Li Peilian is planning to open a top-of-the-line cinema for Kunming, which they have called the 'Nanping Cinema'. Long Yun in the past has helped other artistic works, like the establishment of the Yunnanese Opera in Kunming, for which he founded Lu Chongren to be funded by the Finance Department to setup the Drama Improvement Agency. Now that the construction of the Nanping Cinema is coming a bit short on funds, it falls to the Governor, and by extension, the government, to help with such vital infrastructure of our province."
 yun.323.a: "All for the sake of art and love."

 yun.324.t: "Long Yun Launches a Theatre Play"
 yun.324.d: "The Drama Improvement Agency has greatly helped introduce Opera to the Kunming Artistic scene. With artists coming to the province being impressed by the infrastructure put up by the governor, it should be no wonder that Kunming is quickly becoming one of China's most valued artistic destinations. With such a background, it has come as a rather pleasant surprise that Long Yun has submitted his own play for the Kunming Opera to perform. Called 'The Drama of Yunnan', it's meant to be a patriotic play to Yunnan's place in China as its vanguard in the frontier and as its role in national salvation during the National Protection War. While many critics have stated that the play has very clear anti-Zhili undertones, and that it seems to have little value outside of trying to inflate the morale of Yunnanese soldiers and citizens alike, there's no denying that many who have seen it in the theatre end up having enjoyed the play."
 yun.324.a: "Not bad...for a warlord..."

 yun.325.t: "Long Yun's Son Departs to Study Abroad"
 yun.325.d: "Long Yun's son, Long Shengwen, has finally come of age and has decided to leave China in order to study International Relations Abroad. While his trip and inscription will mean a significant cost for the Long family, many in the province are moved by Yun's commitment to education, and the cabinet has authorised to give the Long family a small loan from the government to pay for Shengwen's education."
 yun.325.a: "Best of luck to you abroad, Shengwen!"

 yun.327.t: "Long Shengwen Becomes a Millionaire!"
 yun.327.d: "Amazingly, after graduating from his university, Long Shengwen started up his own business, and in a matter of a few years, he managed to get the money back to pay for his education, and he has repaid his family the debt he incurred back when he left. It seems that Shengwen's experience is yet another proof of the strength and talent that lies in the Long lineage..."
 yun.327.a: "It seems our 'investment' paid off..."

###Zhu Peide or Left KMT leader if CHI managed to die without taking YUN with it after puppet###

 yun.328.t: "Implementing the Kuomintang's Ideals to Yunnan"
 yun.328.d: "With Yunnan's economy laying in ruins, and many scared or disheartened about the future of Yunnan and the future of China, it's no wonder that brother turned against brother in the recent uprising. Thankfully, the Kuomintang has come out on top of such struggle, and it is our duty to stand above these petty squabbles and to bring China to a brighter tomorrow. With such a thing in mind, our leader [Root.GetLeader] has authorised our government to pass a series of sweeping reforms to our province, of the kind that the frontier has never seen in a long time. While the reform programme is extensive, [Root.GetLeader] has chosen to split it into three sections, same as the three main tenets of the Kuomintang: Minzu, Mínquán and Minsheng."
 yun.328.a: "Glory to the Kuomintang!"

 yun.329.t: "The First Principle: Minzu"
 yun.329.d: "The first principle the Kuomintang has prioritised in Yunnan is that of Minzu, or Nationalism. With the dozens of ethnic groups in Yunnan, some of which have actively clashed in the past, it should be no surprise that [Root.GetLeader]'s first move is to try and unite these under a single banner. [Root.GetLeader] himself, and many other government officials have begun touring the Frontier, visiting distant ethnic groups, spreading pamphlets and giving speeches about the new way of China, one where all of them will be represented, one in which all of them are as Chinese as the people in Beijing. While many remained apathetic to [Root.GetLeader]'s message, there's no denying that Kuomintang affiliations have risen among minorities..."
 yun.329.a: "For a united China!"

 yun.330.t: "The Second Principle: Mínquán"
 yun.330.d: "The second principle [Root.GetLeader] has introduced to Yunnan is one that existed before us took over, luckily. Usually translated as 'Democracy' or 'Government by the People', in this stage of reforms, the Kuomintang has introduced their binary set of 'Powers' to Yunnan: The Zhèngquán (Power of Politics) and the Zhìquán (Power of Governance).\n\nOn one hand, Zhèngquán, commonly understood as the power of the people to express their political wishes, is now represented by the new National Assembly formed in Kunming, with the power to call for local and provincial elections, to take initiative in local projects and to allow the people to voice their wishes via referendum. While these would mean the people could normally vote out [Root.GetLeader] from power, our leader has invoked the concept of the 'Political Tutelage', in that he'll remain as leader of the Kuomintang in Yunnan until China is finally united.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhìquán represents the republican balance of powers many European and American nations uphold. However, unlike most nations which have a Congress (Executive Branch), a Senate (Legislative Branch) and a Supreme Court (Judicial Branch), the Kuomintang has now implemented Five branches for the province: The Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan, the first tree from European inspiration and the final two from Chinese tradition. With this sweeping change in structure, the old system Tang had created for the province is now fully gone."
 yun.330.a: "For the people of China!"

 yun.331.t: "The Third Principle: Minsheng"
 yun.331.d: "The third and final section of the reforms is the principle of Minsheng. Commonly translated as 'The People's Welfare', in Yunnan it means the government has introduced a land value tax, and with the proceeds that come from it, social programmes are already been drawn and passed in order to help peasants and workers improve their quality of life by subsidising food consumption, clothing and housing costs. While many major landlords have protested in front of the Kunming assembly, the reality is that this move has made [Root.GetLeader] immensely popular amongst the peasantry."
 yun.331.a: "For a fairer China!"

 yun.332.t: "Honouring the Kuomintang Past"
 yun.332.d: "With the reforms passed, the Kuomintang comfortably stands strong in Yunnan's government. However, the troubled history of the party still haunts it. With many old soldiers from the time of the Northern Expedition retiring, the memory of the heroes of the past seems to be fading as [Root.GetLeader] becomes the new Generalissimo of the party. Such a thing is a unacceptable, and plans for monuments for both Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Yat-sen have been drawn. However, while everyone agrees Dr. Sun deserves his monument in the province, many within the party have mixed feelings about giving one to Chiang. While he arguably built the National Revolutionary Army and led our forces in the Northern Expedition, it was his decisions that eventually led to its failure and the near annihilation of the party and of Republicanism in China. As the debacle escalates, [Root.GetLeader] has been forced to step in and enforce his decision..."
 yun.332.a: "Build a monument just to Sun Yat-sen."
 yun.332.b: "Build a monument both to Sun and Chiang."

##Tusi Revolt##

 yun.333.t: "Gong Shou Attacks Han Frontier Settlements"
 yun.333.d: "Given our recent disenfranchisement of Tusi leaders, some in the Western section of Yunnan have chosen to join efforts with the radical anti-Han Tusi leader Gong Shou, and have grown bold enough to attack a Han Settlement in the Frontier, killing or severely injuring most residents before our regional garrison could catch the culprits. While they remain on the run, we may need to allocate extra protection in the frontier and a hunting party to catch them, as well as compensating the residents for failing to protect them. What should we do?"
 yun.333.a: "We shall hunt them down to the last man!"
 yun.333.b: "We'll catch them eventually."

 yun.334.t: "Gong Shou has Been Caught!"
 yun.334.d: "After months of pursuit in the treacherous frontier, our forces have finally apprehended Gong Shou. As he's been transported to Kunming to being tried, the citizens of the frontier breathe a sigh of relief at the news. It seems the wild frontier is one step closer to stability."
 yun.334.a: "Serves him right!"

#Miscelaneous#

 yun.335.t: "Chen Ruzhen's Assassination"
 yun.335.d: "The Cangyuan Administration, which has been tasked with keeping the peace in the Cangyuan County in the Prefecture of Licang, has suffered a major loss today. The Police Chief Chen Ruzhen, one of the major executive members of the administration, was shot dead in his office. While the investigation is still ongoing, other officers have pointed to the Christians of Cangyuan as the culprits of the assassination. Many in the area claim that Chen was involved in crackdowns against Christians in the area, in a bid to 'purge European influence', and it seems his luck had finally caught up with him. While we've yet to issue any formal orders regarding the case, as the investigation is still ongoing, it's clear that many members of the Cangyuan Administration want retaliation against Christian groups."
 yun.335.a: "Christians being relevant? In China?"

 yun.336.t: "Retaliation in Cangyuan Fails"
 yun.336.d: "While the investigation of Chen Ruzhen's murder is still ongoing, 300 men, between policemen and local militias, were sent to Cangyuan to retaliate against the Christians without our consent. In the first instance, a street brawl ensued and they were forced to retreat back to Lancang. With the town seemingly on open revolt, 100 of the 300 men were sent back to pacify the county. After a few days and a few requests of explanations, we've received a full report from the Cangyuan Administration of that last expedition: One of the men fired a weapon towards the civilian crowd (even though it is unknown if it was provoked), and apparently killed one of the residents, sparking yet another street brawl, where most soldiers were able to escape unharmed, but they were still kicked back to Cangyuan. It seems that the Christians there are becoming more than a small nuisance, we will have to give the Licang more assets to deal with this apparent insurrection."
 yun.336.a: "How the..."

 yun.337.t: "Retaliation Strike in Cangyuan Succeeds"
 yun.337.d: "With express orders from our government to restore order in the town, the Cangyuan Administration assembled a small militia of 2000 men and sent them to finally pacify the area, although we gave specific instructions to prevent yet another bloodshed like last time. After four months of efforts, the militia has been recalled and the reports are overall positive. While in the end there were eleven civilian casualties and twenty three wounded, the town is finally firmly under our control once more, although some within the Cabinet and the Kunming Assembly have proposed to investigate the Cangyuan Administration for illegal Religious persecution, which may be the way to prevent these revolts in the near future."
 yun.337.a: "Finally."

##Events for effects of civil war events

 yun.350.t: "The Battle of Chuxiong"
 yun.350.d: "With a lack of artillery support, our forces tried to move into the city via the river bridges. However, the defenders were well positioned, and a few well placed machine guns on the bridges were able to hold off our advance for hours, inflicting multiple casualties to our forces. In the end, our forces were required to fall back, and the West remains in rebel hands."
 yun.350.a: "Damn."

 yun.351.t: "The Surrender at Chuxiong"
 yun.351.d: "After the artillery was put in place near the city, the surrender ultimatum was issued, and foolishly ignored by the rebels. The artillery pieces then began concentrated fire near the mouth of the bridges that gave access to the city, in preparation for an infantry assault. With the defenders at the bridge swept by the Artillery barrage, our infantry was able to make quick work of the defenders and capture the city, securing our western flank and allowing us to look eastwards."
 yun.351.a: "Excellent."

 yun.352.t: "The Battle of Qujing"
 yun.352.d: "With orders to hold the entrances to the valley, our soldiers positioned themselves both at the lower ends of the valley and the hills surrounding it. As the rebel forces came close, the narrow nature of the entrances and the usage of the high ground by our own forces was able to hold the entrances to the city against a seemingly more numerous foe."
 yun.352.a: "Good job."

 yun.353.t: "The Battle of Qujing"
 yun.353.d: "With our forces falling back into the city, the enemy took hold of the valley entrances and positioned several divisions on the hillsides. While the battle is still raging in the city, it's clear that with their forces in the hills we will be unable to push them out without suffering heavy casualties, and our officers are advising us to retreat from the valley and focus our forces elsewhere."
 yun.353.a: "What a blunder..."

 yun.354.t: "The Capture of Anshun"
 yun.354.d: "After waiting for a day, Long Yun's forces moved into Anshun, and found that the defenders had kept their promise. The elderly, children and women had been evacuated, and their force had retreated, allowing us to take the city without any fighting. However, locals who decided to stay have stated that the force that retreated was several times larger than the new occupiers, so maybe not engaging was actually the wisest choice..."
 yun.354.a: "What a weird turn of events..."

 yun.355.t: "The Capture of Anshun"
 yun.355.d: "With our soldiers trying to assault the city right away, it became clear that the defenders were a lot better prepared than our forces were to held the city. After repelling our attacks repeatedly, our officers had no choice but to retreat. It seems the evacuation forces were a lot more numerous than our offensive force was..."
 yun.355.a: "That's unfortunate."

 yun.356.t: "The Battle of Bijie"
 yun.356.d: "With a part of our forces diverted to attack from an unexpected flank in the north of Bijie, the defender force became distracted by our diversionary frontal assault. As the frontal assault unfolded, our other force flanked the defenders and turned the one-sided defence into an encirclement, quickly throwing the enemy forces off-balance and allowing us to take the strategically important town of Bijie."
 yun.356.a: "Great job."

 yun.357.t: "The Battle of Bijie"
 yun.357.d: "While we tried focusing our efforts into punching through the main defender line, a lack of artillery and well dug and devised defences in the valley entrance made us unable to secure any footing into the town. Having suffered heavy casualties, are assault has been called off and we'll have to rethink our strategy if we wish to take back Bijie from the Rebels for good."
 yun.357.a: "What a disaster."

 yun.358.t: "The Defence of Bijie"
 yun.358.d: "With our forces scattered in the night attack and the order to fall back to the roads being issued, the bulk of the enemy force managed to take the city, and without any solid grounding to defend our position, we have been forced to retreat from Bijie as a whole to a defensive position closer to Kunming, which may prove to be a shaky defence line later on..."
 yun.358.a: "That's not good..."

 yun.359.t: "The Defence of Bijie"
 yun.359.d: "Despite the starting confusion for the night raid, our order to dig in and hold managed to reach our officers, which quickly began organising our forces to defend the Bijie from the rebel forces. After hours of furious urban combat, the enemy force finally chose to retreat, and we remain yet in control of the city, which we can now use as a staging ground for our invasion of Western Guizhou."
 yun.359.a: "Excellent."

 yun.360.t: "The Storming of Guiyang"
 yun.360.d: "The order to secure Guiyang first came at a high cost. The defenders in Qingzheng, well prepared and dug in to fend off our force from the South-West easily repelled their attack, and while our forces managed to fully seize Guiyang, the defenders and Qianzhong have started pushing into the city, and without the backing of the Southern Force, we'll be forced to cede some ground before we can deliver a final blow to the rebels."
 yun.360.a: "We should've moved faster..."

 yun.361.t: "The Storming of Guiyang"
 yun.361.d: "With orders to march straight into Qinzheng from Guiyang, we were able to pincer the defenders there and encircle the enemy forces. With no room to escape, they quickly surrendered and the Western area of Guizhou seems to be under total control of our regime"
 yun.361.a: "Excellent."

 yun.362.t: "The Battle of Jinghong"
 yun.362.d: "With a significant group of our troops scattered at the forest, the enemy force was able to reorganise their defence and mount a counter-attack on our position, forcing us to fall back and leave Jinghong in enemy hands."
 yun.362.a: "That's not good..."

 yun.363.t: "The Battle of Jinghong"
 yun.363.d: "With a brave order to attack the city directly, our forces were able to surprise the defenders and seize the city after some fighting. It seems that, at least for now, the Southwestern flank of Kunming is secure"
 yun.363.a: "Wonderful."

 yun.364.t: "Battles in Guiyang and Zhaotong"
 yun.364.d: "With the bulk of our supplies having gone to Guiyang, we were able to hold our position in Guizhou. Although we lost control of Zhaotong, We can yet encircle the rebel forces in the northern area and pressure them to flee towards Sichuan."
 yun.364.a: "Wonderful."

 yun.365.t: "Battles in Guiyang and Zhaotong"
 yun.365.d: "With the bulk of our supplies having gone to Zhaotong, we were able to hold our position in the northernmost area of the Kunming region. However, the loss of Guiyang has greatly strengthened the rebel forces in the East, and even though we achieved victory in Zhaotong, it's not a victory that will guarantee a swift end to this rebellion."
 yun.365.a: "We'll have to keep trying."

 yun.366.t: "The Defence of Chuxiong"
 yun.366.d: "Having prepared for a protracted and elastic defence, our troops first engaged the enemy forces near Guanyin Mountain, being forced to retreat to the banks of the Longchuan River and into Chuxiong proper. As the enemy casualties mounted, it was clear that they couldn't penetrate our defence and that they had lost their momentum, and they began retreating. Quick to seize the opportunity, our officers took the initiative and began chasing them back into Dali, and we expect them to secure the area anytime soon."
 yun.366.a: "Excellent."

 yun.367.t: "The Defence of Chuxiong"
 yun.367.d: "Having prepared for a static defence, our troops engaged the full bulk of the enemy forces to the side of the Longchuan River. While we were able to hold the line thanks to some well placed machine guns in the bridge crossings, enemy artillery support, while scarce, eventually pulverised our positions, and as the enemy with superior numbers began pouring into Chuxiong, our officers had no choice but to order a full retreat towards the valley at the Northeast and protect Kunming directly from a seemingly impending attack from the enemy that now occupies Chuxiong."
 yun.367.a: "Damn."

 yun.368.t: "The Battle of Jinghong"
 yun.368.d: "Having split our forces, we were able to pincer the enemy and secure Jinghong for our forces. While we found little proof that they were being supplied through the Lancang River, we now know for sure that they won't be getting resupplied anytime soon!"
 yun.368.a: "Great news."

 yun.369.t: "The Battle of Jinghong"
 yun.369.d: "With our force trying to push into a narrow valley, the enemy force quickly staged a defence against our forces, and even though we had the element of surprise, we were unable to break their defence. While our officers have not decided to pull out from the area just yet, it's clear that they lack the strength to deal a decisive blow to the defenders, and as enemy forces reorganise elsewhere, this defeat could cost us dearly."
 yun.369.a: "Dammit."

 yun.370.t: "The Battle of the Luojiang River"
 yun.370.d: "Having chosen to push them Eastwards, our forces managed to rout the enemy from their defensive positions. However, and to our great detriment, they were properly reinforced from Bijie in their retreat, and instead of facing two small, separate forces, we are now facing one single, large enemy contingent in a narrow valley. Our advance has been completely halted, and this may prove to be a decisive mistake if the enemy manages to reorganise in Guiyang."
 yun.370.a: "That's not good..."

 yun.371.t: "The Battle of the Luojiang River"
 yun.371.d: "Having chosen to push the enemy into the north, our forces were quickly able to rout the enemy from their defensive positions and push them into the Sichuan border. Stuck between the Sichuanese Border and our forces, the enemy commander decided to surrender to our forces, and now our army marches victoriously eastwards, albeit facing some enemy opposition. It seems that the campaign is running smoothly, for now..."
 yun.371.a: "Excellent."

 yun.372.t: "Skirmishes Near the Lancang Valley"
 yun.372.d: "With the order to retreat, our forces, battered and bruised, have successfully managed to evacuate the Western part of Yunnan. Unfortunately, while this saves us some manpower, it only means that we have given the enemy more time to breathe freely and organise against us."
 yun.372.a: "Well, those aren't necessarily bad news, are they...?"

 yun.373.t: "Skirmishes Near the Lancang Valley"
 yun.373.d: "Having ordered our troops to assault the enemy positions, we were able to catch the enemy off-guard and overrun their positions. Now Baoshan stands under our control, and with it, we will soon be able to secure the Western part of Yunnan."
 yun.373.a: "Wonderful news."

 yun.374.t: "Results of the Bijie Attack"
 yun.374.d: "Having chosen to attack the town of Bijie proved to be the right choice, the defenders were still scattered and regrouping after our takeover of the capital and expecting reinforcements from Guiyang to mount a proper defence. With this, we have managed to somewhat equalise our forces with those stationed in Western Guizhou and we have managed to open up a path towards Guiyang for future attacks."
 yun.374.a: "Great news."

 yun.375.t: "Results of the Guiyang Attack"
 yun.375.d: "Having chosen to attack Guiyang directly has proven to be a disastrous choice. Not only were our men outgunned, but enemy forces were also able to flank our troops from Bijie's valley passes, forcing our army to march back to Central Yunnan while suffering heavy losses. While the war is sure to be long, we seem to have started with the wrong foot."
 yun.375.a: "We're still in the fight."

 yun.376.t: "Capture of Dali"
 yun.376.d: "With our troops having marched westwards, we have managed to reach the old city of Dali, and the enemy threatening Yuxi has chosen to retreat back to Baoshan, seemingly with the intention to attack us and retake Dali. While this is decisive victory, whether this will win us the war or merely extend it is yet to be seen."
 yun.376.a: "A victory is still a victory."

 yun.377.t: "The Loss of Yuxi"
 yun.377.d: "With our forces having concentrated on Yuxi to hold the front line, we were initially able to contain the enemy advance. However, as the battle dragged on, the geography surrounding Yuxi played against our forces, as an enemy detachment flanked eastwards heading first to Lake Fuxian and then turning Westwards to encircle Yuxi. In the panic, our officers ordered to break out, and while the breakout attempt was successful and the bulk of our force was able to retreat, we still loss Yuxi, and our chances of attacking the West now are looking dimmer by the day as an enemy army marches near Kunming."
 yun.377.a: "We'll still fight tooth and nail for every inch of Kunming."

 yun.378.t: "Retreat from Songshan Mountain"
 yun.378.d: "As our man packed up and fled their defensive positions, the enemy forces occupied the mountain pass. While we have spared ourselves unnecessary losses, we have decisively lost control of the western section of Yunnan, and that may cost us dearly when we go forward to retake the East."
 yun.378.a: "A soldier that runs away can fight again."

 yun.379.t: "The Songshan Mountain Defence"
 yun.379.d: "Having ordered our troops to stay, we were able to hold off the enemy advance. Despite all efforts from the rebel forces to break through, wave after wave was repelled at the mountain. While the treacherous valleys and mountain passes of the Frontier may still be crawling with enemies, Baoshan and the West remain firmly under our grip."
 yun.379.a: "Wonderful news."

 yun.380.t: "The Bijie Gamble is Unsuccessful"
 yun.380.d: "Having chosen to focus on the warlord forces, the National Revolutionary Army forces ended up becoming strong enough to knock us out of Bijie. While our forces still block their passage to Kunming from Bijie, it's clear that they have all the intentions to punch through our lines now that they know that they have the upper hand."
 yun.380.a: "Those are bad news..."

 yun.381.t: "The Bijie Gamble is Successful!"
 yun.381.d: "Having chosen to focus on the National Revolutionary Army, we were able to easily knock them out of Bijie and force them into a full retreat before we turned to dealing with the smalled, scattered forces in Bijie, presumed to be Hu Ruoyu's forces. Before the night, they had all surrendered and Bijie now stands solidly under our control, poised to help us in our Eastern offensive."
 yun.381.a: "Great news!"

 yun.382.t: "The Qianzhong Sympathisers Remain Undercover"
 yun.382.d: "While our forces weren't discovered, the National Revolutionary Army has consolidated in the Region and now the possibility of us beating it in direct confrontation is next to impossible."
 yun.382.a: "Damn."

 yun.383.t: "The Qianzhong Sympathisers Successfully Stage an Uprising"
 yun.383.d: "As the National Revolutionary Army's forces tried to regroup, our undercover agents were able to mount a successful insurrection and are now in control of Qianzhing, securing most of Guizhou for our forces."
 yun.383.a: "Yet another victory for the real Kuomintang!"

 yun.384.t: "The Yulong Mountain is Successfully Defended"
 yun.384.d: "Having chosen to relive the defenders, our forces were forced to engage the encirclement surrounding the mountain. While the casualties were plenty, our Forces arrived just in time and relieved the defenders, securing our western flank from the enemy forces."
 yun.384.a: "Their heroic defence won't be forgotten!"

 yun.385.t: "The Battle of Yulong Mountain Ends in a Defeat"
 yun.385.d: "Without any relief coming their way, the defenders decided to surrender in order to avoid unnecessary casualties. The Enemy now safely controls the Western Section of Yunnan."
 yun.385.a: "Damn it."

 yun.386.t: "The Guixi Pincer"
 yun.386.d: "Having chosen to flank the enemy in Guixi, we were able to make short work of our enemies in the East, and we can now look back at the West to secure our position in Kunming!"
 yun.386.a: "Onwards!"

 yun.387.t: "The Redeployment of Troops"
 yun.387.d: "Having chosen to redeploy our troops back to protect the West, we have unfortunately lost our footing in the East, and while we have our Western Flank protected, maybe our inaction in the East will lead our enemies to reorganise near Guizhou..."
 yun.387.a: "At least Kunming is safe."

 yun.388.t: "Tangalang River Perimeter Broken"
 yun.388.d: "Having chosen to send a detachment to flank the attackers from Dali, we have unfortunately weakened our front line too much and the enemy was able to break through before our officers were able to perform their flanking manoeuvre. While they can still retreat through a different mountain pass to rejoin our forces, our position in Kunming is compromised and we may have to retreat to the countryside once more..."
 yun.388.a: "Pft! Cavalry officers..."

 yun.389.t: "Western Frontline Holds"
 yun.389.d: "Having chosen to maintain the strength of the Tangalang River Perimeter, we have managed to repel the enemy attacking forces and our cavalry officers have seized the initiative and pursued the enemy back to Dali. With the fall of Dali, it seems that the West is now solidly within our grasp."
 yun.389.a: "Great work!"

 yun.390.t: "Zunyi Garrison Suppressed"
 yun.390.d: "Having chosen to take the long way around, the Zunyi loyalists were suppressed by the enemy forces. While their sacrifice will be remembered, our position in the East is now in jeopardy, and our expedition will need to fall back to Kunming in case our enemies grow bold and decide to strike..."
 yun.390.a: "If only we had trucks..."

 yun.391.t: "Zunyi Garrison Relieved"
 yun.391.d: "Having chosen to head directly towards Zunyi, we have managed to overwhelm the enemy defenders in the encirclement around Zunyi, and we have managed to relieve the defenders. Now, the enemy retreats back to Guizhou, and our position in the East seems ever more secure by the day..."
 yun.391.a: "No one is left behind!"

 yun.392.t: "Infiltration Strike Fails to Cause Effect"
 yun.392.d: "Having chosen to bypass the Songshan Mountain Pass, our forces have reached Baoshan, but unfortunately we took too long, and the enemy, which had been already informed by scouts from the mountain, had already prepared a defence by the time our forces arrived at the area. While some skirmishes in the region are still ongoing, it's clear that the bottlenecked nature of the region means that losing our element of surprise and having no inherent terrain advantages means that we will have to retreat or risk a war of attrition we currently can't afford."
 yun.392.a: "Damn It."

 yun.393.t: "Songshan Mountain Assault Successful!"
 yun.393.d: "In what many could describe as either a heroic or desperate show of force, our forces charged the mountain defenders in a bid to reach Baoshan before the rebel forces could organise. Despite several well placed machine guns inflicting heavy casualties in our forces, we were able to break through the defence, and quickly reach Baoshan. While scouts from the mountain defenders had reached Baoshan before us, we were still able to reach the city before the defenders organised, and with our forces having stormed the city, Baoshan and by extension the Western Frontier are now safely within our grasp."
 yun.393.a: "An example for all of us."

 yun.394.t: "Xingyi Siege Finishes Successfully"
 yun.394.d: "Having left a small garrison to finish the siege of Xingyi, many feared that we would be splitting our forces as Chiang did, weakening both and ending in a catastrophic defeat. However, we proved them wrong, as our advance through Guixi has managed to catch the defenders of Anshun completely by surprise. As our forces finished routing the rebels from Anshun, we received reports from Xingyi that the troops left behind received the surrender request of the defenders, and now Guixi is solidly under our control."
 yun.394.a: "Great job!"

 yun.395.t: "Xingyi Siege Finishes Successfully"
 yun.395.d: "Having left the bulk of our force in Xingyi, we received the surrender of the defenders, and after occupying the town, our forces moved northwards towards Anshun. However, by the time our forces made it there, the enemy had already entrenched itself in the city. While we managed to push through their lines, we have suffered heavy casualties and we have been delayed considerably."
 yun.395.a: "How unlucky can we be?"

 yun.396.t: "Detachment Secures the Bridge"
 yun.396.d: "Having sent an infantry detachment north, we began staging probing attacks against the enemy forces, hoping that in such a way they would perhaps ignore our flanking manoeuvre. As our scheduled all-out assault began, our detachment closed in from the north with almost perfect timing. The flanking caught the defenders almost completely off-guard, and while their entrenched positions were hard to clear out and a savage close-quarters Combat ensued in the narrow streets of Xingyi, we were quickly able to rout the enemy, push south to meet the southern force."
 yun.396.a: "Great!"

 yun.397.t: "Our Forces Fail to Breakthrough"
 yun.397.d: "Having decided to prioritise speed over caution, we have unfortunately paid the price. The Defenders completely repelled our attack, and we have suffered severe losses in the process."
 yun.397.a: "Damn it!"

 yun.400.t: "The Shan Princes and Kachin Revolt"
 yun.400.d: "While we were busy preparing for war in a different front, the Shan Princes and the Kachin Rebels managed to amass enough forces in their lands to push out our forces from their territory. While we can formally declare war on them, it is clear that they will not submit to us anymore, and as such we could just leave them alone. What should we do?"
 yun.400.a: "They shall regret having defied us."
 yun.400.b: "We have no choice, we can't afford another front."
 yun.400.c: "Kachin will prevail!"
 yun.400.e: "Shan will endure!"

 yun.401.t: "Tang Jiyao Announces Centralising Reforms"
 yun.401.d: "With the adoption of Federalist laws and constitution, the executive power in Yunnan has always been severely decentralised, and while Tang has always been a defender of democracy and provincial autonomy, such idealistic sentiments are not compatible with Yunnan's current political situation. While his fellow federalists to the east in Guangdong and Hunan try to promote their causes to the Jade Marshal, Tang understands that such efforts are futile and federalism can only truly succeed if the southern federalists establish themselves as the dominant powers in China. However, in order for federalism to achieve such heights, the federalist movement must also be prepared to adopt some minor centralist and militarist policies."
 yun.401.a: "For the good of China and the Federalist movmement."

 yun.402.t: "Local Government Powers Reform"
 yun.402.d: "As the grip of the Zhili Clique grows weaker on China, Tang has decided that, in order to further consolidate his grip on the province, a revision to the local government assemblies has to be made. While the local provinces elect their own candidates for the assemblies, this has created a weird mix of somewhat conflicting governments, which have drifted away from Tang's Federalism and more into the Revolutionary Republican lines of the KMT and even warlord-supportive assemblies like in Baoshan. As such, passing coherent reforms from one extreme to the other of the province has become extremely difficult, and instead of continuing to use this system, Tang has opted for replacing the heads of these assemblies with his own trusted candidates. While this move is quite obviously undemocratic, he argues that it is a temporary move as the transition to a Federalist system begins. In order to further strip power away from the warlords and the KMT, he has simultaneously passed a decree in which the Head of each local assembly now has the ability to handle the redistribution of land from feudal landholders to the peasants, as well as encouraging the free trade between the different assemblies instead of having Kunming regulate their internal affairs. Though some detractors from the Kuomintang have openly criticised the move for deposing their comrades, the public results of the reform have made Tang publicly more popular, and that should force them to remain largely silent, even if the move directly hinders their power in the province."
 yun.402.a: "A new step towards Federalism? Or another step towards authoritarianism?"

 yun.403.t: "Provincial Constitution Expansion"
 yun.403.d: "Based on Chen Jiongming's 'Reconstruction Plan' (Jianshe Fanglue), Tang had passed a constitution for approval years ago in which it detailed a system of shared authority between the Central and local governments. Since China as a whole is still far from being united under a Central government, this meant that Kunming and each local assembly would follow a decentralised ethos, encouraging the use of trade and professional organisations as the primary organisational units in cities, while villages and counties would retain their traditional subdivisions, among many other principles. However, back in the first implementation, Tang sidelined plenty of the points Chen made, like reducing the Executive Power of the President to a mere figurehead, where the executive power would be held by the assembly in charge, where Tang held to a much greater degree of power as governor of Yunnan than his fellow federalists, and he has allowed the creation of legislative bodies that were, on all levels, handled and organised via popular and direct voting of the people but in a form that allows him to maintain stability. However, Tang is willing to loosen his control over the legislative bodies now, as it will allow Tang to close ranks even further with his fellow Federalist supporters."
 yun.403.a: "Centralised Federalism?"

 yun.404.t: "The Future of the Yunnan Clique"
 yun.404.d: "With the final struggle in China growing ever closer, Tang finally has the chance of deciding once and for all what the fate of the mountain province will be in the grand scheme of China. While Tang is a staunch federalist, being the co-founder of the Public Interest Party himself and having endorsed many of their policies, it's clear that he is not entirely on board with Chen's more decentralised version of federalism. Chen and Zhao's collaboration with Wu exacerbated tensions, as Tang remained nominally aligned with Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Government until the latter's passing in 1925. Regardless, Tang recognises that the federalists must be one, or their movement will disintegrate. However, unrest runs rampant in the two Guangs, and Tang watches with great concern for the future of federalism."
 yun.404.a: "We shall fight for Chen Jiongming's Federalist banner!"

 yun.600.d: "The once-peaceful province of Yunnan seems to have finally caught fire, as Tang Jiyao's missteps have finally led to an open revolt from his General Staff. Led by the Yi General Long Yun, a huge army of loyalists marched on the city of Kunming, moving in from the South and finally taking the city at the end of the day. Governor Tang Jiyao has been confirmed to have resigned and large scale uprisings are being reported throughout the once-hegemonic province of Southern China. Many experts suspect that behind these uprising lie both the surviving Right Kuomintang forces, the National Revolutionary Army, led by Zhu Peide and the Warlord forces following General Hu Ruoyu, a long time rival of Long Yun.\nAs armies mobilise in the narrow valleys and tall mountains of the Mountainous Province, the future of the region remains uncertain."

Now, the Yi General will now be tasked with looking inwards into repairing Yunnan and whipping back into fighting shape. As for what will Long Yun utilise his armies when looking outwards, time will tell whether his leadership will start another age of Yunnanese hegemony, or mark the end of Yunnan as a belligerent province in the region."

With such an ambitious declaration, many wonder whether this seemingly isolated far-away corner of China will truly be able to revert the crushing defeat of the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition and bring back a United China under the ideals of Nationalism, Democracy and Welfare..."

As the situation deteriorated further and further, Zhu De assembled an army with both eager volunteers from the Kunming Academy and exhausted warlords, and then decided that it was time to strike and managed to achieve a decisive victory against the exhausted rebel forces. However, there are reports that Kuomintang forces led by Zhu Peide have sent a delegation over to Kunming, and Zhu De's promises to handle back Governorship to a Civilian Government seem compromised.

Many Korean revolutionaries and nationalists in exile sought the safety of Chinese military academies and republican movements with the hopes of perhaps one day returning home.\nLike many others, Kim Hong-il found himself in exile and travelled to the far southwest of Guizhou for military instruction, where he met He Yingqin. In 1926, Hong-il joined the National Revolutionary Army and participated in the doomed Northern Expedition. After its failure, Hong-il fled with Yingqin and the remnants of the rightist faction of the Kuomintang into Yunnan. However, with the victory of the Chinese over their Japanese adversaries in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Hong-il has officially announced his resignation in favour of serving in the new Korean republic."

 YUN_Purchase_Artillery_desc: "Artillery became a deal breaker for most nations during the Great War, and its recent usage both inside and outside of China have greatly proven that indirect artillery fire rules the modern battlefield. In order to prepare Yunnan for this kind of warfare, we should invest into importing Artillery pieces into the region."

 YUN_overhaul_the_Kunming_arsenal: "Overhaul the Kunming Arsenal"
 YUN_overhaul_the_Kunming_arsenal_desc: "The Kunming Arsenal has provided our Army with top quality rifles for years now, and it has had a pivotal role in our victories in the past. Without it, our army would amount to a disorganised peasant militia armed with pitchforks. As such, an overhaul in order to improve working conditions and improve production capabilities is in order, so that Kunming may produce the best rifles in all of China."

 YUN_artillery_assemblies: "Artillery Assemblies"
 YUN_artillery_assemblies_desc: "While the Kunming Arsenal does a superb job in producing Rifles, the recent importance and influx of Artillery from the outside has proven that we need to extend its production to new horizons. While it may be costly, it will be a necessary sacrifice in order to have enough artillery to come out ahead in the upcoming conflicts that loom over China."

 YUN_focus_on_support_equipment: "Support Equipment Production"
 YUN_focus_on_support_equipment_desc: "It's not only guns and artillery pieces that we will need to win the battles to come. We will also need shovels, tents and other kinds of auxiliary equipment for our engineers and scouts to use. In order to become more self-sufficient, instead of importing these from Germany as we have so far, we should instead foster the production of this material locally."

 YUN_Prioritize_our_manpower: "Prioritise our Manpower"
 YUN_Prioritize_our_manpower_desc: "While Weapon production and Tactics will be invaluable in the field of battle, we cannot fight a war without men. Yunnan, has a relatively low manpower pool compared to other provinces, and as such, we should look for ways to expand it in order to catch up with other cliques. With our already established advantage in tactics and equipment, and solving our weakness in terms of manpower, we will be unstoppable!"

 YUN_modernize_our_rifles: "Modernise our Rifles"
 YUN_modernize_our_rifles_desc: "While the Kunming Arsenal has provided us with top notch equipment for years, there is no denying that so far we have been using knock-off Mauser rifles for years. Maybe well crafted knock-offs were enough to earn us victory in the past, but the time has come to adopt a new standard Rifle. We will import new tooling for the Kunming Arsenal in order to start producing more up-to-date rifles."

 YUN_reverse_engineer_german_pieces: "Reverse Engineer German Artillery Pieces"
 YUN_reverse_engineer_german_pieces_desc: "German Artillery has found its way into Yunnan as a way of payment for some tin shipments in the past. While these artillery pieces are immensely useful, their craftsmanship remains a mystery to us, and this may prove to be a disadvantage in the battles of tomorrow. We shall import a shipment of the newest Artillery pieces the Germans have to offer and reverse Engineer it in order to learn its secrets."

 YUN_engineer_corps: "Engineer Corps"
 YUN_engineer_corps_desc: "Yunnan is a province of contrasts. Large mountains paired with deep valleys and huge river crossings make any combat within our province a challenge of ingenuity. As such, we will require an engineer corps that is up to the task of finding a way around the challenges this province's geography provides us with."

 YUN_enact_multi_ethnic_conscritpion: "Enact Multi-Ethnic Conscription"
 YUN_enact_multi_ethnic_conscritpion_desc: "Currently, only Chinese Ethnicities can serve in the Yunnanese Armed forces, which means that our army is mostly made up of Han, Hui and the Yi. However, our province is made up of a lot of ethnic groups besides those, and extending the conscription to these ethical groups would increase our manpower pool significantly, even if it will have a political cost..."

 YUN_improve_coordination: "Improve Coordination"
 YUN_improve_coordination_desc: "One of the major flaws in our armed forces is how localised each regiment and battalion is. Due to the distances involved, and the lack of communications infrastructure, half of our army has to operate on its own terms, and this causes cohesion to break down in the face of battle. If we are to field a larger army, we will need to solve this issues in cooperation in order to stand a chance in the battlefield."

 YUN_enact_meritocratic_promotions: "Non-discriminatory Promotions"
 YUN_enact_meritocratic_promotions_desc: "Perhaps not surprisingly, the Yunnanese Army, and the Chinese army in general, have always preferred to promote Han Generals to leadership positions, with only a few exceptions to this rule like General Long Yun or Bai Chongxi. To combat this, we should legislate that promoting officers should only be done based on skill, regardless of ethnicity."

 YUN_elite_officer_corps: "Elite Officer Corps"
 YUN_elite_officer_corps_desc: "Yunnan is the home of one of the most advanced Officer Corps in China, thanks to the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army and the survivors of the New Guangxi Clique as well as our own cadre of Generals. Their expertise and ingenuity bring invaluable tactical innovation to our province, and we should exploit their knowledge if we wish to prevail in the ever changing battlefield."

 YUN_adopt_special_tactics: "Adopt Special Tactics"
 YUN_adopt_special_tactics_desc: "China has a long tradition of utilising straightforward attack plans, more reminiscent of Weltkrieg style infantry charges than organised and well thought-out attacks. Instead of throwing our manpower to the fire, we should instead learn the lessons of German Shock Troopers in order to maximise the combat effectiveness of our units and minimise our casualties."

 YUN_infiltration_excercises: "Infiltration Exercises"
 YUN_infiltration_excercises_desc: "Considering China's large armies, perhaps an indirect approach to battles will be best in order to gain the upper hand. As such, practising Infiltration techniques in order to flank and crush enemy pockets will be vital if we wish to beat our enemies in the battlefield."

 YUN_Kunming_Academy_support: "Expanding the Kunming Academy"
 YUN_Kunming_Academy_support_desc: "The Kunming Academy has produced some of China's finest officers, and now we need its services more than ever. We shall expand their installations and allow their cadets greater freedom to both observe and lead troops in the front line if they decide they want to start gaining experience and rank without having yet graduated."

 YUN_accept_only_the_best: "Improve Officer Standards"
 YUN_accept_only_the_best_desc: "A lot of officers in Yunnan wound up being promoted hastily and without proper checks of their skill and talents. Instead of encouraging a purge of our officers, which would be undesirable and politically negative, we shall encourage the usage of higher officer promotion standards, so that officers that truly earned their positions remain and climb up the hierarchical ladder."

 YUN_renew_academy_textbooks: "Renew Academic Textbooks"
 YUN_renew_academy_textbooks_desc: "While the Kunming Academy has done a great job at producing officers, it has done so with pre-Weltkrieg manuals, which in many ways are severely outdated to the face of the modern battlefield, as the French learned the hard way in 1914. In order to keep our edge, we will need to start importing some new bibliography in order to train our troops and officers in the newest battlefield techniques."

 YUN_Army_excercises: "Army Exercises"
 YUN_Army_excercises_desc: "Practice makes perfect, and as such, our army must not fall behind in this aspect. As we organise new war games, we will be able to test new strategies and tactics to separate the wheat from the chaff."

 YUN_the_national_champion: "The National Champion"
 YUN_the_national_champion_desc: "Yunnan is sometimes called the National Champion when it comes to Officer organisation, discipline and leadership. We should further prove this legend true, and continue to improve upon our officer corps."

 YUN_CaiE_art_of_war: "Cai E's Art of War"
 YUN_CaiE_art_of_war_desc: "Cai E is immensely respected in Yunnan for his tactical and strategic expertise, as well as his bravery in leading the National Protection Alliance. As his impact cannot be ignored, his preference for preserving manpower and maintaining well equipped divisions in the front line have made an impact in the ideas of our current officer corps, and we should tailor our province to follow his ideals."

 YUN_Chinas_finest: "Finalise our Reforms"
 YUN_Chinas_finest_desc: "With our reforms at an end, time has come to finally take all the knowledge we have gathered and put it to practice. Some Armies will march to the West to practise mountain manoeuvres, others to the East to practise open field battles, and through practice, we will show any foe how our tactical expertise will favour us in the Battlefield."

 YUN_brigade_reorganisation: "Brigade Reorganisation"
 YUN_brigade_reorganisation_desc: "Brigades in Yunnan are currently extremely heterogenic, where some groups are based around the American 'Rule of 3' whereas others have 4, 5 or even 1 single battalion. In order to fix this, we shall pass a new Brigade size standard, and disband and merge brigades in order to fulfil the new standard."

 YUN_fierce_assault: "Fierce Assault Preparations"
 YUN_fierce_assault_desc: "Once the battle starts, we cannot slow our advance down or we will lose our momentum. We need to make the logistical preparations so that we can have unstoppable unrelenting advances on the enemy lines. Our Casualties may be plentiful, but our victories will outweigh the costs."

 YUN_improve_hospitals: "Improve Field Hospitals"
 YUN_improve_hospitals_desc: "A way to reduce Yunnan's manpower shortage will be to have front line hospitals capable of treating and properly caring for our men so that they may be back on the battlefield faster. We shall invest into newer forward hospitals so that our men get the best attention possible."

 YUN_improve_logistical_support: "Improve Logistical Support"
 YUN_improve_logistical_support_desc: "In order to sustain a large standing army, we will need to adjust our supply lines accordingly. During the Zhili-Fengtian war, we had an unfortunate taste of logistical shortcomings as Tang's overstretched forces failed to help Fengtian's forces break through the Zhili lines. We shall not make the same mistake again, and we shall prepare logistical specialists to maximise the effectiveness of our supply distribution."

 YUN_diplomatic_overtures_desc: "With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, suddenly republican movements have risen again. The Left Kuomintang is busy fighting against the Nanjing Clique, but that doesn't mean there aren't other Republican groups we can reach out to for support against the Zhili."

 YUN_rally_republicans: "Rally Republicans"
 YUN_rally_republicans_desc: "Several Republican Groups co-exist within Yunnan since even before the Xinhai Revolution, and that trend continues to this day, now with Federalists, Kuomintang officials and independents.

 YUN_strengthen_local_government: "Strengthen Local Governments"
 YUN_strengthen_local_government_desc: "The Federalist Constitution Tang passed years ago granted significant power to the local assemblies of Yunnan, but it could still be improved. We should authorise a revision of the executive power of the local governments and their relations with the provincial government."

 YUN_the_future: "The Future"
 YUN_the_future_desc: "It has always been Tang's position that the federalist movement requires him to expand his domain at all costs so that he can build up the strength necessary to bring federalism and democracy to the eastern continent. Tang also believes that in order to establish the federalists as a viable movement in China, all federalists must act as one, following a singular vision. Should Chen not be able to lead the movement, then it falls to Tang to bring federalism to China."

 YUN_expand_the_provincial_constitution: "Revise the Provincial Constitution"
 YUN_expand_the_provincial_constitution_desc: "In 1927, under the pressure of popular unrest, Tang passed a provincial constitution that reflects the Federalist agenda. It is long past due that we reform the constitution of Yunnan so that we better reflect Tang's ideals. While Tang's original constitution made sense at the time, there are still improvements could be made so that our marshal Tang would give a more modernised version of federalism to the Chinese people."

 YUN_attract_republican_intelectuals: "Attract Republican Intellectuals"
 YUN_attract_republican_intelectuals_desc: "With stability returned to the province, Yunnan is swiftly becoming the beacon of Chinese republicanism.

We shall further the dream that was cast down after the Xinhai Revolution!"

 YUN_the_federalist_mantle: "The Federalist Mantle"
 YUN_the_federalist_mantle_desc: "The federalist dream was almost toppled when Chen Jiongming was ousted from power, but thankfully Marshal Tang moved quickly to bring the two Guangs back into federalist control.

 YUN_the_mountain_fortres: "The Mountain Fortress"

 YUN_toe_the_line: "Autonomy and Accountability"
 YUN_toe_the_line_desc: "While we wish to remain autonomous, we are still beholden to Chen Jiongming's true central government. To Tang, while provincial autonomy is a must for a free China, the provinces cannot be too free, or it will bring forward another Warlord Era. No, the provinces must still be accountable to the Central Government, and we shall lead by example!"

 YUN_go_after_Sichuan_desc: "After the Xinhai Revolution, while the North remained under the control of the old Qing Army who rebranded themselves as so-called Republicans of the Beiyang Government, the South was run by genuine Republican reformists. However, this has not stopped the southern cliques from waging wars against each other, and preventing us from bringing true republicanism to the north. This ends now, and the other provinces of the South will follow our lead or face the sword."

 YUN_the_King_of_Yunnan: "The King of Yunnan"
 YUN_the_King_of_Yunnan_desc: "While Tang may not be the federalist leader of China, he remains the great governor of Yunnan Province. His leadership may have had both highs and lows, but he has led the Yunnanese people through thick and thin, and has gained the nickname ‘King of Yunnan'.

 YUN_power_centralisation: "Centralising Power"
 YUN_power_centralisation_desc: "Although Tang Jiyao is a fervent believer in the cause of federalism, China's current situation requires a re-evaluation of certain PIP policies.

 YUN_National_Southwestern_Associated_University_desc: "Thanks to the chaos in central and eastern China, the exiled intellectuals have brought us a lot of room to organise new research teams to help the R&D department of the Kunming Arsenal. As such, the formation of the new National Southwestern Associated University, that represents faculties from different prestigious universities, would allow us to better coordinate these efforts."

 YUN_seeking_new_markets: "Seek New Markets"
 YUN_seeking_new_markets_desc: "With our own supply of goods secured, we should seek to sell our excess production abroad. While the dependence on exports in the past has damaged our own self-sufficiency, we are confident that resuming the practice exclusively on excess goods is bound to only bring benefits to our economy."

 YUN_expand_infra: "Expand Rural Infrastructure"
 YUN_expand_infra_desc: "Ever since the first human settlements appeared at the sides of the Dian Lake thousands of years ago, connecting the bountiful farmland with the villages and cities through the maze of mountains and valleys of Yunnan has been a tough challenge for every government in the region. We should try our best to expand on it, and to improve upon the already existing framework."

##Alternate Tree
 YUN_initial_stabilisation: "Initial Stabilisation"
 YUN_initial_stabilisation_desc: "With Tang's final blunder, a massive rebellion has sprung out across Yunnan. The Federalists, the Kuomintang and the Warlords all began clashing against one another in a struggle for dominance. Only now, after weeks of struggle, the wounds are starting to heal..."

 YUN_End_the_Monarchy: "End the [QIE.GetName]"
 YUN_End_the_Monarchy_desc: "The [QIE.GetName] has been a thorn in our side for decades, and it has vastly outlived its usefulness. As such it falls to us, the people who once overthrew the pretender Yuan Shikai during the National Protection War, to save China from disgrace."

 YUN_Secure_Tibet2: "The Tibetan Debacle"
 YUN_Secure_Tibet2_desc: "While the Yunnanese government may look outwards towards conquest, there are still small disputes we need to resolve. In the chaos that followed the independence of Tibet, they happened to seize land that was ours. However, many wonder if we should truly focus on such a small claim in these trying times..."

 YUN_Exploit_Burma2: "The 'Yellow Book' Affair"
 YUN_Exploit_Burma2_desc: "The Pianma Incident of 1910 saw the British and their Burmese stooges seize control of what was and is rightful Chinese territory. However, we have been in negotiations for months with the tribal leaders of the border region, and they have proclaimed their support for us. The time has come for putting our cards on the table and release the 'Yellow Book'..."

 YUN_Strike_At_Liangguang: "Strike at Liangguang"
 YUN_Strike_At_Liangguang_desc: "Liangguang has always been a thorn in our side for these last few decades, first by sending us the decadent remains of the New Guangxi Clique and later by joining the League of Eight Provinces. Their time as a thorn in our side is now at an end, as we shall strike them down before they can suppose a threat to our province."

 YUN_connect_sea: "Connect to the Sea"
 YUN_connect_sea_desc: "With our acquisition of Liangguang we are finally free to divert our exports to ports under our own control and own terms. By connecting the two provinces we shall finally have an alternative to the Kunming-Haiphong export route."

 YUN_the_Siamese_Threat2: "Our Claims in Siam"
 YUN_the_Siamese_Threat2_desc: "The fall of the British Empire saw Burma reaffirming their independence, but with this came weakness. Without the support of the British and the Entente, Siam was able to lay claim to a portion of the Pianma region, of which is true Chinese territory. With the successful acceptance of the Yellow Book Affair, now it's time to secure the Silver mines that were stolen by the Siamese!"

 YUN_Conquer_Indochina: "Conquer Indochina"
 YUN_Conquer_Indochina_desc: "Indochina has been a thorn in our side since antiquity. Now, they stand in possession of the valuable Kunming-Haiphong Railway, and once more, we have the choice to go to war for the Region to strengthen China..."

 YUN_Long: "Long Yun's Clique"
 YUN_Long_desc: "Long Yun, a local Yi General and a widely popular officer among the Yunnanese soldiers and minority groups, has come ahead in the power struggle following Tang's overthrow. As for what future awaits for Yunnan, only Long Yun knows..."

 YUN_the_Society_of_Bamboo_King: "The Society of the Bamboo King"
 YUN_the_Society_of_Bamboo_King_desc: "The Society of the Bamboo King is a secretive organisation, mostly made up of Tusi leaders, politicians and other groups seemingly disadvantaged by the Han encroachment into Yunnan. While most of their objectives are shrouded in mystery, what we do know is that they wish to curb the influence of the Han in Yunnan, and collaborating with them for the sake of unity in Yunnan is in our best interests."

 YUN_Dian_Identity: "Dian Identity"
 YUN_Dian_Identity_desc: "For centuries, Yunnan has been a melting pot of cultures. Divided, the province has been preyed upon by Beijing and foreigners alike, and as such, we should strive to form a new identity, which integrates the multicultural aspect of our province into a harmonious mosaic of ethnicities, united in their desire for self-preservation and the prosperity of the province."

 YUN_Sinitic_Dominance: "Sinitic Dominance"
 YUN_Sinitic_Dominance_desc: "Despite all setbacks, the Han have become the ethnic majority in Yunnan, and as minority groups insist on having separate rights than the rest of China, we have to continue encouraging Han immigration so that Yunnan may continue to be a part of China lest it actually develops separatist sentiments."

 YUN_Restore_political_stability: "Restore Political Stability"
 YUN_Restore_political_stability_desc: "With Han immigration having restarted, several ethnic groups have shown their disapproval of our policies, and are now protesting our apparent reforms. While we sympathise with their demands, we can't afford dissent now, and we will have to suppress their protests for the time being."

 YUN_King_of_Yunnan2: "The 'King of Yunnan'"
 YUN_King_of_Yunnan2_desc: "The title of the 'King' of Yunnan has been passed from provincial governor to provincial governor since the time of Cai E, given the immense power the governor yields over the frontier province. Long Yun, despite being a staunch anti-monarchist, has graciously accepted the title, and the power and legitimacy his position gives him over the province is undeniable."

 YUN_Democratic_Fortress2: "Democratic Fortress"
 YUN_Democratic_Fortress2_desc: "Despite its distance from the capital and relative isolation, Yunnan has become more than a warlord fiefdom. With working universities, a growing industrial sector, a judicial system, a representative legislature and a locally elected assembly, Yunnan is one of the few provinces in China that can truly be considered Democratic. At least for chinese standards."

 YUN_NRA_prevailed: "NRA Prevailed"
 YUN_NRA_prevailed_desc: "Despite the failure in the Northern Expedition and all setbacks set by Tang Jiyao, Long Yun and the many other enemies of the Kuomintang, the National Revolutionary Army has managed to prevail in the province. As for what the future awaits for Yunnan, it's up to the new Governor..."

 YUN_Land_Problem: "Land Redistribution"
 YUN_Land_Problem_desc: "After a thorough analysis made by Miao Yuntai, it has been deemed necessary that we perform an agricultural reform in order to improve our cultivation and extraction efficiency, as well as improving the working conditions of peasants and small landlords in our nation."

 YUN_Form_The_National_Protection_Alliance: "Form the National Protection Alliance"
 YUN_Form_The_National_Protection_Alliance_desc: "China lies in chaos after decades of warlord conflicts and a weak Beijing government. As such, Yunnan cannot sit idly and wait for Beijing to come to its rescue. We must act quickly and seize the opportunity in order to secure China's strength and stability!"

 YUN_emergent_financial_measures: "Emergent Financial Measures"
 YUN_emergent_financial_measures_desc: "As our provincial economy moves forward, we should also try to keep up with it financially. New overtures of investment have opened, new companies have opened, new factories have settled, and we should encourage all via our financial measures to continue improving Yunnan and making it the model province."

 YUN_cult_of_personality: "Cult of Personality"
 YUN_cult_of_personality_desc: "The weakness of Tang was his lack of touch with the average citizen. His lavish lifestyle, and his boastful attitude ended up being his downfall. Our new governor understands this, and using his position as an officer, a local celebrity and a family man, he plans to cause sympathy in every soldier, politician and working class family alike."

 YUN_continue_isolation: "Continue Isolation"
 YUN_continue_isolation_desc: "Yunnan, perhaps thanks to its geographical location, remains as one of the few spots in China that hasn't completely fallen into chaos, nepotism and repression. Perhaps things should stay this way, and we should try to foster a more stable province. China has enough war as it is, they don't need us to throw our hat in the ring."

 YUN_the_mountain_fortress: "The Mountain Fortress"
 YUN_the_mountain_fortress_desc: "Our province is already hard enough to assault, as enemies are restricted to small valleys and narrow mountain passages. However, that doesn't mean it's unassailable. We can still improve its defences by setting up defensive lines in said valleys and passages. That should be enough to deter any potential attackers."

 YUN_join_the_left_KMT_committee: "Join the Left KMT Committee"
 YUN_join_the_left_KMT_committee_desc: "With the revolutionary government struggling against Beijing, it is only right that we follow the true Kuomintang into bringing the revolution to China!"

 YUN_join_the_right_KMT_committee: "Join the Right KMT Committee"
 YUN_join_the_right_KMT_committee_desc: "Despite Wang Jingwei's resistance in Fujian, their version of the Kuomintang clearly stands at odds with what Sun Yat-sen truly wanted. Instead, we shall seek to join those who really follow what Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek fought and died for!"

 YUN_Kuomintang_government_Initiative: "Kuomintang Government Initiative"
 YUN_Kuomintang_government_Initiative_desc: "With our allies behind us, it's finally time to make a comeback and save China from the Emperor, the Japanese and the Warlords alike. The time of reckoning is now, China will be united and free or we will die trying!"

 YUN_gear_up_for_war: "Gear Up for War"
 YUN_gear_up_for_war_desc: "While war is common in the rest of China, Yunnan has remained in a relatively isolated peace from the rest of China. This has played against us in the last Zhili-Fengtian war of the twenties, where our advance into Guizhou was stopped by a lack of supplies. We cannot let that happen again, and as such we should prepare for the conflicts to come."

 YUN_Revive_republican_ideals: "Revive Republican Ideals"
 YUN_Revive_republican_ideals_desc: "Complacency in the province has become widespread, as many people don't care anymore whether there is a central government, or a united China at all. This can't be allowed to stand, China has to be saved, and we should instil patriotism again in our population!"

 YUN_Reform_KMT_Organisation: "Reform the Kuomintang Organisation"
 YUN_Reform_KMT_Organisation_desc: "The Kuomintang, or more specifically, the National Revolutionary Army branch of the Kuomintang, has hardly undergone any reforms since the Generalissimo was assassinated. We should look into restructuring our party, and begin passing reforms that may help our province ease itself into our organisation."

 YUN_A_New_China: "A New China"
 YUN_A_New_China_desc: "China has finally been reunited under the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth of the Kuomintang. While there is still a long way to go before we recover from the Century of Humiliation, we have fulfilled the dream of the late Dr. Sun and our late marshal Chiang Kai-shek. Long live our Generalissimo Zhu Peide, unifier of China!"

 YUN_Ultimatium_To_Sichuan2: "Ultimatum to Sichuan"
 YUN_Ultimatium_To_Sichuan2_desc: "The Sichuan Clique stands as the living example of why warlords cannot rule in China anymore with the recent famine. We will send an ultimatum to Sichuan to restore the rule of law of the Republic, and if they refuse, we'll send a message to all of China: The time of the warlords is at an end..."

 YUN_Enter_Yangtze_River2: "Enter the Yangtze Valley"
 YUN_Enter_Yangtze_River2_desc: "The Yangtze River Valley leads the way to the heart of China. Going from Sichuan all the way to Shanghai. If we wish to save China, we will need to control this vital river, and to start our hegemony, we will need to eliminate the gatekeeper of the Valley: Hunan."

 if_they_fully_accept_tt: "§YEffects if they fully accept:§!"
 if_they_partially_accept_tt: "§YEffects if they partially accept:§!"

 YUN_Deal_with_Nanjing: "Deal with Nanjing"
 YUN_Deal_with_Nanjing_desc: "So long as Nanjing stands in enemy hands, China will never be truly united. Their insult to China and The Republic's ideals has gone on for long enough, and we will put an end to their defiance."

 YUN_civilian_kmt: "Establish a Civilian Party"
 YUN_civilian_kmt_desc: "The victory of the Whampoa clique over their warlord rivals has not yet attracted recognition from other elements of the Kuomintang. We are short on civilian allies at the moment, leaving us bereft of internal legitimacy. If we wish to be more than another clique of military strongmen, we must make concessions to right-leaning intellectuals in the party, cast out by the duplicitous Wang Jingwei."

 YUN_assembly: "Fate of the Assembly"
 YUN_assembly_desc: "Despite Yunnan's leadership in the National Protection war and its reputation as a democratic bastion, its provincial assembly has always been marred by corruption and stacked with Yunnan clique loyalists. In some cases, representatives are outright military officers. A decision must be made about its future direction."

 YUN_supervisory_organs: "Supervisory Organs"
 YUN_supervisory_organs_desc: "In the shadow of the warlord era, corruption and nepotism has been institutionalised. Crucial for curbing this graft is the creation of various regulatory bodies, chief among them the Control and Examination Yuans. These will primarily focus on monitoring financial irregularities, but we shall dangle the possibility of future military accountability to attract sympathetic intellectuals to our cause."

 YUN_warlordism: "Incorporate Warlord Elements"
 YUN_warlordism_desc: "The sad reality of the current situation is that we are desperately short on friends. This means that if we are to continued with our quest for national liberation, we will need provide amnesty for various warlord officers and co-opt existing power structures in the lands that we liberate. Keeping them in control might be a problem for the future, but for now we will work with who we can."

 YUN_new_life_movement: "The New Life Movement"
 YUN_new_life_movement_desc: "China has sunk into a deep moral decline over the years, corrupted both physically and spiritually. Key to reversing this decadence is the restoration of proper values, with both Confucian and Christian inspirations. This New Life Movement will help capture the public imagination, helping turn out party into a mass but consolidated movement. It will prove we are more than just petty autocrats."

 YUN_expand_party_congress: "Expanded Party Congress"
 YUN_expand_party_congress_desc: "There are many fellow republicans and nationalists who wish to see the end of foreign oppression and domestic division. Although there are plenty of unsavoury figures among the flock, we will take the time to invite those we deem worthy into an expanded party congress to help provide the political tutelage our people need to one day establish a constitutional republic."

 YUN_kmt_personality_cult: "Cult of Personality"
 YUN_kmt_personality_cult_desc: "Our great Generalissimo [ROOT.GetLeader] embodies the true values of the Kuomintang and holds the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Xinhai Revolution. The future looks bright with him at the helm, and although plenty of party divisions remain, all will be lead by his guiding hand. His wisdom and prowess, however require further emergency powers to be enacted around his office to protect our future."

 YUN_implementing_the_three_principles: "Implementing the Three Principles"
 YUN_implementing_the_three_principles_desc: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen proposed Three Principles of the People, the foundational work for the Kuomintang and guiding ideology for generations of Chinese republicans for years to come. Although there is much still to be done, we have begun the groundwork for the preparation of a Chinese republic. We shall stress our continuation with Dr. Sun, and promote a certain party orthodoxy to this end."

 YUN_dangguo: "Entrench Dangguo"
 YUN_dangguo_desc: "Through this period of national strife, the Kuomintang shall be the first and only party across the political tutelage. We are embarked on a tremendous, nigh spiritual mission for the soul of a nation. This party-state will ensure the end of warlordism, imperialism, and monarchy, and serve as the honest, incorruptible guides for a future multi-party republic. Until then however, democracy must wait."

 YUN_secure_northern_china: "Secure Northeastern China"
 YUN_secure_northern_china_desc: "The Fengtian government, while standing in defiance to the Qing, are still traitors to the Chinese nation. Upholding purely façade of Republicanism, their warlord of a leader is nothing but a Japanese lapdog, and it falls to us to save Manchuria from such tyrants, and return it to its rightful place in China."

 YUN_secure_western_china: "Secure Western China"
 YUN_secure_western_china_desc: "With the East secured, now is the time to begin the long march westwards. So long as the Kuomintang upholds Sun Yat-sen's ideals, it is the duty of the Republic to protect Chinese citizens, wherever they may be. As the West has recently fallen into chaos, the livelihood of many Chinese is now threatened, and it is our duty to march in and restore order."

Today, their presence continues to throttle our trade and force us into a form of economic submission. Shattering their hold on Indochina would greatly aid us in securing our independence from the Germans and their lackeys and free the valuable Kunming-Haiphong railway."

 YUN_expansion_of_the_mining_industries: "Expansion of Yunnan's Mining Industry"
 YUN_expansion_of_the_mining_industries_desc: "Yunnan has, since time immemorial, been a large mining province. Despite centuries of exploration and mining, the province is still filled with valuable resources that, with enough investment, could potentially make us China's greatest resource centre.\nThese decisions are repeatable and will reappear."
 YUN_kunming_tungsten_prospecting: "Expand Yunnan's Tungsten Prospecting"
 YUN_kunming_tungsten_prospecting_desc: "While tungsten has remained behind in terms of extraction as opposed to tin, it is nonetheless a valuable resource in these times of war. Our government has luckily kept land surveys of the frontier archived, and while funding expeditions may prove expensive, it may yet prove vital for us."
 YUN_dali_aluminium_expansion: "Expand Yunnan's Steel Production"
 YUN_dali_aluminium_expansion_desc: "Yunnan's iron mines have been operating for around 30 years, and while their yields have greatly helped our economy, there's still plenty of room for improvement. New mines can be started, old mines can be expanded, new smelters and smelting methods could be introduced to the system, all for a small investment..."
 YUN_kunming_bauxite_refining: "Improve Kunming's Bauxite Refining Methods"
 YUN_kunming_bauxite_refining_desc: "While the province is definitely not short in resources to produce aluminium, it's definitely lacking in its refining process. With an extra investment, we can potentially expand our aluminium output and be able to supply our own demand for the resource."
 YUN_guixi_chromimum_deposits: "Expand Guixi's Chromium Mines"
 YUN_guixi_chromimum_deposits_desc: "The frontier isn't the only place that's ripe with resources in our province. In the province of Guixi, there are several chromium-rich regions which sit largely unexploited. With our investments, we could greatly change this."

After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nHowever, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921 - thus, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. While the threat of the Zhili Clique and their German patrons looms in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces has largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and overambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside.§!"

 YUN_li_xin_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 12th, 1897, in Longling, Yunnan Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LLi Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the '20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the \"Renovation Society\" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he travelled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the CSP and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the \"Yunnan Special Branch\", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organise the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organising a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat.§!"

Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's \"Renovation Society\", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organise socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Syndicalist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the Kuomintang and League of Chinese Syndicalists ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or LCS might still be organised and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them.

Sensing political change sweeping through China, Shou changed his name to Gong and began to promote an elaborate story that his family were in reality descendants of Ming dynasty soldiers who had occupied Yunnan. The decision to pass himself off as a member of the Han ethnicity earned Shou a considerable degree of influence in the post-revolutionary political climate, which he used to campaign against the attempted land reforms that would weaken the Yi people and their Tusi's autonomy.

Upon Wang's death in 1921, He Yingqin was expelled from Guizhou and made his way to Tang Jiyao's Yunnan Clique.\n\nIn 1924, Sun Yat-sen established the Whampoa Military Academy and appointed He Yingqin as the chief military instructor. In 1925, He Yingqin led Whampoa-trained regiments against Chen Jiongming and seized Chaozhou and Shantou. With the pacification of Guangdong, He Yingqin prepared the Kuomintang military for the coming Northern Expedition. Despite serving valiantly in the First Army of the National Revolutionary Army, German Intervention caused the Kuomintang effort to collapse. He Yingqin and the First Army retreated into Yunnan, where Tang Jiyao was forced to grant refuge to various Nationalist forces due to Long Yun's insistence. Disillusioned with the Central Committee's shift towards the left, He Yingqin became influenced by Dai Jitao's interpretation of the Three Principles and is committed to a National Revolution without the taint of syndicalism.§!"

In 1906, Gu graduated from the Guizhou Army Primary School and continued to the Third Wuchang Army Secondary School in Hubei. In 1909, Gu was selected to study abroad in Japan's Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, specially made for Chinese students. During his time in Japan, Gu came to sympathise with the underground republican nationalist movement, the Tongmenghui. Gu further committed himself to the nationalist cause by taking part in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911.\n\nAfter finishing his studies in Japan, Gu returned home to Guizhou where he served as part of the local military. When Sun Yat-sen kicked off the Constitutional Protection Movement, Gu once again aligned with Sun and marched into Sichuan. When the Old Guangxi Clique betrayed the Guangzhou Nationalist Government, Gu mobilised his forces against Lu Rongting's renegade province and occupied Guilin. Gu Zhenglun served ably in the Northern Expedition, but German intervention halted Kuomintang ambitions in China.\n\nWith Guangdong and Guangxi under hostile forces, Gu once again made his way towards Guizhou. Although Governor Tang Jiyao wished to leave Gu to the Germans and Zhili Clique, Long Yun forced the governor to grant him shelter, along with other KMT exiles. Maintaining connections with Paris through his brothers and colluding with generals Zhu Peide and Li Zongren against Tang Jiyao, Gu serves as a bridge between Wang Jingwei's Central Committee and the KMT remnants in Yunnan.\n\nGu's strong efforts into the formation of the Military Police, has granted him the nickname of the 'Father of the Gendarmerie', showcasing his will for law and order.§!"

With the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, Zhang Qun returned to China to help take Shanghai where he became friends with Huang Fu.\n\nZhang Qun further served the Nationalist cause during the Second Revolution, which saw Yuan Shikai victorious and Zhang was forced to flee to Japan, where he finished his studies.

Under his uncle's guidance, Chen joined the Tongmenghui and participated in the Xinhai Revolution.\n\nHaving met his uncle's protege Chiang Kai shek, the two became close friends and worked together extensively after Chen Qimei was assassinated in 1916. In 1920, Chen Guofu operated in the Shanghai Stock Exchange alongside Chiang in order to fund the Kuomintang. Chen Guofu found his fortunes increase with Chiang's elevation to Headmaster of Sun's Whampoa Military Academy, with Chen put in charge of military recruitment in Shanghai.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition turned into a disaster and Chen's old friend Chiang was killed, he and his brother fled Guangzhou for Yunnan province where the remnants of the Kuomintang had consolidated. Chen Guofu has become prominent voices in the Kuomintang's right wing, staunchly opposing the Central Executive Committee's alliance with syndicalist forces. With Chen Guofu now in a dominant position in the Kuomintang and his brother at his side, he will not see Sun Yat-sen's National Revolution fall to such darkness. No, he will reshape the National Revolution in honour of Chiang Kai shek, Chen Qimei, and all Nationalist martyrs who have given their lives for China's future.§!"

Unlike his brother Chen Guofu, uncle Chen Qimei, and close friend Chiang Kai shek, Chen Lifu was uninterested in politics, but was convinced by Chiang and Chen Guofu to join the Guangzhou Nationalist Government which was seeking to unify China and purge the corrupt Beiyang warlords.\n\nWhen Chiang was killed and the Northern Expedition failed, Chen Lifu followed his brother into Yunnan where they hoped to avoid the retribution of the Zhili Clique. While Chen Guofu established himself as a prominent figure in Yunnan's right wing Nationalist circles, Chen Lifu remained in the shadows, assisting his brother where he could, but also dedicated himself to Yunnan's mining industry.

Upon graduating, Yang Yongtai returned to Guangdong and became the editor of “Guangnan Daily.” When the Qing Dynasty was toppled by the Xinhai Revolution, Yang was elected as a member of the provisional senate and joined the Kuomintang.\n\nAlthough elected to the first session of the senate, President Yuan Shikai abolished the National Assembly only a year later and Yang moved to Shanghai to establish the magazine \"Zhengyi\" with fellow senator Gu Zhongxiu. When Yuan proclaimed himself emperor, Yang denounced him, went south to Guangdong, and raised funds for Cai E's National Protection War. After Yuan's death, Yang Yongtai along with other Kuomintang members formed the Political Science Clique. In 1917, Sun Yat-sen began the Constitutional Protection Movement by establishing a rival government in Guangzhou and Yang Yongtai was made Director of the Finance Department. Due to the scheming of the Political Science Clique with the Old Guangxi Clique and Yunnan warlords, Yang and Sun had a falling out and the former went up north to participate in the Beiyang government.\n\nWhen Cao Kun bribed the senate to become president, the Political Science Clique shattered and Yang went into retirement in Shanghai. After Sun Yat-sen died, Chiang Kai-shek embarked on the ambitious Northern Expedition and invited the remnants of the Political Science Clique to rejoin the Guangzhou Nationalist Government. Hoping to regain political influence, Yang returned to Guangzhou to support the National Revolution. However, the Northern Expedition proved to be a failure and Chiang Kai-shek was killed. Unwilling to flee to France, Yang fled to Yunnan alongside Zhang Qun.

Although originally in contact with Chen Duxiu and the burgeoning Syndicalist movement in China, Dai split with the CSP after only a brief association.\n\nIn 1924, Dai Jitao became a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee. After Sun's death in 1925 and different interpretations of the Three Principles began to emerge, Dai theorised that the Principles were based in orthodox Chinese thought and a continuation of Confucian moral values, rejecting the need for class struggle in the National Revolution. With the failure of the Northern Expedition and death of his old friend Chiang Kai shek, Dai fled to Yunnan, where various right wing Nationalist forces had taken refuge.\n\nAiding in the Nationalist cause however he can, Dai has spent the last decade writing extensively on his vision of the National Revolution, becoming the primary ideologue of the anti syndicalist wing of the Kuomintang.

In 1912, after Chen's graduation, the dire economic situation within his family forced Chen to ingeniously take the initiative in his own education.\n\nSuch initiative and capability has continued to be an ever present element within Chen Cheng's life, as after a failed attempt to study at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1917, and another failed attempt to apply for Baoding Military Academy in 1918, he persisted and was finally admitted to the Eigth Artillery Section of Baoding Military Academy. After the fallout of the Zhili-Anhui war in 1920, Chen Cheng was forced to flee southwards where he found himself in the Third Regiment of the newly-established Guangdong Army's First division, joining the Kuomintang thereafter.\n\nDeveloping a student-teacher relationship with National Revolutionary Army general Deng Yanda during his time in Baoding, Chen found himself abandoning his new post as a trainee officer in Zhejiang upon hearing that Deng was recruiting officers for a new army in Guangzhou, ignoring military discipline and departing to Shanghai to join with his old mentor. Serving dutifully as lieutenant-adjutant and company commander of the Third Regiment of the First Division of the NRA, he later served as a bodyguard to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, being shot in the chest during his service.
