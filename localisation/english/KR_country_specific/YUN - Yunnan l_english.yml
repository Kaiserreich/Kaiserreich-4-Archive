#Example
 #中國國民黨中華復興社
 #CHI_crs_party: "KMT-CRS"
 #CHI_crs_party_long: "China Revival Society (Zhongguo Guomindang zhonghua fuxing she)\n§gThe China Revival Society (CRS) is a clique formed by radical officers of the National Revolutionary Army and holds close ties with Dai Chunfeng's shadowy BIS or Juntong. Led primarily by Hu Zongnan, He Zhonghan, and Deng Wenyi, the CRS emerged as a new political faction following the First National Congress and is especially popular amongst the military's young guard.\n\nTheir ideology consists of a host of influences from far-right Savinkovism, Japanese Bushido, Maximist British economic planning, but the Sorelian necessity of revolutionary cleansing violence most inspires them. The CRS sees the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party's downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxiu). From there, they envision China to be developed into a highly militarised and equal society with the notion and ideas of class struggle eradicated in favour of a completely totalitarian and socialist nation. They look to China's antiquity and its Confucian order of old as not elements of ancient history but rather a sense of halcyon tranquillity that will eventually be achieved under the rule of the benevolent lingxiu. If China is to be saved, if she is to be liberated, and if she is to become a respected mighty power once more - she will have to be revived from the ground up.§!"

 #NOTES - Add pinyin but without tones in parantheses.

 YUN_CSP_intro: "The Chinese Syndicalist Party was founded in 1922 by a collection of socialist thinkers inspired by the recent successes of French revolutionaries. It allied with the Kuomintang in 1924 in the First United Front, which allowed them to expand in size and influence within the southern Guangzhou government during the warlord era. Emboldened by the Hong Kong-Canton Strike of 1925, the Chinese Syndicalist Party formed the League of Chinese Syndicalists as a broad umbrella of Chinese socialists not directly associated with the Kuomintang, the high water mark of their movement.\n\nYunnan's Syndicalists organised in Peking University in 1923 Beijing under the tutelage of Li Dazhao. The brothers Wang Fusheng and Wang Desan, along with other leaders such as Li Xin and Yang Qingtian founded the Yunnan Reform Society along with other students. They took part in the May 30th protests that year and renamed the group the New Yunnan (Dian) Society."

 YUN_KMT_intro: "The Kuomintang was founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen after the failure of his unwieldy Tongmenghui. The party took an authoritarian turn when he demanded personal loyalty oaths from all of its members, and drifted in a leftwards, vanguardist direction after the 1924 Reorganisation. Built on Dr. Sun's teachings and cult of personality, the party grew severely divided after his death."

 YUN_NRA_intro: "In order to combat the warlords, Dr. Sun demanded the creation of an army purely loyal to the party and the revolution known as the National Revolutionary Army. With the help of military advisors from the Third Internationale, the Whampoa Military Academy was erected in Guangzhou which trained a generation of revolutionary military officers."

This smaller circle included many political and military operatives trained in Whampoa Military Academy by advisors from the Third Internationale.§!\n"

 #中國國民黨中華復興社
 YUN_KMT_CRS_party: "KMT-CRS"
 YUN_KMT_CRS_party_long: "Kuomintang - China Revival Society (Guomindang Zhonghua Fuxingshe)\n§L$YUN_KMT_intro$\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Northern Expedition, Hu Zongnan broke off from He Yingqin's First Army, joining Wang's CEC in Europe. In Europe, he connected with fellow Whampoa Alumni He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi, who shared his disappointment in the state of the Party. Embracing ultra-nationalism and staunch militarism, Hu and the CRS embraced the revolutionary violence of French Sorelians, declaring the bureaucracy of the Party to be the root cause of the Northern Expedition's failure. The failure of the leftist committee's most recent adventure into China has broken their cause, leaving them a shell of what they once were. However, following their adoption into the new Kuomintang government, it seems that they have seen a small revival in popularity. Having dropped the more socialist aspects of their platform in favour of emphasising their commitment to rejuvenating the Party's revolutionary resolve, they have established a friendly partnership with Teng Jie's Blueshirts on the basis of a shared commitment to ultra-nationalistic militarism and totalitarianism.§!\n"

 YUN_KMT_WRD_SOC_party: "World Society"
 YUN_KMT_WRD_SOC_party_long: "(New) World Society (Shijie She)\n§LThe World Society enjoys the distinction of being the first organised anarchist organisation (anarchists groups traditionally avoid referring to themselves as parties) in China. Led by the Four Elders (Zhang Renjie, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei), these Paris-based anarchists became mentors for many prominent Kuomintang figures. Their influence was eclipsed however by the rise of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, especially as their relationship with other anarchists deteriorated and they were forced to retreat into their positions in the Kuomintang establishment.\n\nAlthough they suffered a further loss in influence within the Party following the Leftist Kuomintang Government's collapse, it seems that they have escaped their string of bad luck following their entry into the new Kuomintang Government. Viewing the CSP as something of a political liability, the Nationalist Government has opted to support the World Society in its capacity as head of the League of Chinese Syndicalists in order to contain their radicalism. Li Shizeng in particular has risen to prominence, ingratiating himself in right-wing circles through his recent thorough criticisms of the promotion of class struggle by KMT leftists as well as the CSP, declaring it detrimental during China's fight against foreign imperialist powers.§!\n"

It fought with distinction in the Eastern front of the Northern Expedition against Sun Chuanfang, but was ultimately forced to retreat with the rest of the NRA during the Long March. In Guizhou, the Third Army absorbed smaller Yunnan based military forces under Fan Shisheng and Jin Handing after the Kuomintang reorganised in Guizhou.\n\nThe Third Army harbours a large leftist faction within its ranks led by Zhu De.

Internally, the RCA was divided between the Radicals under Chen, who advocated violent class warfare and Marxism, and the Moderates under Gu who preferred class collaboration.\n\nWang Jingwei's decision to join our government has shattered the RCA with many of the rank and file denouncing him as a sell-out. Chen Gongbo has refrained from directly criticising his friend, but has retreated into the shadows as Wang throws his weight behind Gu Mengyu's wing and emphasised his left-nationalist credentials. The RCA retains some sway within our party, particularly among the civilian bureaucracy, parts of the intelligentsia, and overseas chapters, but it's clear that they are well past their heyday.§!\n"

 YUN_KMT_PAC_party_long: "Kuomintang - Provisional Action Committee (Guomindang - linshi xingdong weiyuanhu)\n§L$YUN_KMT_intro$\n\nAfter the Northern Expedition collapsed, there was a growing divide between the Central Committee in exile and the insurgency leadership on the ground. The failure of the 1932 Shanghai Uprising worsened this schism, and confirmed the need for a more autonomous leadership structure in the MinGan zone. This led to Song Qingling and Deng Yanda's \"Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World\", which formally announced the creation of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang.\n\nFollowing an agrarian, vanguardist strain of socialism, its dominance in MinGan has made it into the leading internal opposition to Wang Jingwei's rule. Despite the failure of the Left Kuomintang Government, the PAC was able to enjoy some level of support within the new Kuomintang Government through Deng Yanda's friendship with Chen Cheng.§!\n"

Gathering various party leaders, particularly those of their former allies in the Provisional Action Committee, though not forgetting to draw useful cadres from the RCA and even the CSP, Zhang and Zhu have reorganised the party under one Revolutionary Committee under their control.

With Tan self-exiling himself to lead the Guangdong regional branch of the PAC, and Zhang folding with Deng and Song, such a fate seemed pre-disclosed.\n\nAnd yet with the manipulation of the political battleground by Zhang and his newfound accomplice Zhu De, the duo have managed to propel themselves into a new landmark Third Way for Chinese Socialism. Participating in discussions with Dangwai such as the China Democratic League and the Chinese Syndicalist Party, Zhang has managed to break free from the chains of the White Sun. Advancing ever onwards, Zhang hopes to lead the nation to a new Democratic Socialist future, one beholden to the people and not committee.§!\n"

They established the European Affairs Research Society in Tokyo, which later evolved into the Political Science Society in 1916.\n\nRejecting the need for a Northern Expedition to unite China, they worked with southern warlords like Cen Chunxuan and Lu Rongting to topple Sun Yat-sen and his Constitution Protection Government and promote reunification negotiations with the northern Beiyang government. When Sun, with the help of Chen Jiongming, was able to drive Cen and Lu out of Guangdong and Tang Jiyao later drove out the Political Science Clique aligned Governor Gu Pinzhen out of Yunnan, the Old Political Science Clique effectively collapsed.\n\nA New Political Science Clique has emerged from an alliance between Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai, who formed the New China Construction Society (the formal name of the clique).

 #共和大同盟
 YUN_GRA_intro: "The Grand Republican Alliance is a quasi-legal political coalition of largely Southern Chinese parties operating in opposition towards the established Beiyang political order. Formed in 1931 after the swelling of anti-concessionist energy and nationalist agitation following the failure of the Zhili-Fengtian negotiation discussions, the Grand Republican Alliance would briefly ally with the retired Duan Qirui, and be joined by other \"Old\" Federalist groups such as Tang Jiyao's People's Government Party in Yunnan and Chu Fucheng's Zhejiang Autonomy Movement enacting a non-compliance bloc in the National Assembly. Largely sympathetic to the GRA but independent are those of Zhao Hengti's People's Renewal Society, and Xiong Kewu's Provincial Federal Autonomy Preparation Office."

 #中國民主同盟
 #YUN_CDL_intro: "The China Democratic League would find its origins in the Fall of 1929, wherein after the National Assembly Elections and the resulting Harmony Association majority a group of endeavouring intellectuals would found the United National Construction League with the hopes of promoting democracy in China, albeit with the rather controversial inclusion of Zhang Bojun and Tan Pingshan. Ultimately banned in 1932 following the Shanghai Uprising, its component parties would continue to meet in the new underground Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties, without the aforementioned socialist revolutionaries.\n\nWhilst largely a force of all participating liberals and independents, including but not limited to the Political Science Clique, Chinese Constitutionalist Party, National Salvation Federation, China Vocational Education Society and Endeavour Society, the FCDP in the South would see itself coalesce and emerge from quasi-legal status to that of a fully fledged political alliance known as the China Democratic League. Including the Democratic Socialist Party, Crescent Moon Society, China National Democratic Construction Association and components of the aforementioned factions, it remains a force spearheading legitimate democracy within China."

 YUN_NPA_intro: "In the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, the military came to dominate the politics of Yunnan. Initially led by Cai E, Tang Jiyao would succeed him following the former's ousting by Yuan Shikai due to his support for Song Jiaoren. Tang ceded power to Cai after he made his escape in the midst of Yuan Shikai's monarchical restoration and aided him in leading the National Protection Alliance, but became governor again following Cai's passing."

During his time in Beijing, Wang began to flirt with the allure of Syndicalism, becoming into contact with syndicalist theorists such as Deng Zhongxia, Li Dazhao and others. That same year under Li Dazhao's guidance alongside 19 others, Wang would help initiate China's First Syndicalist research group — the Beijing University Syndicalist Theory Research Society.

Prepared to enter the civil service, one of Zhu's tutors was a devout Kang Youwei supporter, and therefore Zhu began to fall under the allure of revolutionary sentiment.

Later studying in Germany, he would become enamoured by European military theory. Returning to China to participate in the Northern Expedition, he attempted to mobilise Yang Sen to join the revolutionary cause to no avail.

After being appointed Secretary of the Northern District Committee of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, Chen returned to Sichuan to serve in a military role in the upcoming Chinese revolution under Zhu De. However, fate did not favour the revolutionaries, with German intervention bringing the national revolution crumbling down like a house of cards. Chen evacuated to Guizhou under Zhu De in the 3rd Army during the chaos. Despite the setbacks suffered by the KMT, Chen remains confident that the socialist revolution will come about in China, one way or another.§!"

Setting himself on the path of martial prowess, Guan would initially fail to enlist in the army, yet in 1924 upon hearing that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had opened a new officer school in Guangzhou, and recruited students secretly, Guan would set out with his friend Deng Yumei.

Amused, Yu would explain the Three Principles to the duo, and alongside the likes of Du Yuming, would receive a letter of introduction from Yu Youren, successfully admitting the boys to Whampoa Academy.

Analysing the internal enemies of the Kuomintang as local warlords and the Chinese Syndicalist Party, he deemed the former very fragile, and not an issue. Whilst he deemed the Chinese Syndicalist Party to be one of the greatest threats to the Kuomintang. It had organisation, doctrine, strategy and support of the Internationale.\n\nTherefore in order to deal with the CSP, he desired the establishment of a new \"omnipotent party organisation\", declaring that if the Kuomintang does not surpass the CSP in organisational effectiveness, they will never be able to defeat them in action, unable to guarantee the complete success of the National Revolution.

In 1910 he was admitted to the fourth term of the Yunnan Army Primary School, and participated in the Double Ninth Uprising the following year. In 1912 he left Yunnan for Jiangxi to serve under Li Liejun, and returned to Yunnan on the eve of the Second Revolution. In 1914 he entered the officer class of Kunming Military Academy, and graduated to serve as a squad and battalion commander. During the National Protection War Hu Ruoyu participated in the battle to retake Gejiu.\n\nOrdered to reinforce the Yunnan Army in Sichuan, he would defeat Liu cunhou, and become a brigade commander in 1918. In 1920 during the Gu Pinzhen coup attempt, Hu would lead his soldiers in support of Tang Jiyao, but diverted his force to Guangxi to rally with Sun Yat-sen, seizing Guilin from Shen Hongying, and contacting Tang who had fled to Hong Kong. Fighting on behalf of Tang to restore him to power, he would lead Long Yun and Zhang Ruji to victory, and be rewarded as Garrison Commander of Mengzi as a result.\n\nInsisting upon a near coup of Tang in 1927 following several blunders, Long Yun would outmanoeuvre Hu into instating Tang as puppet governor, but Tang would force Long and Hu back to the negotiating table. With the turn inwards in the 1930s, Hu has strengthened his position in Yunnan's south, relying on Mengzi's connections to German Indochina and extensive mineral wealth."

 YUN_oversized_military_idea1_desc: "While it has provided us with one of the best armies in Southern China, it is clear that the provincial government's heavy focus on the development of the military is unsustainable. If policy is to be continued, Yunnan's civilian populace and industry will continue to suffer."

 YUN_oversized_military_idea2: "Oversized Military"
 YUN_oversized_military_idea2_desc: "Despite many improvements in handling provincial economics, the economy is still under heavy strain from previous heavy military spending. However, due to current circumstances the government can ill afford to decrease the size of the military any further. Until the political situation changes, the people of Yunnan will have to endure hardship."

 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea1: "Abysmal Economy"
 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea1_desc: "With both Yunnan and Guizhou being two of the most underdeveloped provinces in China coupled with Guizhou being under de-facto KMT control, it is no surprise that the provincial government finds itself constantly short of funds. Without serious reforms, the situation is unlikely to get any better."

 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea2: "Collapsed Economy"
 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea2_desc: "With the advent of Black Monday, Yunnan's already fragile economy has totally collapsed as foreign investments are pulled out and exports disappeared overnight. The economy is in dire straits if something is not done about this soon."

 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea3: "Stagnant Economy"
 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea3_desc: "Whilst much of Yunnan's pre-Black Monday problems still exist, the economy is in a much better state than it was in the immediate aftermath of Black Monday. With the provincial government's recent economic investments, it seems that Yunnan's economy is on its way to a full recovery."

 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea4: "Recovering Economy"
 YUN_abysmal_economy_idea4_desc: "With the provincial government's recent investments, the worst of Black Monday's damage has been mitigated.

 YUN_industrial_economy_idea2b: "Industrial Stagnation"
 YUN_industrial_economy_idea2b_desc: "The state cannot allow further militarisation. The results of former attempts at solidifying power through it are clear: Almost total economic ruin and misery in the civilian sector. Without the faith of the people, a modern state is nothing. Reconstruction efforts and development will both be intensified, providing a balanced and rational economic growth, and securing the people's faith in the state."

 YUN_industrial_economy_idea3b: "Industrial Recovery"
 YUN_industrial_economy_idea3b_desc: "The plans have been laid out and industrial buildup has begun. The people look to the future with a great deal of hope, as the government has promised expansive development, reform and modernisation in all areas of industry. However, much work is to be done if the government is to deliver on these promises."

 YUN_industrial_economy_idea4b: "Industrial Economy"
 YUN_industrial_economy_idea4b_desc: "The economy has finally harnessed the power of industry, letting the country catch up to the rest of the world. In due time, the past industrial ruin will be nothing but a distant memory."

 YUN_industrial_economy_idea5b: "Industry Revitalised"
 YUN_industrial_economy_idea5b_desc: "The transformation of the state into a truly formidable industrial power is now complete. The march to modernity is steadier than ever, and others look to the achievements of the regime in awe, envy, and frequently both. Long may China prosper!"

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea1: "Collapsed Agricultural Sector"
 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea1_desc: "After decades of mismanagement and conflict, the agricultural sector has been left in a catastrophic state. If Southern China is to advance into modernity, agricultural reforms must be carried out as soon as possible."

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea2a_desc: "Farmers are struggling to keep up with all the chaos that has taken over China, having to deal with wrecked farmland and the competing foreign powers that creates an unfair competition that only favours the imperialists, leaving many peasants praying for an end to this madness."

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea3a_desc: "The situation has stabilised, and at long last, agriculture is starting to recover. However, this is still only a small step in the right direction. The government shall spare no effort to ensure that full recovery is achieved."

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea4a: "Recovered Agricultural Sector"
 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea4a_desc: "The agricultural sector has finally made a recovery, thanks to the government programs and the hard work of the people.

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea5a: "Revolutionary Agricultural Sector"
 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea5a_desc: "The agricultural sector is now truly revolutionary. It has come all the way from complete and utter collapse to being the pride of the people. With several modernisations, reforms and innovative ideas, the breadbasket of the nation is now truly a sight to behold."

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea2b: "Weak Agricultural Sector"
 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea2b_desc: "The agricultural sector is in shambles. Severely outdated tools and methods, and damaged farms are unfortunately a normal sight. No more! The government must embark on an ambitious agricultural development spree to save the countryside from ruin."

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea3b: "Recovering Agricultural Sector"

 YUN_agrarian_economy_idea4b_desc: "Full agricultural recovery has now been made. The farmers now toil with a never before seen enthusiasm, and the gain is plentiful.

 YUN_militarised_state_idea2a_desc: "Enemies on all sides constantly look to Southern China, and it must always have the capability to defend itself.

 YUN_militarised_state_idea3a_desc: "Several notable strides have already been made towards the end goal of complete militarisation of the economy, with even the fiercest sceptics now coming around to the idea.

 YUN_militarised_state_idea3b: "Expensive Military"
 YUN_militarised_state_idea3b_desc: "Despite some strides being made towards cleansing the rot, military expenses are a constant drain on the budget and, frankly, will get the government and especially the people nowhere. This is a problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible."

 YUN_militarised_state_idea4b: "Balanced Economy"
 YUN_militarised_state_idea4b_desc: "With the balancing of the budget, the last of the bloat has been removed from the military and the government can finally begin properly paying off debts.

 YUN_militarised_state_idea5b: "Healthy Economy"
 YUN_militarised_state_idea5b_desc: "It took a lot of time and effort from both the government and the people, but finally the economy can be considered to be in proper shape.

 YUN_national_revolution_idea_desc: "The idea of national revolution now drives everything: The people are fully dedicated to making Dr. Sun's vision of China a reality in accordance with the three principles, his greatest gift to the Chinese people. This is especially felt in the breakneck pace of China's economic development, with the economy functioning as the lynchpin of the nation's harmony. Instead of serving foreign imperialism and concessions, the economy now serves the prosperity of China and her people, ensuring that the three principles can be realised to their fullest potential, just as Dr. Sun intended."

 YUN_union_of_class_and_society_idea_desc: "Within Ancient China there existed four classes: peasants, artisans, scholars and merchants. Living in perfect harmony together, they cooperated for the mutual benefit of society and nation as long as the government guaranteed good governance. China itself is forever uniquely positioned to achieve a revolution to a class-led society without having to use class-warfare. If we are to restore the harmony between class and society, we must first restore mutual respect and self-love for neighbour and workplace."

 YUN_achieving_minsheng_idea: "Achieving Minsheng"
 YUN_achieving_minsheng_idea_desc: "The ultimate goal of the Chinese revolution, as well as the driving force throughout the whole of history, has always been that of the pursuit of \"People's Livelihood\", or Minsheng. Everything the party enacts is towards this end goal of granting the people welfare. Minzu and Minquan, Nationalism and Democracy, they are ultimately subservient towards the responsibilities of the state to provide Minsheng towards the populace. Different from syndicalism and socialism, Minsheng shall utilise the revolutionary force of every class to limit expansion of power by any class, and enable state power to eliminate even the concept of class."

Particular effort is drawn to enhancing the quality of life for women and young children, in order to provide much needed material and feminine medical care to the rural countryside."

 YUN_the_new_life_movement_idea: "The New Life Movement"
 YUN_the_new_life_movement_idea_desc: "As the Nationalist Government now controls the Chinese country and has completed the Northern Expedition, we must seek to regenerate and rejuvenate the energy by reviving the morality of Confucianism and by prescribing quaint rules of personal conduct. This is Confucianism for the masses, devoid of philosophical subtleties, stripped to its ethical essentials, a sloganised Confucianism that would ensure the consumption of the four virtues: property, justice, honesty, and self-respect. Through the 96 rules governing daily behavior, the Chinese people ought to be instructed on how to be prompt, button their clothes, stand straight, and not eat nosily. To restore our nation and gain revenge for our humiliations, then we need not talk about guns and cannon, but must first talk about washing our faces in cold water. In doing so, we will be able to transform the inner man and fabricate a new society and a stronger nation."

 YUN_daughters_of_a_new_china_idea: "Daughters of a New China"
 YUN_daughters_of_a_new_china_idea_desc: "The National Revolution does is not just a revolution against imperialism, it is a cultural revolution, a social revolution dedicated to the uplifting of all of the oppressed masses. As women do indeed help hold up the sky, they are an indispensable aspect of the national revolution. Yet Western loose morals and vices have long turned the women of China into a degenerative mess, that ought to be resolved by the new institution of party rule. We should encourage women to be dutiful, to be the new matriarchs of innocent and revolutionary families, and to help participate in the war effort."

 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_idea_1: "Provisional Constitution Question"
 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_idea_1_desc: "The growing divide within the ruling Kuomintang between supporters of President He Yingqin and his detractors led by Hu Hanmin has escalated amid tensions over the proposed Provisional Constitution. There is a growing sense of uncertainty over the direction of the party, and it is unclear if the Generalissimo will be able to get his way this time."

 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_idea_2: "Provisional Constitution Crisis"
 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_idea_2_desc: "The growing divide with the ruling Kuomintang over the Provisional Constitution has culminated in Hu Hanmin's arrest. The ensuing unrest has forced He Yingqin's resignation, throwing the party-state into chaos. Contradictory orders and vicious infighting has degraded the functioning of the government and the morale of the military."

 YUN_GXC_war_morale_idea_intro: "The outbreak of war between Yunnan (Dian) and Guangxi (Gui) has pitted the two province in a brutal rematch of their 1925 conflict. The Yunnan Army, which seeks to march past Guangxi and onwards to Guangdong, must go on the offensive and seize crucial cities to sustain their offensive before morale drops."

 YUN_GXC_war_morale_idea_4_desc: "$YUN_GXC_war_morale_idea_intro$\n\nSpirits are high among the Yunnan Army and their soldiers feel confident in their ability to win this bout.

 YUN_autonomous_armies_level0: "Autonomous Armies"
 YUN_autonomous_armies_level0_desc: "For all of his posturing, rallying, and shaking of fists, Tang Jiyao's hold on Yunnan's ever ferocious militarism is fragile, and brittle. Deposed by Gu Pinzhen in the early 1920s, Tang Jiyao's influence would never recover, and control of his armies would slowly slip out of his grasp. Increasingly reliant on bandit armies, and increasingly dejected by his closest commanders such as Long Yun, or Hu Ruoyu, the state of the once proud Yunnan Army is that of a sorry one. Local garrison commanders and generals alike run their fractured units like fiefdoms based on personal loyalties, no longer swearing true fealty to the provincial governor. Run amok, the King of the Southwest is nothing more than the King of Kunming, and even that is debatable."

 YUN_legacy_of_the_huguojun_level_1_desc: "The Huguojun, or National Protection Army, were the great saviours of the Republic in its time of great struggle against Imperial Ambitions. The perfidious Yuan Shikai, sought to tear up the hard fought values of the Xinhai Revolution, trample over the constitution, and declare himself as the Hongxian Emperor. Yet the brave leaders of Yunnan stood defiant against his desire for autocracy. Liang Qichao, Cai E, Tang Jiyao, Li Liejun, Yang Sen, all of these brave men are heroes of modern China, having defied the odds against the Central Government's army, triumphing against the likes of Wu Peifu, Cao Kun and Feng Yuxiang.\n\nWithout a doubt, their brave victories could not have been so swift, so hard fought, if it was not for the superior training, vigour, and dedication of the graduates of Kunming Military Academy. Once again a time of great conflict is upon the nation, and the leadership of Yunnan must again march to save the nation. Recalling the glory days of the Huguojun, the Yunnan Army is focused on excellent drill, officers and command, rather than superior armaments. For if one thing is for certain, a devout militaristic warrior spirit can triumph even the most well equipped division."

 YUN_rejuvenation_of_national_struggle_level_1_desc: "With the restoration of the Kuomintang to power, the National Revolutionary Army has been granted a second lease on life. With the influence of both the party and Whampoa cliques, a new strain of military thought has been born from the failures of the Northern Expedition and realities of the situation. With their enemies far more well equipped, well supplied, and without a doubt more numerous, the Kuomintang have decided to use their greatest strength: the Chinese people themselves. By focusing on waging a people's war, the National Revolutionary Army will become a true conduit for the people's rage.\n\nFocused on agile irregular units, combined with guerilla harassment campaigns, and using every possible avenue to pitch battles and engagements in their favour, the National Revolutionary Army has focused on waging warfare in the most pragmatic fashion possible. Idolising not control of cities or villages, but instead total control for a total victory, the NRA hopes to elude their more centralised opponents, and out manoeuvre them with mobile warfare tactics."

 YUN_baring_our_teeth_idea_desc: "The Yunnan Army may be down, but it is not fully out. With limited capacity to still propel our influence out of our de-facto borders, it is time for the beast to reawaken, to renew its arsenals, and show everyone why Yunnan has been the Kingmaker of the Southwest for the past decades."

 YUN_vanquishing_personalism_idea: "To Be Rid of Personalism"
 YUN_vanquishing_personalism_idea_desc: "Our institutions and armies are rife with decay, rot and corruption. A fate befallen by all warlord armies, the Yunnan Army bureaucracy thought itself immune to such encroachment by paltry forces at play, and yet the current state of the army is evidence enough of our fall from grace. To excise such rot, it is necessary to once again reimplement the frequent rotations of command, mandate continued education and study within Kunming, and consolidate our high command staff, removing those who were granted titles to alleviate their political ambitions."

 YUN_kunming_military_academy: "Kunming Military Academy"
 YUN_kunming_military_academy_desc: "Organised by Hu Jingyi on behalf of Governor Wang Wenshao, the Yunnan Military Academy was formally promulgated in August 1909, with the first general manager being Gao Erdeng, and the first principal being Li Genyuan. With Li consolidating his role by taking over as general manager, he would shape the course of the institution into that mirroring the Shikan Gakko, or Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Prioritising hard, extensive training, the academy has produced some of the best military minds of this era of warfare, and is considered one of the \"Big Three Major Military Academies\" of China.\n\nWith the motto \"Endure Hardship, in which resides the basis of reform\", the reputation of the institution is far reaching, having received positive remarks from Baoding and Whampoa faculty alike. Training is based off of a more martial education content, focused on military studies, drill and field training, with an infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering and transportation department. Notable alumni and instructors include the likes of Cai E, Tang Jiyao, Li Liejun, Li Genyuan, Liu Cunhou, Yang Jie, Zhu De, Zhu Peide, Long Yun, and many more."

 YUN_ensuring_ideological_cohesion_idea_desc: "To much of our dismay, the Yunnan Army is a hotbed of combative ideological adherents. Those self-serving, those beholden to the ideals of the Three Principles, to Republicanism, those apolitical. However first and foremost, the Yunnan Army is a military force, and should function on the basis that it is destined to achieve military goals to carry forth political ones. Undergoing a period of ideological pruning may be detrimental to our overall command, but in the long term it will ensure that the political prospects of our government are carried without a hitch."

 YUN_handling_overglorification_idea: "Handling Over-glorification"
 YUN_handling_overglorification_idea_desc: "With its tenure of activity, the Yunnan Army has become but a paper facade of its glory days. More focused on pompous displays of arrogance, parade marches, spiffy uniforms, and goose-step rather than field training and drills. If we are to return to the position of national champions, it is time to put away the military dress, the medals, and once again return to the down-to-earth reputation of our forebears."

 YUN_dare_to_die_idea_desc: "Salvation does not come to those who wait but rather to those who are willing to give it all, their livelihoods, their families, and most of all their lives for the freedom and liberty of China. As the bugle sounds and the Yunnanese soldier rises to take his stand in this pivotal moment of Chinese history, bold and courageous individuals should seek to form dare to die corps in the mold of the martyrs of the Double Ninth Uprising, so that they too can offer their lives in sacrifice for a free China."

 YUN_to_bear_sacrifices_idea: "To Bear Sacrifices"
 YUN_to_bear_sacrifices_idea_desc: "If we are to truly march for the Chinese nation and its institutions, there is no greater strength for the military man to hold than the capacity to endure suffering. For if we can endure suffering, we cannot lose, and victory is but an assurances. Instilling this spirit not just in our military leaders, but in our populace too, we can bring forth China's own inherent Bushido, and become unconquerable."

 YUN_political_commissars_idea: "Political Commissars"
 YUN_political_commissars_idea_desc: "Beholden to an ever expanding army, and with increasing recruitment outside of Yunnan, the political outlook of our army grows increasingly muddied. Whilst we will not bend to the pure political indoctrination witnessed in party state armies such as the NRA, by enlisting and assigning a series of Political Commissars to units, we can ensure that the new Huguojun retains its course. Never shall we fall to self-serving corruption for as long as China believes in the might of its army, and if China is indeed to be saved by the army, then the education of the masses must begin with the armed forces - so that they will be truly an army dedicated to the cause of the militaristic nation-state."

 YUN_prioritisation_of_military_victory_idea: "Exalt the Military Victory"
 YUN_prioritisation_of_military_victory_idea_desc: "The Huguojun had one goal in mind when they declared their crusade against Yuan Shikai: military victory. For with military victory, their political goals can be instated upon the whole nation. Such unrelenting devotion to military success saw our men sacrifice everything to contribute towards it, and if we are to succeed in China's Darkest Hour, it will be up to our men to once again perish for the good of the nation."

 YUN_seizing_our_land_idea: "Seizing our Rightful land"
 YUN_seizing_our_land_idea_desc: "For too long have the Burmese held onto rightful Chinese land, granted due to the weakness of the decadent Qing. If we are to be the true protectors of China, we must unite all of it, no matter how small. The Yellow Book Affair, as it has become to be known, is perhaps scoffed at by foreign powers, but for us Chinese, it is merely setting things right."

 YUN_officers_prerogative_idea_desc: "Emphasising the initiative and command capacity of lower level commanders within the Yunnan Army, the military high command has granted them the ability to discern the best course of action to achieve their tactical military goals in line with the overall strategic goal. Our officers are our strongest asset, and it would be wise to trust their judgement."

 YUN_concentration_of_popular_will_idea: "People's Arms Manufacturing"
 YUN_concentration_of_popular_will_idea_desc: "Evidently, the Chinese people rush to support our armies every step of the way, however our men still lack guns and armaments. If we are to truly stand up as the defenders of the people and their rights, we must mobilise them not just in the fields but the factories also. For every bullet made, is another oppressor of the people's will vanquished."

 YUN_frontlines_everywhere_idea: "Frontlines, Everywhere"
 YUN_frontlines_everywhere_idea_desc: "It is not just enough for potential invaders to have to engage our military forces in direct combat, for they must also deal with the mobilisation of guerilla units in their backlines. The deeper they march into our territory, the increasingly fragile their supply lines become, and the bolder our guerillas become. Continuously, we will wage a complete and utter people's war against invaders."

 YUN_lower_level_autonomy_idea: "Yunnanese Auftragstaktik"
 YUN_lower_level_autonomy_idea_desc: "Auftragstaktik, or mission-type tactics, is a method of command practised by delegating junior military leaders a clearly-defined strategic objective, timeframe, and the necessary forces to complete said objective, whilst leaving the execution and best application of resources provided to their diligence. With our military theorists having studied the Weltkrieg, the superior performance of the German Imperial Army was in-part due to their delegation of command. To replicate their successes, we shall employ our own level of lower officer autonomy."

 YUN_a_hundred_regiments_idea: "Hundred Regiments Offensive"
 YUN_a_hundred_regiments_idea_desc: "A campaign masterminded by our greatest military theorists and strategists, the military high command has drafted an ambitious and extensive plan requiring only one hundred regiments. With one hundred regiments, our army can annihilate any invader or opponent, no matter their strength. Launching forward the great might and spirit of the Chinese nation, our enemies are sure to cower in utter terror."

 YUN_the_lightning_school_idea: "The Lightning School"
 YUN_the_lightning_school_idea_desc: "At odds with the traditional naval cliques of Fujian and Shandong, the newly founded \"Lightning School\" is a training school founded by intrepid admiral Ouyang Ge. However, not actually under its own jurisdiction, the Lightning School is an arm of Kunming Military Academy, and is considered by traditional naval staff to merely be the \"Kunming Military Academy of the Navy\". Hoping to spur on a new revitalised naval tradition for the Chinese people, it specialises in joint navy-land operations, and the extolling of exceptional leadership for admiralty."

 YUN_republic_of_china_navy_level_2_desc: "The precursor to a modern Chinese republican navy dates back to the early days of the Xinhai Revolution when the Ministry of the Navy was formed in the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. The former Qing Dynasty admiral Liu Guanxiong became the first Minister of Navy during this turbulent period. Following the Warlord Era and the subsequent Xuantong Restoration, many elements of the Republic of China Navy fled south for the Kuomintang and Federalist strongholds, while many others chose to remain loyal to the government in Beijing.

It is only by fear that the Party should rule, through the rule of law and complete abject brutality should the knights of the revolution cleanse and purify the party elements from its degenerative forces. Inspired by the Japanese Kempatai, the founder of the Tewu Li Shizhen has sought to organise his forces into two branches.

China is a great country, filled with abundant natural resources, and long has she been chained to the whims fo foreign imperialists who have exploited the rights and resources of the Chinese people for their own gain.

 YUN_rampant_hyperinflation_desc: "All around us the Chinese nation can bear witness to the fruitless yields of capitalistic endeavours on the Chinese national economy. Warlordism, civil strife, the Northern Expedition, and finally the Second Sino-Japanese War has sent China into practical freefall. Numerous foreign investors withdraw their stocks and interests, the Japanese contributions within Manchuria are clearly defunct, and the Legations continue to harass or otherwise treat the Revolutionary regime with apprehension and caution.

In the shadows, in their intellectual circles, their coffee clubs and their book club meetings, the Chinese educated elite are fearful. Fearful of Chinese democracy being squashed in totality once and for all. Utterly imperfect, the regimes that have come before at least maintained pretenses of a \"democracy\". Yet with the Party's crusade towards ensuring truthful and faithful Chinese democracy after a period of Tutelage, our people's morale dampens. Not only is this felt in the general atmosphere, but in the morale of our soldiers too. Whampoa must make no pretenses, the China that will emerge from the National Revolution will be that of a better one than before, with the mass participation of every Chinese citizen in the selection of their leadership."

Party editorials are decrying the Kuomintang's governance as one that has \"dissipated the hopes of the masses\". Not only that, they insist that the Party has \"become remote from the masses, and in many places is simply hated by the masses!\" It has become evidently clear that the complete lack of political and military solutions to the problems that China faces in the wake of the fight for survival has resulted from an absolute failure of the party and its governmental organs."

 YUN_ending_government_inanity_desc: "For too long has the party ruled rather irrationally, ambivalent to the true needs and desires of the Chinese people. Exhibiting an arbitrary decision making process that sometimes even circumvents the Central Executive Committee, the bureaucratic growth of the Party State has become a cancer of its own being. Existing and subsiding off of its own self-preservation instincts, rather than the desire for efficient governance. Civil Engineering has proposed a series of radical, and highly controversial, reforms that would see the implementation of a form of semi-constitutional rulership.

Gaining its moniker due to being drafted in the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.\n\nConstantly iterated upon, the constitution ultimately never saw the light of day despite the push from the Beiyang Parliament. However with the primacy of the Political Science Clique, the constitutional committee was finally reconvened and included the upper echelons of the Party's government. Espousing a wide ranging sweep of unimpeachable civil rights, restrictions on the presidency, the utilisation of a bicameral system, independence of the judiciary and much more, the constitution is a surprisingly liberal turn for the domineering technocracy of the Tutelage period."

Their calls for the various provinces to work towards implementing local self-government and then peacefully unite together into a federal republic achieved some traction, but after a promising start it was rejected by both northern and southern governments. The Zhili's successful unification by force discredited the movement, and many came to associate the movement as little more than a front for warlordism.\n\nAs one of the strongest and most earnest proponents of Federalism for decades, few have begun to believe in Tang Jiyao and his prophetising of a new Federal Republic. Insisting upon Anti-Militarism, Provincial Elections, and Constitutional Rule, he has but ruled the Southwest as a dictator in perpetuity despite this. To rebuild belief and hope in the Federalist movement is undoubtedly arduous hurdle to tackle, but the Yunnan Federalists might be the men to do it."

Chinese experiments with Federalism previously culminated in the promulgation of the Cao Kun Constitution in 1923, with its further refinements in 1928. Ostensibly Federalist, it was both ill-informed, ill-enforced, and utterly incapable of serving as a national constitution in large part due to how vague it was. Refusing to make the foolish mistake of their predecessors, the Yunnan Federalists vow to ensure a compliance with a new Chinese Federalism, one based off of the success stories: Hunan, Yunnan. Not one based on the folly power-grab of charismatic charlatans.\n\nHowever, Chinese Federalism is an unwieldy beast, with numerous opposing interpretations. For the Yunnanese, they are split upon the precipice; sticking to the ideals valued by Zhang Taiyan, granting sweeping autonomy to the provinces in a nigh Confederation format. Or moving towards the Liangist strain of thought; a strong, centralised, and authoritarian form of Federalist democracy upon which the Chinese tradition for the masses' civic participation can be built."

Whilst mandating Buddhism as some sort of state religion is absolute heresy to our Republican values, it stills serves as a shared binding for many within the nation.

Equalisation of the land, alongside Land to the Tiller, those are but naturaly and prompt responses to China's near-Feudal state. However, the government cannot enforce the absolute equalisation of wealth; redistributions or appropriations. For that would naturally instill chaos within China's delicate balance.

Nonetheless, an anti-partisan Civil Service should be the model for which the nation strives towards.

 YUN_NPA_popular_support_the_new_age_of_export_militarism_desc: "$YUN_NPA_popular_support_endgame_desc$\n\nPerhaps exhibiting the greatest virtues of the legendary Yunnanese heroes of old, Lu Han has brought a new meaning to \"only the strong survive\". Rising within the ranks of the Dian Clique, Lu circumvented both his cousin Long Yun, and his rival Hu Ruoyu, to ascend to the highest office in the whole nation. Adventurous, judgemental, a political chameleon at his finest, Lu has aligned with revolutionaries, democrats, and warlords alike, hoping to maintaing the initiative on Chinese militarism, and cement the nation's role in the world stage."

 YUN_celebrating_revolutionary_tradition: "Celebrating Revolutionary Tradition"
 YUN_celebrating_revolutionary_tradition_desc: "Modern China is a nation born within the flames of revolutionary fervour, there can be no denying it. It is a nation of sacrifices, of courage, and as such it is only natural that government's embrace, celebrate, and extol such virtues. In this all consuming civil war, you cannot deny the righteous Chinese youth and citizens their right to exhibit their anger at the cruel state of the nation's affairs, instead you must harness it to see a new China form from the ashes."

 YUN_hinging_everything_on_total_victory: "Hinging Everything on Total Victory"
 YUN_hinging_everything_on_total_victory_desc: "Ever in pursuit of that decisive victory, that first kick in the door that shall cause the obliteration of the enemy's lines and morale, this is what the Kunming Military Academy trained the Yunnan Army for. Vigour, the endurance of hardship, and the upholding of a revolutionary republican ideal. Only through such difficulties, may the nation exhibit reform and progress."

 YUN_chinas_praetorians: "China's Praetorians"
 YUN_chinas_praetorians_desc: "Defending China's republican institutions, the constitution, and her frontier border with their lives, the Yunnan Army is the last line of defence for many Chinese. Called upon once more to fight for the values often forgotten by those in the Capital, the Yunnanese shall not allow autocracy, or the flagrant abuse of law and judiciary to see the sundering of Five Races Under One Union."

 YUN_faltering_hopes: "Faltering Hopes"
 YUN_faltering_hopes_desc: "And to what end? To what end did so many brave soldiers die? Without order, or without reason, it would appear that the morale of the Yunnanese lines have utterly collapsed, welcoming mass defections, surrendering of key positions, and an ultimate sense of defeatism within the ranks. Whilst the high command insists to the Governor that they can push on, few share their optimism."

 YUN_increasing_isolationist_politics: "Increasing Isolationist Politics"
 YUN_increasing_isolationist_politics_desc: "To combat increasing hostilities outside of the sphere of Yunnan's control, the provincial administration has adopted a policy of isolationism, outwardly stating their abandoning of national ambitions, hoping to retain their corner of the Southwest alone. In conjunction with this reorientation, the Governor has ordered an increase in the development of fortifications and trenches at key weakpoints within Yunnan and Guizhou."

 YUN_culling_incompetents: "Culling Incompetents"
 YUN_culling_incompetents_desc: "Many within the Yunnan Army still retain loyalties to Tang Jiyao, or other spectres of the past administration, and without a stable control on the military arm, few can expect to survive years in office as Governor of any province, let alone one as militarised as Yunnan. By conducting a swift and thorough army purge, reorganising and slimming divisions, alongside promoting key loyalists, the Yunnan Army is undergoing a stringent period of reconstruction."

 YUN_continuation_of_the_tang_policy: "Continuation of the Tang Policies"
 YUN_continuation_of_the_tang_policy_desc: "Whilst Governor Tang may no longer hold the reigns in his steadfast grip, much of his old administration has managed to survive both the recent coup and turmoil before that. Indispensable in their efforts to keep the provincial bureaucracy from falling to anarchy, the new Governor has deigned it a pragmatic yet unpopular move to retain much of the existing civil servants, whilst continuing the reform plans implemented and produced by Tang Jiyao's administration."

 YUN_tribute_for_autonomy: "Tribute for Autonomy"
 YUN_tribute_for_autonomy_desc: "Whilst not wholly conquered, the Yunnan Clique has at least nominally sworn fealty to another Chinese warlord with far more national ambitions. In order to preserve local autonomy, and to prevent another disastrous offensive war, the Yunnan provincial administrations has begun to forward materiel and industrial aid to their allies, as a sort of tithe."

 YUN_maintaining_open_mindedness: "Maintaining Open Mindedness"
 YUN_maintaining_open_mindedness_desc: "Ever the pragmatist, Long Yun has often kept his options ever open and ever available in matters involving Yunnan's external positioning. Be it Reformist, Warlord, or Chairman, Long has shaken hands with associates of all backgrounds, and cast himself equally as a democrat, a principled Governor, or resilient revolutionary. But at home, make no mistake, the King of Yunnan rules with a harsh policy, annihilating any potentially destabilising force foolish enough to rear its head."

 YUN_revival_of_export_militarism: "Revival of Export Militarism"
 YUN_revival_of_export_militarism_desc: "Foolishly, previous Yunnanese administrations sought to retreat entirely from their duties and investments outside of provincial control. Opting to abandon national ambitions and isolating the Clique from the rest of China, they bore witness to a great diminishing of Yunnan's capacity to exert itself. Not only within the nation, but on the borders in the West, and Southeast. Yunnan is a province known for being the kingmaker of the Southwest, and it is time that it acts like it."

 YUN_the_yunnan_provincial_economic_committee: "The Yunnan Provincial Economic Committee"
 YUN_the_yunnan_provincial_economic_committee_desc: "Founded by Lu Chongren, Miao Yuntai, Li Peiyan, Zhang Banghan, and many others, the Yunnan Provincial Economic Committee's purpose is to rectify the dire economic situation that the province has recently found itself in. With an increased period of warfare and a collapse in financial stability alongside trade, the YPEC has been tasked with finding novel solutions to Yunnan's current difficulties. Through methods such as the reformation of the tax services, establishment of new bureaus and collection networks alongside the levying of new taxes, monopolies on opium and other goods, and nationalisation of provincial banking services, the YPEC has been granted a relatively free hand to conduct itself as it sees fit to save Yunnan's economy."

 YUN_spartan_education: "Spartan Education"
 YUN_spartan_education_desc: "Held to the highest regard for his service in local provincial educational matters, Cun Shusheng has been granted the spotlight by the Yunnan provincial government to popularise his methods of \"Spartan Education\". By teaching students to be self-sufficient warriors capable of surviving the harsh reality of a nation with thousands of years of tradition under-siege, he hopes to cultivate a sense of duty, honour, pragmatism and adherence to new ideas amongst Yunnan's future generations."

 YUN_establishing_a_provincial_monopoly_idea: "Establishing a Provincial Monopoly"
 YUN_establishing_a_provincial_monopoly_idea_desc: "Devised by Lu Chongren, the Yunnan's new economic model revolves around the concept of finance sustaining production, which there onwards enriches finance. By expanding state-owned enterprises and vigorously improving local production methods whilst enforcing a strict state monopoly, Lu hopes to create an infinitely sustainable economic growth model. Competing with Miao Yuntai, Lu's Provincial Enterprise Bureau and four major banks have become the bedrock of his ambitious economic reforms."

 YUN_architect_of_a_new_china: "Architect of a New China"
 YUN_architect_of_a_new_china_desc: "Perhaps one of the greatest economists to have offered his services during the Warlord Era, and having served every Yunnanese provincial administration, Miao Yuntai rose to fame initially after his tenure as general manager of the Yunnan Tin Company saw the drastic rise in profits of the local tin industry, and as president of the Fudian Bank, alongside the provincial Chamber of Commerce. The Architect of much of Yunnan's economic success, he has once again managed to secure a lucrative economic deal with various foreign contractors to Yunnan's great benefit."

 YUN_industrialisation_by_the_train_track: "Industrialisation by the Train Track"
 YUN_industrialisation_by_the_train_track_desc: "Whilst railways may have led to the collapse of the Zhili Clique, it is an ever present fact that the interior of China still remains relatively untouched by modern track. With the Kunming-Haiphong Railway being the largest arterie in and out of Kunming, it serves almost exclusively to export goods such as tin and opium to Indochina, and onto further markets. If China is truly to be a modern nation, it must equally have plentiful modern track to sustain its industrialisation."

 YUN_devastating_economic_catastrophe: "Devastating Economic Catastrophe"
 YUN_devastating_economic_catastrophe_desc: "With the pursuit of unification of the nation, China has underwent a myriad of terrible troubles along such an unsteady path. Perhaps the worst of them all however, is that of the economic consequences of decades of warfare and warlordism. Hyperinflation, rampant militarism, civil war, banditry, and a general lack of financial stability or cohesion amongst the provinces has resulted in the mass withdrawal of investors, the general inability to efficiently collect taxes, or for there to be a unified national currency or tax system in the first place. AS the nation recovers, it is imperative that its best minds work swiftly to repair the presently dire economic straits."

 YUN_inexperience_and_lack_of_cohesion: "Inexperience and Lack of Cohesion"
 YUN_inexperience_and_lack_of_cohesion_desc: "Politically, the Dian Clique is far from a unified outfit. Appealing to all manner of local politicians, officers, and bureaucrats, the only ruling ideology of the day was inherent republican pragmatism. Similarly, Yunnan provincial political dynamics would ensure that the deciding fact of one's own success in the province was commonly that of one's own strength. Yet having emerged to rule the national stage, matters have become incredibly complex, requiring a certain level of skillful tact to navigate, all the while various organised political outfits besiege the Central Government for some sort of agenda."

 YUN_the_state_within_the_state: "The State Within the State"
 YUN_the_state_within_the_state_desc: "As the heirs to a legacy of Chinese militarism and the foundations of modern warlordism, it should become no surprise that the inherent vices of the Dian Clique have re-emerged with their new successes and conquests. Requiring the administration of vast swathes of territory far outside their home province, the National Army has become something of a hyper militarised and over-inflated goliath. With various attempts at insubordination since unification, and a certain level of \"Napoleonic\" belief in their own right to steer the nation, the army has in-effect become a state within the state, holding China hostage under its whims."

 YUN_of_many_cultures_and_many_histories: "Of Many Cultures and Many Histories"
 YUN_of_many_cultures_and_many_histories_desc: "Built upon the foundations of Five Races Under One Union, the Beiyang Republic has long espoused the notion of harmony between the Han, Manchu, Mongols, Hui, and Tibetans. Constructing the \"whole\" Chinese identity as a nationally binding sentiment, it still falls short of the necessary qualities to represent the many peoples that contribute towards the Chinese nation-state. In Hulunbuir and Barga, the Daur people once advocated for a six-nation republic, and in 1911 Cai E himself advocated for a seven-nation republic, adding Miao and Liao to the original five.\n\nBut China is a nation of many more: Zhuang, Yi, Tujia, Buyei, Dong, Yao, and other minorities constitute the Chinese identity. As such, representative of all Chinese, and ruled by a Yi President, the nation must embrace its multi-cultural identity, enshrining protections for minority cultures, and reflecting upon our joint history."

 YUN_the_roulette_of_backstabbing_and_betrayals: "The Roulette of Backstabbing and Betrayals"
 YUN_the_roulette_of_backstabbing_and_betrayals_desc: "With no clear cut \"leader\", the closest having been Tang Jiyao in his prime, the Dian Clique has perhaps been one of the most bloody and servile Warlord cliques of the whole era. With blood brother killing blood brother, and various coups having been conducted, or otherwise attempted, it must be of no surprise that with external enemies subdued, the tornado of malice would turn inwards. Like Luo Peijin, Zhu De, Gu Pinzhen, Long Yun, and Tang Jiyao before them, Lu Han and Hu Ruoyu have engaged in a brutal and bitter spat to declare their supremacy. And the stakes could not be any higher, for whomever emerges on top will not only secure the Dian Clique and Yunnan, but China as a whole."

 YUN_national_youth_league_affairs_bureau: "National Youth League Affairs Bureau"
 YUN_national_youth_league_affairs_bureau_desc: "Originally a provincial organisation started under the auspices of the Dian Clique to oversee the training of the future generations, the Yunnan Youth League Affairs Bureau has served as a model to be constituted all around the nation. Not only enshrining the values of the administration within the youth, but preparing them for their future as soldiers and contributing citizens to the Chinese nation-state, the Youth League informs them of their responsibilities to the national whole, and of their obligations towards the government and army. With personal politics remaining one's own sphere, the National Youth League Affairs Bureau strives for apolitical training, and influence within the youth, without the trappings of similar initiatives from the Kuomintang, or Young China Party."

 YUN_obligations_of_the_military_idea: "Obligations of the Military"
 YUN_obligations_of_the_military_idea_desc: "It is only natural that the warriors of unification, national self-strengthening, and the Republican revolution be the same men to lead the Chinese nation-state onto a new era of prosperity. Obligated to defend China's interests at home and abroad, the professional soldier should conduct himself in national politics akin to that of their career in the common soldiery. Whilst it is preferable that the men of words remain in their civilian spheres, and the men of guns in their military spheres, should the nation be at risk of subversion or otherwise, officers must but only seize the initiative to correct China's course."

 YUN_striking_a_mutually_beneficial_deal: "Striking a Mutually Beneficial Deal"
 YUN_striking_a_mutually_beneficial_deal_desc: "Long having been the backbone of China's prosperity, the gentry have seen much of their rights and say in national politics diminished under the stature of wartime conditions, and the necessity to sacrifice anything, and pursue any course, in order to defend the nation from imperialist invasion. Yet with the resumption of peacetime, they have begun to chafe under the authority of not only military governors and administrators all around China, but under the stresses of the masses, and of bandits.\n\nBy reassuring the gentry of their status in China's national harmony, and protecting them from their greatest threats, the government will be able to extract incredible usefulness in economic advancement, and political stability, as they aid in the restoration of order and finances. Albeit, some sympathetic to the plight of the masses raise concerns that the so-called \"mutually beneficial deal\" is a short term solution, with long term consequences."

 YUN_fallout_of_the_gentry_deal: "Fallout of the Gentry Deal"
 YUN_fallout_of_the_gentry_deal_desc: "Despite assurances to the contrary, the so-called \"mutually beneficial deal\", what was at least unofficial and handled by handshake and promises, has become a publicised controversy against the Central Government. With various tabloids and newspapers producing a series of dismissals and rebuttals of the government's land reform strategy, the publicisation of a clear preference for the \"Local Gentry and Evil Bullies\" over the plight of the common man has resulted in the masses protesting severely. Not only that, but with their increasing influence and amassment of wealth, the gentry have begun to avoid even their obligations to the state, skirting tax duties and otherwise ignoring state intrusions into their affairs."

 YUN_responsibility_for_the_nation_state: "Responsibility for the Nation-State"
 YUN_responsibility_for_the_nation_state_desc: "The President of China is expected in his role to serve in the creation of a shared nation-state, in which every citizen could assume their respective responsibility for the well-being of the nation state, and its survival. As such, the President's priorities must always align with constitutionalism and national unity, not partisan politics or other loyalties. Under a strong president, and a strongly centralised republic, China should be guaranteed stability, progress, and harmony. And should any such facet fail or be disregarded, the state's veto above all else is that of its Praetorian Guard, the armed forces."

 YUN_economic_regulation_committee: "Economic Regulation Committee"
 YUN_economic_regulation_committee_desc: "Consolidated as an outgrowth of local provincial efforts to modernise the Yunnan tax systems and reduce inefficiencies, the now national Economic Regulation Committee is a multi-faceted governmental organisation tasked with a myriad of duties to rectify state finances, incentivise investments, and provide for the nation's people. Abolishing all previous loans and levies, streamlining currencies into that of a new resilient paper currency and affirming taxes to the rate of five paper dollars for every existing silver dollar, and applying extra taxes on luxury goods are but a few of the many tasks the committee is involved with.\n\nIn conjunction, it serves to enhance and strengthen the state monopoly on various key nationalised industries, the advancement of local and international investments, repaying of foreign debts, and the further industrialisation of China wholesale."

 YUN_the_three_trainings_and_three_commandments: "The Three Trainings and Three Commandments"
 YUN_the_three_trainings_and_three_commandments_desc: "Advocated by An Enpu within the Dian Clique, the Three Trainings and Three Commandments are serious of modus operandi for which the army should conduct itself upon in order to reinforce strict discipline, and correct its mistakes. As such, the Three Trainings are the instilling of the values that \"honesty is sacred\", that \"diligence is omnipotent\", and that \"selfishness is evil\". Similarly, the Three Commandments are the outlawing of egoism, gambling, and other vices.\n\nStrictly guarding against corruption day and night, the soldiers must be reminded of their duties and honour, shirking the notion of bribes, deceiving the people, or violating the laws they defend in order to harm the public."

 YUN_maintaining_the_paradigm: "Maintaining the Paradigm"
 YUN_maintaining_the_paradigm_desc: "Strained to the breaking point, Yunnan's economy has long been in disrepair. Already weak and unstable from militarisation efforts, black monday has brought the house of cards falling. The clock is ticking: We must find a way to stave off total collapse with the limited resources at Yunnan's disposal lest our ambitions be nipped in the bud by permanent economic collapse."

 YUN_alleviate_the_gentry: "Alleviate the Gentry"
 YUN_alleviate_the_gentry_desc: "The gentry has played a pivotal role in Yunnan's history, and was of course badly hit by the current economic crisis. While Cai E directed Yunnan province towards a more martial and militaristic direction, Governor Tang Jiyao has attempted to somewhat tune down the militarisation. With the economy in tatters, the economy needs to be tended to once more, starting with the gentry."

 YUN_expanding_tin_exports: "Expanding Tin Exports"
 YUN_expanding_tin_exports_desc: "Unemployment is another major issue owing to the current economic crisis. Fortunately, There is a way to combat it by using Yunnan's historically rich tin mines to our advantage. By expanding the mines, we will produce far more jobs for the unemployed, as well as gaining the ability to further exploit Yunnan's rich tin reserves for expanded exports."

 YUN_dual_development: "Dual Development"
 YUN_dual_development_desc: "While Yunnan's industrial capabilities remain lacklustre, the province is rich with natural resources. While traditionally an export economy, Yunnan's resources can be used to develop domestic light industries and diversify the economy. Resources not shipped to Western markets shall be used to develop burgeoning light industries in Yunnan's cities."

 YUN_nationalisation_of_critical_industries: "Nationalisation of Critical Industries"
 YUN_nationalisation_of_critical_industries_desc: "The current economic crisis cannot be left to the whims of the free market. No, the provincial administration will require a more hands on approach, one which requires more revenue to be accumulated in the governorship. On top of that, nationalisation will allow the state to create new jobs for the unemployed, prevent labour abuse at the hands of the gentry, and prepare the province for war."

 YUN_appealing_to_berlin: "Appealing to Berlin"
 YUN_appealing_to_berlin_desc: "Yunnan's main connection to the international market is via the French-constructed Kunming Haiphong Rail and it acts as the province's greatest weapon supplier. The Germans have since inherited the rail, but have not continued military sales to the same degree. To incentivise Berlin, we will of course promise to keep our Vietnamese workers in check and implement stricter anti-banditry measures..."

 YUN_centralising_taxation: "Centralising Taxation"
 YUN_centralising_taxation_desc: "Inefficient taxation has long been a major issue for Yunnan's economy. However, attempts to centralise and streamline it have failed due to corrupt officials and a lack of personnel. With a need for increased provincial revenue, the province must centralise tax collection under one ministry of finance, rather than having it handled by multiple independent bureaus."

 YUN_kunming_to_guiyang: "Kunming to Guiyang"
 YUN_kunming_to_guiyang_desc: "Ever since the Yuan Dynasty brought the Southwest into China, Yunnan and Guizhou have shared a common destiny, bound together by circumstance and geography. Indeed, the two provinces suffered together during the last years of the Qing Dynasty. Sadly, the Northern Expedition split the two, with Kunming under Tang Jiyao, and Guizhou under the KMT. However, Dian and Qian once again fly the same flag, and never shall the two be split again!"

 YUN_united_xinan_model: "United Xinan Model"
 YUN_united_xinan_model_desc: "While Yunnan and Guizhou finally have once again become one, much work remains to be done. The Chinese Southwest has long been one of the least developed regions of China, and economic reforms thus far have been less than fruitful. If China is to escape the Century of Humiliation, the provinces must first liberate themselves from backwardness and foreign domination, and Yunnan and Guizhou will lead the charge."

 YUN_develop_yunnans_smelting_company: "Develop Yunnan's Smelting Company"
 YUN_develop_yunnans_smelting_company_desc: "Tang Jiyao's ambitions were not only to tackle industrialisation, but mining as well. One of the core pillars of the Yunnanese economy, Tang attempted to oversee the breaking of foreign dominance in mining, to limited success. Another critical avenue of economic modernisation came in the form of smelteries, and if Yunnan is to become a modern province, Yunnan's smelting must be done by Yunnanese companies in parallel to Yunnanese mining."

 YUN_provincial_reconstruction: "Provincial Reconstruction"
 YUN_provincial_reconstruction_desc: "Continuously devastated by never ending crises, Yunnan province remains crippled by poverty, banditry, and the scars of militarisation. Yunnanese governors have traditionally been successful in curbing banditry in the short term, but only the economic recovery will truly bring Yunnanese banditry down for good. Hand in hand, the gentry, peasantry, and government will work as one to bring much needed relief to Yunnan province."

 YUN_financial_regulation: "Financial Regulation"
 YUN_financial_regulation_desc: "Yunnan has long had a patchwork of tax collection, dating back to the Qing Dynasty. The last Viceroy of the Yun-Gui region, Li Jingxi, attempted to streamline taxation, but was unable to accomplish much before the Xinhai Revolution occurred. Even 20 years after Li Jingxi, Yunnan's problems remain much the same, and the system of taxation is no different. Governor [ROOT.GetLeader] must finally tackle proper taxation and finance if Yunnan is to prosper."

 YUN_centralised_planning: "Centralised Planning"
 YUN_centralised_planning_desc: "Leaving the economy to the whims of the market leaves it open to foreign domination, a fate the Chinese people know all too well. Modernity must be fostered with a firm hand from the provincial government, which will shepard the economy to a respectable condition and see Yunnan and Guizhou work as a well-oiled machine and achieve common prosperity for the peoples of both provinces."

 YUN_cultivating_the_bureaucratic_apparatus: "Cultivating the Bureaucratic Apparatus"
 YUN_cultivating_the_bureaucratic_apparatus_desc: "The state cannot hope to regulate and manage the economy efficiently or effectively without a proper bureaucracy. While the gentry would prefer that the government not stick its hands into their affairs, the government must do exactly that, for gentry while a respectable class in Yunnan are also an obstacle to our agenda. The Yunnan Economic Commission will help oversee Yunnan's smelting, mining modernisation, and agricultural development with gentry support."

 YUN_militarising_guizhous_ironwork_industry: "Militarising Guizhou's Ironwork Industry"
 YUN_militarising_guizhous_ironwork_industry_desc: "Yunnan and Guizhou, despite being unified under a single flag, still fall behind their provincial neighbours. Yunnanese militarisation is the only feasible option for the peoples of Dian and Qian to gain a leg up against the threats to our North and East. Guizhou still remains less militarised when compared to Yunnan, and its resources must be marshalled by Kunming in order to defend them from common threats."

 YUN_promoting_self_sufficiency: "Promoting Self Sufficiency"
 YUN_promoting_self_sufficiency_desc: "The imperialists that we are forced to serve enjoy their luxuries in their western cities whilst the Chinese people are chained to a life of poverty as we produce lucrative and essential materials for their consumption. The disease of capitalism ravages our lands and forces all to play, but wherever possible, the government of [ROOT.GetLeader] will keep the West at arm's length. Death to Imperialist extortion, long live the eternal spirit of the Chinese nation!"

 YUN_begin_grand_southern_reconstruction_project: "Grand Southern Reconstruction Project"
 YUN_begin_grand_southern_reconstruction_project_desc: "Yunnan has known nothing but strife since the Century of Humiliation began, but the administration's reformist aspirations have culminated in the form of the Grand Southern Reconstruction Project, the most ambitious economic reform agenda which will propel not only Yunnan, but southern China and soon the entire nation into the modern age! Long live [ROOT.GetLeader]!"

 YUN_streamline_superfluous_taxes: "Streamline Superfluous Taxes"
 YUN_streamline_superfluous_taxes_desc: "During the Qing Dynasty, Yunnanese taxation bureaus were established independent of each other, causing great headaches for the Kunming Administration. While the late Qing reforms saw attempts to centralise taxation, gentry opposition ultimately prevented total centralisation, and Yunnan became engulfed in war during the Republican era. At long last, plans have finally been laid out to restructure Yunnanese taxation."

 YUN_resurgent_south: "Resurgent South"
 YUN_resurgent_south_desc: "Day after day, factories come to life in Kunming. Yunnanese exports line the pockets of the Yunnanese people instead of Western powers. Ever since the Qing Dynasty, Southern China has seen the economy stagnate due to neglect, but the Grand Southern Reconstruction Project has seen long awaited development finally arrive. Let it be known that the south rises like a phoenix and the Chinese Century is at hand!"

 YUN_waking_the_tiger: "Waking the Tiger"
 YUN_waking_the_tiger_desc: "Ever since Cai E took the reins of Yunnanese governance, he has had to balance his militaristic ambitions with his reformist outlook, but ultimately chose to militarise the province heavily. Tang Jiyao aimed to rebalance the economy, but also couldn't abandon militarism. With the government putting all focus into economic reform, the state now finds itself at a crossroad, between continued militarisation or full rebalancing."

 YUN_national_defence_economy: "National Defence Economy"
 YUN_national_defence_economy_desc: "Yunnan finds itself encircled by vultures on all sides. Even with the wealth of Guangzhou at hand, the state must be prepared to push the Chinese worker, merchant and soldier to work as one. A strong emphasis on discipline will encourage everyone to work with sweat, blood and tears to bring about the national unification that will bring about a reborn nation. Without the army, there would be no new China!"

 YUN_funding_the_guangxi_reconstruction_movement: "Movement for Guangxi's Reconstruction"
 YUN_funding_the_guangxi_reconstruction_movement_desc: "Like Yunnan, Guangxi is the site of a decades-old militarist programme. During the short rule of Li Zongren and his New Guangxi Clique, the Guangxi Reconstruction Movement was adopted to modernise the province whilst keeping to Lu Rongting's militarist principles. While these reforms lack the scale of Yunnan's, supporting Guangxi's reconstruction will fuel the Southern war machine."

 YUN_urban_self_initiatives: "Urban Self Initiatives"
 YUN_urban_self_initiatives_desc: "During the late Qing reforms, Yunnanese Viceroy Li Jingxi attempted an ambitious programme of bureaucratic and economic reform. Ultimately gentry opposition limited his reforms to just the big cities of the province. While today's administration seeks out reform across all parts of China's economy and society in a centralised manner, limited autonomy to urban centres may churn out the reforms of tomorrow."

 YUN_dictating_foreign_trade: "Dictating Foreign Trade"
 YUN_dictating_foreign_trade_desc: "Over the years, foreign businessmen from Japan and the West have been exploiting our resources and killing the livelihoods of Chinese producers. No longer shall this be the case as we shall enact protectionist policies that will enrich the hands of the people rather than the pockets of those who have exploited us for centuries. The west found itself kept at arm's length under the Cantonese system, and so it shall be again."

 YUN_merchants_under_the_state: "Merchants under the State"
 YUN_merchants_under_the_state_desc: "Under earlier Guangdong administrations, the Merchant Corps enjoyed unprecedented levels of freedom, not unlike the Yunnanese Gentry. Taking advantage of the government's hospitality, the Merchant Corps has stolen from the Chinese people and acted as tax collectors for the Western powers and Tokyo. No longer will the Merchant Corps enjoy autonomy, for the nation must be united in a singular, patriotic direction."

 YUN_industrial_self_reliance: "Industrial Self Reliance"
 YUN_industrial_self_reliance_desc: "While Eastern China profits greatly from foreign investment and foreign-built factories, Yunnan's geography and location mandated that a more autarkic policy be adopted, lest the province become a resource state for the Great Powers, as it had been in previous decades. Adopting a more autarkic, self-reliant, or even mercantilist outlook on industrial modernisation will keep the south reliant on strength that is their own."

 YUN_expanding_the_kunming_arsenal: "Expanding the Kunming Arsenal"
 YUN_expanding_the_kunming_arsenal_desc: "Kunming cannot always rely on the mountains that surround it, so it must be ready to defend herself at all times and that means it needs a lot of equipment to be able to survive. Investing into the construction of new factories will help the efforts of building not only a stronger lifeline for the city of Kunming but to the rest of Yunnan and beyond. The Kunming Arsenal will surpass the Hankou, Taiyuan, and Shenyang Arsenals!"

 YUN_union_of_state_and_industry: "Union of State and Industry"
 YUN_union_of_state_and_industry_desc: "In the modern age, to modernise the military requires the modernisation of the economy. To modernise the economy, the bureaucratic apparatuses of the state must be operating at peak efficiency. The great effort of modernising the south requires all hands on deck, and total cooperation between all sectors of the economy and all aspects of the government. Yunnan must become a fierce machine of war and modernity."

 YUN_the_south_unshackled: "The South Unshackled"
 YUN_the_south_unshackled_desc: "Since the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Southern China has known nothing but despair and decay. Heightened by the Century of Humiliation, patriotic Chinese could only watch as the one-time centre of the world was pillaged by cruel Europeans and Japanese traitors. Southern China's time in the gutter has ended now, and the Guangzhou Government marches forward, modernised, rejuvenated, and free!"

 YUN_southern_reconstruction_commission: "Southern Reconstruction Commission"
 YUN_southern_reconstruction_commission_desc: "While [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration finds itself in a precarious position, it also offers a unique opportunity for Chinese renewal. Yunnan's recent history has been rife with militarism, but now with militarist institutions at a low, rebalancing Yunnan's economy is finally feasible. If China is to prosper, it must recover and be given breathing room. To that end, the Southern Reconstruction Commission will be the first major step away from militarism and towards prosperity."

 YUN_promoting_national_light_industries_desc: "The century of humiliation has deeply damaged China's light industry at the national level, furthering the people's suffering. No longer! Significant modernisations, developments and reforms will ensure that the nation's light industry finally prospers like it was always meant to, and lifts Chinese people up from their suffering under imperialism."

 YUN_promoting_foreign_investment: "Promoting Foreign Investment"
 YUN_promoting_foreign_investment_desc: "Guangzhou's importance not just to the South, but to China itself, cannot be overstated. During the Qing Dynasty, the Cantonese System helped control western trade in China, and give Beijing a preferential trade imbalance with the West. This system was abolished after the Opium Wars, but its legacy rings on. If China is to rise to prosperity, western trade must be encouraged, though not to the detriment of Chinese businesses. Both China and the West must profit from this arrangement."

 YUN_friendly_but_cautious: "Friendly But Cautious"
 YUN_friendly_but_cautious_desc: "While foreign investment is undoubtedly necessary to further national economic development, such an effort also demands carefulness in order to not fall into the trap of overreliance to foreign powers and their imperialism once more. In the Northeast, Marshal Zhang Zuolin finds himself hopelessly reliant on Tokyo, and it serves as a cautionary tale for the rest of China. China may greet the West with a firm handshake and a friendly smile but always remain on guard."

 YUN_developing_the_middle_man: "Developing the Middle Man"
 YUN_developing_the_middle_man_desc: "To make sure that foreign investments in Guangzhou go all according to plan, and maximise their efficiency, the government will have to take upon the mantle of the Middle man between foreign businesses and merchants in Guangzhou, providing necessary oversight and rational direction to the investments coming in from abroad."

 YUN_cantonese_trade_ties: "Cantonese Trade Ties"
 YUN_cantonese_trade_ties_desc: "Guangzhou, the City of Flowers, is tremendously important as a trading hub, and by leveraging trade ties between it and Yunnan, economic development would be rapidly accelerated. China's economy will be uplifted not through reliance on foreign imperialists, but through the strong ties and friendship between the Chinese provinces themselves."

 YUN_promoting_economic_integration: "Southern Interregional Trade"
 YUN_promoting_economic_integration_desc: "In order to fully utilise the economic potential of southern China, economic integration must be promoted. Several notable strides towards integrating Kunming and Guangzhou have already been made, and now, it is time to accelerate and bring this process to its natural conclusion. Yunnan will find its way through modernity by making itself indispensable in the Chinese domestic economy!"

 YUN_guangzhou_and_kunming_united: "A Tale of Two Cities"
 YUN_guangzhou_and_kunming_united_desc: "Under new management, Kunming has truly become one of the most important economic regions in China, and with further cooperation and integration with Guangzhou, new ground in Chinese interregional trade has been broken, and economic progress is better than ever before. Long may China prosper!"

 YUN_investment_in_mining: "Invest in Mining"
 YUN_investment_in_mining_desc: "In Yunnan, tin exports have already been expanded, and smelting is now done locally. However, this is not enough: For Yunnan, and by extension China, to continue its unshaken march to modernity, the mining industry must be developed further. Yunnan's reserves are as rich as ever, all that is needed now to do is tap even further into them. Gejiu will dominate not just the markets of Asia, but those of Europe as well!"

 YUN_rural_demilitarisation: "Rural Demilitarisation"
 YUN_rural_demilitarisation_desc: "Governor Tang Jiyao saw the issues that lay in Yunnan's unending militarisation, and attempted to combat it with several measures. Now, however, the [ROOT.GetLeader] Administration will go even further. Demilitarisation seeks to undo rural devastation, one of the worst side effects of Cai E's militarist programme. The demilitarisation of rural regions at last will go a long way towards relieving the populace and restoring hope in a better economic future."

 YUN_balancing_the_budget: "Balance the Budget"
 YUN_balancing_the_budget_desc: "Excessive military spending almost drove Yunnan's economy to utter ruin by creating an increasingly skewed budget and accruing crippling debt for the province. The time has come to cut down on the incessant funding of the military, and focus on paying off debts. Without a properly balanced budget, the door to modernity will remain forever closed."

 YUN_guangzhou_kunming_rail: "Guangzhou Kunming Railway"
 YUN_guangzhou_kunming_rail_desc: "It is time for Chinese interregional trade to be modernised even further: With the construction of a brand new railway between Guangzhou and Kunming, more trade will now go through the former, making us naturally less reliant on the Germans. With this new development, Yunnan will finally end decades of economic subjugation."

 YUN_prosperous_south: "A Prosperous South"
 YUN_prosperous_south_desc: "After decades of militarism, Southern China finds itself on a new path. While once Yunnan was known for being the great martial province of the south alongside Guangxi, Kunming now shows itself in a new light of peaceful modernity. While much of China remains in chaos and ravaged by war, Southern China turns a new leaf, an example for the rest of the nation!"

 YUN_backbone_of_the_south: "Backbone of the South"
 YUN_backbone_of_the_south_desc: "All throughout China's existence, agriculture has consistently played a role of utmost importance. Chinese civilisation sprung out of the Yellow River, derived from wheat farming. When China expanded into the south, rice farming was added into Chinese agriculture. For millennia, agriculture has stood as the primary pillar of the Chinese people, and thus its reformation into the modern era stands as our top priority."

 YUN_mechanising_agriculture: "Mechanising Agriculture"
 YUN_mechanising_agriculture_desc: "In the modern age, an agricultural sector is nothing without the proper mechanical tools. New industrial machines greatly increase output, and China too must harness the power of mechanised agriculture if the nation is to compete with the Great Powers. No longer will Chinese agriculture rely purely on human labour, for now our farmers must make use of motorised mechanisation."

 YUN_land_to_the_tiller: "Land to the Tiller"
 YUN_land_to_the_tiller_desc: "The ultimate goal of the National Revolution is to establish an equitable and revitalised Chinese state, with a citizenry infused with patriotic fervour. To that end, Chinese agriculture must not only be modernised, but equalised among the farming populace. Sun Yat-sen called for Land to the Tiller in his ambitious plans for the renewal of China, and with a Nationalist presence restored on the Mainland, the will of the eternal premier must be carried out."

 YUN_ending_rural_overtaxation: "Ending Rural Overtaxation"
 YUN_ending_rural_overtaxation_desc: "The rural areas have suffered greatly in decades past, with them sorely lacking in urbanisation and developmental programs and being constantly overtaxed. Many various taxation agencies were established to fund Kunming's agenda, but the lack of centralised control hampered responsible taxation. It is finally time to remedy this: A rural reconstruction campaign will be carried out across different regions, and the obscenely high taxes will be cut."

 YUN_material_reconstruction: "Material Reconstruction"
 YUN_material_reconstruction_desc: "The extent of the material damage done to the agricultural sector cannot be overstated. In order to raise it from the state of near-paralysis, significant material reconstruction efforts are necessary, and the government will of course act to provide them. Unending wars from the Warlord Era coupled with banditry have reduced the material wellbeing of the Yunnanese people to an all time low, but now the Nationalist Party will provide where Tang Jiyao could not."

 YUN_commercialising_agriculture: "Commercialising Agriculture"
 YUN_commercialising_agriculture_desc: "With the agricultural sector slowly coming back on track, new opportunities for economic growth are arising: One such opportunity is agricultural commercialisation. The abundance of tea and silk, in particular, can be sold for massive profit to greatly boost the economy. The commercialisation of agriculture on Chinese terms will allow wealth to not only flow into the hands of the government, but the people themselves."

 YUN_liberated_agriculture: "Liberated Agriculture"
 YUN_liberated_agriculture_desc: "The journey towards a true social revolution eludes Southern China yet still, but for the first time in decades, strides have been made in the right direction. The reforms of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration will not only uplift the people of the Southern China, but will become the inspiration for a nation-wide reform effort which will herald the end of the Century of Humiliation and the renewed rise of China on the world stage as an equal partner."

 YUN_maintaining_the_course: "Maintaining the Course"
 YUN_maintaining_the_course_desc: "Without a shadow of a doubt, the agricultural sector desperately needs an almost total makeover. Yunnan's agricultural state has been greatly reduced from the constant warring of the Warlord Era, and requires great reconstruction. While the Yunnanese method has proven slow, it is a careful and long thought out process developed by decades of trial and error. It is finally time to demonstrate what the culmination of decades worth of experience can do."

 YUN_the_opium_question: "The Opium Question"
 YUN_the_opium_question_desc: "Ever since the 19th century, Opium has been a scourge on the people of Yunnan. Its pervasiveness in the Yunnanese economy makes it particularly troublesome to root out as well. Tang Jiyao tried many times to suppress the poppies, but in doing so it hurt the local economy and pushed many poverty stricken regions into anarchic states of banditry. Even now, the question remains unclear whether to restart opium suppression or merely institute taxation."

 YUN_developing_local_granaries: "Developing Local Granaries"
 YUN_developing_local_granaries_desc: "Grain is of utmost importance in Southern China, especially as famines constantly threaten food supply. Until the agricultural sector achieves complete recovery, the threat of destructive famines is very much still present, and it would be prudent to develop and improve granaries in the region to more efficiently stock more grain. Not only will the threat of famine which Sichuan suffers from in the present, but also will assist in the supply of the local armies."

 YUN_dual_policy: "Dual Policy"
 YUN_dual_policy_desc: "While it is imperative that the Gentry do not control all government policy, their cooperation is also just as important. Li Jingxi found this out the hard way, and irrespective of the effects the Gentry have on government reform, they will prove useful for the development of the local economy. By giving them incentives, private industry will develop, and the wealth provided to the state will allow for increased funding to government projects."

 YUN_land_reclamation_initiative: "Land Reclamation Initiative"
 YUN_land_reclamation_initiative_desc: "Land reclamation has remained an underutilised idea in Southern China, until now. The Kaimeng land reclamation bureau established by Tang in years prior will assist in the efforts of modernisation and increasing revenue. Grain supply to the capital will be increased, and silk and rice production will hopefully increase. While the original bureau was less than successful, extra efforts will be put in to ensure that the renewed effort does not die out as well."

 YUN_modernism_with_yunnanese_characteristics: "Yunnan's Course to Modernity"
 YUN_modernism_with_yunnanese_characteristics_desc: "Yunnan is unique for the continuity of its reforms throughout its political history. The reformist agenda was passed from Li Jingxi to Cai E and Tang Jiyao. [ROOT.GetLeader] has worked tirelessly to maintain a long flowing method to reform, which although not as radical as the Nationalist agenda, will undoubtedly score a greater yield in the long term. The path to modernity will be achieved on the path of continuity, not aggressive rhetoric."

 YUN_white_sun_ascendant: "White Sun Ascendant"
 YUN_white_sun_ascendant_desc: "The Nationalist dream first came about several decades after the Taiping Rebellion. Fed up with Qing weakness and foreign domination, the Tongmenghui was the promise of a China free from imperialism and Manchu tyranny. The National Revolution was born out of the call for action from the Party Reorganisation of 1924. The National Revolution was crippled in 1927, but now the Kuomintang has not only rebounded but triumphed. Long live the Republic of China!"

Grounded in Chinese philosophy and morals, we shall strive towards the modern era Confucian-based cosmopolitan utopianism."

 YUN_a_new_social_organism: "A New Social Organism"
 YUN_a_new_social_organism_desc: "The individual is an element making up society, and society is formed out of the gathering of many individuals.

 YUN_pursue_international_legitimacy_desc: "When the Kuomintang collapsed in 1927 following the failure of the Northern Expedition, international legitimacy towards the Chinese Nationalist movement went largely to Wang Jingwei's rival Central Committee based in Paris. Yet, now that our control is established over the region of Beiping, we have the right to declare to the world that we are the sole and legitimate Republic of China."

 YUN_national_reconstruction_committee: "National Reconstruction Committee"
 YUN_national_reconstruction_committee_desc: "Ever since the Opium Wars, China has seen disaster after disaster without respite. While the fall of the Qing Dynasty promised a new age, the following Warlord Era plunged China into utter chaos and devastated the countryside. With the Northern Expedition restoring some semblance of unity, the task of reconstructing falls to the Kuomintang. The Government of [ROOT.GetLeader] has already outlined several bodies for the purposes of rural and urban reconstruction."

 YUN_autarkic_model: "Autarkic Model"
 YUN_autarkic_model_desc: "During the early Qing Dynasty, trade was controlled via the Cantonese System. It was designed to guard against commercial and trade threats from the Western colonial powers. The Canton System was brought down by the British in the Opium Wars, and since then China was economically colonised by the West and Japan. The Nationalist Party aspires for a China free politically and economically, and so the Chineses State will adopt a policy of self-reliance."

Economic equality will pave the path for China's path towards modernity, and beyond."

 YUN_rural_cooperative_movement: "Rural Cooperative Movement"
 YUN_rural_cooperative_movement_desc: "Ever since the creation of Chinese civilisation, farming has been a core staple of the Chinese way of life. While modernity must be embraced in order to revitalise the Chinese nation, agriculture will always remain the base. Thus, the Kuomintang's mission of achieving equity must see China's farmers rise out of humiliating poverty. To that end, the Nationalist Government will establish and support rural cooperative societies to supply farmers credit."

For too long, women have served as the properties of their husbands and been subjected to foot binding. For too long, peasants have been abused by their landlords and extorted by local officials.

The Three Principles are not a stepping stone to hedonistic anarcho-socialism, the principles are the means and the ends. Western ideas are nothing more than the empty promise of a better tomorrow, whereas the National Revolution delivers decisive action on the road to equality."

 YUN_developing_the_financial_sector: "Developing the Financial Sector"
 YUN_developing_the_financial_sector_desc: "While our National Revolution promises equity in response to the ravages of capitalism and imperialism, the Chinese State will be unable to assist its people without proper capital. To that end, China must learn the Western game of Finance and develop its financial sector to a state befitting a great power. Modern Financial Institutions will go a long way in not only shoring up the capabilities of the Chinese government but shore up foreign opinion of our government."

Just as Western ideals will no longer pollute this nation, so too will western capital not hold the Chinese people in a stranglehold.

Fretting too much to even assert itself beyond the provincial borders of Yunnan or Guizhou, it has allowed the remnants of the NRA to sit within Guizhou, the continued harassment by Yuan Zuming across the Guizhou border, and the increase of German influence within the provincial mines.

 YUN_yunnans_militarist_credidentials: "Yunnan's Militarist Credentials"
 YUN_yunnans_militarist_credidentials_desc: "The commitment of the Yunnan Leadership to the military profession is unheard of. The very prospect of switching to non-military studies horrified the father of Kunming Academy, Li Genyuan, so much so that he stated \"he would rather die\" than do so. If the Chinese nation had more militarist heroes and less weakling scholars or intellectuals, perhaps the nation would not be the way it is. Nonetheless, Yunnan must work to set things right."

 YUN_militaristic_and_patriotic_spirit: "Militaristic and Patriotic Spirit"
 YUN_militaristic_and_patriotic_spirit_desc: "The greatest issue facing China is survival. China can only survive if she developed a martial spirit through a revamped educational system, by glorifying military life in literature and music, and by raising the social status and esteem for soldiers. Such measures should work to instil glory in the accomplishments of our soldiers, and to make China a strong military power. In the world of realpolitik, only the strong will survive."

 YUN_the_huguojuns_bureaucracy: "The Huguojun's Bureaucracy"
 YUN_the_huguojuns_bureaucracy_desc: "An exception to the rule of military institutions, the Yunnan Army of the glorious past was a bureaucratically organised army. Officers are bound not just by loyalty, but by the fact that commands came from a position higher up in the name of the entire institution. Authority lies not in the person, but in the position itself, and the positions were a pyramid hierarchy in nature. Such values should shine in our new Huguojun."

 YUN_commitment_and_bravery: "Commitment and Bravery"
 YUN_commitment_and_bravery_desc: "The armies of National Protection, our dear and beloved Huguojun, once exhibited an esprit-de-corps that triumphed all enemies it faces. Be it the armies of Beiyang, Old Guangxi, or Sichuan, the Huguojun annihilated all. With our personal renown and prestige once more developing, it is time to again reinforce the bravery of our officers, and the maintenance of exceptional morale in dire circumstances."

 YUN_idealisation_of_political_goals: "Idealisation of Political Goals"
 YUN_idealisation_of_political_goals_desc: "No longer can we rely on the ideals and goals exhibited within the province, as more and more Northern provinces become under our control, hesitant to revolutionary change. As supported by many within the high command staff, the drafting of a political commissar system would centralise the political outlook of the Huguojun in light of the increasing recruitment of soldiers outside of Yunnan."

 YUN_prioritisation_of_military_victory: "Prioritisation of Military Victory"
 YUN_prioritisation_of_military_victory_desc: "Importance to the utmost is the overall goal of military victory. For whatever political outcomes our campaigns desire cannot be achieved without prior military victory over any opposition. By emphasising mobile warfare, bayonet attacks, and night assaults, our daring and surprise will be sure to compensate for any lacking faults of the army, and drive home our military superiority."

 YUN_to_bear_sacrifices: "To Bear Sacrifices"
 YUN_to_bear_sacrifices_desc: "The ideal military man should be motivated by patriotism, honour, loyalty and sense of duty towards the nation-state. Such a warrior has to be disciplined, obedient, and animated by a \"martial spirit\". With such a mindset, military men would be enabled to better discern national interest, and increase their willingness to sacrifice for it. To supplement such a mindset, we shall intensify physical training and military drills."

 YUN_knowledge_of_the_land: "Knowledge of the Land"
 YUN_knowledge_of_the_land_desc: "Sometimes, the most crucial component of the success of a battle is the proper manipulation of the battle's environment to accentuate the capacity of our soldiers. Luckily for us, the interior of China proves to be some of the most strenuous, arduous territory the world has to offer. Mountain ranges, deep rivers, and rows of hills, it is the perfect environment to further training in rough terrain."

 YUN_the_new_era_of_warfare: "The New Era of Warfare"
 YUN_the_new_era_of_warfare_desc: "Modern warfare bears witness to the third theatre of warfare, the aspect of air support, and it has also unleashed the rapid assault of armoured behemoths onto the battlefields of the world. Whilst China perhaps lacks the industry and capacity to have established a concrete armour corps prior to this point, with recent developments the bandwith for armoured brigades has grown, and Yunnan must be on the cutting edge."

 YUN_drafting_a_viable_supply_corps: "Drafting a Viable Supply Corps"
 YUN_drafting_a_viable_supply_corps_desc: "Without supplies, an army is nothing more than a roving band of malnourished, demotivated, and toothless tigers. Up until now the Huguojun has relied on limited motorisation of supply lines, the generosity of locals, and captured equipment. For a front as expansive as China's it is prudent to produce a centralised, regularly monitored system of provisions to sustain our deep thrusts into enemy territory."

 YUN_heirs_of_national_protection: "Heirs of National Protection"
 YUN_heirs_of_national_protection_desc: "Others may claim that they fight for the Nation, or for the Revolution, or even for the Republic. But none insofar have the true history of adhering to a struggle to become the saviours of the Chinese nation. Our soldiers die, brave and fearless, honeycombed by bullets, aware that their sacrifice is for the ultimate greater good of the nation-state. Originating from Yunnan, our army marches for China as a whole."

 YUN_fighting_for_our_stolen_land: "Fighting for Our Stolen Land"
 YUN_fighting_for_our_stolen_land_desc: "Having long been a region of dispute between British and Qing authorities, the border between Yunnan and Burma has never truly been properly demarcated. Inflamed by the Pianma incident of 1910, and the collapse of British Authority in Burma, we have begun to reignite our claims over the Southern region of the border, home to many valuable silver mines."

 YUN_yunnans_most_premier_caste: "Yunnan's Most Premier Caste"
 YUN_yunnans_most_premier_caste_desc: "Our resident elites are those remaining stragglers of the early generations of the Huguojun, and those of the generation immediately after the War of National Protection. Without them, the Army would not have the necessary depth and expertise to be able to draw from, and would remain an impotent force. Truly exalting every virtue of a military man of the nation-state, it is time to reward these brave men."

 YUN_integration_of_auxillaries: "Integration of Auxiliaries"
 YUN_integration_of_auxillaries_desc: "Whilst the Huguojun no lunger suffers from the unleashed cronyism of the autonomous armies of the past, we still make use of several irregular formations to supplement our wider regulars. Capable, and ultimately useful, the time for such divisions has passed, as we emerge onto the national and international stages of warfare. By granting commissions to auxiliary soldiers, we can further bolster our central army."

 YUN_heroes_of_the_nation: "Heroes of the Nation"
 YUN_heroes_of_the_nation_desc: "Without a doubt, the new, reformed Huguojun has proven itself to once again be the saviours of the Chinese nation. Rising up to all challenges every step of the way, we have triumphed. Instilling virtue, and a martial spirit into the national consciousness, the army has dragged the people away from the brink of destruction. For our comrades lost along the way, this victory is for you."

 YUN_first_amongst_equals: "First Amongst Equals"
 YUN_first_amongst_equals_desc: "Without our great leaders, there would be no new China. [ROOT.GetLeader] has displayed time and time again the sheer excellence of their leadership and command both in politics and the field. Practically the saviour of the country, a cult of personality has begun to develop around the martial prowess of [ROOT.GetLeader]. It wouldn't hurt to further such a cult, a true \"First Amongst Equals\" on the likes of Cai E."

 YUN_an_era_of_national_struggle: "An Era of National Struggle"
 YUN_an_era_of_national_struggle_desc: "With the Warlord Era having depleted China's international standing, China's people have suffered further. The glimpse of light following the Xinhai revolution, was ultimately snuffed out following Yuan Shikai's machinations, and the collapse of the Northern Expedition. If the people are to truly exert their willpower in this era of National Struggle, an army comprised purely of the people is necessary."

 YUN_preserving_ones_forces: "Preserving One's Forces"
 YUN_preserving_ones_forces_desc: "Fighting a superior enemy with little equipment and manpower, our tactics must revolve around eluding enemy armies, and preserving our own. Focusing on agile, mobile units that strike multiple armies and lines, we can then slip away into the hinterlands of China, before any opposing force can retaliate. Whilst considered to be \"Guerilla Warfare\", such tactics are merely an extrapolation of the tactics deployed by Kunming."

 YUN_engulfing_the_enemy: "Engulfing the Enemy"
 YUN_engulfing_the_enemy_desc: "\"If China is military confronted by another country in the near future, it would be better for it to adopt the Boer tactic... China should primarily take a delaying resistance and retrograde defensive strategy to preserve its own forces while luring the enemy in deep. When the enemy is exhausted and does not have enough force to support itself, China can wipe it out with one strike.\" - Cai E"

 YUN_resolute_in_ideals: "Resolute in Ideals"
 YUN_resolute_in_ideals_desc: "Our men in our army are our most important aspect, for without them, the very core of the army would not exist. However, the ideal soldier should be foolhardy, concrete, and resolute in their social, economic and political ideas. Instilling these virtues into our soldiers will grant them boundless confidence in our military strategies, and our ability to apply them."

 YUN_officers_prerogative: "Officers' Prerogative"
 YUN_officers_prerogative_desc: "As exhibited by the independent units of the National Revolutionary Army — those whom originate from Whampoa at least — the delegation of local autonomy to the commanders of these units has proven remarkably successful in the past. By emphasising lower level officer initiative and independence, whilst maintaining a methodical approach to careful preparation and planning of operations, our military objectives are sure to be achieved."

 YUN_extensive_reconnaissance: "Extensive Reconnaissance"
 YUN_extensive_reconnaissance_desc: "Critical to triumphing over a superior enemy is waging the war of intelligence. By performing proper reconnaissance on enemy units before engagement, we are sure to be able to identify their weakpoints, and strike where it will hurt them most. However we are not merely limited to scouting detachments and binoculars, for the incensed local populace can also be utilised, providing intel on warlord forces."

 YUN_fighting_in_our_favour: "Fighting in Our Favour"
 YUN_fighting_in_our_favour_desc: "The National Revolutionary Army has long learnt the harsh lessons imposed on it following the collapse of the Northern Expedition. The tactics of Whampoa were not enough to outfight the German military behemoth, and the National Revolution suffered for it. Ultimately, we must utilise all necessary levers in a battle to pitch them in our favour, and by entrapping enemy columns in our land, we are sure to surround and annihilate them."

 YUN_committed_in_ideology: "Committed in Ideology"
 YUN_committed_in_ideology_desc: "Commitment to the party, to the ideology of the Three Principles, utmost dedication to the National Revolution, these are all attributes that our soldiers should be the most premier examples of. By instituting mass meetings explaining the political and military situation, we shall provide a sense of purpose for our soldiers, hopefully increasing their motivation in battle, allowing them to see the mission to its conclusion."

 YUN_renewed_officer_examinations: "Renewed Officer Examinations"
 YUN_renewed_officer_examinations_desc: "By instituting a series of exams and tests for our officer corps, our generals shall assess them on their knowledge of regulations, orders, and the modern mobile tactics of the army. Simultaneously, they must display skills in both drill and field operations. Alongside that, their personalities and proclivities will also be assessed, alongside their squad management skills, leadership in battle, and their abilities to teach, or train."

 YUN_the_endpoint_of_chinese_armies: "The Endpoint of Chinese Armies"
 YUN_the_endpoint_of_chinese_armies_desc: "Ultimately, our army structure is nothing revolutionary, despite the nomenclature. Our way of waging war is merely the continued innovations of Chinese armies following the implementation of the New Army reforms of the late Qing. From Qing, to Beiyang, to Party State, to now, our army has proven the most effective as it contains the concise capacity to implement its ideals without fear."

 YUN_extolling_political_objectives: "Extolling Political Objectives"
 YUN_extolling_political_objectives_desc: "In his service from the National Protection Wars, Zhu De has discerned the integral importance of keeping a clear focus on the overall political objectives of a war, even if they conflicted with immediate military imperatives. Cai E withheld his full strength on the eve of war, in order to rally the cause of National Protection to the provinces of Guangxi, and Sichuan. Similarly, we must prioritise the masses, before military successes."

 YUN_concentration_of_popular_will: "Concentration of Popular Will"
 YUN_concentration_of_popular_will_desc: "An important and often overlooked aspect of military success in the Warlord Era is that of winning the support of the civilian populace. For the average Chinese soldier is seen as nothing more than a legalised bandit. However if we display that our army is a people's army, here to liberate them from the clutches of warlords, they are sure to support both our administration and our soldiers."

 YUN_frontlines_everywhere: "Frontlines Everywhere"
 YUN_frontlines_everywhere_desc: "As argued by He Yingqin, Chinese forces must \"make occupied areas part of the battlefield\" through the organisation of guerilla units and attacks, thereby \"turning the rear areas into the front lines\". If any enemy is to step foot onto Chinese territory, they will not only face our military forces, but the full wrath of the Chinese people themselves."

 YUN_improving_our_soldiery: "Improving Our Soldiery"
 YUN_improving_our_soldiery_desc: "The composition insofar of our army is comprised majority of peasants, followed by National Revolutionary veterans, then workers, and finally bandits. Such a military, whilst true in our image as a people's army, ultimately yields itself to a mixed force of varying skill levels. If we are to truly transform ourselves into a national army, we must work to standardise drills and training methods."

 YUN_installing_discipline: "Installing Discipline"
 YUN_installing_discipline_desc: "Born as an army comprised of the people, it is no surprise that in tense and chaotic situations, our soldiers lose their composure and exact petty revenge upon gentry and landlord alike. Despite their personal convictions, the National Revolutionary Army should be an army for the people, no matter their status in life. By instituting strict disciplinary measures, our men should learn to stow their hatred."

 YUN_strategic_defensive_tactical_offensive: "Strategic Defensive Tactical Offensive"
 YUN_strategic_defensive_tactical_offensive_desc: "Evidenced by the genius of von Schlieffen within the First Weltkrieg, and with Zhu De's own studies of the former's military theory, staying on the defensive whilst going on the offensive at operational and tactical levels is sure to win victory no matter the situation. Achieving the annihilation of enemy forces through encirclements, our army will triumph over imperialist or warlord alike."

 YUN_qualities_of_a_leader: "Qualities of a Leader"
 YUN_qualities_of_a_leader_desc: "Truly, the virtues of our army are emboldened and reflected by the virtues of its leadership. Ultimately, what the army desires is an aim-conscious leader, with an iron character, and an obstinate will for victory. Nothing exemplifies this more than the leadership of the National Revolutionary Army, continuously struggling for China's salvation. With suave leadership, our troops will clearly understand the issues at stake."

 YUN_lower_level_autonomy: "Lower Level Autonomy"
 YUN_lower_level_autonomy_desc: "Exhibited by the National Revolutionary Army, and by the German Army's Auftragstaktik, or Mission-type tactics, our army's theorist desire the delegation of lower level tactical concerns towards various subordinates. By defining a clear overall objective, timeframe, alongside the forces necessary for completion, the generals shall leave the officers to decipher the best way to achieve said goal."

 YUN_maintaining_flexibility: "Maintaining Flexibility"
 YUN_maintaining_flexibility_desc: "The contingent nature of war is well appreciate by our military theorists, all too familiar that tacticians and strategists alike should be familiar that the battlefield situation can radically change, and so set rules are impossible in commanding troops. Battlefield decisions should depend on the specific task at hand, the enemy's situation, and the terrain. As all of these can often change, one must be capable of being flexible with their planning."

 YUN_a_hundred_regiments: "A Hundred Regiments"
 YUN_a_hundred_regiments_desc: "All we need is 100 regiments. With 100 regiments, 200,000 men strong, we can engage any foe and devastate them. The might of the National Revolutionary Army has far ascended that of the Northern Expedition, and should any foe face it now, be it Japanese, German or otherwise, they will fear the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth. Not buckling under the cruelty of this world, our soldiers continue to push forward, continue to scream out, and continue to fight."

 YUN_reorganising_the_airforce: "Reorganising the Air force"
 YUN_reorganising_the_airforce_desc: "Originally established as the Aviation Department in 1922, the Yunnan Aviation School is one of the earliest aviation schools in the whole of China. Attached to Kunming Military Academy, it would be reorganised into the Yunnan Air Force in 1924. With the funding now available to revitalise the institution, it is time for a second reorganisation of the air force, the appointment of new air captains, and the drafting of a new aviation team."

 YUN_renovating_wujiaba_airport: "Renovating Wujiaba Airport"
 YUN_renovating_wujiaba_airport_desc: "Wujiaba Airport, constructed under the auspices of Tang Jiyao in 1923, is one of the first airports on the mainland Asian continent. Built in a strategic location not too far from Kunming, it is the third largest airport in China, second only to the Beijing Nanyuan Airport and the Hangzhou Xianqiao Airport. However it has entered a state of disrepair, and is in dire need of both attention and funding to be brought back to its full potential."

 YUN_mass_proliferation_of_airfields: "Mass Proliferation of Airfields"
 YUN_mass_proliferation_of_airfields_desc: "Whilst Wujiaba provides its service amicably and with great capacity, Yunnan's topography is mountainous and ragged. If we are to truly reach every dark crevice of the province, and beyond into neighbouring provinces, it would be wise to engage in a wide campaign of mass airfield proliferation. By mandating that counties are to complete the construction of an airport within a time limit, albeit with no monetary compensation, we are sure to establish concrete air control."

 YUN_equalisation_of_pilots: "Equalisation of Pilots"
 YUN_equalisation_of_pilots_desc: "In the first class of students at Wujiaba, Tang Jiyao specifically selected two girls from wealthy families in Yunnan to enrol in the school, in an attempt to encourage students to apply, and to set a precedent for Chinese women to study aviation. However Xia Wenhua and Yin Yuejuan were not the only successful female pilots to graduate, for the third batch of graduates had 9 women in it. We must once again allow female pilots to fly, for the eventual equalisation of gender."

 YUN_powering_on_liangguang: "Powering on Liangguang"
 YUN_powering_on_liangguang_desc: "With our seizure of the twin provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong, we have found ourselves upon a cornucopia of wealth and industry, merely waiting to be resuscitated. With arsenals such as the Guangxi and Guangdong arsenals, we are sure to revolutionise not only our civilian industry, but our military industry too. With the funding of Liangguang, our Yunnan Army shall no longer be wedged in by lack of armaments, or pay."

 YUN_foreign_naval_experts: "Foreign Naval Experts"
 YUN_foreign_naval_experts_desc: "Realistically, having been an inherently landlocked province, it is an undeniable reality that our naval staff is particularly lacking. With spare funding provided by our new geopolitical situation, it would be prudent to seek out exiled, or unemployed seafarers from the Legations, to train our own naval staff in the art of naval warfare."

 YUN_securing_a_merchant_marine: "Securing a Merchant Marine"
 YUN_securing_a_merchant_marine_desc: "Without seafaring access, the Yunnan Provincial Government has traditionally relied upon land transport lines through Guangxi, Guizhou and Indochina in order for our exports to reach international markets. However with the seizure of a coastline, we can now work towards the establishment and purchase of a flotilla of ships, capable of traversing the seas in order to export and import goods from international markets."

 YUN_the_lightning_school: "The Lightning School"
 YUN_the_lightning_school_desc: "With a long tradition in the navy, owing to the ancient Cantonese naval tradition, Admiral Ouyang Ge has sought the establishment of his own naval academy within Guangdong, known as the \"Lightning School\". Ostensibly an independent naval academy, in actuality it is an extension of Kunming Military Academy, acting as the army's own foray into the political world of Chinese naval cliques. Nonetheless, it is the breathing of new life into China's naval history."

 YUN_a_new_class_of_wujiaba_cadres: "A New Class of Wujiaba Cadres"
 YUN_a_new_class_of_wujiaba_cadres_desc: "With the renovation of Wujiaba airport, and the establishment of further airfields all throughout our territory, it is time to once more welcome a new generation of Wujiaba cadets into the training course. Tutored by old and new cadres alike, this new generation will perhaps see the most live combat out of any, and must be capable of rising to the challenge. For in the endurance of hardship, lies the basis for reform."

 YUN_securing_modern_equipment: "Securing Modern Equipment"
 YUN_securing_modern_equipment_desc: "Having had to rely on the, quite frankly, paltry arms and ammunition it could acquire from foreign sources and the Kunming Arsenal, the Yunnan Army has been in a dire need for guns for as long as it has been a military force. With the seizure of Canton however, the prime real estate and industries within the Pearl of the Southwest, capable of supporting the militaristic Old Guangxi cliques, is more than enough to sustain the Yunnan Army."

 YUN_integrating_beiyangs_legacy: "Integrating Beiyang's Legacy"
 YUN_integrating_beiyangs_legacy_desc: "Having long been experts of sailing the high seas, and recently without employment, the Beiyang admiralty has forever remained an amicable accompaniment of sailors compared to most of their Beiyang counterparts. Apolitical, or even harbouring sympathies for our cause, we can utilise contacts and connections with these old sea dogs, and use these men for their know-how and skills, ultimately benefiting the nation."

 YUN_defending_chinas_coastline: "Defending China's Coastline"
 YUN_defending_chinas_coastline_desc: "Long and contiguous, the Chinese coastline is the perfect set piece for any potential invasion from the sea. A constant issue in all applications of our defensive stratagems, some of the admiralty and army staff have advised the government to restructure and consolidate the current coastal defences, whilst also allocating funding to coastal defence ships. With these efforts, it is hoped that our coastline will become an impenetrable fortress."

 YUN_circumnavigating_the_blockade: "Circumnavigating the Blockade"
 YUN_circumnavigating_the_blockade_desc: "For all of its expansiveness, Chinese geography is ultimately a cage, penned in by the Japanese and Germans. With their holdings in South East Asia, and off of our immediate coastline, it is impossible for any trade goods to pass without their knowledge. Instead of simply lying down and accepting our fate however, it is crucial that we develop strategies and ships capable of evading enemy patrols, in order to circumnavigating any blockade."

 YUN_a_central_aviation_academy: "A Central Aviation Academy"
 YUN_a_central_aviation_academy_desc: "With the consolidation of the majority of China, Yunnan's trendsetting in the space of Chinese aviation is allowed to fully flourish. Despite notable attempts from prior regimes such as the Zhili, Fengtian or the Kuomintang, China has never truly exhibited a true Central Aviation Academy for the air force. With renewed efforts however, and the consolidation of previous attempts, our forces shall all fly under the newly christened CCAA."

 YUN_constructing_aircraft_plants: "Constructing Aircraft Plants"
 YUN_constructing_aircraft_plants_desc: "Despite ambitions to build an air force of our own, the Chinese aircraft industry is critically lacking for our needs. For a truly independent airforce, we cannot rely on foreign suppliers to meet our needs. With plans to construct an aircraft plant at Dongshan, and to expand the plant at Shaoguan, our aviation staff have further drawn up plans to establish a plant deeper within Guangxi."

 YUN_adopting_armoured_assaults: "Adopting Armoured Assaults"
 YUN_adopting_armoured_assaults_desc: "In the era of modern warfare, two things triumph above the mere mortality of mankind. The aircraft, and the tank. Roaring metal behemoths strike fear into any opposing soldier, and contain the firepower alongside mobility to perform encirclements of unbelievable swathes of frontline. If China is to truly survive amongst the great powers, it is imperative that it has its own armoured force."

 YUN_the_nation_under_siege: "The Nation Under Siege"
 YUN_the_nation_under_siege_desc: "The long awaited judgement hour has arrived. Despite our tenure, our civilisation of centuries, of millennia fears complete and utter destruction at the hands of the Japanese imperialists. No one is safe, be it woman or child. We all know this to be true, and with the impending doom approaching, the Chinese people must put away our squabbles, and unite in the face of adversity!"

 YUN_acquiring_expertise: "Acquiring Expertise"
 YUN_acquiring_expertise_desc: "Despite previous acquisitions of foreign expertise, it has proven not enough for our needs. Old, and outdated, the seafarers of the legations are not fit for the state of modern naval warfare. With ambitions far beyond China, it is time to engage in diplomacy with foreign powers, and negotiate advisory missions to build up our own military strength."

 YUN_incentivising_airfleet_production: "Incentivising Airfleet Production"
 YUN_incentivising_airfleet_production_desc: "Overall, our lack in the number of planes flying over our skies and airfields has proven itself to be drastically insufficient in order to protect the Chinese airspace. Once more, with even more gravitas and effort, and a focus on streamlining aircraft production, our air fleet shall see a rapid expansion of its capabilities, to rival even that of the Germans."

 YUN_a_nascent_marine_corps: "A Nascent Marine Corps"
 YUN_a_nascent_marine_corps_desc: "Long a tradition in the Chinese Navy, for almost as long as the Republic itself, the Marine Corps of the Republic of China has existed since 1914, where it was drafted from the decaying Navy Sentry Corps, and transformed into a force capable of traversing naval landings and rivers. Providing ample support to the institution in our quest for a navy, our ships shall be supported by our army."

 YUN_a_fleet_in_six_years_desc: "An ambitious plan far exceeding our own expectations, the naval staff have drafted an governmental finance plan in order to propagate a fleet of 600,000 tons in 6 years. Granted the full go ahead by the government, hundreds of ships and dockyards are to be constructed, in order for the target to be met. Perhaps once more, the Chinese fleet shall reach as far as the Americas."

 YUN_a_naval_guerilla_war: "A Naval Guerilla War"
 YUN_a_naval_guerilla_war_desc: "With modern naval advancements extolling better, bigger, and faster ships, one can forget the silent advancement of submarine warfare. Transforming from tin-cans that are more likely to kill their passengers in an engagement with a larger vessel, submarines now dominate in their role at performing a sort of \"naval guerilla war\". It would be wise to invest in such capabilities, to strangle our enemies."

 YUN_combined_air_land_offensives: "Combined Air-Land Offensives"
 YUN_combined_air_land_offensives_desc: "Under the auspices of local land warfare, nothing is more capable of turning the tide than that of air support. Able to annihilate enemy fortifications, armour, and units alike, close air support planes have proven themselves repeatedly. With all future Chinese military engagements, our infantry will no longer move without the air force guiding them along the way, lighting up a path with bombing runs."

 YUN_wartime_service_corps: "Wartime Service Corps"
 YUN_wartime_service_corps_desc: "With the dire circumstances upon us, there has been the proposal of the construction of a \"Wartime Service Corps\", which would feature the conscription of men and women alike to serve in minor staff roles, behind frontlines, in order to alleviate more soldiers to serve at the front. Perhaps unpopular, or even out right hated, most across the nation know full and well of their duty. For if they fail, the whole of China will be lost."

 YUN_scorched_earth_policies: "Scorched Earth Policies"
 YUN_scorched_earth_policies_desc: "As the enemy marches into the great encompassing Chinese landmass, their supply lines grow increasingly thin, tenuous, and desperate. Emboldened by our continuous retreats into the interior, it is expected that we must be able to give up whatever they may potentially prey upon in order to achieve total victory. Seeking to utilise anything and everything in the countryside before the invaders can, we will then follow through with a relentless guerilla assault."

 YUN_nation_building_through_turmoil: "Nation Building Through Turmoil"
 YUN_nation_building_through_turmoil_desc: "Ultimately, the bloodshed and turmoil of the invasion has led to a renewed sense of Chinese nationalism and brotherhood. Through the fire and flames of shared brutality, our countrymen, no longer their ideological tendencies, share in each other a common foe, and a common love for the Chinese nation-state. Brothers and sisters alike, we all partake in the common struggle, a common nation built through turmoil."

 YUN_revival_of_chinas_naval_prowess_desc: "Many of the more navally inclined powers would scoff at such a phrase as \"China's Naval Prowess\", and yet the Chinese nation once dominated all of Asia as a whole. Our ships had influence in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and even more. The Chinese navy may have befallen a period of stress, and weakness, but it is China's destiny to exert itself across the world, and that is only enabled by a strong fleet."

 YUN_overseeing_the_seas_desc: "In a combined effort between the aviation and navy wings of the military, they have devised joint technical designs for China's own deployment of naval bomber capabilities. To be launched from airports or carriers in order to support our navy, the integration of the third avenue of warfare is sure to result in complete domination on the naval field."

 YUN_unified_air_doctrine_cohesion: "Unified Air Doctrine Cohesion"
 YUN_unified_air_doctrine_cohesion_desc: "As bright and shining as ever, our air force has exhibited resounding success, yet many observers of pilot test flights have critiqued the disarray in doctrine practised by individual units. A spectre from previous attempts at regional Chinese air forces. Ultimately, if we are to eradicate such a ghost, it would be prudent to centralise our air doctrine into a coherent unified one, understood and implemented by all endeavouring pilots."

 YUN_from_above_and_below: "From Above and Below"
 YUN_from_above_and_below_desc: "Whilst our air force is increasingly capable of defending the Chinese population from terror and strategic bombing, there are times, rare as they might be, where a bomber could slip through and wreak havoc on villages and industry alike. In these times, it is up to our soldiers, to man newly founded anti-air installations, and shoot down the intruders upon our airspace. From above and below, may all those who intrude fear retribution."

 YUN_the_jingguojun_of_the_air: "The Jingguojun of the Air"
 YUN_the_jingguojun_of_the_air_desc: "Just like Tang Jiyao's \"National Pacification Army\", or Jingguojun, the new Chinese air force has sought the pacification of the Chinese airspace. With exceptional ace pilots, and training, our radical pilots and daredevils seek to defy the odds, or die trying. Whilst the nation is unified under a broader Chinese nation-state, the remnants of Yunnan's military traditions have infiltrated all facets of military life."

 YUN_the_king_of_the_southwest: "The King of the Southwest"
 YUN_the_king_of_the_southwest_desc: "Tang Jiyao may have fancied himself as the \"King of the Southwest\" at the height of his power in 1919, but the ensuing decade saw his rule challenged by rivals in other provinces and at home. Once positioned to seize control over the southern government in 1925, by 1936 he can hardly exert influence over the Kuomintang infested western Guizhou. But Tang could not have survived this long without cunning, and as the new year approaches he concocts new schemes."

 YUN_harness_the_yunnan_army: "Harness the Might of the Yunnan Army"
 YUN_harness_the_yunnan_army_desc: "The Yunnan Army has a proud history, the stalwart vanguards of southwestern China against European imperialism and defenders of Chinese republicanism against monarchist restorationists and socialist revolutionaries. It provided order amid the chaos of the 1910s, but suffered humiliating defeats in the 1920s. No more. The proud heirs of Cai E and Kunming Military Academy must rise to the occasion once again!"

 YUN_revive_the_national_revolutionary_spirit: "Awaken the National Revolutionary Spirit"
 YUN_revive_the_national_revolutionary_spirit_desc: "The National Revolutionary Army was founded in 1925 by Dr. Sun Yat-sen himself, a force loyal to the party and the people rather than warlords and tyrants. Though defeated in the Northern Expedition and forced into an ignominious exile in Guizhou, the brave soldiers that remain have not yet forgotten their revolutionary mission. And they will do their duty until the bitter end!"

 YUN_the_federalist_revival: "The Federalist Revival"
 YUN_the_federalist_revival_desc: "He has done it again! The Master of the Eastern Continent has once again secured his power within Yunnan! The Federalist Champion, undefeatable, unsurmountable! It is crucial to reassure the Provincial Assembly that the Governor has reaffirmed his commitments. Down with despotism! Down with Beiyang! Down with militarism! Up with People's Government! Up with Provincial Autonomy!"

 YUN_leveraging_our_assets: "Leveraging Our Assets"
 YUN_leveraging_our_assets_desc: "Naturally, having ruled Yunnan for over three decades, Tang Jiyao and his cohort have acquired quite a wide breadth of assets within the province. Mines, factories, banks, money and power practically flow through the hands of the King of Yunnan's court. It is crucial that these funds be used to build up the People's Government Party, and prepare the generals for righteous war."

 YUN_buddhist_revivalism: "Buddhist Revivalism"
 YUN_buddhist_revivalism_desc: "A devout Buddhist, Tang Jiyao has found much commonality with his fellow People's Government Party founder Zhang Taiyan. Flirting with the Buddhsit revivalist movement, it is time that the Governor go all in. Inviting Xu Yun, a famous Buddhist Monk, into government, he shall serve the role of a spiritual advisor, as we improve the lives of the Yunnan people through Foshi, the Buddhist rite."

 YUN_joint_committee_of_the_gentry: "Joint Committee on the Gentry"
 YUN_joint_committee_of_the_gentry_desc: "The Gentry see to it that they ally with far more malleable warlords, such as Hu Ruoyu or Long Yun, but that's their own folly. Through Zhang Taiyan's Joint Committee of the Gentry, the Gentry will have no choice but to bend, or be rended, to Tang Jiyao's will. All must facilitate the Federalist future, and the end of the old order."

 YUN_elevating_the_poor_masses: "Elevating the Poor Masses"
 YUN_elevating_the_poor_masses_desc: "Noble as it may be, the Kuomintang are but vile vermin intent on abusing the masses. Soliciting their earnest support, they yearn for, they prod the masses, and then with the whirlwind of rage they have constructed, direct it at their enemies. However, Yunnan cannot be socialist; it is too poor without foreign aid. The masses instead should focus on freedom as their vice."

 YUN_completing_ma_congs_reforms: "Completing Ma Cong's Reforms"
 YUN_completing_ma_congs_reforms_desc: "Stalwart and capable, Ma Cong is one of the People Government Party's most astute members. Originally a civilian of Tang Jiyao's warlord Clique, his transition into domestic politics saw him as a principal negotiator at the Yiliang Conference for Tang, and as minister of Finance in 1928. Aiming to eliminate corruption, he was obstructed by warlords. With Tang's full support, let us annihilate this threat."

 YUN_the_southwestern_university: "The Southwestern University"
 YUN_the_southwestern_university_desc: "With the League's brutal crackdown in 1932 enacted by Qi Xieyuan, and the general decrease in free speech and democratic progress in the coastal areas, vast swathes of prestigious intellectuals fled into the interior. Circulating around Yunnan, the \"Crescent Moon Society\" is based on the intellectual foundations of Tsinghua and Beijing University graduates, and they are very willing propagate their ideas."

 YUN_order_in_guizhou: "Order in Guizhou"
 YUN_order_in_guizhou_desc: "Whilst naturally unpopular, the Liu family within Guizhou has connections stretching far and wide. Perhaps diminished in respect and prestige, that is nothing compared to official support from Governor Tang. Of course, the Governor has a long history with Guizhou, and is generally regarded as a butcher, or tyrant. But really, what choice does he have? Tang Jiyu?"

 YUN_a_new_national_protection_war: "A New National Protection War"
 YUN_a_new_national_protection_war_desc: "Having long campaigned against over zealous militarisation (whilst maintaining an inflated army nonetheless), it would appear the time is ripe. The last bid for Canton in 1925 ending in nigh failure, but ultimately the Yunnan Clique was unprepared that time. With a decade on his back, it is time to claim Yunnan's rightful place as the King of the Southwest."

 YUN_aid_our_federalist_allies: "Aid Our Federalist Allies"
 YUN_aid_our_federalist_allies_desc: "Ever since the general collapse of the Federalist movement from its height in the mid 1920s, Yunnan has experienced a relative air of isolation. Sure, there is Governor Zhao, but apparent disagreements over the rightful situation within Guizhou has led to much dismay. But nonetheless, Federalism cannot survive on its own, and Yunnan needs allies if it is to survive."

 YUN_hold_the_guangzhou_conference: "Hold the Guangzhou Conference"
 YUN_hold_the_guangzhou_conference_desc: "Miraculously, or perhaps, even as ordained, the Yunnan Federalist have finally managed to fulfill the goal of over a decade ago. Our first gambit nearly cost us our lives, but our second proved fortuitous! With the southern political seat of power finally within our hands, it is inevitable that we must declare to the nation the revival of the Federalist movement!"

 YUN_a_new_order_in_beijing: "A New Order in Beijing"
 YUN_a_new_order_in_beijing_desc: "And so the heroes of National Protection have done it. Without the constraints of the war two decades ago, without the reservations of its political leaders. A new, formal, political order has been established within the nation. One of Federalism and Democracy, not dilly-dallying and autocracy. The first to set forward this new order is none other than Tang Jiyao, and he is keen to grease the wheels of his new city."

 YUN_control_wartime_commodities: "Control Wartime Commodities"
 YUN_control_wartime_commodities_desc: "Frivolity and individualism has henceforth wrought vast defficiencies in valuable resources for the nation's war efforts, and beyond. Materiel, food, clothing, all manners of equipment are necessary for the nation's soldiers and its people, and yet hoarding has run amok. Through the proliferation of government supported organisations, private factories shall be ensured the necessary materials for their production of goods."

 YUN_revise_the_tax_system: "Revise the Tax System"
 YUN_revise_the_tax_system_desc: "Two things are for certain in life, death and taxes. Whilst this perhaps did not hold for many of the people in China's highly irregular flow state during the Warlord Era, it nonetheless has witnessed both extremes. High rates of mortality, and extensive taxes on miscellany and absurdities. Through a thorough revision of the taxation system, progressive taxation can be adopted, providing the government with necessary funding to substantiate itself."

 YUN_chinas_new_industrial_revolution: "China's New Industrial Revolution"
 YUN_chinas_new_industrial_revolution_desc: "All around China are situated many enemies who would see to it that it remains in ruin, that much of the country remains an easily exploitable backwater, disunited and fractured. But China's patriots, its people, its rulers and its esteemed enlightened few have developed the anathema to her enemies. Industrialisation, encompassing both light and heavy industry, will be all that the nation needs to secure its national defence forevermore."

 YUN_protect_the_landowners: "Protect The Landowners"
 YUN_protect_the_landowners_desc: "We seek not to deprive the people of their property, the gentry of their rights, to shuttle them onto their untimely demise as the result of masses of the dissatisfied. That is unruly, and above all else abhorrent. We seek not violence, but change, and as such private property must be held up in principle. Disputes in territory must be arbitrated fairly, and landowners assured of their importance to the state."

 YUN_encourage_resource_extraction: "Encourage Resource Extraction"
 YUN_encourage_resource_extraction_desc: "China is a nation full of bountiful resources, from ores, to crops, to workers, to culture, the nation of thousands of centuries undoubtedly possesses enough resources to see itself dominant on the world stage. But, as it currently stands, much of its bountiful beauty is misutlised by miscreants and capitalists intent on making a buck at her expense. Resources that can be used in public interest should be owned by the public servants."

 YUN_finding_a_third_way_in_china: "Finding a Third Way in China"
 YUN_finding_a_third_way_in_china_desc: "Between revolutionaries and warlords, those who are proponents of reformism have found themselves sidelined and sandwiched between vocal demagogues who seek radicalism as the solution to the nation's woes. But it is the Third Way, that of the Moderates, that of moderate opinions based on calculated evidence, expressing themselves with moderate words only, that shall save the day, and the nation."

 YUN_rejuvenating_liberal_conservatism: "Rejuvenating Liberal-Conservatism"
 YUN_rejuvenating_liberal_conservatism_desc: "The demand for democracy, for that of human rights, for that of a national constitution, the rule of law, the freedom of thought, that of speech, the right to protest against authoritarianism, militarism, and all sorts, these are all but analienable rights for the people. It is that thereof which the Liberal-Conservatives of the Moderate Crescent Moon Society promise, and it is that thereof Tang will deliver upon."

 YUN_rule_of_the_outstanding: "Rule of the Outstanding"
 YUN_rule_of_the_outstanding_desc: "The nation cannot fall to the diatribes of unenlightened fools who believe in their own facetious self-worth. This is not a game of cards, it cannot be ruled by ideology, but instead by modern science and intellectual expertise. Through administrative competence and government by experts, the nation should be ruled by that of the most outstanding group of people, experts on political science selected through examination and elections."

 YUN_the_last_stand_against_tyranny: "The Last Stand Against Tyranny"
 YUN_the_last_stand_against_tyranny_desc: "Perhaps Beiyang's greatest folly was the failure of the Republic's own administration, legislators, and jurors to deny or prevent increasing autocracy and the complete abuse of the law; constitutions were but hashed out quickly to ensure political successes. Checks and balances, it is checks and balances between government branches, and the central government in comparison to provinces, that can avoid unwieldy tyranny in the chief office."

 YUN_strengthen_presidential_powers: "Strengthen Presidential Powers"
 YUN_strengthen_presidential_powers_desc: "The warlords believe in their own folly, that the Central Government was all but guaranteed to kowtow to their needs. But it is the needs of the people, not that of the Governors, that must be seen to. And it is a great mistake to further litigate legal warlordism through a Confederation. China has grown past the need for provincialism, and it is time for a wise executive, of decisive action, to cut through the quagmire of provincial politics."

 YUN_elevating_the_nations_thinkers: "Elevating the Nation's Thinkers"
 YUN_elevating_the_nations_thinkers_desc: "Rule of the enlightened, or rule of the elite few? Parties of the masses would see to it that the tyranny and evil of the masses overpower that of those best suited towards governance. Democracy must be cultivated, not thrust unto people ill-prepared to utilise it. And so it is under this rule that the nation's brightest and most well-equipped must be elevated, shouldering the burden of the nation's future."

 YUN_integrate_the_beiyang_bureaucracy: "Integrate the Beiyang Bureaucracy"
 YUN_integrate_the_beiyang_bureaucracy_desc: "Idealists and utopians would cast aside the whole \"rotten\" structure of the Beiyang Government, as corrupt, as full of mailaise, of unredeemable individuals in their new world order. Yet they would be met with the consequences of their actions; an inefficient system, lacking utterly in skilled personnel. Bureaucracy is a disease, that is true, but applied correctly it can propagate grand state machines. We must but only try."

 YUN_the_fight_against_imperialism: "The Fight Against Imperialism"
 YUN_the_fight_against_imperialism_desc: "The most vile evil extracted upon the nation is that of the great onset of imperialistic endeavours within China. For it has bore witness to foreign powers carving it up senselessly into zones of influence and control. Even now, embroiled in war undoubtedly, they look towards the Middle Kingdom with hunger in their eyes, and malcontent for its people. It is not war between individuals, but that of nation states, and only the strong survive."

 YUN_promises_of_constitutional_rule: "Promises of Constitutional Rule"
 YUN_promises_of_constitutional_rule_desc: "It may seem but an empty slogan, propagated by warlords and lesser men, but our assurances are genuine, and our actions shall vindicate the new Federal government. This is not the rule of tyranny, or of a party state, but of servants of the people. Relinquishing their lives to the service of solidarity and the people's representation, to upholding laws, to upholding good morality!"

 YUN_groundwork_for_a_confederation: "Groundwork for a Confederation"
 YUN_groundwork_for_a_confederation_desc: "Zhang Taiyan, one of the key architects of Federalism, proposed to that of which the form Chinese Federalism should take: a confederation. And alas, many would indicate that such a stance is in opposition to his desire to eliminate warlordism, but in essence it is the very support base by which warlordism can be prevented. If appeased with a confederation, they will merely not notice the curtailing of their power, and eventual removal."

 YUN_affirm_governor_loyalty: "Affirm Governor Loyalty"
 YUN_affirm_governor_loyalty_desc: "Of course, loyalty has its own rewards. It is loyalty that guarantees trust, and it is loyalty that build genuine strength amongst compatriots. As much as it is true in the military, or in daily life, loyalty serves its purpose in statecraft all the same. Not necessarily does it have to take the form of corruption either, as those who are loyal may remain. Those who are disloyal will but merely have their flames extinguished."

 YUN_first_among_equals: "First Among Equals"
 YUN_first_among_equals_desc: "The Province that spawned it all, the province that has safeguarded the merits of republicanism since 1911, and the republic that has championed undiluted Federalism for decades. It is Yunnan, the First Among Equals, that has shown the strengths of the provincial unit. Perfectly sized, the province is neither too big nor too small, and individually has the potential to unite the nation. Together, collective provincial might will overcome imperialism."

 YUN_unity_through_national_essence: "Unity Through National Essence"
 YUN_unity_through_national_essence_desc: "You can hardly impose your will upon others, and much similarly one cannot impose central government authority upon that of provincial rights and attitudes. As if cultivating a plant, you must take great care, and be gentle, for any overt action and it wilts away. United by common culture, buddhist identity, and a common national essence, the backbiters of regionalism will be restrained by that of patriotic pride."

 YUN_healing_the_north_south_rift: "Healing the North-South Rift"
 YUN_healing_the_north_south_rift_desc: "For as long as it has been certain, there has been a simmering cultural and political divide between the nation's south and north. Apathetic to authoritarianism, and predisposed to invasion, the North has long since upheld both the traditional seat of power, and that of political arrangements. The South, beset with militaristic tendencies and revolutionary idealogues, has spurned great change and transition. The solution? The proper deliberation of powers."

 YUN_for_a_new_china_for_a_new_economy: "For a New China, For a New Economy"
 YUN_for_a_new_china_for_a_new_economy_desc: "With the seizure of Beijing, the state has had to undergo a perhaps ill-timed and radical transition as various facilities, departments, companies and other aspects of the economy were put under direct state control. With the lessening of restrictions, it is crucial that wartime controls and monopolies be abolished, and the economy reconverted back to fulfilling the needs of the people, not of the military."

 YUN_emerging_from_the_ashes: "Emerging From the Ashes"
 YUN_emerging_from_the_ashes_desc: "Individual and collective group action is not necessarily enough as it would seem to subdue the woes of the people. In various recently conquered areas and even at home, they languish and suffer under infrastructure devastation, and the collapse of monetary value. Only through direct government aid to those wanting to renew their lives, and to the Chinese yuan, can the nation truly arise from its sorry state."

 YUN_promoting_economic_security: "Promoting Economic Security"
 YUN_promoting_economic_security_desc: "It is one of the most important values of any free economy in the modern era that the principle of economic democracy is upheld. Under such a principle, adequate livelihood and economic securty must be ensured, and so too shall the equalisation of wealth and the further closing of the gap between the rich and the poor. The people yearn for a better life, and it is the responsibility of the government to facilitate such."

 YUN_revolution_of_the_middle_classes: "Revolution of the Middle Classes"
 YUN_revolution_of_the_middle_classes_desc: "Naturally, this is not a revolution of the masses, or of the elites, but of the middle classes. That of the producers, of the entrepreneurs, of the bounding capitalists taking risk and initiative in their endeavours. And so too should production between increased, under adequate planning from both private and national firms. It is the expectation that they hold to this proposal, and the government is obliged to assist however it can."

 YUN_sanction_safe_progress: "Sanction Safe Progress"
 YUN_sanction_safe_progress_desc: "The whirlwind of progress has never been further propelled than it has by that of the masses' fury. For it is their very yearning for a better life that has thrust upon the Chinese nation, and elsewhere, that of revolution. Unmitigated oppression can only lead to the explosive counter-attack of revolutionaries, but if you are smart in statecraft, you can alleviate such ills. Safeguarding and guaranteeing the rights of peasants and workers is but the first step to emancipation."

 YUN_federalist_fortress_in_the_southwest: "Federalist Fortress in the Southwest"
 YUN_federalist_fortress_in_the_southwest_desc: "With the return of Federalism as a formidable force in the wake of the Zhili Collapse, there have been many considerations as to the role Yunnan should play in the emancipation of the Centralist system. In its true essence, Yunnan has long been a fortress of defiance. One against tyrants, against autocrats, against monarchists, and against revolutionaries. And so it is only natural that it become a fortress of Federalism; its true safeguard."

 YUN_support_the_southern_government: "Support the Southern Government"
 YUN_support_the_southern_government_desc: "Playing second fiddle is hardly the place of the Yunnanese, but make no mistake, if the Southwestern Federalist government falls, Yunnan itself will be so terribly alone. We know too well the value of good allies in the Chinese battlefields, and so it is imperative that the provincial government muster all that it can to assist our allies. Troops, men, materiel, all must be put forward to our shared goal."

 YUN_press_for_unification: "Press for Unification"
 YUN_press_for_unification_desc: "It would appear that our ever gracious allies have deemed it fit to kick their feet around, hardly pursuing the course of unification in a genuine or timely manner. This, simply, cannot stand. The world will not wait around for the Chinese people to unite and for the nation to compose itself, and the longer we wait, the stronger our national and international adversaries become. We must press our allies to press forward with a grand offensive."

 YUN_last_holdout_of_federalism: "Last Holdout of Federalism"
 YUN_last_holdout_of_federalism_desc: "And so it would seem that history has repeated itself for the third time in the Warlord Era. Yunnan, standing on its own bare feet, must face off against an onslaught of opponents, rallying the banner of freedom, liberty, and democracy. And if history is correct, then it will be Yunnan that will undoubtedly persevere and emerge victorious. We must put forward all of our strength, all of our might, to preserve all that which we hold dear. Wansui!"

 YUN_rein_in_the_defence_commissioners: "Rein in the Defence Commissioners"
 YUN_rein_in_the_defence_commissioners_desc: "Backed into a corner, Tang Jiyao had been forced into enabling vast amounts of Yunnan to effectively sport their own regional kingpins in the form of the Defence Commissioners. Evenly split north, west, and south of Kunming in Zhaotong, Dali, and Mengzi, the Defence Commissioners have been able to exert undue influence on Yunnan Clique policy ever since the tumultuous 1920s. They must be brought to kneel before the king."

 YUN_self_government_training: "Self Government Training"
 YUN_self_government_training_desc: "Very few existing bureaucrats and magistrates are thoroughly educated enough on the political stance on Federalism, or that of the way of local self-government. By sending cadres to the College of Law and Politics, or even abroad to places such as Japan, the government can train the old officials on the proclivities of their status, and a generation of new officials, with the general hope that they will be able to sufficiently empower local assemblies."

 YUN_second_southwestern_conference: "Second Southwestern Conference"
 YUN_second_southwestern_conference_desc: "Ostensibly it is Yunnan's allies who lead the charge of the national Federalist movement, but in the grand reality of the Federalist project, it is the Yunnan that will steward the Southwestern provinces into a cohesive and unified front. This is our destiny, and hardly anyone could oppose us. Calling forth delegates representing all aspects of the Southwest, we shall lay out the role Yunnan is to play in National Federalism."

 YUN_the_yunnan_monroe_doctrine: "The Yunnan Monroe Doctrine"
 YUN_the_yunnan_monroe_doctrine_desc: "Yunnan itself has fought, bled, and sacrificed in order to bear the flag of Chinese Republicanism and Federalism ever since its unsteady embark unto provincial governance in the Xinhai Revolution. But with allies on most fronts, it need not bear that standard alone anymore. Yunnan's own \"Monroe Doctrine\", akin to that of Hunan, shall allow it to focus on local reform and development, whilst allowing our allies to do most of the fighting."

 YUN_implement_social_reforms: "Implement Social Reforms"
 YUN_implement_social_reforms_desc: "With peace secured outside the provinces, Yunnan now has the bandwith to pursue a modicum of necessary reforms as the military takes a backseat. Various antiquities remain within Yunnanese cultural society, such as a despotic penal system, or ludicrous marriage, burial, and gift-giving customs. Whilst we truly do not desire to tell the people what they should and should not do, we can at least prevent the most harmful excesses of these habits."

 YUN_spreading_popular_education: "Spreading Popular Education"
 YUN_spreading_popular_education_desc: "It is not enough to merely construct the grand Southwestern University, or to host a whole splendor of Chinese intellectuals. Across all levels, Yunnan must be enlightened. Through the spread of popular education, the construction of primary schools, vocational schools, night schools, teacher-training schools, and promulgation of lecture societies, Yunnan will become a utopia in the Southwest."

 YUN_true_peoples_government: "True People's Government"
 YUN_true_peoples_government_desc: "What the people fail to see is that democracy and Federalism cannot merely be ushered in by local initiative alone, for that is paramount to declaring one's province superior to that of the nation. Nay, it is \"True\" People's Government by which Yunnan will serve as a model for all provinces; economic development, education, and the reformation of administration. But no popular election of the governor, not until national unification."

 YUN_reform_the_militia_system: "Reform the Militia System"
 YUN_reform_the_militia_system_desc: "The Baojia militia system, and all other similar systems, were devised to serve as local guardsmen, or garrisons, of their respective communities. However, in-effect they have become nothing more than mere pawns of the local magistrates or gentry, aiding in the perception of their tyrannical rule over the peasantry. By consolidating and managing the militia through a central office, they will all become accountable to the governor, at least, indirectly."

 YUN_consolidate_the_southwest: "Consolidate the Southwest"
 YUN_consolidate_the_southwest_desc: "Under the auspices of local self-governance, it is ostensibly in poor taste to annex, or otherwise control a neighbouring province via military intervention or otherwise. As is the heart of Federalism, provinces must be ruled by their fellow provincials. However, the Guizhou experiment has shown that tying provinces together can yield considerable benefits, if applied correctly. Let us export the Dian-Qian model to the whole Southwest!"

 YUN_reconcile_with_the_socialists: "Reconcile with the Socialists"
 YUN_reconcile_with_the_socialists_desc: "It is nigh disgusting how the \"auspicious\" Governor Tang Jiyao treated Yunnan's local workers movement. Fearing populism, distrustful of perceived \"radicalism\", he all but co-opted or otherwise decimated any form of legitimate worker representation amongst the intelligentsia and factories. Our Socialist brethren are not our enemies, for they aspire for the same goal as all Chinese, we must but merely curry their favour with amnesty."

 YUN_root_out_the_socialists: "Root Out the Socialists"
 YUN_root_out_the_socialists_desc: "It has become evidently clear that vanquishing the Kuomintang was not enough to prevent Yunnan from following to the tyranny of demagogues and the masses. Preaching their poison in underground cells, various revolutionary groups remain active within Yunnan, not especially those led by Wang Fusheng or Li Xin. Socialist revolution has no place within China, it is simply too agrarian and poor for its means. If they cannot see sense, then they will see the sword."

 YUN_seize_federalist_leadership: "Seize Federalist Leadership"
 YUN_seize_federalist_leadership_desc: "It would appear that not all ties are made to last, and most certainly not all allies. Unfortunately, Yunnan is rather used to having to fulfill its duty and service alone, and by its own hands. With the dashing of the previous torchbearer of the Federalist movement, it is only within the due line of succession that Yunnan, and Yunnan alone, sit atop the throne of the United Provinces."

 YUN_refuge_for_intellectuals: "Refuge for Intellectuals"
 YUN_refuge_for_intellectuals_desc: "With the Crescent Moon Society and the Southwestern University establishing their roots within Yunnan, the province has somewhat turned into a cornucopia of intellectualism and development within the Chinese nation. Of course, it is only prudent that the provincial government sponsor, fund, and cultivate these ambitious modern Scholar-Officials, for their benefit, and our own."

 YUN_patriotic_labour_unions: "Patriotic Labour Unions"
 YUN_patriotic_labour_unions_desc: "Unions are a special, and in notion, glorious, form of representing those who form the bedrock of industrial society. It is only natural that they retain their influence and serve their role within China's industrial revolution. But they cannot be political. That sullies their potential, poisons the well of the worker's revival. No, they must be apolitical, fueled not by domineering politicians, but by pure patriotism."

 YUN_addressing_the_currency_crisis: "Addressing the Currency Crisis"
 YUN_addressing_the_currency_crisis_desc: "Naturally, civil war, national unification, and an all-out struggle against foreign imperialists is not particularly the ripe grounds for economic development or fostering business ties. Worse still, Yunnan itself has been in the wild throes of an influx of various currencies. German marks, Fudian bank notes, and even some lingering Yuan Shikai and Pre-Xinhai bills. By cultivating the Fudian Bank however, a solution might be found in its expansion."

 YUN_gathering_capital_and_labour: "Gathering Capital and Labour"
 YUN_gathering_capital_and_labour_desc: "Perhaps as a consequence of the Provincial Administration's rather heavy-handed approach to the labour movement, it has been utterly bereft of Chinese workers to finance its ambitious development projects. Modernisation of transportation, agriculture, mining, and light industry necessitates manpower. With workers from Vietnam and Hong Kong, alongside a worker housing scheme for native Chinese immigrants, Yunnan will develop to rival that of even Shanghai."

 YUN_promoting_mass_education: "Promoting Mass Education"
 YUN_promoting_mass_education_desc: "With the development of local education facilities, a sort of intra-factional clique has developed within Yunnan. The so-called \"Beijing Group\" has been linked to rising radicalism within the student base, but their ferocity has carried over to educational endeavours too. Organising the Yunnan Student Organisation, it has seen the development of a comprehensive adult education programme emphasising patriotism, democracy, and opposition to antiquity."

 YUN_push_for_economic_revival: "Push for Economic Revival"
 YUN_push_for_economic_revival_desc: "Utterly damaged by nigh-perpetual warfare since Xinhai, and banditry before that, the Chinese economy is foreign dominated, fractured, and particularly lacking in various provinces. But in order to move mountains, the Chinese must be able to assert true economic prosperity and independence. If the people and politicians do not see the true imperative of economic reconstruction, then we must but merely enlighten them."

 YUN_freedoms_final_call_desc: "The witching hour is upon us! Those traitorous cutthroats, our once auspicious allies, they seek to betray their very own ideals! To sunder it for their own grandeur and folly! This cannot stand! The martyrs of Federalism did not fight for a strong, free, and fair democracy to see it sunk by aspiring autocrats and their milieu of faceless bureaucrats. Yunnan's destiny is to be the vanguard against tyranny, and so it must be that we pick up arms and advance against our foes!"

 YUN_a_patriots_war: "A Patriot's War"
 YUN_a_patriots_war_desc: "There is no true Chinese patriot that can merely sit on the sidelines and abide as the nation falls into the cataclysmic void of despotism and authoritarianism once again! This war is a people's war against a system that has spiralled out of their control. It's a war against the very forces of entropy. It's a war for the future of not just the current generation, but every generation thereafter. And it is the duy of every Chinese to fight for their freedom."

 YUN_exploiting_divided_loyalties_desc: "The traitor's own backlines and headquarters are not truly united, this much is evident in their campaigns conducted before and after their betrayal. If we but merely consolidate our own forces, and curry favour with those considering defection, or those perceiving the same injustices with their own very eyes, the traitor's ranks will break, and their resolve will be all but hollow."

 YUN_leadership_of_the_best_and_brightest_desc: "It is the Kunming Academy that has produced some of the nation's most fantastic and brilliant generals, officers, and commanders. Staffed by an even greater body of military educators, it is the very pride of the nation, inspiring duty, honour, service, and patriotism within its alumni. Without a doubt, the Yunnan Clique is stronger for it, and so it is the Yunnan Clique's officers that will bring forward steady victory."

 YUN_the_lessons_of_fire_and_blood_desc: "Chinese history has been bathed in bloodshed, civil war, and destruction for centuries. Our revolt is but one in a long-line of defiant stands against national tyranny and despotism. But it will not be a failure. In recent history, in Xinhai and the war for National Protection, Yunnan was the trendsetter on securing victory, and it is only natural that these past victories propel us further."

 YUN_sustaining_the_republics_flame_desc: "Aspiring for democracy, freedom, and Federalism are noble goals. It is the true Utopian idealism of the Chinese masses that they too, like their compatriots in the West and elsewhere, can assert the popular mandate of election and recall. It is the very roaring flame that bore witness to the flourish of the Chinese republican revolutionaries, and it is this very flame that we have protected, and ultimately, set ablaze."

 YUN_no_sacrifice_no_victory_desc: "You cannot secure victory without some form of sacrifice. The martyrs of revolution and reform have vindicated their struggle with loss of life, and it is through this fight against tyranny that the Chinese people must again muster their willpower, vanquish the autocrats, and ensure lasting peace within the Republic. No matter the cost, China must be united, and it must be a democracy."

 YUN_the_fight_for_human_rights_desc: "It is only under the continued campaign for one's own indomnitable human rights that a Free and Democratic political system can emerge;this has long been the core of the Crescent Moon Society's platform. A state cannot focus itself upon the granting of citizens rights whilst ignoring that of intrinsic human rights. Democracies all around the globe put citizen's rights first, but it will be the Crescent Moon that takes the step towards the primacy of human rights."

 YUN_cultivating_liberal_nationalism: "Cultivating \"Liberal\" Nationalism"
 YUN_cultivating_liberal_nationalism_desc: "Many posit that the antidote to foreign imperialism is to pursue a total mobilisation of the people, to direct cultural and military throughput against Tokyo, Moscow, or Berlin. And they would be at least half-right. But it is nationalism, the forsaken adoration and pride in one's country, their history, and their culture, that will fight imperialism. Internationalism can wait, at least until all of China is ruled by the Chinese."

 YUN_promoting_positive_thinking: "Promoting Positive Thinking"
 YUN_promoting_positive_thinking_desc: "Xu Zhimo first posited that the Warlord Era had caused \"all standards of value\" to be upset by the confusion and chaos. A deterioration in benign human deceny. The loss of such \"positive thinking\" resulted in non-conscious and unconscious thoughts to enter into conscious activities. But the situation is not untenable: it is the duty of the intellectuals to continue Confucian-esque moral and intellectual cultivation; or suffice to say, politics by experts."

 YUN_health_and_dignity: "Health and Dignity"
 YUN_health_and_dignity_desc: "Social services, healthcare, welfare, and all sorts of charitable endeavours to maintain the wellbeing of Chinese citizens has largely been left up in the air due to lack of national unity in the Warlord Era. Christian missionaries, the Red Cross, and Warlord philanthropy served largely to replace a central healthcare system. But as is emblematic in the literary ideals of the Crescent Moon, the government must work to restore \"health\" and \"dignity\" to the populace."

 YUN_leadership_of_the_talented_minority: "Leadership of the Talented Minority"
 YUN_leadership_of_the_talented_minority_desc: "The Jinshi and all other Scholar-Officials had once stewarded the Qing unto enlightened progress. Following examples set by Confucius or Mencius, they commanded the confidence of the court and that of society to be the experts of the Chinese government. Therefore it is only natural that their modern-day descendants, the intellectuals and experts, carry on their burden, staffing the central bureaucracy."

 YUN_ending_the_political_chaos: "Ending the Political Chaos"
 YUN_ending_the_political_chaos_desc: "Naturally the intense political chaos within China has largely been caused by two resoundingly evil forces: the militarists controlling the government and politics, and the incentivised taking of spoils by warlords, bandits, or corrupt bureaucrats. To be the anathema of such evil forces, it is necessary to both restrain the army, and flush out the bureaucracy. Squabbling politicians yield no good fortunes, and it is the government's duty to keep them in check."

 YUN_third_way_economics: "Third Way Economics"
 YUN_third_way_economics_desc: "China is largely an agrarian society, the peasants labour under their gentry landlords whilst few scant urban centres such as Tianjin or Shanghai shore up large portions of the urban productivity sector. To transform China it is imperative that a state-controlled economy is put in place. The state is an instrument of national development, and so both free markets and class struggle must be rejected in the name of state development."

 YUN_the_peaceful_road_to_socialism_desc: "As China itself is so deprived of material and economic prosperity, it is all too common-place for the destitute and the angry to look towards historical materialist views and that of the class struggle in order to achieve prosperity. But it is not economic inequality but that of political inequality which is the true wellspring of woe. To cultivate the end goal of Chinese socialism, one must induct it through the democratic process."

 YUN_spartan_education_methods_desc: "As espoused by Cun Shusheng time and time again, Chinese society, and especially its schools and universities, must be but all self-sufficient if they are to survive in harsh reality. Indebted with thousands of years of tradition and culture, students must learn to be strict, to be diligent, to be pragmatic, and open to new ideas whilst maintaining a concise and concerted core tenents that they live by."

The torch of Cun Shusheng and Su Honggang, two admirable educators, shall set forth a bright era of enlightenment upon the whole country. No longer shall any descendant of the Yellow Emperor be a submissive citizen, nor shall they be a willing slave to any foreign master."

 YUN_economic_stewardship: "Economic Stewardship"
 YUN_economic_stewardship_desc: "Black Monday and annual recessions have set the clear example that Central Governments can hardly sit idly by and merely watch chaos erupt within agricultural and industrial sectors during economic hardship. China moreso demands an active hand in economic affairs; seeking peaceful resolutions to land disputes, relief of peasant suffering whilst protecting interests of landowners, free enterprise, all manner of stable economics must be managed by state hands."

 YUN_mandatory_public_education: "Mandatory Public Education"
 YUN_mandatory_public_education_desc: "In 1902, the Guangxu Emperor issued an edict closing all traditional schools like the Kunming Academy, and reorganising them based upon moderl principles. Two normal schools were founded, one for boys and another for girls, alongside that of the School of Mines, and the School of Law and Politics. By the 1920s, there were 10 modern schools with 2000 students. Education has been at the core of Yunnanese life, and it is imperative it become a core of Chinese life too."

 YUN_scholarly_civil_service: "Scholarly Civil Service"
 YUN_scholarly_civil_service_desc: "Truly the most admirable civil service system in the world has to be that of the United States. Setting the example, the development of the system from George Washington onward is nothing short of marvelous. In their unselfish service, both Washington and Jefferson cleaned up corruption, and ensured that the civil service remained loyal to the nation, not to any politial party. And it is to this example that China must emulate."

 YUN_modernising_china: "Modernising China"
 YUN_modernising_china_desc: "To be a truly strong nation, capable of its own independent action, China must be modern. And to be a modern state, it must be based upon the foundations of agriculture, commerce, and industry. Those three titans of which all western nations have been made wealthy and strong upon. It takes but a few confident Chinese merchants to one day forge a great commercial circle that will compete with their western counterparts."

 YUN_zhang_taiyans_federation_desc: "Whilst not necessarily as extreme as he would've wanted, Zhang Taiyan's banner still soars high in the Capital. The spiritual father of the nation, his successors must work in order to build a balanced government that still remains feasible. Not confederation, but as autonomous as possible; provinces have power, perhaps even a national guard, but the Central Government must still retain its say."

 YUN_peace_with_the_democrats_desc: "Fears loom large that the People's Government Party merely seeks to install dictatorship, or a dominant party akin to those front organisations such as the Harmony Association or Recovery League, but that could be no further than the truth. Extending an olive branch, the PGP must calm tensions with not only the China Democratic League and the independent democrats, but also that of the Young China Party."

 YUN_grand_republican_statesman: "Grand Republican Statesman"
 YUN_grand_republican_statesman_desc: "Whilst perhaps the underdog candidate of the Federalist cause, Tang Xiaoying carries with him a lot of merit. Educated, young, and presented a \"modern\" take on the People's Government Party's platform, it could be said that he is emblematic of the new generation of Chinese politician. More connected with the broader Grand Republican Alliance and with the China Democratic League, he is a moderate, liberal, and unifying force on the political scene."

 YUN_fair_competition_in_the_middle_kingdom_desc: "The revolutionaries curry favour with the masses through their promotion of Georgist-styled land reform efforts, that of Land to the Tiller, of bequething upon them the land that they work. Whilst depriving the gentry of their dominance, it also comparitively deprives them of any influence at all. There must be a sense of balance, and harmony, in agrarian matters, of benevolent landlords overseeing diligent workers."

 YUN_arbiter_between_the_provinces: "Arbiter Between the Provinces"
 YUN_arbiter_between_the_provinces_desc: "There is no greater statesman in the whole of the modern Chinese politial era than that of Tang Jiyao. A son of revolutionary fire, and of intense patriotism, he has not only brought forward true freedom for the Chinese people, but that of true democracy. A central, binding, and neutral figure, a truly enlightened individual capable of balancing the interests of every Chinese individual. A true First Amongst Equals."

Marching under the banner of people's government, people's democracy, and people's federalism, they have ensured both the prosperity of the Chinese republic, and the continued dominance of the Yunnanese in Chinese affairs. They were the saviours of the nation, the endeavouring soldiers that fought against autocracy, and they have done so yet again."

 YUN_demobilising_the_army_desc: "It is of the utmost importance in the new Chinese federation that warlordism and its ilk be curtailed nigh indefinitely. There can never be another Warlord Era, and whilst extending autonomy to provinces, it must be assured that militarists do not gain power in such a scenario. As such, the national army must be reduced to just 200,000 men, enough for independent action whilst protecting national integrity."

 YUN_preserving_chinese_culture: "Preserving Chinese Culture"
 YUN_preserving_chinese_culture_desc: "Chinese civilisation has seen itself much downtrodden in recent years. A Century of Humiliation, decades of infighting and strife, a failing political system and a failing society. Much has been done to damage our thousands of years old culture, but no more! Chinese culture must be preserved, it must be handled delicately and allowed to thrive. Intertwined with Chinese Buddhism as a binding factor, neither socialist nor imperialist shall further our humiliation."

 YUN_the_liangist_ideal_desc: "Although auspicious, and of course deserving of respect, Zhang Taiyan's concept of Federalism would see grand sweeping autonomy granted to provinces that can hardly stomach being attached to Beijing. In the most maximum form of idealism, he would seek to rely upon \"Good Men\" to serve dutifully, but Tang Jiyao knows all too well the fate of \"Good Men\". A strong state, a strong government, that is the only thing capable of balancing the nation."

 YUN_mastering_beiyang_politics: "Mastering Beiyang Politics"
 YUN_mastering_beiyang_politics_desc: "There is much to be said about the state of affairs of Beiyang Politics, but if one thing is for certain, in order to prowl in the Tiger's den, you need allies. And all too aspiring to look towards a central unifying figure, the Young China Party, amongst other interest groups, have opened themselves to overtures from Tang. Together, the nation will be strong, resilient, and will no longer be the plaything of other great powers."

 YUN_cai_es_champion: "Cai E's Champion"
 YUN_cai_es_champion_desc: "There is no greater man with such a resounding impact upon Tang Jiyao's life than Cai E. It was Cai E, who mentored Tang in statesmanship. It was Cai E, who relied upon and placed his trust within Tang Jiyao. And it was Cai E, who defended the nation in its darkest hour. Perhaps if he had not died early, it would've been Cai E in this very position. An apolitical First Amongst Equals, he stood against political parties. Tang can only hope he is proud."

Whilst ostensibly assassination and tools similar are heinous crimes in the modern legal system, one respected by the party.

In a beehive, the bees know their place, and do not question orders - rather they merely follow the queen.

Wang and the Central Committee drifted towards socialism, while the forces loyal to Chiang combined with Hu Hanmin's supporters coalesced in opposition.

In Deng's name, Chen Cheng will fight for the people!"

 YUN_undoing_the_injustice_of_1924_desc: "One of the most disastrous and destructive actions that occurred in the wake of Dr. Sun's desperation to free himself from \"warlordism\" was that of the Reorganisation of the Party in 1924. For the very first time the inner factionalism of the Kuomintang embarked on a full display of its insanity. With a government of rational technocrats in control, it is time to build a modern China, free of militaristic fanatics."

 YUN_draft_a_permanent_constitution: "Draft a Permanent Constitution"
 YUN_draft_a_permanent_constitution_desc: "For too long the Kuomintang has ruled in this chaotic, incomprehensible and incongruent fashion of irrational decisions enacted with executive authority. In its wake a fierce dialectical debate has arisen between the merits of Dangguo and Tutelage, versus the enacting of a Chinese Constitution. Fortunately, Political Science benefits most strongly from the implementation of the latter."

 YUN_modernising_the_decrepit_dangguo: "Modernising the Decrepit Dangguo"
 YUN_modernising_the_decrepit_dangguo_desc: "The Party-State has become much reviled and detested by the general populace. Seen as a haughty gathering of militarists, intellectuals, and ideologues too concerned with bureaucracy and infighting to alleviate the qualms of the people. Under the stewardship of Political Science however, the rank and file are those technocratic planists engaged in the zeitgeist of modernisation. Let us bring such culture to the party."

 YUN_a_national_liberal_economy: "Rationalisation of National Capitalism"
 YUN_a_national_liberal_economy_desc: "Despite lofty ideals and admirable improvements in the living situation of the Chinese people under National Capitalism, ultimately such a development scheme necessitates modification. Through the implementation of a planned economy with state control in heavy industry, National Bourgeosie and the Party alike can see hallmark economic progress for the Chinese Nation together, as opposed to the Party alone."

 YUN_rule_through_agreement_not_through_the_sword: "Through Agreement, Not the Sword"
 YUN_rule_through_agreement_not_through_the_sword_desc: "What wrought the destruction of the Beiyang Republic, despite all the blood spilt and sacrifices made, was not the failure of its institutions, but the ambitions of autocratic military warlords more focused on personal development rather than national. The Party must ingrain that China is a nation ruled by Gentlemen and consensus, not that of despots and militarists."

 YUN_rule_of_national_experts_and_gentlemen: "Rule of National Experts and Gentlemen"
 YUN_rule_of_national_experts_and_gentlemen_desc: "Many of its detractors would decry the Political Science Clique simultaneously as both Party traitors who attempted to oust the Guofu and work with Beiyang, alongside a gathering of ivory tower elites who do not understand the plight of the worker. In light of this however, it has become evidently clear that the rule of the nation's industrial and intellectual elites is most fortuitous."

 YUN_ushering_a_new_era_under_the_genro: "Ushering a New Era Under the \"Genrō\""
 YUN_ushering_a_new_era_under_the_genro_desc: "Genrō, or \"Elder Statesmen\" is an informal term attributed to the senior officials and elites of the Japanese Empire in the early 20th century. Constructing one of Asia's first democracies, and its most modern state, the Genrō wielded immense influence in guiding the Japanese people with a steady hand for decades. Similarly, Political Science's rule has wrought its own flock of Genrō."

 YUN_to_save_yunnan_from_itself: "To Save Yunnan From Itself"
 YUN_to_save_yunnan_from_itself_desc: "The eternal folly of all rulers of Yunnan, Tang Jiyao most deservedly of all, is their presumption that with a large enough show of force, they will be able to control the Southwest through Export Militarism. But it is such Export Militarism upon which they fall upon their own blade. To save Yunnan from itself, and to protect its citizens, Mengzi and the Dragon have been forced to act."

 YUN_reorganising_the_yunnan_army: "Reorganising the Yunnan Army"
 YUN_reorganising_the_yunnan_army_desc: "With the decapitation of the hydra, there are still many within the Yunnan army that hold true loyalties to their once erstwhile Commander-in-Chief of many long years. In truth, we have never been a truly united force, and it is ever present that without a solid constituency of support within the army, you cannot rule Yunnan. Let us purge the last of Tang's incompetents."

 YUN_retreating_into_isolation: "Retreating Into Isolation"
 YUN_retreating_into_isolation_desc: "Having only saved Yunnan by the skin of its teeth, there is the impending threat of continued advances from our one-time opponents into more of Yunnan's controlled territory. In order to become an insurmountable fortress, and to truly abandon our predecessors' national ambitions, it is crucial that fortifications and garrisons become rebuffed with reinforcements."

 YUN_dealing_with_the_southern_bandits: "Dealing with the Southern Bandits"
 YUN_dealing_with_the_southern_bandits_desc: "In order to strengthen his position in provincial politics, Hu Ruoyu has preferred a relatively light hand in regards to the bandit issue, preferring to control them. Long Yun, for his preference, would rather see them exterminated. Due to the last gambit for Guangzhou, the bandit issue has grown in magnitude, joined by ex-Tang, and ex-KMT soldiers, and they must be crushed."

 YUN_salvaging_tangs_reforms: "Salvaging Tang's Reforms"
 YUN_salvaging_tangs_reforms_desc: "For all that you can say about Governor Tang, one thing is for certain: his capacity for pragmatic reformism and continued progress despite external and internal factors is a virtue to be thought highly of. Junmin Funzhi, the separation of military and political spheres, must be upheld, and meritocracy should be the deciding factor on government positions, not loyalty or family ties."

 YUN_eliminating_internal_dissidents: "Eliminating Internal Dissidents"
 YUN_eliminating_internal_dissidents_desc: "Due to seeming fragility in the government, or weakness under duress, there has been a steady increase and uptick in student radicalism, motivated by some political actors whom have found their home in Yunnan since 1932. No matter what stance we hold to outsiders, revolutionary, republican, what have you, dissidents at home must be extinguished."

 YUN_handling_external_affairs: "Handling External Affairs"
 YUN_handling_external_affairs_desc: "Military might and a constant sheltering isolation is simply not enough to keep most outsiders at bay. Whilst we obviously do not seek secession, it is true that we must maintain some ties, even if begrudgingly, with the outside warlords. If only in hopes that when the nation is united once again, Yunnan can play a pivotal role in its leadership."

 YUN_protecting_our_commerce: "Protecting Our Commerce"
 YUN_protecting_our_commerce_desc: "Rich in minerals and with an exports lifeline travelling towards Indochinese ports, Yunnan has long survived off of, amongst many things, the exportation of its natural resources. Under the auspices of the banking systems constructed by FuDian and Miao Yuntai's Chamber of Commerce, alongside Mengzi's control of the mines, Yunnan will undoubtedly prosper."

 YUN_expanding_our_universities: "Expanding Our Universities"
 YUN_expanding_our_universities_desc: "Amongst the curious eclectic circles of Long Yun's personal clique, there are many long-standing provincial statesmen who carry with them the expedience of education in foreign universities. Utilising the expertise of these men, such as Zhang Banghan, a stable bureaucratic apparatus shall be setup to being the creation of Donglu University, with hopes to expand in the future."

 YUN_claiming_the_southwest: "Claiming the Southwest"
 YUN_claiming_the_southwest_desc: "Whilst we may have abandoned notions of hoisting our flag atop the heights of Beijing, Yunnan nonetheless still has a crucial role to play as steadfast arbiter of Southwestern political dynamics. As Masters of the Eastern Continent, it is imperative that should the opportunity arise, the Yunnanese will administer, and seize, what it can of the Southwest."

 YUN_as_the_flowers_bloom: "As The Flowers Bloom"
 YUN_as_the_flowers_bloom_desc: "With the Begonias Blooming, and the nation somewhat more stable than before, Yunnan has certainly played a pivotal role in the national state of affairs. But with further war looming on the horizon, and a nation damaged economically, Yunnan has seen better days. Outpouring nationalism has hurt notions of isolation or regionalism, and there are rumours of further plots in Kunming..."

 YUN_internal_affairs_reform_conference: "Internal Affairs Reform Conference"
 YUN_internal_affairs_reform_conference_desc: "As the nation, and Yunnan, undergoes significant turmoil, it has become necessary to strengthen the provincial bureaucracy, against further internal and external threats. By convening the Internal Affairs Reform Conference, we will confirm to much needed financial reform, renewed treasury management, and the further elimination of banditry and disorder."

 YUN_raise_the_banner_of_the_southwest: "Raise the Banner of the Southwest"
 YUN_raise_the_banner_of_the_southwest_desc: "As much as we may dismay, as much as we may shirk the duty, the nation's disorder has necessitated that we break Dian's isolation. For the rights of all Chinese in the Southwest to be so brazenly and consistently abused by those supposedly meant to be our allies is an infraction that is utterly intolerable. Like once before, we must set out on campaign."

 YUN_the_yunnan_uprising: "The Yunnan Uprising"
 YUN_the_yunnan_uprising_desc: "With the situation outside Yunnan becoming untenable, the time has arrived for Yunnan to stake its claim to national unification. Ejecting the outsiders and their armies, we must then march upon their capital, and liberate the nation. Whilst Cai E launched his National Protection War to defend the Constitution, we launch our own War for National Liberation."

 YUN_the_governments_undertaker: "The Government's Undertaker"
 YUN_the_governments_undertaker_desc: "In order to retain our administration's iron grip on the territory we've amassed, it has become increasingly necessary to respond with harsher, and stronger, shows of force. Hell hath no quarter, it is imperative that the government allocate funds for an increase in the resources of the Yunnan Public Safety Bureau, as the tides of unrest wash again Yunnan's walls."

 YUN_harmony_in_the_land_harmony_at_home: "Harmony in the Land, Harmony at Home"
 YUN_harmony_in_the_land_harmony_at_home_desc: "With the pseudo-revolutionary gestures and architecture of the government, many in the gentry have begun to fear the worse for our administration, despite the pretenses of their support being crucial for the provincial administration. Reminding the gentry of their key role within the government, we can rein in any further peasant unrest."

 YUN_the_unexpected_development: "The Unexpected Development"
 YUN_the_unexpected_development_desc: "Surprisingly, despite our notions of isolation and self-preservation, the opportunity has been presented to our administration to further reinforce our claim to the future unification of China. Whilst we are not necessarily complaining, and is necessary due to the circumstances, we can only hope it fairs better than that of the last attempt on the cusp of the NPA War."

 YUN_a_nation_of_valleys_and_caves: "A Nation of Valleys and Caves"
 YUN_a_nation_of_valleys_and_caves_desc: "With deep redoubts and caves usually full of bandits, the Chinese interior has become a location where ingenuity, not men or material, serve to lead towards success. Whilst air power is potentially the great equaliser, boots on the ground under commanders that understand the objectives of their mission, and how best to achieve them, are sure to achieve success."

 YUN_the_vigorous_notion_of_sacrifice: "The Vigorous Notion of Sacrifice"
 YUN_the_vigorous_notion_of_sacrifice_desc: "We are no strangers to the necessities of warfare, as many have given their lives to bear the burden of Yunnan's national unification ambitions. But we must glorify such prospects, the capacity inherent to the ability to \"Dare-to-Die\". If we are to save the Beiyang Republic from itself, and do what Cai E could not, then there can be no holding back."

 YUN_organisation_of_a_modern_army: "Organisation of a Modern Army"
 YUN_organisation_of_a_modern_army_desc: "A truly modern army is one that is oft impossible to maintain without the necessary budget allocations, especially in a region such as China. Tang Jiyao himself had nearly bankrupted the province numerous times over maintaining his hefty Jingguojun. But as the Dian Army acquires further material stockpiles, the opportunity has arisen for own elite divisions."

 YUN_kunming_as_a_safehaven: "Kunming as a Safehaven"
 YUN_kunming_as_a_safehaven_desc: "Kunming has become something of an intellectual cornucopia since the repression of Left-Wing and Liberal-Conservative Intellectuals in 1932. With many educators and writers gathering within the Southwestern interior, and working in institutions such as, what is now, the Southwest Associated University, or the Yunnan University. Let us cultivate these scholars, without their politics."

 YUN_revel_in_the_republican_tradition: "Revel in the Republican Tradition"
 YUN_revel_in_the_republican_tradition_desc: "The inherent glories of the Chinese Republican tradition extol the virtues of courage and bravery, with the intent to transform one's own nation for the betterment of their fellow citizens. And with an all-out civil war at the forefront, morale and propaganda may very well be the two pillars holding up our success. Let us sing the praises of our history of great revolt!"

 YUN_muster_our_fellow_comrades: "Muster Our Fellow Comrades"
 YUN_muster_our_fellow_comrades_desc: "There are many veterans of Yunnan's long history of ardent militarisation, both within and outside the provincial boundaries. With many growing dissatisfied with the affairs of the Central Government, let us rally our old soldiers, and reinvigorate our new men with the successes of our history. Together, the Jingguojun has the capacity to vanquish any foe."

 YUN_the_undefeatable_heroes: "The Undefeatable Heroes"
 YUN_the_undefeatable_heroes_desc: "We are perhaps at our last limits. Already our armies have begun to strain and buckle somewhat, however, we are the Masters of the East Continent. With the unbridled glories of some of the nation's most talented soldiers at the helm of our past victories, we can put forward one, last, final effort for victory. However, should we fail, the consequences will be disastrous."

 YUN_establish_the_economic_committee: "Establish the Economic Committee"
 YUN_establish_the_economic_committee_desc: "Whilst the Fudian Bank has served its purposes valiantly since its inception under Cai E, it has become clear that the need for a clear cut governmental economic committee dedicated towards the education and revival of Yunnan's financial affairs is ever increasing. Staffed by the likes of Li Peiyan and Miao Yuntai, let the government's committee work towards stability."

 YUN_junta_of_many_faces: "Junta of Many Faces"
 YUN_junta_of_many_faces_desc: "United more in their shared opposition to figures such as Long Yun, or Tang Jiyao, Hu Ruoyu's Mengzi Clique is truy multi-faceted and diverse in nature. With Zhang Ruji, Li Xuanting, and various gentry or otherwise outcast officials joining together under on umbrella, their governance is inherently that of a balancing act, and all eyes look towards Hu to see if he can keep order."

 YUN_the_yunnan_dragon: "The Yunnan Dragon"
 YUN_the_yunnan_dragon_desc: "So-called the Yunnan Dragon due to his dominance in the province's affairs both under Governor Tang and after his deposition, Long Yun's government represents an eccentric mix of reformists and old revolutionaries, overlayed ontop of a Han dominated bureaucracy, with a Yi dominated army. And yet, Long's capabilities result in the perfect blend of all these factors."

 YUN_a_renewed_land_survey: "A Renewed Land Survey"
 YUN_a_renewed_land_survey_desc: "Under the auspices of the economic committee, a policy plan has been proposed for the transition of the land tax to a cultivated land tax, and the institution of the General Suvery Bureau, with Lu Chongren as general manager. Whilst far from a radical, Lu's capability for effective and pragmatic reformism is sure to see reinvigorated revenue sources from the new land tax alone."

 YUN_the_rotunda_of_finance: "The Rotunda of Finance"
 YUN_the_rotunda_of_finance_desc: "Under the previous administrations, the provincial mint was directly under the control of the government, and not the Department of Finance. Resulting in inherent mismanagement and inefficiences, Lu Chongren has suggested the transfer of management to his finance department. Furthermore, he hopes to train a new generation of personnel, and create a new audit system."

 YUN_to_rebel_against_isolation: "To Rebel Against Isolation"
 YUN_to_rebel_against_isolation_desc: "It was a foolish concept to retreat further than we had before into only provincial matters. Such is the inherent role that Yunnan has to play in Chinese Unification, that it is necessary that we engage in offensive campaigns, not only defensive. Under the auspices of Lu Han, the government should be adventurous, not only within China, but Indochina too."

 YUN_guarantee_of_stability: "Guarantee of Stability"
 YUN_guarantee_of_stability_desc: "Perhaps the most key factor of Hu Ruoyu's governance is the inherent camouflage of this \"Victorious Chameleon\". Flexible on all fronts ideologically, Hu has floated working with the Kuomintang, Tang Jiyao, Wu Peifu, and many others in his long career, all as long as they backed him. Whilst some would see this as lacking backbone, for Hu, it is his greatest strength."

 YUN_security_as_a_provincial_affair: "Security as a Provincial Affair"
 YUN_security_as_a_provincial_affair_desc: "To ever maintain the paradigm within Yunnan, Long Yun has long deigned local security to be that of a provincial affair. No matter what national policy the Governor may support, or espouse, internal provincial policy should always be that of security and progress. Democracy on the outside, autocracy on the inside, whatever it takes to maintain the governorship."

 YUN_the_roots_of_a_democratic_fortress: "The Roots of a \"Democratic\" Fortress"
 YUN_the_roots_of_a_democratic_fortress_desc: "With an influx of Liberal-Conservative intellectuals within Yunnan, alongside its own native progressive movement, the province has long been in turmoil about the nature of democracy, and its applications within China. Under the auspices of the King of Yunnan, let various democratic organisations, such as the New Democratic League, flourish and prosper!"

 YUN_teaching_student_self_reliance: "Teaching Student Self-Reliance"
 YUN_teaching_student_self_reliance_desc: "In the dire circumstances that present China finds herself in, there have been many perceived solutions to the daring issue of student radicalism, or reliance upon the state's stability for their future. In order to defend the nation individuals such as Cun Shusheng have begun to advocate for self-reliant \"Spartan Education\". Let Yunnan heed his methods."

 YUN_the_southwestern_metropolis: "The Southwestern Metropolis"
 YUN_the_southwestern_metropolis_desc: "Having long been a key urban centre for Chinese influence and control in the Southwest, Kunming has become something of a mini-metropolis, at least in comparison to most Chinese cities. Specially cultivated by regionalist officials, the once mostly consular city has turned into that of one with its own bustling nightlife and culture, unspoiled by warfare."

 YUN_establishing_a_provincial_monopoly: "Establishing a Provincial Monopoly"
 YUN_establishing_a_provincial_monopoly_desc: "Under Lu Chongren's auspices, the government has begun to embark on the policy of \"using administration to support finance, finance to promote production, and production to enrich finance\". By expanding state-owned enterprises, strictly enforcing monopolisation and unifying markets, the Yunnan economy can be transformed into that of a self-sustaining chain."

 YUN_reorganise_the_fudian_bank: "Reorganise the Fudian Bank"
 YUN_reorganise_the_fudian_bank_desc: "Whilst the tendrils of Yunnan's financial clans have almost penetrated into all local state-owned enterprises, Fudian bank has proven itself incredibly useful and sustainable in all manners of economic reform. By further ingratiating it within the provincial government's administration, Yunnan will bring all major local banks under one state-owned umbrella."

 YUN_commerces_wartime_contribution: "Commerce's Wartime Contribution"
 YUN_commerces_wartime_contribution_desc: "The Yunnan Chamber of Commerce under Miao Yuntai has long been the lifeline of Yunnan provincial economics since the 1920s. And yet with a surplus of currency, they have not contributed nearly enough to Yunnan's wartime goals. By allocating a special fund for the acquisition of guns and ammunition, Yunnan will have the latest in international weaponry at its disposal."

 YUN_militarisation_to_save_the_nation: "Militarisation to Save the Nation"
 YUN_militarisation_to_save_the_nation_desc: "Only through force of arms may the Chinese liberate themselves from foreign impression and national disunity. In the game of evolution, only the strong survive, and similarly so only nations that can impose their will upon others will be guaranteed latent security. For every rifle constructed, a bullet is loaded, and with that the nation takes one step forward."

 YUN_maximise_tax_revenues: "Maximise Tax Revenues"
 YUN_maximise_tax_revenues_desc: "Through the levying of a special consumption tax, and a special business tax, alongside forcibly implementing the stamp tax, Yunnan should be able to garner millions more yuan from its citizens to re-introduce into state enterprises. Furthermore, by monopolising the sale and transportation of opium, the government can both curb its influence, and rake in immense profits."

 YUN_cai_es_dream_realised: "Cai E's Dream Realised"
 YUN_cai_es_dream_realised_desc: "As advocated by Cai E, the spiritual successor of the present Central Government, the President should be strong, resilient, taking no stances on issues unless the principle of the central government was at stake, whislt the legislative branch should not be able to command the President or cabinet. The incumbent President certainly makes no qualms in following such a doctrine."

 YUN_obligations_of_the_military: "Obligations of the Military"
 YUN_obligations_of_the_military_desc: "The natural role of the military-man in the nation's politics is that to be a prominent participant in its nation-state building project; they are obliged to defend the nation against all threats, and thus are entitled, or warranted, to intervene in the political sphere should the nation's interest be at risk. Whilst the politicians squabble, the military must remain vigilant."

 YUN_the_financial_regulation_committee: "The Financial Regulation Committee"
 YUN_the_financial_regulation_committee_desc: "As the nation has undergone untold amounts of political and military strife, it too has been levied with severe economic collapse in multiple sectors, alongside a highly irregular state financial network. Through the establishment of a new economic regulation committee, the state shall begin its economic revival through abolishing all previous economic irregularities."

 YUN_building_a_shared_nation_state: "Building a Shared Nation State"
 YUN_building_a_shared_nation_state_desc: "It is in Cai E's ideal of a state, of a shared nation-state, that every individual assumes their respective responsibility for the well-being of the nation-state, thus ensuring its survival. To consider undermining any of the political institutions of the republic, be it through abrogation of elections, or strongarming the branches of government, would thus erode national unity."

 YUN_restoring_harmony_to_the_countryside: "Restoring Harmony to the Countryside"
 YUN_restoring_harmony_to_the_countryside_desc: "Whilst the gentry may balk at the notion, you cannot rule a nation in perpetual fear or contention with that of the masses. As Dr. Sun provided, it is necessary, in some retrospect, to see to it that Land to the Tiller be implemented throughout the nation. However, the government should refrain from politicising the masses in this programme, lest revolutionary fervour take hold."

 YUN_all_under_the_king: "All Under the King"
 YUN_all_under_the_king_desc: "As is his right, both as a war hero and the head of state, every individual minister of his cabinet should be absolutely responsible to President Long Yun; the parliament should exist to vote on the President's agenda, not the other way around. Partisan strife has no place in the new Beiyang Republic, and if any parties do exist, they should be entirely constitutionally based."

 YUN_duel_of_twin_dragons: "Duel of Twin Dragons"
 YUN_duel_of_twin_dragons_desc: "With the sundering of all other opponents, it would appear that the ensuing tide of Dian Clique backstabbing has succumbed even that of Hu Ruoyu and Lu Han. The incumbent herald of the remnants of Tang Jiyao's nation-building project, and the ambitious adventurous stalwart, once attached to Long Yun. Facing off despite their mutual victory, it would appear that the nation's strife is not over yet."

 YUN_restraining_the_revolution: "Restraining the Revolution"
 YUN_restraining_the_revolution_desc: "Soldiers should not take part in political parties, if they allow themselves to be distracted and disturbed by external matters, then the task of leading armies will fall bit by bit to civilian weaklings. Similarly, if every party had military backing, then it will become an untrustworthy institution. In principle the revolution was good, but you cannot politicise the army's men."

 YUN_three_trainings_and_commandments: "Three Trainings and Commandments"
 YUN_three_trainings_and_commandments_desc: "With the unification of the nation, there has been a grand increase in the extra-judicial rights of various middle to high ranking officers, who have become something of a new warlord class in of themselves. In order to restore strict discipline and reduce corruption, we must instill the virtues of honesty, diligence, and selflessness, and fight against all injustices."

 YUN_from_flexibility_to_dynamicism: "From Flexibility to Dynamicism"
 YUN_from_flexibility_to_dynamicism_desc: "Lacking in concrete ideological beliefs could be viewed as an innate sense of personalism, or lack of a state-building plan, for Hu Ruoyu and Lu Han it is perhaps their greatest strength. Staying true to the ideal of apolitical and decisive strongmen willing to make pragmatic choices, they are able to inevitably prioritise what is best for the nation, be it liberal, or conservative."

 YUN_cultivate_the_national_youth: "Cultivate the National Youth"
 YUN_cultivate_the_national_youth_desc: "Originally a pet project of the local Dian warlords, the Yunnan Provincial Youth League Affairs Bureau is the perfect model to extrapolate and export nation-wide. For the future generations need guidance, and a wise hand to induct them into steering the future of China. Thus, it is necessary to cultivate their spirit through youth leagues and other organisations."

 YUN_chinas_melting_pot: "China As a Melting Pot"
 YUN_chinas_melting_pot_desc: "Having synthesised a minority Yi armed forces with a majority Han provincial bureaucracy, Long Yun is no stranger to integrating China's various minority cultures into one broader national whole. Similarly, he has sponsored a great expanse of operas, libraries, and museums. Staying true to his origins, President Long has sought to embrace a new multicultural identity for the new cosmopolitan China."

 YUN_adherence_to_the_new_literati: "Adherence to the New Literati"
 YUN_adherence_to_the_new_literati_desc: "In dynasties past, the scholars were once upheld as virtuous civil servants who steered China into a direction of harmonious progress. With the Xinhai Revolution however, a new form of prestigious literati has emerged: the intellectual class. Exposed to Western ideas, or otherwise attempting to synthesise them with Chinese tradition, let us once more heed these men."

 YUN_exporting_the_dian_economic_model: "Exporting the Dian Economic Model"
 YUN_exporting_the_dian_economic_model_desc: "As opposed to Eastern China, Western China had to adopt its own form of economic development: it could not rely on foreigners to build factories and teach the workers, as they had little investments in the interior. As such, a major bureaucratic state apparatus, central planning, and government intervention within key industries ruled the day, and it shall rule the nation too."

 YUN_on_the_issue_of_those_of_merit: "On the Issue of Those of Merit"
 YUN_on_the_issue_of_those_of_merit_desc: "With the recent unification of the nation, the various leading warlords and otherwise commanding members of the high command have continued to complain to the new President about the \"employment of men in public office in an improper fashion\", and \"not employing those of merit\". Whilst perhaps an overt attempt for patronage jobs, it is still necessary that their qualms be seen to."

 YUN_restoring_auspicious_governance: "Restoring Auspicious Governance"
 YUN_restoring_auspicious_governance_desc: "Whilst the Zhili core may have been decimated by the tide of history, their acolytes and layabouts remain within pockets of the country: the Assembly and Senate, even various informal provincial Guanxi networks remain in function. With a fitting career worthy of being the Marshal-President, let Hu Ruoyu emerge from the outskirts of the Zhili family tree, and into its core."

 YUN_revolutionary_constitutionalism: "Revolutionary Constitutionalism"
 YUN_revolutionary_constitutionalism_desc: "Ambivalent to the true revolutionary struggle of the Kuomintang, Lu Han nonetheless sees much merit in their ideals and practices. Reasoning with and understanding the plight of the common peasantry, and the desire for a strong, democratic, and nationalist state, Lu can call upon wise men such as Zhou Zhongyue to facilitate the re-admission of some revolutionaries into the mainstream."

 YUN_the_steeled_democracy: "The Steeled \"Democracy\""
 YUN_the_steeled_democracy_desc: "Close friends with many endearing democrats of all political stripes, Long Yun is at his heart a man born in the ostensibly democratic ideals of Xinhai. Whilst having ascended to the highest office at the helm of a military onslaught, President Long nonetheless prefers to rule by and through constitutionalist rule. Whilst democracy may not come soon, it can at least be an ideal to strive for."

 YUN_government_by_efficiency: "Government By Efficiency"
 YUN_government_by_efficiency_desc: "Democrats, demagogues, and idealogues suffer from the infallible nature of believing more in their ideological tenets than that of what is best for the nation. And it is only further admission of their faults and failures that President Long, pragmatic and erstwhile, ascended to the state office. Through the rules of efficiency and progress, China and its citizens will prosper."

 YUN_protecting_chinas_foundations: "Protecting China's Foundations"
 YUN_protecting_chinas_foundations_desc: "The Chinese nation-state is entirely beholden to its capacity to care for, control, and revitalise both its agricultural sector and the environment. Whilst the peasantry are actively seen to, it is necessary to maintain the fields they till too. Through regional conservation boards and land reclamation bureaus, China will never again suffer starvation."

 YUN_extending_a_hand_to_the_gentry: "Extending a Hand to the Gentry"
 YUN_extending_a_hand_to_the_gentry_desc: "Having been key backers of many individuals now close to the upper halls of the central government, the gentry have seen their position seemingly diminished in light of unification due to the nature of the peasant issue. However, it is still possible to strike a mutually beneficial deal. Protecting the gentry from instability, the government shall earn their compliance."

 YUN_the_great_commandant: "The Great Commandant"
 YUN_the_great_commandant_desc: "During his time in China, Hu Ruoyu drafted many books on modern military theory. Amongst them that of \"The Establishment of the Modern Army\", and \"The Commander of the Great Army\". Much akin to the example prescribed in the latter, Hu has managed to command the respect of the nation as its Great Commandant, not only from his backers, but the masses too."

 YUN_the_adventurous_turncoat: "The Adventurous Turncoat"
 YUN_the_adventurous_turncoat_desc: "Ever willing to burn bridges in the pursuit of self-glorification and endless ambition, Lu Han has finally ascended to perhaps the highest office possible within the nation. With many lost along the way, Lu's almost nigh reckless nature, and intensely opinionated outlook, has caused much instability within the delicate balance of the nation. Yet, eternally a new adventure awaits."

 YUN_introgame_minigame_decision_category_desc: "By March 1927, the last stragglers of the battered National Revolutionary Army completed their grueling \"Long March\" into western Guizhou, setting up camp in a province long contested between neighbouring warlords. With the Zhili advance losing steam as they moved east, they settled for installing Yuan Zuming as Governor in the East while leaving the rest of Guizhou at the mercy of the Yunnan Clique. Internal turmoil in Yunnan and the desire for a buffer region against Zhili hegemony prevented Governor Tang Jiyao bringing Western Guizhou back into his sphere over the past decade, but the limited truce between the §cKuomintang junta§! in Guizhou and §fthe Yunnan Clique§! is rapidly fading.\n\nThe standoff will likely only be resolved through force of arms, but moving troops to the border is no easy feat.\nThe §cGuizhou Kuomintang§! have [?YUN_introminigame_KMT_soldiers_var|c0] soldiers mobilised.\nThe §fYunnan Clique§! have [?YUN_introminigame_UPC_soldiers_var|f0] soldiers mobilised.\n\n§YAn overwhelming advantage of at least 10,000 more men than the other would be needed for either side to safely overcome their rival.§!\n[YUN_introgame_troop_advantage_loc]"
 YUN_introgame_troop_advantage_loc_KMT: "The §cGuizhou Kuomintang§! have [?YUN_introminigame_KMT_soldiers_difference_var|c0] more soldiers than the §fYunnan Clique§!"
 YUN_introgame_troop_advantage_loc_UPC: "The §fYunnan Clique§! have [?YUN_introminigame_UPC_soldiers_difference_var|f0] more soldiers than the §cGuizhou Kuomintang§!"
 YUN_introgame_troop_advantage_loc_balanced: "Neither the §fYunnan Clique§! nor the §cGuizhou Kuomintang§! have an advantage over the other."

 YUN_introgame_minigame_rigged_warning_tt: "§RA game rule has been set which has pre-determined the outcome of $YUN_introgame_minigame_decision_category$.§!"

 YUN_introminigame_war_preparation_mission_timer: "Initial War Preparations Are Completed"
 YUN_introminigame_war_preparation_mission_timer_desc: "Though Yunnan and Guizhou are neighbours, laying the groundwork for an invasion will take some time. Supply depots need to be created, battlemaps need to be drawn out, and freshly arrived troops need to be positioned. On both sides of the border, generals are war-gaming their next moves, hoping to gain a critical advantage. The buildup along the frontlines continues across planting season, and by summer commanders believe their armies will be primed for an invasion."

 YUN_troops_flood_to_the_border_monthly_timer: "Troops Flood to the Dian-Qian Border"
 YUN_troops_flood_to_the_border_monthly_timer_desc: "The amassing of units on the Yunnan-Guizhou border has caused a cycle of continued escalation as both sides deploy forces to the front. With any hope of a surprise attack lost by this point, both sides race to try and outdo the other - ironically reinforcing the stalemate. It will only be through decisive action that one side gain a large enough advantage at the border needed to overrun the other."

 YUN_introminigame_switch_sides_decision: "Switch Sides"
 YUN_introminigame_switch_sides_decision_desc: "The Warlord Era is filled with tales of sordid betrayals, sometimes due to envy, sometimes due to greed, and sometimes for self preservation. For many of the lower ranking officers on both sides of the border, this choice has become more and more tempting as the tide begins to turn."

 YUN_introminigame_commence_the_assault_decision: "Commence the Assault"
 YUN_introminigame_commence_the_assault_decision_desc: "Thanks to our men's efforts, our troop buildup has outpaced that of our foes. Momentum is on our side. We must strike while the iron is still hot, and order our troops forward before our enemies can bring in more reinforcements."

 YUN_introminigame_accelerate_our_buildup_decision: "Accelerate Our Buildup"
 YUN_introminigame_accelerate_our_buildup_decision_desc: "This stalemate will only be broken if one side can take the initiative and outpace the other in assembling their troops. The wise general knows that the logistics game is not merely a military matter, but often political. The side that is able to marshal the resources of its people and overcome bureaucratic inertia will be the one with more guns, more supplies, and more troops."

 YUN_introminigame_develop_our_battleplan_decision: "Develop our Battleplan"
 YUN_introminigame_develop_our_battleplan_decision_desc: "They say the best laid plans of the generals never survive contact with the enemy, but that hardly diminishes the value of a good plan. We must work to piece together the information provided by our networks of spies, scouts, and soldiers on the ground, allowing our planners to create the best strategy possible for the coming war. Although the exact details are bound to change as the situation develops, having the right pieces in the right places before the battle will give us the flexibility to win."

 YUN_introminigame_win_the_war_of_wills_decision: "Win the War of Wills"
 YUN_introminigame_win_the_war_of_wills_decision_desc: "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting, and in an era of shifting loyalties the effective number of troops one side has on the ground may be far fewer or far greater than their actual soldiers gathered. With tailored propaganda on one hand and some generous bribes on the other, we may be able to convince our opponents to give up or at least not resist as hard. Similarly, adequate pay and good treatment of our men will go a long way for shoring up our own officers and mens' loyalties."

###- Phase II Decisions -###
 YUN_GXC_war_decision_category: "The Second Yunnan-Guangxi War"
 YUN_GXC_war_decision_category_desc: "Yunnan has invaded Liangguang, reigniting conflict between the two southern powers. Success or failure in this war will likely hinge on their ability to take Nanning, the capital of Guangxi. Seizing it will open the door to march on Guangzhou. Failing to do so will cause many in Yunnan to lose faith in [YUN.GetLeader] and likely result in a diplomatic settlement.\n\n§Y[YUN_GXC_war_settlement_scripted_loc]§!"
 YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_start: "If a treaty was signed today, Yunnan would"
 YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_1: "$YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_start$ be forced to become an Associated Governorate and yield Guizhou."
 YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_2: "$YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_start$ be forced to become an Associated Governorate but would keep Guizhou."
 YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_3: "$YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_start$ sign a white peace and yield Guizhou."
 YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_4: "$YUN_GXC_war_settlement_outcome_start$ sign a white peace but would keep Guizhou."

 YUN_the_course_of_the_yunnan_guangxi_war_mission: "The Course of Dian-Gui War"
 YUN_the_course_of_the_yunnan_guangxi_war_mission_desc: "Yunnan Clique Generals, reluctant to commit to external military adventures or risk Yunnan falling under external domination, are expecting rapid results in this war lest they begin to panic. Successfully seizing Nanning will give Yunnan momentum, failing to do so will shatter it."
 YUN_GXC_increase_morale_effect_tt: "§YOur Morale National Spirit may §GIncrease§! if we control Nanning and our war support is high.§!"
 YUN_GXC_decrease_morale_effect_tt: "§YOur Morale National Spirit may §RDecrease§! if we do not control Nanning and our war support is low.§!"

 YUN_begin_secret_surrender_negotiations_decision: "Begin Secret Surrender Negotiations"
 YUN_begin_secret_surrender_negotiations_decision_desc: "The war has gone horribly, just as expected. With hopes of a speedy resolution dimming and fears of our enemies entering Yunnan growing, Generals Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu have begun secretly conspiring with one another about the possibility of overthrowing [YUN.GetLeader]. It might be time to covertly begin talks with our foes and end this war before it is too late!"

 YUN_accept_yunnans_surrender_decision: "Accept Yunnan's Surrender"
 YUN_accept_yunnans_surrender_decision_desc: "Having received contact with the conspiring Yunnan Generals in Kunming and with battlefield developments going in our favor, it is time for us to press our terms. This will allow us to avoid a costly campaign in the mountains while securing our Western flank for the time being."

###- Phase III Decisions -###
 YUN_grand_southern_reconstruction_decision_category: "Grand Southern Reconstruction"

 YUN_expand_gejiu_mining: "Expand Gejiu Mining"
 YUN_expand_gejiu_mining_desc: "With the commencement of the Grand Southern Reconstruction project, Gejiu's massive Tin deposits can finally be exploited thanks to our economy becoming more industrialised over the past few years."

 YUN_kunming_cement_factory: "Kunming Cement Factory"
 YUN_kunming_cement_factory_desc: "To reduce Yunnan's reliance on imported cement from its neighbouring provinces and abroad, Yunnan must develop its own cement industry to ensure the security and stability of the Grand Southern Reconstruction."

 YUN_modernised_smelting: "Modernised Smelting"
 YUN_modernised_smelting_desc: "If Yunnan's mineral deposits are to be optimally exploited and reduce our reliance on imported steel, there must be improvements made to Yunnan's current smelting industry. Outdated machinery must be replaced, missing equipment procured and new techniques must be learned."

 YUN_purchasing_american_machinery: "Purchasing American Machinery"
 YUN_purchasing_american_machinery_desc: "To further progress the development of our industry, and to replace our ineffective and rather outdated tools, the government must turn to the more experienced outside world. Being one of the world's more industrialised nations, it would be wise for our government to turn to the United States for assistance."

 YUN_yaolong_electric_station: "Yaolong Electric Station"
 YUN_yaolong_electric_station_desc: "With the Yunnannese economy becoming increasingly industrialised, it would be wise to construct a hydroelectric power station within Yunnan itself near Yaolong to supply Yunnan's future power needs."

 YUN_charcoal_kiln: "Expand Kunming Charcoal Kilns"
 YUN_charcoal_kiln_desc: "With much of Yunnan's population living in rural areas, charcoal has become a fuel source in high demand due due it often being much easier to cook with than fuel. By expanding Yunnan's domestic charcoal production, our government could see an increase in revenue as well as appeasing local charcoal dealers."

 YUN_arsenal_subsidies: "Arsenal Subsidies"
 YUN_arsenal_subsidies_desc: "Despite the Kunming arsenal being a historically stable supplier of arms for the Yunnan army, it may not be enough due to our government's increased demand for arms. With some hoping to expand the arsenals, it would be of the utmost importance to increase subsidies for the Kunming arsenal if our government hopes to maintain its supply of weapons."

 YUN_guizhou_brewing_factory: "Guizhou Brewing Factory"
 YUN_guizhou_brewing_factory_desc: "Despite Guizhou's underdevelopment and poverty, Maotai has remained one of Guizhou's most valuable, and most famous, exports throughout its entire history. Therefore, the expansion of current breweries and distilleries must be undertaken if we are to maintain, or even increase, Guizhou's supply of Maotai to the rest of China."

 YUN_guangzhou_cement_factory: "Guangzhou Cement Factory"
 YUN_guangzhou_cement_factory_desc: "Thanks to Guangdong's pre-existing relatively stable cement manufacturing industry, no additional investment of capital is necessary if we are to maintain it. However, if our government is to cut down on its use of foreign cement, Guangdong's cement industry must be further expanded to ensure the security of all future construction projects within the southwest."

 YUN_qingyuan_chemical_and_fertiliser_factory: "Qingyuan Chemical and Fertiliser Factory"
 YUN_qingyuan_chemical_and_fertiliser_factory_desc: "Although a primarily agricultural nation, China still lacks a modern fertilising industry. Economic planners have outlined an ambitious project to develop a chemical and fertilising plant in Guangzhou which will hopefully kickstart China's fertilising modernisation."

 YUN_wengjiang_hydroelectric_plant: "Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant"
 YUN_wengjiang_hydroelectric_plant_desc: "With Guangzhou, and Guangdong in general, emerging as a new industrial centre for China, the region is projected to see a massive increase in power consumption in the following years. To supply Guangdong's new industry, the mighty Pearl River's flow can be exploited by constructing new hydroelectric power plants along it."

 YUN_qiongya_rubber: "Qiongya Rubber"
 YUN_qiongya_rubber_desc: "With Qiongya's warm climate and nutrient rich soil, it has become a plantation for cash crops in recent years. Profits from the island's cash crops can be further increased if a rubber plantation is started to supply both our government and any potential foreign buyers with rubber."

 YUN_guangxi_infrastructure_development_scheme: "Guangxi Infrastructure Development Scheme"
 YUN_guangxi_infrastructure_development_scheme_desc: "With Guangxi often lacking behind in development, its infrastructure is often not up to modern standards. Therefore, if our government hopes to develop Guangxi's industry, investment in new infrastrucutre projects is of the utmost imporance."

 YUN_guangxi_farmers_bank: "Guangxi Farmers Bank"
 YUN_guangxi_farmers_bank_desc: "Farmers live in a cycle of perpetual debt, taking on loans in the spring in hopes of reaping a fruitful harvest in the fall. To alleviate their plight, a farmer's bank will be created to lend money to rural granaries and farmers, accepting grain as collateral. Credit Offices for the Common People are to developed by shopkeepers under government regulation to facilitate rural business. We will not leave our farmers behind."

 YUN_arable_land_development: "Arable Land Development"
 YUN_arable_land_development_desc: "Due to Yunnan's mountainous terrain, large scale agricultural developments have always been a challenge in the region. Rice paddies and small scale farms make up most of Yunnan's current agriculture due to its adaptability to its difficult terrain. To aleviate this, the government must develop Yunnan's agricultural industry by further expanding its amount of arable land."

 YUN_yunnan_cotton_spinning_and_weaving: "Yunnan Cotton Spinning and Weaving"
 YUN_yunnan_cotton_spinning_and_weaving_desc: "With cotton production and spinning being one of Yunnan's more productive light industries, it would be wise in continuing the efforts of Tang's government in further developing Yunnan's cotton mills."

 YUN_yunnan_water_control: "Yunnan Water Control"
 YUN_yunnan_water_control_desc: "With Yunnan often experiencing large amounts of seasonal rainfall, flooding is quite a common occurrence for many Yunnanese people. With how destructive flooding tends to get during the rainy season, previous governments have often organised massive water control projects in an effort to limit the damage. Our government must continue to do the same."

 YUN_support_inc: "Supporting the Indochinese Revolt"
 YUN_support_inc_desc: "Forever sharing a form of cultural brotherhood with our Indochinese neighbours, we could not previously support their prior efforts to rid their lands of the German yoke. However, now that a new rebellion has sprung into action, fiercer and stronger than before, it is imperative that we seize the opportunity to both support a friendly regime, weaken German Influence in Asia, and remove German inroads into Yunnan. A win for everybody. Except the Germans."

 YUN_mining: "Expand Mining Operations"
 YUN_mining_desc: "The mining operations near Gejiu and other major mining cities in Yunnan are a major aspect of the Yunnanese economy, a vital one even. Expanding the mines, furnaces and smelters in our province as well as subsidising mining corporations will help us increase our output and quality."

 YUN_mining1_decision: "Expand Coal Mining in [816.GetName]"
 YUN_mining1_decision_desc: "Expanding the mines, furnaces and smelters in [816.GetName] as well as subsidising mining corporations will help us increase our output and quality."

 YUN_mining2_decision: "Expand Aluminium Mining in [325.GetName]"
 YUN_mining2_decision_desc: "Expanding the mines, furnaces and smelters in [325.GetName] as well as subsidising mining corporations will help us increase our output and quality."

 YUN_mining3_decision: "Expand Chromium Mining in [816.GetName]"
 YUN_mining3_decision_desc: "Expanding the mines, furnaces and smelters in [816.GetName] as well as subsidising mining corporations will help us increase our output and quality."

 YUN_mining4_decision: "Expand Tungsten Mining in [816.GetName]"
 YUN_mining4_decision_desc: "Expanding the mines, furnaces and smelters in [816.GetName] as well as subsidising mining corporations will help us increase our output and quality."

#CHI YUN Satellite Decisions
 YUN_CHI_Spreading_Socialism_to_the_Southwest_decision_category: "Spreading Socialism to the Southwest"
 YUN_CHI_Spreading_Socialism_to_the_Southwest_decision_category_desc: "The southwestern Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou have traditionally been more conservative, with revolutionary movements quashed in favor of gentry-backed \"reformism\". The Kuomintang and their predecessors have struggled to maintain a foothold in the region throughout the 1920s, however after the Long March of the National Revolutionary Army, rightist forces managed to seize part of Guizhou in 1928 and after the collapse of the Zhili hegemony they conquered Yunnan on behalf of the party.\n\nLoosely allied to our government, their loyalties remain suspect. The Central Committee has deployed advisors to Kunming and Guiyang in hopes of promoting socialism in the region, but they can use our help. Taking the following decisions will increase leftist influence in the Southwest, increasing the odds of §RZhang Bojun§! or §SChen Cheng§! taking control of Yunnan after we complete the Northern Expedition."

 YUN_CHI_fund_agrarian_development_in_guizhou_decision: "Fund Agrarian Development in Guizhou"
 YUN_CHI_fund_agrarian_development_in_guizhou_decision_desc: "General Chen Cheng's calls for extensive rural land reform, including land-to-the-tiller, rent caps, and streamlining of taxation is a scaled-down version of the more radical proposals of our party but perhaps is sufficient to get our message through the door in conservative Guizhou. By offering to fund these efforts, we can promote a more equitable future for the province in the countryside."

 YUN_CHI_arm_the_civil_engineering_clique_decision: "Arm the Civil Engineering Clique"
 YUN_CHI_arm_the_civil_engineering_clique_decision_desc: "Chen Cheng has recently been appointed commander of the 18th Army, split from the old 1st Army that encamped in Guizhou. Combined with his direct command of the 10th Division, his faction has been dubbed the \"Civil Engineering Clique\" (a visual pun) and represents the leftward drift of Chiang Kai-shek's Whampoa Clique. While perhaps not truly socialist, Chen's affiliation with Deng Yanda and the PAC makes him a useful counterweight to the overtly rightist Political Science Clique. Prioritising weapons to General Chen will help promote socialism in the southwest."

 YUN_CHI_cultivate_third_army_leftists_decision: "Cultivate Third Army Leftists"
 YUN_CHI_cultivate_third_army_leftists_decision_desc: "General Zhu De is perhaps the most visible leftist in the Third Army, a brilliant strategic mind and well connected among regional revolutionary generals including Zhu Peide, Fan Shisheng, and Jin Handing. With personal politics often taking priority to ideology in the southwest, he is a vital asset and by funding major renovations to Kunming Arsenal and Kunming Military Academy, we will gain leverage over Yunnan's military."

 YUN_CHI_empower_zhang_bojun_decision: "Empower Zhang Bojun"
 YUN_CHI_empower_zhang_bojun_decision_desc: "Zhang Bojun is a loyal party cadre deployed to Yunnan as an \"advisor\", in practice acting as our plenipotentiary to the southwest. Zhang is a fairly effective diplomat - well educated and charismatic, he is able to weave his way into local intellectual circles. With many Yunnan students and professors disillusioned by recent political developments, they are ripe to be converted, he claims, if only we would be generous with our funding."

 YUN_CHI_recognise_the_new_yunnan_society_decision: "Recognise the New Yunnan Society"
 YUN_CHI_recognise_the_new_yunnan_society_decision_desc: "The Yunnan Special Bureau of the Chinese Syndicalist Party is a covert group of former students turned revolutionaries with military-political training from Whampoa. Led by brothers Wang Desan and Wang Fusheng, they have achieved some success infiltrating the province on behalf of the broader New Yunnan Society, a society of Yunnan born syndicalists within the CSP. Offering official recognition to these agents would allow them to step out of the shadows, but the consequences are unpredictable."
 YUN_CHI_recognise_the_new_yunnan_society_tt: "§YDepending on Yunnan's choices, this may benefit Yunnan's §rSyndicalists§!, §RRadical Socialists§!, or §SSocial Democrats§!.§!"

##Dian Dragon's Domain Decisions

#YUN Side Decisions
 YUN_dian_dragon_domain_decision_category: "Dian Dragon's Domain"
 YUN_dian_dragon_domain_decision_category_desc: "The successor to Cai E and his legacy has fallen. Despite having built up the province of Yunnan and its provincial army to what it is today, riding high off of his victory against the Kuomintang holdout in Guizhou, Governor Tang Jiyao's gaze was set upon the Pearl of the South, Guangzhou. In poor judgement, Governor Tang threatened to destroy the entire existence of the Yunnan Clique with his failed invasion of Guangxi, forcing his generals to detain him and make peace.[YUN_dian_dragon_domain_long_yun_status_scripted_loc][YUN_dian_dragon_domain_hu_ruoyu_status_scripted_loc]"

 YUN_dian_dragon_domain_long_yun_independent_key: "\n\nHaving held a firm grip over Yunnanese politics for decades and temporarily confined to the northern city of Zhaotong after the failed February 6th Coup, §gGeneral Long Yun's§! position as \"King of Yunnan\" has now become a reality with Governor Tang no longer in the spotlight.

 YUN_dian_dragon_domain_long_yun_subject_other_key: "\n\nEither simply going which way the wind is blowing or done out of sheer desperation, §gGeneral Long Yun§! has broken Yunnan's isolationist policy and aligned Kunming with another force.

 YUN_acknowledge_zhili_authority_decision: "Acknowledge Zhili Authority"
 YUN_acknowledge_zhili_authority_decision_desc: "Yunnan's autonomy should be preserved at all cost, but at times like these, we have to acknowledge the impossibility of achieving such a feat. With the Zhili at our doorstep, and their supporters continuing to pressure us into aligning with them, we have no choice but to send a telegraph to the Zhili leadership acknowledging our recognition of their national authority to secure what remaining autonomy we will have under their protection."

 YUN_building_a_democratic_base_decision: "Building A Democratic Base"
 YUN_building_a_democratic_base_decision_desc: "Yunnan was the first province to rebel against the tyranny of Yuan Shikai when he dismantled the republic by crowning himself Emperor of China, dragging the nation back towards the monarchical system many revolutionaries died to overthrow during Xinhai. To remember the sacrifices of the revolution, we must build upon this legacy by transforming Yunnan into a \"democratic\" fortress, with the help of reformist intellectuals and progressive movements within the province to mold Yunnan into what it ought to be."

 YUN_entrust_our_finances_to_commerce_decision: "Entrust Our Finances to Commerce"
 YUN_entrust_our_finances_to_commerce_decision_desc: "Facilitators of economic growth in Yunnan through the development of local industry and the province's financial system, the Yunnan Chamber of Commerce has proven itself a worthy ally of the provincial government. With their previous cooperation with Governor Cai E and Governor Tang Jiyao, the Chamber of Commerce can surely be entrusted to handle the province's finances with care and responsibility. Together, this fruitful pact will bring prosperity to Yunnan for which will be enjoyed by all."

 YUN_continue_modernisation_efforts_decision: "Continue Modernisation Efforts"
 YUN_continue_modernisation_efforts_decision_desc: "Far away in the corners of the nation's mountainous frontiers, Yunnan has lagged in comparison to other provinces in the east. Without a coastline for the province to be reached, Yunnan has not felt the benefits of modernisation efforts that have already taken place across the nation, bar from attempts to do so by Governor Tang Jiyao. By continuing where Governor Tang left off, we shall ensure modernisation takes place in Yunnan socially, politically, and economically."

 YUN_repurpose_the_bureaucracy_decision: "Repurpose the Bureaucracy"
 YUN_repurpose_the_bureaucracy_decision_desc: "For all of Governor Tang's failings, it is thanks to him that we inherit a vast and functioning bureaucracy that has served him so \"loyally\" throughout his governorship, implementing his policies and reforms efficiently and without question. With him out of the picture and us in control over Yunnan, it is only natural that we reconfigure this wonderful system to serve our needs, and legitimise our rule by acting as a continuity to the previous administration."

 YUN_tolerate_mengzis_monopoly_decision: "Tolerate Mengzi's Monopoly"
 YUN_tolerate_mengzis_monopoly_decision_desc: "Much of the Yunnan's natural resources lay at the hands of Mengzi, which controls a majority of the province's mines in the southern reaches of the mountainous Yungui Plateau. Extracting minerals from the earth and exporting it towards Indochinese ports to be refined, this has come to be one of Yunnan's main sources of revenue, funding for its economic development, administration, and most importantly, its military strength. Predictably, due to their location, Mengzi holds a monopoly over the province's mining sector, of which we have to tolerate for now."

#Non-YUN Side Decisions

 YUN_pressure_yunnan_into_alignment_decision: "Pressure Yunnan into Alignment"
 YUN_pressure_yunnan_into_alignment_decision_desc: "Our efforts in Yunnan have begun to bear fruit as those loyal to our government are starting to wield enough power to contest the current authorities in the province. With General Long Yun's mandate on the verge of collapse, it is high time we apply pressure upon Yunnan to align with our government!"

 YUN_allure_of_money_and_flattery: "Allure of Money and Flattery"
 YUN_allure_of_money_and_flattery_desc: "Distant from the reaches of the Central Government, it has led Yunnan to enjoy a certain level of political autonomy, free to carry out its administration independent of Beijing's wishes. However, this has also made Yunnan among the poorest provinces in the Southwest, neglected by central authorities as its economy suffers from underdevelopment. For us, this is but an opportunity for us to increase our influence in Yunnan by enticing them with financial aid."

 YUN_bribing_the_disaffected: "Bribing the Disaffected"
 YUN_bribing_the_disaffected_desc: "The Yunnan Army might be more professional than most warlord armies in China, but its loyalty is questionable. Despite Long Yun's position as Yunnan's hegemon is unquestionable, there remains those who remain loyal to Governor Tang and his clique as well as those more than willing to jump ship with a bit of cash injection. By sending waves of bribes to corrupt officers, and the apathetic rank and file, threats of desertion should help keep Long Yun in line."

 YUN_issue_threats_to_yunnan: "Issue Threats to Yunnan"
 YUN_issue_threats_to_yunnan_desc: "Although the Yunnan Clique has retreated into isolationism in light of its failure in the Second Yunnan-Guangxi War and subsequent coup against Governor Tang Jiyao, the mere idea of Yunnan maintaining its independence cannot stay any longer. With military defeat fresh in the minds of the Yunnan Army, being threatened with the possibility of another war should scare the Yunnanese leadership into aligning with us and strengthen our grip over the Southwest."

 YUN_deal_with_the_mengzi_junta: "Deal with the Mengzi Junta"
 YUN_deal_with_the_mengzi_junta_desc: "With Governor Tang out of the picture, a balance of power exists between Long Yun in Kunming and the three other garrison commanders in Mengzi: Hu Ruoyu, Zhang Ruji, and Li Xuanting. Unlike Long Yun who has shown himself in favour of isolationism and non-alignment, our agents in Yunnan have indicated the Mengzi junta to be more receptive towards aligning with our government. With that in mind, we could expand their influence in the province by directly making deals with Mengzi."

 YUN_send_out_peace_feelers: "Send Out Peace Feelers"
 YUN_send_out_peace_feelers_desc: "Aside from being an act of self-preservation by its conspirators, the coup in Kunming is a clear sign of Yunnan distancing itself from Export Militarism, and as a consequence, war itself. Isolated politically, we should send peace feelers to Yunnan, announcing our intention of achieving national unification without resorting to forceful methods. With the promotion of peace in our mutual interest, it is no doubt Kunming will accept and align with us in the name of uniting the nation peacefully."

#Hu Hanmin Crisis
 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_decisions: "The Provisional Constitution Crisis"
 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_decisions_desc: "[YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_desc_scripted_loc]"
 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_desc_he_yingqin_key: "President He Yingqin has vowed to pass the Provisional Constitution, whatever the cost may be. To him, this is the only way to unite the nation and assert his authority once and for all. Faced with stiff opposition by Hu Hanmin, Premier of the Legislative Yuan, he has ordered his men to begin planning an auto-coup - eliminating dissent against his rule by force in one fell swoop.\n\nIn order to pull this off successfully, He Yingqin must ensure that §cNationalist Zeal§! remains stably in the centre: above §R$RKT_bop_unrelenting_cynicism$§! and below §G$RKT_bop_unbridled_conviction$§! at the end of the 60 day $YUN_he_yingqin_autocoup_mission$ mission.\n\nCurrently, Nationalist Zeal sits at §Y[ROOT.GetActiveRangeName]§!"
 YUN_provisional_constitution_crisis_desc_zhang_qun_key: "In the fallout of Hu Hanmin's arrest, the Provisional Constitution Crisis has spun out of control. Hoping to salvage the situation, the §MPolitical Science Clique§! has staged a power grab, strongly opposed by their rivals in the §aCC Clique§!. Meanwhile, the §PWhampoa Clique§! are considering a coup of their own.\n\nThe National Assembly is on-going. Delegates are known to double-dealing, willing to vote with who incentivises them more or appears stronger at the moment.\n\nThe §MPolitical Science Clique§! needs §M335 Votes§! to pass their Constitution and save their government.\n[?YUN_PSC_aligned_delegates_variable|M0]§M/502§!

 YUN_he_yingqin_autocoup_mission: "He Yingqin's Autocoup"
 YUN_he_yingqin_autocoup_mission_desc: "Mounting criticism from within the party, spearheaded by Premier of the Legislative Yuan Hu Hanmin, has created a brutal rift between Hu and President He Yingqin. As mutual suspicion grows, exacerbated by the drafting a Provisional Constitution, He Yingqin has resolved to eliminate his rival once and for all.\n\nTo do so he will need to not only purge the party of Hu Hanmin and his Moscow Committee Clique allies, but also disarm or threaten into submission the regional militarist cliques that dominate the party's southern heartland. This is no easy task, and to be successful he will need to demonstrate that he can preserve party stability and avoid allowing Nationalist Zeal from growing too high or too low."

 YUN_hu_hanmins_outrage_mission: "Hu Hanmin's Outrage"
 YUN_hu_hanmins_outrage_mission_desc: "Hu Hanmin is a fiery orator and one of Sun Yat-sen's closest disciples, allowing him to express an unusually large amount of dissent within the party-state. A devout democratic-centralist, he has lashed out against Kuomintang figures who have formed factions to advance private interests and government officials who hoard property and live off corruption, both understood by He Yingqin as a veiled attack on the Generalissimo.\n\nWhile his antics were once tolerable, or at least a necessary evil, the discussions over the Provisional Constitution have worsened relations between the two men. Hu, as Premier of the Legislative Yuan, argues that the Kuomintang can convene a National Assembly (also translated as the National People's Convention) but it cannot draft a provisional constitution. The National Assembly can only draft a full constitution at the end of the Political Tutelage. Moreover, Hu argues that a provisional constitution would not improve the life of the people, instead it would be a distraction from the national reconstruction, reduction of taxes, and development of communication infrastructure, agriculture, industry, and commerce.\n\nUnlike the empty words of the provisional constitution, Hu Hanmin is very much willing to back his views with his well armed supporters."

 YUN_position_forces_near_liangguang_mission: "Position Forces Near Liangguang"
 YUN_position_forces_near_liangguang_mission_intro: "Liangguang (the \"Two Guangs\" of Guangdong and Guangxi), is the traditional heartland of the Kuomintang and also the centre of anti-He Yingqin discontent. Between He Yingqin's autocratic rule, Hu Hanmin's status as a favourite son of Guangdong, the CC Clique's efforts to \"De-Cantonise\" the party, the Political Science Clique's unsavoury history there, and the outsider status of many of the Whampoa Clique's leading members (He Yingqin is from Guizhou, Teng Jie from Jiangsu, Chen Cheng from Zhejiang), Guangdong is perhaps the epicentre of the Old and Regional Rights' opposition to the New Right.\n\nThey are no idle threat either. One of the wealthiest provinces in China and with a long history of external trade with the West, their regional forces are well equipped. Similarly, as the New Guangxi Clique rebuild their control over their provinces, they have shaped Guangxi into \"China's Sparta\", turning their bandit-infested provinces into a disciplined citizen-militia."
 YUN_position_forces_near_liangguang_mission_desc: "$YUN_position_forces_near_liangguang_mission_intro$\n\nConvincing both provinces to stand down and see reason will require an army beyond reckoning - tens of thousands, if not hundreds."

 YUN_liangguang_troop_stationing_mission: "Liangguang Troop Stationing"
 YUN_liangguang_troop_stationing_mission_desc: "$YUN_position_forces_near_liangguang_mission_intro$\n\nWith loyalist troops having entered the region, more and more potentially rebellious commanders have been persuaded to stand down. To truly dissuade an uprising in this rebel heartland, we may have to prolong our stay."

 YUN_divide_and_conquer_in_hunan_mission: "Divide and Conquer in Hunan"
 YUN_divide_and_conquer_in_hunan_mission_intro: "Hunan has a complicated relationship with the Kuomintang. Not only a major battleground between Beiyang and Guangzhou governments over the years, the populous province also was home to three feuding Kuomintang-aligned factions. Ever since the rise of the New Right, Hunan has straddled the line between obeying central government directives and expressing sympathies with regionalist and Old Right movements."
 YUN_divide_and_conquer_in_hunan_mission_desc: "$YUN_divide_and_conquer_in_hunan_mission_intro$\n\nThey are a quasi-subordinate region anyway, so show of force should intimidate the fence sitters into aligning with our interests and their petty internal rivalries will do the rest."

 YUN_Hunan_Divided_and_Conquered_mission: "Hunan Divided and Conquered"
 YUN_Hunan_Divided_and_Conquered_mission_desc: "$YUN_divide_and_conquer_in_hunan_mission_intro$\n\nWith our troops already occupying the region, the centre of gravity has shifted in our favour. However, for this to be more than just a show of force, we will need to demonstrate that we are here to stay."

 YUN_Secure_the_Southwest_mission: "Secure the Southwest"
 YUN_Secure_the_Southwest_mission_intro: "The southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou have been our military heartland for many years. It is where the National Revolutionary Army first reorganised after its defeat in the Northern Expedition and the endpoint of the Long March."
 YUN_Secure_the_Southwest_mission_desc: "$YUN_Secure_the_Southwest_mission_intro$\n\nWe have a deep connection to the southwest, something our enemies seem to have forgotten. We shall remind them of our power...and our love."

 YUN_The_Southwest_Submits_mission: "The Southwest Submits"
 YUN_The_Southwest_Submits_mission_desc: "$YUN_Secure_the_Southwest_mission_intro$\n\nWe have a deep connection to the southwest, something that we have been quick to remind our foes about. Still, in order to prevent them from forgetting again, perhaps we ought to stay here a while."

#PSC Decisions
 YUN_Pass_the_Provisional_Constitution_decision: "Pass the Provisional Constitution"
 YUN_Pass_the_Provisional_Constitution_decision_desc: "Finally, with a supermajority of National Assembly delegates on our side, we can press forward despite the crisis with our long awaited Provisional Constitution. Once the steady stream of \"Ayes\" come rolling in, most of the remaining delegates will fall into line. Zhang Qun's rule will be legitimised, and the Political Science Clique will have the stability needed to reconcile with the South China Political Council."

 YUN_Loyalty_Tests_in_the_Bureaucracy_decision: "Loyalty Tests in the Bureaucracy"
 YUN_Loyalty_Tests_in_the_Bureaucracy_decision_desc: "The Nationalist Government's bureaucracy is bloated and nepotistic, built for patronage and rewarding loyalists rather than administrative efficiency. Now, with allegiances being called in question across the regime, it is time that we begin restacking the government in our favour. The new civil service ought to be qualified, diligent and obey our directives without question!"

 YUN_Promise_a_Constitutional_government_decision: "Promise a Constitutional Government"
 YUN_Promise_a_Constitutional_government_decision_desc: "In a nation that has long been seen as backwards, violent, and effectively feudal, there has been a cry from inside and out for modernisation. The Political Science Clique is eager to demonstrate its commitment to modernity - modern industry, modern styles, modern business culture, modern technology, modern management. Chipping away at needless traditions and turning a new page is a difficult process, but a necessary one.\n\nAmid the chaos of the Hu Hanmin Crisis, there is a growing consensus that the arbitrary, capricious nature of military rule must end in favour of a civilian led government. In place of military dominance, a modern technocratic and responsible government must rise even if it might be too soon for a full democracy. Rule of law, not a party-state and its fanatics, must be the basis of our republic."

 YUN_Release_Political_Prisoners_decision: "Release Political Prisoners"
 YUN_Release_Political_Prisoners_decision_desc: "As Hu Hanmin was arrested, hundreds of his followers were detained with him and held without trial. Others were swept up over the years, sometimes on spurious or non-existent charges by an overzealous secret police or turned in by vindictive political rivals. A surefire way of winning over the bourgeoisie and intelligentsia that make up much of the recently elected National Assembly is to release political dissidents who are like them or even close to them. It will not be easy by any means, but it would be a nice starting point for further negotiations."

 YUN_Bribe_Miliitary_Officers_decision: "Bribe Military Officers"
 YUN_Bribe_Miliitary_Officers_decision_desc: "The National Revolutionary Army is a heavily politicised force by design, meant to be thoroughly loyal to the party-state and its revolutionary creed. Many of its core divisions and officers are ideological fanatics and thoroughly embedded into the Whampoa cult of personality. However, as the army expanded, they quickly became surrounded by many units freshly absorbed from defeated or integrated warlord armies or new recruits from less politicised training programs. While it might be too late to defang the army altogether, with some carefully placed bribes (both monetary and with regards to promotions) and leveraging our connections to prominent regional military men might be sufficient in deterring less zealous officers from endorsing a coup d'etat."

#CCC Decisions
 YUN_Call_a_Vote_of_No_Confidence_decision: "Call a Vote of No Confidence"
 YUN_Call_a_Vote_of_No_Confidence_decision_desc: "The Political Science government has run its course, and not one day too soon. As the treacherous Zhang Qun and two-faced Yang Yongtai flail about, the revolutionary government we have worked so hard to build hurtles towards collapse. Seeing the inevitable and wary of the obvious military discontent, a solid majority over Delegates have been assembled to table discussions on the Provisional Constitution Yang and his allies have staked their legitimacy on. We will press on with a vote of no confidence shortly after and end this farce once and for all."

 YUN_Increase_Propaganda_Output_decision: "Increase Propaganda Output"
 YUN_Increase_Propaganda_Output_decision_desc: "Whampoa has their troops and the Political Science Clique their economic organs, but only the CC Clique can truly harness the will of the people! Through an extensive mass media campaign, with input from the nation's leading thinkers and scholars, we can inflame the hearts and educate minds of the people! With great gusto, we reignite the revolutionary passions of the party!"

 YUN_Stoke_Xenophobic_Hysteria_decision: "Stoke Xenophobic Hysteria"
 YUN_Stoke_Xenophobic_Hysteria_decision_desc: "Our party is surrounded by party traitors and foreign agents! Syndicalists and their fellow travellers infiltrate and twist our revolution from the left, while the Bank of China's plutocrats and compradors try to buy their way into power from the right! These miscreants have undermined the will of the Chinese people and the spirit of our Nationalist Party, all with the hopes of bringing it under foreign control!\n\nZhang Qun and Yang Yongtai have invited socialists, liberals, reactionaries, and foreign interests into our government under the guise of pluralism, causing nothing but division and ruin! They will soon put our revolution up for auction, and sell our principles to the highest bidder! We will not let them win - all patriots must rise up and meet our obligation to prevent socialist boots from trodding over [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"

 YUN_Orchestrate_a_Walkout_of_the_Bureaucracy_decision: "Orchestrate a Walkout of the Bureaucracy"
 YUN_Orchestrate_a_Walkout_of_the_Bureaucracy_decision_desc: "Yang Yongtai, the new Premier, may fancy himself as the new master of the bureaucracy, but the truth is that he has no more power than he has principles. He and his cronies have tried to sift through the administration Dai Jitao has created, slowly shuffling out our appointees and bribing or promoting his own men - creating fear and confusion among the ranks. We will not wait for such indignation - the Chen brothers will orchestrate a mass walkout of government officials, rendering the apparatus inoperable. Even those on the fence will feel the pressure to join our ranks as the Political Science Clique's position grows untenable and our return (and revenge) inevitable."

 YUN_Mobilise_the_Political_Commissars_decision: "Mobilise the Political Commissars"
 YUN_Mobilise_the_Political_Commissars_decision_desc: "Chiang Kai-shek might have built the National Revolutionary Army, but Dai Jitao and Chen Guofu were by his side from the beginning. What makes the National Revolutionary Army different from every other army roaming around China is the thorough political indoctrination imbued into every unit through its political commissars, directly selected and trained by the party itself. It is these connections that we will use to continue to bind the army to us and the good of the party-state."

#BSS/WPC Decisions
 YUN_The_Whampoa_Coup_mission: "The Whampoa Coup"
 YUN_The_Whampoa_Coup_mission_desc: "A great travesty has occurred - our esteemed Generalissimo was forced to resign by an ungrateful party, thrown out by the likes of the wicked Hu Hanmin. This brazen show of disunity and treachery has made our country look weak on an international stage in a time when the survival of nations depends on vicious strength and tenacity of will. Like the crooked politicians of old, our party has fallen into petty infighting and rivalries over the niceties of a useless piece of paper. If the party cannot sort matters out in a reasonable amount of time, then the revolutionary army that built this nation will take matters into our own hands!"

 YUN_Leverage_Whampoa_Connections_decision: "Leverage Whampoa Connections"
 YUN_Leverage_Whampoa_Connections_decision_desc: "No matter what has happened, and no matter what will happen, He Yingqin retains a cult of personality. To many former students and staff, he will always be one of the leading instructors of Whampoa, and a venerable revolutionary General that may as well be an institution in of himself. Though only middle aged, he has made his mark on the nation's history. And though boxed in from all sides, there are still many willing to rally behind him.\n\n§RCoaxing the moderates back into his camp will require a more gentlemanly, reassuring approach however, which may set back the army's plans for a coup.§!"

 YUN_Campaign_of_Intimidation_decision: "Campaign of Intimidation"
 YUN_Campaign_of_Intimidation_decision_desc: "The nation is at war, whether they realise it or not. Every day is another battle for the security of the nation, and the future of the Chinese race! In this war, every tool in our toolkit must be used to save our country - whether it be assassinations, midnight arrests, and mass surveillance. Through this righteous violence, our nation is reborn.\n\n§RWe must be cautious however, because fear has a tendency to drive frightened men into whichever camp will protect them.§!"

 YUN_Remind_about_Foreign_Threats_decision: "Remind about Foreign Threats"
 YUN_Remind_about_Foreign_Threats_decision_desc: "\"Japanese imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, and we absolutely deny the possibility of a compromise peace. If this party does not overthrow Japanese imperialism, Japanese imperialism will destroy China. Therefore, we resolutely maintain an attitude of absolute enmity toward Japan, and the work of resisting Japan is this party's most important and most holy task.\" - the National Programme of the Blue Shirts Society\n\nChina remains under threat, no matter how much \"restraint\" or \"compromise\" foreign imperialists claim to have. This disunity, over something as trivial and pointless as a Provisional Constitution, may very well be the death knell of Chinese civilisation if it is not stopped by the true patriots of the revolution."

 YUN_Encourage_Military_Disobedience_decision: "Encourage Military Disobedience"
 YUN_Encourage_Military_Disobedience_decision_desc: "Why is our revolution failing today? It surely is not because the army lacks the will to fight. Nor is it because the people lack the fire in their hearts or that China is unable to be a great nation! It is the same reason China has failed the past few centuries - the decadence of the elite and their collusion with foreign powers! While the Beijing sell-outs and Shanghai thieves continue to dominate our politics and economy, there can be no new China. But we will not stand for this, nor will we go back to the way things were!\n\nIt is a dark day when the eternally loyal National Revolutionary Army is called towards disobedience towards the party. But when the entire party apparatus has betrayed the revolution, what else is there to be done? The snakes in the Central Executive Committee have forgotten how indispensable a strong army and a strong hand is in carrying out our revolutionary promises. It is only by organising a mass refusal to follow their illegal orders, destabilising their government, that we can truly save our party and our country!"

#CEC + Other Decisions
 YUN_Negotiate_with_the_SCPC_decision: "Negotiate with the SCPC"
 YUN_Negotiate_with_the_SCPC_decision_desc: "Hu Hanmin's loyalists have coalesced into a South China Political Council. While we have successfully stemmed their efforts to enlist further support for their movement, they continue to dominate the old party heartland. Either we make a move to reconcile with them (bound to be popular among National Assembly delegates) or we work to undermine these talks."

 YUN_Handle_the_Leftist_Bloc_decision: "Handle the Party Left"
 YUN_Handle_the_Leftist_Bloc_decision_desc: "The Party's left encompasses a broad range of socialists, syndicalists, left nationalists, and progressives and struggle to be a unified entity. Negotiating with them is a difficult task to say the least, it is often akin to talking to a wall. Still, with party unity under question and a growing leftist movement within the army itself, perhaps some arrangement can be made."

 YUN_Negotiate_with_the_Dangwai_decision: "Dialogue with the Dangwai"
 YUN_Negotiate_with_the_Dangwai_decision_desc: "The Dangwai (literally translated \"Outside [the] Party\") describe the various political independents that have been allowed to participate in Kuomintang legislative processes. To preserve the legitimacy of the proceedings in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], a large number of Dangwai were invited.\n\nThe Dangwai are a diverse group. Many of the southern Dangwai tend to be more left leaning and progressive. Used to be locked out of power, many are eager for their chance to be included in political discussions. Many of the northern Dangwai are established, conservative politicians from the old Beiyang governments. Used to the revolving door of administrations, their political flexibility is useful but they also are quite accustomed to driving a hard bargain. We will need them all if we are to preserve the stability of our government."

 YUN_Harness_the_Mass_Movement_decision: "Harness the Mass Movement"
 YUN_Harness_the_Mass_Movement_decision_desc: "Revolutions are not just won through armies and their guns, but by the people and their willingness to support them. Though many claim to speak for the people, and many more claim to fight for them, there are very few who truly are of the masses and able to raise them up amid years of wars and broken promises."

##Section 1a (000-399): Introgame Political Events

#YUN Internal Event Chain (000-049):
 YUN.introgame.001.t: "The Scheming Court in the Southwest"
 YUN.introgame.001.d: "Tang Jiyao, at the height of his power in the late 1910s, boasted that he was the \"King of the Southwest\" - a metaphorical claim backed up by his command of the mighty Jingguojun, his domination over Yunnan and Guizhou, and his status as successor to Cai E's legacy. The ensuing years have been a humbling experience for the Governor - multiple coups and military defeats have left him clinging on for dear life. But to have survived this long was no easy feat, and the calculating leader continues to scheme from his throne in Kunming.\n\nThe latest bout of political intrigue back in 1927 left Yunnan at an impasse. Having been briefly overthrown by his own generals, Tang was able to claw back power by maintaining the loyalty of his bodyguard units in the capital. As the threats of Kuomintang invasion faded, the mutinying generals fell back in line leaving Tang Jiyao once again on top - ruling from his base in Kunming.\n\nTo the North, General Long Yun controls Zhaotong and remains the second most powerful man in Yunnan - a regionalist that prioritises stability above all and a reluctant participant in the 1926 coup. Tang's desire to check Long's influence has been constrained by his need for a reliable commander to man the border with the Kuomintang remnant in Guizhou and also to provide a counterweight to the true mastermind of the coup: Hu Ruoyu.\n\nHu Ruoyu, along with co-conspirators Li Xuanting and Zhang Ruji, was effectively banished to the south where he rules Mengzi on Tang's behalf as part of the final settlement. Even in 1926, their combined influence could never surpass Tang or Long's. Still, with German money flowing in from Indochina and Hu's shameless deference to Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang after the Kuomintang's defeat (Hu had been among the first to welcome the KMT into the province in the 1920s), they remain a potent force in Yunnan.\n\nWith the new year dawning, Tang has invited Defence Commissioners Long, Hu, and also Sun Du of Dali to a conference in a few weeks."
 YUN.introgame.001.a: "Our discussions will be fruitful I'm sure."
 YUN.introgame.001_tt: "§RThe Yunnan gentry is a force to be reckoned with and their power is represented by Long Yun serving as Second-in-Command. Until he is sidelined (one way or another) later in on, the official \"Governor\" will always be at risk of a coup.§!"

 YUN.introgame.002.t: "Dian-Qian Border Tensions"
 YUN.introgame.002.d: "Yunnan (abbreviated as Dian) and Guizhou's (abbreviated as Qian) fates after the Xinhai Revolution were intertwined. While both overthrew their Qing Governors, Cai E of Yunnan proved more successful in consolidating control in the aftermath and deployed Tang Jiyao to Guizhou to aid the Constitutional Preparation Society in pushing out the more radical Self-Government Study Society.\n\nThis led to Liu Xianshi taking power in the province, though he was deposed by his nephew Wang Wenhua in a power struggle after Tang returned to Yunnan to serve as Governor. Wang, who was backed by the Kuomintang, orchestrated a coup known as the Minjiu incident with the help of Guizhou commanders He Yingqin, Gu Zhenglun, and Zhu Shaoliang in 1920. The bloodshed caused widespread condemnation and Wang Wenhua was assassinated in turn while in exile in Shanghai.\n\nGuizhou was thrown into chaos amid fears of a Yunnan invasion, but the Beiyang government struck first by sponsoring Yuan Zuming to invade Guizhou and depose the Kuomintang backed Lu Dao. By 1922, Yuan was master of the province but within a year he faced an invasion force led by Tang Jiyao's brother Tang Jiyu, who was tasked with restoring Liu Xianshi to power. Tang Jiyu then served as de facto co-Governor but was forced to retreat in 1925 after the disastrous Yunnan-Guangxi war. Yuan, who had briefly come to an arrangement with Tang, reluctantly sided with the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition, only to betray them as the tide turned.\n\nYuan had hoped to recover Guizhou after the war, but fate had other plans. The National Revolutionary Army, defeated but not destroyed, undertook the \"Long March\" from eastern China to Guizhou, occupying western Guizhou. Tang Jiyao, who has had a long history of allying and fighting the Kuomintang, decided to bide his time, leaving them there to rot as a buffer to deny the Zhili any further gains. But he knows as well as anybody that the revolutionaries always bring trouble eventually."
 YUN.introgame.002.a: "One day, we shall return to Guizhou."
 YUN.introgame.002.b: "One day, we shall leave Guizhou."
 YUN.introgame.002_tt: "§YThe border between Yunnan and Guizhou is lightly fortified at the moment, a stalemate between the two sides. That could rapidly change...§!"

 YUN.introgame.003.t: "Anti-Concessionist Wave in the East"
 YUN.introgame.003.d: "The League of Five Provinces started off as a Southern Zhili project in eastern China, but after the Northern Expedition Sun Chuanfang added Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi to his sphere of influence. The League formally expanded to Eight in 1930 during the aftermath of the controversial 1929 elections, which saw Zhang Zuolin walk out of peace talks in the North and triggered fears of a Zhang-Sun alliance against the Cao-Wu government's proposals for disarmament and centralisation.\n\nGuizhou very narrowly avoided being added to the League. The Zhili recognised Governor, Yuan Zuming, has been extremely dependent on Southern Zhili and later Hunan Clique patronage to maintain his rule over eastern Guizhou. But Sun, in his desperate manoeuvres against the North, sought to avoid antagonising the Sichuan and Yunnan warlords during the interwar and left Guizhou out of the League.\n\nUnfortunately, the League Marshal's doomed quest to challenge his mentors has proven to be his downfall. An oversized army, soaring costs, endemic corruption, extreme brutality and the undertaking of significant loans has weakened the foundations of his empire. His partnership with foreign concessionists, most notably the German AOG, has triggered massive unrest, which has reached a fevered pitch after the ZheGan Railway scandal.\n\nYunnan of course is no stranger to working with foreign merchants. The valuable Tin Trade has brought British, French, Japanese, American and now German traders into the province and Tang Jiyao has sought to balance potentially riches with foreign exploitation. Overreach by the British and French have caused unrest in Gejiu in the past, which Tang has manipulated to his advantage. Still, German influence remains high particularly in Mengzi, where their patronage of Hu Ruoyu has allowed them to dominate Yunnanese trade.\n\nIn the east, the Wuhu Incident has given Chen Tiaoyuan of Anhui the pretext needed to secede from the League. Perhaps it is a sign the tide is turning?"
 YUN.introgame.003.a: "Unlike the League, we shall pursue an equal partnerships with foreign traders."
 YUN.introgame.003.b: "Foreign exploitation will only end when China takes back what is rightfully theirs!"

 YUN.introgame.004.t: "Black Monday Cripples the Tin Trade"
 YUN.introgame.004.d: "Black Monday has triggered a global economic meltdown, a disaster that will cripple economies for years to come. For China, already struggling with diminished trade after the American Great Depression, this will likely worsen the political instability the year has wrought. For Yunnan, heavily dependent on the Tin Trade, the collapse of the German economy is devastating.\n\nVirtually all tin exports go through the Hanoi-Kunming railroad. Initially built and owned by the French, the Germans seized it after the Great War and it has been folded into AOG subsidiaries. Likewise, mining rights in the Mengzi region which were once controlled by an Anglo-French syndicate, are effectively dominated by the Germans. Similar to the French, who exploited the lack of easy routes to Guangdong and also blocked efforts to create alternative railways, the Germans have charged extortionate rates to use the Hanoi-Kunming line.\n\nThe resentment against foreign concessions have been building for some time now, and recent events have created both a sense of national solidarity and xenophobia against outsiders. Nationalist and socialist agitators, usually affiliated with the Kuomintang, have exploited the moment to call for forceful seizures of foreign owned banks, plants, mines, and railways. Though often sparse on details beyond a retelling of Sun Yat-sen's vague Programme of National Reconstruction published decades ago, for many it captures the zeitgeist of the day.\n\nFor the technocrats working in the Yunnan government, there has been a greater urgency to modernise the economy. Yunnan's economy has long depended on tin and opium, and efforts by Minister of Finance Ma Cong in the 1920s to centralise the economy and promote currency reforms amid a severe economic crisis fell apart due to bureaucratic resistance. His successor, Miao Yuntai has been more successful in his efforts in the 1930s, particularly promoting industrialisation, but it often feels as if he has little time to work with."
 YUN.introgame.004.a: "A revolution frees men, land, and the nation!"
 YUN.introgame.004.b: "Reform of the economy will save it."

 YUN.introgame.005.t: "Sun Chuanfang is Shot in Nanjing!"
 YUN.introgame.005.d: "Sun Chunfang was gunned down by an assassin in Nanjing, bringing the League on the brink of war. While he is not dead yet, the sharks have been circling as his southern Zhili lieutenants angle to be his successor. Chief among them are Governor Qi Xieyuan of Jiangsu and the rebellious Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anhui, both of whom are positioning themselves for a coup.\n\nIn the south, Kuomintang uprisings have broken out almost simultaneously across the League as Nationalist leaders make their move. While most are in contact with Kuomintang hubs in MinGan or Guizhou, others are simply taking the initiative without waiting for higher authorisation.\n\nBeijing is in shambles, as northern Zhili leaders feud over how to respond to the crisis and warlords who accepted their authority for the past decade rapidly slip from their orbit. Unrest in the north and fears of another invasion by the Fengtian clique have paralysed the government, and for now they are left rudderless.\n\nFor the Kuomintang junta in Guizhou, the next steps are obvious. This might be their last chance to fulfill their revolutionary promises, and while the Beiyang establishment is distracted they must seize control of what provinces they can. For men like Tang Jiyao however, the present circumstances present a quandary.\n\nThe Federalist heyday was in the early 1920s, when China was seemingly irrevocably divided not only into North-South, but also into provincial warlord states. The idea of peacefully reuniting through negotiations was appealing to many reformist intellectuals, but even before the Zhili were able to reunite through force (thus proving them wrong), the Federalist movement lost steam as both the Northern and Southern governments ousted Federalist figures. Discredited as unpatriotic outside of certain southern circles, it seems using force will be the only route to Federalism in China. But for the regionalists in Tang's government, leaving Yunnan is unpopular after the last few failed military expeditions."

 YUN.introgame.006.t: "Tang Jiyao's Gambit"
 YUN.introgame.006.d: "As Sun Chuanfang's house of cards continues to fall in the five provinces, the other three in the League have undergone a similar wave of unrest. Liangguang, consisting of the province of Guangdong and Guangxi, is now in a full-scale civil war as the Old Guangxi Clique hegemony is challenged by Guangdong Warlords and Kuomintang invaders.\n\nFor Tang Jiyao, a great opportunity has presented itself - if only he could seize it. The Zhili are distracted, devouring one another as central authority once again collapses. Neighbouring warlord cliques in Sichuan and Liangguang are imploding, and Hunan is in no shape to contest his actions. Guizhou (or at least the western part of it) is ripe for the taking now, all he needs to do is eliminate the Kuomintang remnant holes up there - an ambition he has expressed to the commanders arriving in Kunming.\n\nTang's ambitions of course do not end in Guiyang. While his brand of federalism has taken an isolationist turn in the 1920s after the collapse of the broader movement, Tang is no stranger to using force to impose his will - having marched into Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guangdong across the early warlord era. The city of Guangzhou, the heart of the old southern governments, would be needed to truly assert legitimacy as a rival government in China. Though his previous attempt was foiled by the particularly staunch defence by armies in Guangxi, Tang is confident that this time his foes are weaker and his armies have learned their lessons.\n\nOf course, the Kuomintang junta in Guizhou have rather similar ideas. Unfortunately for them, the lack of unity between their leaders has been exposed, with Generals Cheng Qian of Hunan and Li Zongren of Guangxi already departing for their home provinces. While the junta has \"given their blessing\" for their adventures, it is obvious the Guizhou junta has little control over its members and that their leading generals can hardly stand one another. That leaves only two remaining to fight Tang's onslaught: General Zhu Peide of Yunnan and General He Yingqin of Guizhou."

 YUN.introgame.007.t: "The Exiles in Guizhou"
 YUN.introgame.007.d: "Encamped in Western Guizhou are the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army - the force established by the Kuomintang to fight and obey the party and the party alone. For some, Guizhou is a foreign land and an uneasy exile. For others, it is a return home. The reality of the NRA was that it was never truly the \"National\" army it was supposed to be, it was largely cobbled together from subjugated warlord armies with extensive regional loyalties that the NRA was supposed to be above.\n\nIn late January 1927, Chiang Kai-shek seized the opportunity to return to power and countermanded Wang Jingwei's orders by commanding his troops to retreat westwards to Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan to wait out the Zhili assault in a retreat that would be known as the \"Long March\". Assassinated a month later in Nanning, NRA units loyal to him were slowly pushed back into Guizhou across the next year.\n\nTaking his place was a junta chaired by Zhu Peide of the Third Army, made up of primarily Yunnanese soldiers. He was joined by Li Zongren (7th Army/Guangxi), Tan Yankai (2nd Army/Hunan), Cheng Qian (6th Army/Hunan), and He Yingqin (1st Army/Whampoa). Constant infighting prevented much progress in Guizhou, with the various commanders attempting to make forays into their home provinces with little success.\n\nTan Yankai left for Hunan years ago during a leadership reshuffle, and with Li and Cheng having marched the bulk of their forces into Guangxi and Hunan respectively, only Zhu Peide and He Yingqin remain. Zhu was \"neutral\" in the Gu Pinzhen-Tang Jiyao conflict, but effectively stuck in Guangdong after Tang's return to power in 1922. He would absorb the armies of various other exiled Yunnan forces there, turning him into a threat to Tang.\n\nHe Yingqin was Chiang's leading deputy and a Whampoa instructor, and his First Army is made up primarily of Whampoa graduates. The closest thing to the NRA ideal of a pan-Chinese army, it has grown dominated by Guizhou officers during the exile period."

 YUN.introgame.008.d: "A brutal combination of drought, flooding, and political instability have contributed to a major famine in the neighbouring province of Sichuan. As rice prices surge and the corrupt, ineffective government fails to provide significant relief, refugees from Sichuan have flooded into neighbouring provinces. Being a poorer, mountainous province relative to other destinations, Yunnan has received fewer refugees than others however news of the people's plight have made their way into Kunming.\n\nYunnan and Sichuan have had a complicated relationship throughout the Warlord Era. Sichuan has been divided into many competing warlord factions, in what has been described as a warlord era within a warlord era. During the National Protection War, Cai E invaded Sichuan in hopes of seizing its valuable salt fields, and ensuing conflicts between Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan continued throughout the next decade or so.\n\nPerhaps the last remnant of these conflicts are the forces of Xiong Kewu and Lu Chao camped in the borderlands between Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Former opponents of Tang Jiyao and not fully in the Kuomintang's sphere either, they act as a wild card of sorts in the looming conflict between Yunnan and Guizhou."

 YUN.introgame.009.t: "Securing the Southern Flank"
 YUN.introgame.009.d: "Tang Jiyao has made a trip to the southern city of Mengzi, where he has met with the southern generals headquartered there. The most prominent of the officers charged with \"guarding the border\" is Defence Commissioner Hu Ruoyu, one of the four original Defence Commissioners appointed by Tang to help oversee the province and the mastermind behind the February Coup d'etat against Tang in 1926. He, along with Generals (and former Defence Commissioners themselves) Li Xuanting and Zhang Ruji, were the most aggressive in seeking Tang's ouster, leaving a deeper enmity with Tang than the more reluctant conspirator Long Yun.\n\nGovernor Tang would not have made this trip if this \"Mengzi Faction\" did not have things to bring to the table. Though they lost considerable territory from their peak collectively controlling Kunming, Dali, and Mengzi, Mengzi is relatively rich from commerce with Indochina. Their friendly relationship with the Germans and the League has allowed them to maintain a larger army than they otherwise should have and access to foreign funds.\n\nTheir forces are not merely for show (or heading off efforts for Tang to control them). Southern Yunnan was also home to large bandit and insurgent bands (the difference often blurring depending on which side you are on) that rose and fell across the 1920s. Tang Jiyao's cooperation with some of these bands provided ammunition for his enemies against him, though the Kuomintang were also noted as attempting to recruit these bandits as well. Some of these men have managed to retire as \"respectable\", with Mo Pu managing to become a \"counselor of first rank\" after defecting to Tang's side and Wang Ruwei even remaining a brigade officer under Hu Ruoyu.\n\nIf Tang Jiyao's plot is to work, he will need the cooperation of southern forces, or at least for them to remain docile in the meanwhile. Otherwise, Kunming may be vulnerable to another plot while Tang's guard forces are in the north amassing against the Kuomintang."

 YUN.introgame.010.t: "Long Yun's Report"
 YUN.introgame.010.d: "When the assault on Guizhou was first planned, Tang Jiyao was forced to entrust the task of preparing the groundwork for the invasion to Defence Commissioner of Zhaotong Long Yun. This week, Governor Tang has come with a delegation to the northern city to personally inspect the progress being made there.\n\nLong Yun has been hard at work constructing depots, organising supplies, and positioning incoming units for an offensive against Guizhou. After four months, his headquarters at Zhaotong has been brimming with activity. In his conversation with Tang, General Long estimated that the basic preparations necessary for offensive operations have been completed.\n\nBut he also warns that the Kuomintang have not been idle on the other side of the border. Noticing the troop buildup, the National Revolutionary Army junta has begun to mobilise troops of their own, constructing defence-works and conscripting locals. Any element of surprise has long since been lost.\n\nThe relationship between the Governor and his best general has been strained as well, even if neither man brings it up. The root of this tension comes from the 1925 Yunnan-Guangxi War, where Long Yun's forces led a successful capture of Guangxi on the way to Guangdong. However, the Kuomintang-aligned New Guangxi Clique launched a decisive counterattack, encircling Long's forces in the city and ultimately forcing them to surrender. Tang Jiyu's forces, responsible for guarding Long's flank, arrived late to relieve the siege, some accused the younger Tang of being too busy purchasing opium in Guizhou, and even when they finally arrived they were utterly defeated.\n\nTang Jiyao's decision to protect his brother in the aftermath of the fiasco and scapegoat Zhang Ruji played a major part in the coup a year later. The two Tang have extensive ties to Guizhou and Tang Jiyu led the 1923 invasion and occupation of the province, leading him to expect to reprise that role. However, Long Yun seems to be under the impression that he would ultimately oversee the invasion."

 YUN.introgame.011.HNN_ruled_by_KMT: "Yunnan's relationship with Guizhou can hardly be considered a particularly friendly one. Embroiled in the Xinhai Revolution, Guizhou would swiftly become a battleground between the revolutionaries, counterrevolutionaries, constitutionalists and local warlords. With Liu Xianshi and Ren Kecheng sending an envoy to Cai E, Tang Jiyao would subsequently invade Guizhou on his behalf. Aided by Liu, Tang would coup the government, becoming the provincial Governor in 1912. Consolidating his power, Tang would return to Yunnan in 1913 to become Governor there, turning power over to Liu.\n\nThrust into the National Protection War, Liu would form his portion of the Guizhou Clique; the Old Xingyi Clique. Due to familial appointments, Wang Wenhua, nephew of Liu, his brother Wang Boqun, and his brother-in-law He Yingqin, would similarly arise to power; and thus begin scheming against Liu Xianshi in what was known as the Minjiu Incident in 1920. With the subsequent resignation of Xianshi, and further infighting, Wang Wenhua would be assassinated by men on Yuan Zuming's payroll under orders of Xianshi.\n\nExpelling Lu Dao from Guizhou, Yuan would then also be expelled by Tang Jiyu in 1923, engage in the Sichuan warlord melee, and align with the Zhili. Making peace with Tang in 1924, Yuan would become Governor again in 1925, yet continue to fight in the Sichuan Civil War, leaving much of the administrating to his subordinates: Wang Tianpei, Peng Hanzhang, and Zhou Xicheng. Ejected by Liu Xiang and Yang Sen in 1926, Yuan would be hosted by the Old Hunan Clique, fighting in the Northern Expedition.\n\nBy 1927, Guizhou would be split between a Kuomintang portion, under the Yunnan Clique's umbrella, and a Beiyang portion, supported by Beijing. With the KMT's recent deposition of Zhao Hengti and vanquishing of the Old Guizhou Clique, they have refused to hand-over their portion of Guizhou to He Yingqin, citing concerns from Wang Tianpei and Lu Dao. Thus, in a rather curious term of events, border disputes have led to NRA infighting along the Guizhou spheres of influence, which could prove useful in Yunnan's own struggles."

 YUN.introgame.012.t: "The Intellectuals Weigh In"
 YUN.introgame.012.d: "For the intelligentsia of Yunnan and Guizhou, opinions on the looming conflict are mixed. Both provinces have undergone a fracture between the \"Reformist\" factions and the \"Revolutionary\" factions, and both had those conflicts spill into violent conflict for control of their provinces. This mirrored the broader split in the southern republican movement, with revolutionary nationalists drifting into the Kuomintang camp and reformists tending towards Federalism or reorienting towards conciliation with Beiyang.\n\nThe intellectual elite were caught up in those battles, with many returning students and scholars joining Kuomintang and other socialist cells while others came in defence of a more reformist programme. While not as immediately powerful as the \"men of guns\", these \"men of letters\" were vital to the competing warlords and revolutionary leaders as a source of legitimacy for their governments. Moreover, when combined with their influence in the bureaucracy and to a lesser extent institutions like city and provincial chambers of commerce, civilians as a whole were an integral part to warlord systems.\n\nFor intellectuals seeking leaders with a consistent ideological worldview, the leaders of the southwest were surely disappointing. Both Federalists like Tang Jiyao and Kuomintang leaders like Sun Yat-sen oscillated between different political positions due to both pragmatism and also personally shifting positions. Indeed, much of the world has radically changed since the Great War, with new ideologies coming out of the ashes.\n\nThese men and their followers could be quite ruthless as the situation called for it: Tang notably mounted his fallen enemy Gu Pinzhen's severed head for public display when he returned to power and Sun Yat-sen responded once to having his bodyguard disbanded by personally ordering Mo Rongxi's headquarters shelled by gunboats.\n\nThe Kuomintang and the Yunnan clique can count on various loyalist newspapers, speakers, and writers for support, but with legitimacy so precious and rare in China - it will be up to men in the middle to tilt the scales."

For the Kuomintang, the coming of winter offers a significant advantage in defending their position from invasion, but even if they were to hold out from the initial onslaught, their window for unifying the south may also be closing. The junta's leadership have ordered further mobilisations, but the October rice harvest has meant militiamen on both sides have returned home and are only slowly trickling back to the front.\n\nTensions remain high, there appear to be little respite for the nervous troops on the front line.

Ordered by Chiang Kai-shek on the eve of his lamented assassination, it cost a significant amount of men, materiel, and supplies, but perhaps resulted in the preservation of the Right Kuomintang as a whole. Setting up a 5-man Junta under Zhu Peide of the 3rd Army as acting Generalissimo, it included He Yingqin of the 1st Army, Li Zongren of the 7th Army, Tan Yankai of the 2nd Army, and Cheng Qian of the 6th Army.\n\nWith power struggles and poor relations beforehand, the 1930s consolidation of forces within the Guizhou Kuomintang sphere of influence would see Tan Yankai's 2nd Army incorporated into Cheng Qian's 6th Army, with Tan himself departing to retire in Changsha.

Crucially however, a few key rear echelon units remain to facilitate connections between the Junta and the adventurous Machiavellian. With resources limited and their initial foothold secure, Huang Shaohong and Xuchu have raised the idea of pulling all remaining personnel from Guizhou into Guangxi to shore up his position in Liangguang.\n\nHowever doing so may doom the remaining Kuomintang forces in Guizhou in their battles with the hostile Yunnan Clique, and Guizhou junta leaders have pleaded Li to maintain the mutually beneficial supply lines between their forces.

It is an open secret that generals like Zhu De have been involved in these covert negotiations, though he insists his loyalty remains with his blood brother Zhu Peide.\n\nHe has informed the latter that his work has borne fruit: the MinGan leadership have formally ordered all party cadres to obey the orders of the junta in their coming struggle with Tang Jiyao. While a generous overture on the surface, it implicitly suggests that the Guizhou government is still subject to the leftist Central Committee, perpetuating a fantasy that the party is still united. Still, there seems little to lose at this point: should Guizhou fall, leftists and rightists alike will be destroyed."
 YUN.introgame.066.a: "Despite their differences, the Left and Right must unite against Tang."
 YUN.introgame.066.b: "These traitorous communications must be investigated!"

 YUN.introgame.070.t: "German Interests in the Dian-Qian Showdown"
 YUN.introgame.070.d: "The German Colonial Project in Southeast Asia has largely inherited the mantle of that of the prior French investments, and the affairs within the Sinosphere are no different. Closely tied to the political developments within Yunnan Province and Guangxi Province, the once French and now German Vietnamese colonial administrations have found themselves with their hands full. With impending colonial unrest, and dangerous developments within the Shandong Peninsula, and within the League Territories, many of their Chinese holdings are seemingly under fret.\n\nHowever, on the immediate border, the German interests within Yunnan prove viable to preserve. Having backed Tang Jiyao tepidly in maintaining his foothold in the Southwest, the self-proclaimed \"King of the Southwest\" now finds himself squaring off against the Guizhou Kuomintang remnants in a bloody showdown for the Southwestern provinces. While that does not immediately concern us, intermediaries with Mengzi Garrison Commander Hu Ruoyu has requested additional arms to help patrol against \"bandits\" who have been a menace for tin traders in the region. In addition to more traditional thieves (the sort that has in fact been active in southern Yunnan in the past), the phrase often is used as a euphenism for socialist insurgents, no doubt emboldened by Kuomintang activities in the north and likely in contact with Indochinese revolutionaries in our colonies.\n\nAiding General Hu, would provide some immediate security for our direct interests, and will likely free up Governor Tang's forces to handle his issues in deeper in-land. Whilst Tang and Hu are far from the most reliable, the revolutionaries of the Kuomintang are both more outwardly hostile, and insatiable. Combined they would threaten German Financial interests heavily."
 YUN.introgame.070.a: "Offer additional funding to Hu Ruoyu."
 YUN.introgame.070.b: "We can hardly worry about Yunnan at the moment."

 YUN.introgame.071.t: "Assistance from Singapore"
 YUN.introgame.071.d: "Inheriting French influence over Yunnan following the end of the Great War, Singapore has noticed with concern the mounting tensions in Yunnan as Kunming and Guiyang prepare for a final struggle to determine the fate of the Chinese Southwest. While Tang Jiyao has largely operated with German backing, Singapore has opted to support Tang indirectly, for fear of strengthening the \"King of Yunnan\" too much. No, instead Germany has sent additional arms to General Hu Ruoyu, who recently requested aid to suppress \"bandits\" who have been harassing the Yunnan tin trade.\n\nA bolstered Mengzi Clique does allow Tang to divert more of his forces towards the invasion of Guizhou rather than patrol for bandits, but the Governor wouldn't trust General Hu as far as he could throw him. Indeed, General Hu plotted in 1927 to remove Tang from the governorship, which nearly succeeded. While Hu appears to have acquiesced to Tang Jiyao's continued rule of Yunnan, the Federalist General knows that Hu is waiting to pounce at any sign of weakness.\n\nGovernor Tang Jiyao finds himself pressed into a corner. While his ambitions for China start with the reincorporation of Guizhou into the Federalist fold, he also cannot allow upstart generals without his own camp to bring down the delicate house of cards he has struggled to keep afloat for two decades. While publicly thanking Berlin for assisting his government in suppressing banditry, privately he bemoans their so-called support as he muses over a difficult decision."
 YUN.introgame.071.a: "This will free us to deploy more troops to the north."
 YUN.introgame.071.b: "We will need to keep an extra eye on General Hu now."

 YUN.introgame.080.t: "Failure in the Dian-Qian Struggle"
 YUN.introgame.080.d: "Despite considerable investment in the Dian-Qian conflict on behalf of the Guizhou junta, it would appear that our gamble within the Dian-Qian power struggle has ultimately been for naught. Dashed either by prepared ambush, stolen by bandits, or mutual mistrust, our money and supplies have hardly found themselves in their intended hands. With our efforts rebuked, it will take considerable time to regroup, and ultimately many within the administration have waned over passion for involvement within the Dian-Qian showdown, at least for the near future."
 YUN.introgame.080.a: "They will have to struggle on their own."

 YUN.introgame.081.t: "Failure in the Dian-Qian Struggle"
 YUN.introgame.081.d: "Despite considerable investment in the Dian-Qian conflict on behalf of the Yunnan Clique, it would appear that our gamble within the Dian-Qian power struggle has ultimately been for naught. Dashed either by prepared ambush, stolen by bandits, or lost to corruption, our money and supplies have hardly found themselves in their intended hands. With our efforts rebuked, it will take considerable time to regroup, and ultimately many within the administration have waned over passion for involvement within the Dian-Qian showdown, at least for the near future."

 YUN.introgame.100.t: "The Late-Autumn Offensive"
 YUN.introgame.100.d: "The sand has run through the hourglass and the die is now cast. Tang Jiyao, impatient about the progress of his army's preparations against what should be a much weaker Guizhou, has ordered them forward. Fighting has broken out across the frontline as Yunnan Army probing attacks surge forward to meet National Revolutionary Army outposts.\n\nThe fog of war has confounded both high commands. The meticulously crafted war plans, inked onto maps with attention to the most minute details, have fallen apart as soldiers trade fire and schemes and counterschemes are unveiled. As battles rage on the frontline and behind it, individual bands of soldiers (loyal more to each other and their commanders than their ostensible masters) are forced to make business decisions for themselves: which side will be more likely to survive and pay us?\n\nThe fate of the southwest is being decided in these coming days, though for now the outcome remains unclear. What is obvious however is that the numerous delays and the unbreakable stalemate have led to a bloody battle: a devastating outcome for both sides who should be husbanding their elite divisions. Whoever the winner may be, the situation looks grim."
 YUN.introgame.100.a: "Come what may, we shall prevail."

 YUN.introgame.101.t: "The Yunnan Army Overruns Guizhou"
 YUN.introgame.101.d: "After a hard fought offensive, Yunnanese preparation and Kunming Military Academy discipline paid off. The advantage began to turn, first slowly and then extremely quickly as the forward positions of the National Revolutionary Army were overcome and the Kuomintang's retreat quickly became a rout.\n\nBy the time the Yunnan Army reached the rear echelons, the battle for Guizhou was effectively over. Most Kuomintang militias either surrendered, defected, or melted away into the countryside - returning to their homes never to come back again. A fanatical last stand by Kuomintang regulars in Guiyang was planned but with their troops in complete disarray and quickly surrounded, the writing was on the wall.\n\nThe Kuomintang junta's leadership similarly either fled into exile or went underground, hopes of a Kuomintang resurgence in the southwest have been permanently dashed. Tang Jiyao is now the undisputed master of the region, but many issues remain unresolved."
 YUN.introgame.101.a: "Let us begin the next phase of unification!"

 YUN.introgame.102.t: "The Zhaotong Incident"
 YUN.introgame.102.d: "In a sudden twist of fate, the National Revolutionary Army gained initiative, something they used to their fullest advantage. With well-drilled precision, nationalist fervor and tenacity worthy of the party-state, Kuomintang units had lured the Yunnan Army into a false sense of security before launching a brutal counteroffensive.\n\nThe National Revolutionary Army's elite units punctured Yunnanese weak-points, taking advantage of reports from well positioned spies and courageous scouts. Sabotage by infiltrators and major defections across the line wreaked havoc in the Yunnan Army's rear, and soon enough their best units were encircled.\n\nAs panicked reports reached Kunming, Tang Jiyao personally rushed to Zhaotong to take command of the situation. But when he arrived at the Yunnan Army's headquarters, his bodyguard unit was ambushed by Long Yun's men and disarmed - a major betrayal. By the end of the day, a Kuomintang delegation was in Kunming to accept their surrender as Hu Ruoyu sent a telegram from Mengzi recognising the new government."
 YUN.introgame.102.a: "We will arrive in Kunming shortly."

 YUN.earlygame.000.t: "Legacy of Export Militarism"
 YUN.earlygame.000.d: "The state of the Yunnan army is one of decay, reflective of the deteriorating quality of the men's morality and armaments. The seldom transports of archaic rifles from the Chengdu Arsenal that had come from Luo Peijin's Sichuan administration have long since ceased, along with the few that have come from Japan via China's Southern ports. The artillery likewise has worsened in quality with many Krupp mountain guns of the Jingguojun having been discarded or damaged, their crews chronically inexperienced due to the sheer lack of both live shells and blanks needed for training.\n\nAs such, parades and vain shows of strength have been preferred over actual field combat and drills, failing to impact the effectiveness of recruits to any meaningful degree. The cavalry detachments of the Yunnan army, an already neglected force owing to the mountainous terrain of the Yungui plateau have been inadequately trained and disciplined, with horses stirring and often routing at the slightest confrontation. This severe lack of either trained horses or vehicles also means that transportation units, often critical for combat cohesion in the Southwest, remain non-existent.\n\nDespite this, Kunming still maintains its reputation of strength and stern discipline - that of elite training, daring to face superior opponents and triumph despite the odds, no doubt fostered by the legacy of the Kunming military academy. This is, however, counteracted by the absence of this spirit in higher command, primarily among Tang Jiyao's clique and his brother, Tang Jiyu. The Jingguojun's rank and file are also mixed in quality, with experienced soldiers being easy to lead but often lacking intelligence and initiative while green recruits remain unruly, untrained and unmotivated. The time for reform of the once great Yunnan Army is of the utmost importance, torn to shreds by export militarism and infighting, it can only be hoped that its prestige can be returned to once more."
 YUN.earlygame.000.a: "We have a long road ahead of us."

 YUN.earlygame.001.t_kmt: "Reviving Whampoa"
 YUN.earlygame.001.t_nokmt: "Expanding Kunming"
 YUN.earlygame.001.intro: "Crucial to the formation of our new army is that of the position of the Kunming Military Academy. Integral to the successes of the Huguojun of the past was the dedication, brotherhood, and selflessness promoted here. With the likes of Cai E, Yang Jie, He Yingqin, Li Genyuan, Li Liejun, Tang Jiyao, and numerous other great revolutionary fighters having served in the faculty of the institution, it carries a deep legacy, having contributed greatly both to the Federalist and Kuomintang revolutionary movements.\n\nWith the intent on creating a warrior class as loyal to the institutions of China and Republicanism as the Japanese are loyal to their Emperor, the curriculum of Kunming is heavily inspired by the Shikan Gakko in Japan — in part due to a lot of the early faculty being graduates. Ran under the principle of unity in management and teaching, the academy is as bureaucratic as it is devoted. Total personnel are small but elite, yet staff and students alike are encouraged to directly inquire to the Principal about any issues. Alas however, the institution of today is not that of the past, and to bring new life to the famed academy, a new principal is required to steer the ship and restore the soul it once had.\n\n"
 YUN.earlygame.001.d_kmtsatellite: "$YUN.earlygame.001.intro$To the authorities at the behest of [ROOT.GetLeader], there lies three options for such an influential position. First and foremost is that of the \"Founding Father\", Li Genyuan, who would oversee a proper and authentic return to the principles of the original academy that are so derided in the current era. Second is that of the capable Zhu De. Considered a prodigy by most, and one of many protégés of Cai E, Zhu De has undergone tenure at the academy, and has done extensive military theorising of his own in the years since. However he is the archon of leftist sympathies within Yunnan, and may provoke more conservative elements. A final option to acquiesce such aforementioned figures is that of Hu Ruoyu. Previously a principal of the academy under Tang Jiyao, Hu Ruoyu similarly was a student at the academy, and has strong connections with the establishment."
 YUN.earlygame.001.d_kmt: "$YUN.earlygame.001.intro$An immediate option is the selection of He Yingqin, owing to his previous experience running his Guizhou Army School with Wang Wenhua, his later position as Dean of Academic Affairs in Kunming, and his most pivotal position as deputy chief instructor of Whampoa. A second candidate pushed by the CC Clique is that of the retired Wang Boling. Principal of Whampoa in 1925, Wang would retire following the failure of the Northern Expedition due to a poor military track record, however due to pressure from Chen Guofu, he has thrown his hat into the ring — much to He Yingqin's spite. A final option pushed for by the Political Science Clique is that of the \"Founding Father\" of the Academy, Li Genyuan. An old commander from Cai E's generation, Li Genyuan is devout in his loyalty to revolutionary ideals and warrior spirit, albeit his political convictions see him viewed with much estrangement by the young guard."
 YUN.earlygame.001.d_fed: "$YUN.earlygame.001.intro$\n\nAccordingly, three potential candidates for the most influential position in the military culture have been drafted. Aware that such a position would effectively result in dual loyalties to both the principal and [ROOT.GetLeader], a most appealing option is that of re-instating Tang Jiyu. Politically malleable, unambitious and reliant on his brother, he would make an excellent extension of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s influence. In regards to the other two candidates, whilst estranged from their old friend and master, Hu Ruoyu and Long Yun are both capable men in political and military affairs, and with previous tenure as principal of the academy, would serve dutifully. Albeit their opinion of [ROOT.GetLeader] leaves much to be desired."
 YUN.earlygame.001.d_npa: "$YUN.earlygame.001.intro$\n\nAccordingly, two potential candidates for the most influential position in the military culture have been drafted. Aware that such a position would effectively result in dual loyalties to both the Governor and principal, the two options are that of the two most influential men in Yunnan. Hu Ruoyu and Long Yun. Both men have their merits, as both enrolled in the academy and later both became principal during Tang Jiyao's tenure. However their true strength relies in their unique qualities, with Hu Ruoyu having connections all across the political spectrum, whilst Long Yun is a notoriously reliable soldier and commander."
 YUN.earlygame.001.a: "He Yingqin has the skills."
 YUN.earlygame.001.b: "Wang Boling, his time is not over yet!"

 YUN.earlygame.001.h: "Tang Jiyu, for continuity."
 YUN.earlygame.001.i: "Keep our current Principal."

 YUN.earlygame.002.t: "Yunnan's Heart and Soul"
 YUN.earlygame.002.d: "In the core of it all, Kunming was founded under the principles of being the last bastion of true Chinese that would endeavour to save the spirit of China. With complete adherence to militarism as the only method in which they could do so, Kunming was one of the first military academies in the nation to integrate military skills into the broader educational curriculum. Through said education and the promotion of universal conscription, they had hoped that they could foster a battlefield spirit within the Yunnanese, one that would triumph even the greatest challenges facing the nation.\n\nThe curriculum in specific was different from the likes of Baoding, as it emphasised military preparation, physical fitness, and field experience. Most instructors were from Yunnan proper, with a token inclusion of Japanese instructors from the Shikan Gakko — where most of the Yunnan instructors graduated. The students are split into three classes, A for existing active-duty officers of the rank major or below, B for provisional defence force officers, and C for aspiring officers recruited from civilian or military schooling. Subjects include Chinese literature, ethics, mechanical drawing, infantry drill, battle discipline and others.\n\nWith the new era of the academy, a conversation has stirred amongst the military staff about the influence of the revolutionary Whampoa Academy in the new Kunming. For the party-state's curriculum saw an even further focus on the martial spirit of the soldier, and of their absolute duty to the revolution and nation. Yet critiques, proponents of the old ways, raise concerns that such integration of Whampoa's teachings would dilute the strength and character of Kunming, and that it is better to merely stay the course."
 YUN.earlygame.002.a: "Amongst all academies, Whampoa is a glistening diamond."
 YUN.earlygame.002.b: "Was this not the same curriculum that won National Protection?"

 YUN.earlygame.003.t: "Beloved Invaders"
 YUN.earlygame.003.d: "Over the years, armies of Yunnan have painstakingly built up an orderly impression among the provincial population, with high morale, good discipline and mannered interactions with civilians setting them apart from the brutish image of the Northern armies. This has been done through a code of conduct between the Yunnan Army and the populace, enforced by the army's officers, mainly surrounding the treatment of civilians, common mannerisms and hygiene.\n\nIn contrast to typical soldiers of the warlord era who are given a free hand off-duty, recruits of the Yunnan army are implored to act respectfully and with restraint, resulting in such values separating them from even regional rivals to the North and East. All ranks of military command condone moral vices that typically plague warlord armies, such as opium smoking, prostitution as well as excessive gambling and drinking.\n\nSuch a regimen in terms of behaviour throughout service has ensured an acceptable standard of moral discipline within the Yunnan Army's ranks, albeit one that has varied in regards to the degree of punishment should these rules not be followed as well as how harshly the policies are enforced.\n\nWith the need for reform of the Jingguojun back on the agenda, a debate has quickly risen within the military structure regarding how integral these regulations are, with many claiming that they detract from the already varied role of officers within the army. Contrary to this, advocates for military professionalism have continued to push for the legacy of the Yunnan Army as one that remains dedicated to the nation, the people, and their cause."
 YUN.earlygame.003.a: "The Yunnan Army's reputation must be preserved!"
 YUN.earlygame.003.b: "These bureaucratic rules detract from the important role an officer plays."

 YUN.earlygame.004.t: "Soul of the Rapid Offensive"
 YUN.earlygame.004.d: "In the formulation of an effective war-winning strategy, commanders have to integrate both the strategic theory they had been taught within the academies with the military, political and economic realities of China. From the first decade of the Republic, two patterns of warfare began to emerge: one for those wars fought in the interior, and another for those fought on the coastline. The two styles differed due to geography, logistics, modern armaments, and communications. Although in general, the common strategic objective of both strategies was the capture of key communication hubs, such as towns and cities that controlled key rivers, mountain passes, and railroad or road networks.\n\nIn contrast to the interior, Eastern China is blessed with more sufficient infrastructure yielding to better communication networks and railways. Such networks enabled efficient mobilisation and transport of troops and equipment. Thus developed the crucial status of those networks into contested military objectives, also determining the size and location of battlefields. Wars there became far more intense, and with the better acquisition of modern arms, turned them into slaughters.\n\nHowever the interior lacked utterly in both railroad and roads, with Yunnan possessing 267 miles of road compared to Guangdong's 2440. Therefore, a strategy for the interior's wars was the shared priority of communication hubs, however armies had to utilise rivers for transport, alongside the splitting of their armies into small detachments, little heavy equipment, restricted reconnaissance and difficulties in coordination.\n\nWith such restrictions, decisive, aggressive actions have been the preference for two decades, yet with the slow industrialisation of the interior, it has proved to become increasingly negligible in turning the tide of battle, with its risks potentially capsizing entire regimes, as what nearly happened to Tang Jiyao in 1926."
 YUN.earlygame.004.a: "Decisive action wins Wars!"
 YUN.earlygame.004.b: "The Northern Expedition proved the folly of pure aggression."

 YUN.earlygame.005.t: "Spirit of the Military"
 YUN.earlygame.005.d: "In bestowing revolutionary republicanism and a warrior spirit within the students of the Kunming Academy, the original founders endeavoured for the establishment of a professional soldier caste, best fit to decide the future of the Chinese nation. To this end, the new Kunming has once again enacted strict discipline amongst all of its students, rebuking them for selfish and individualistic habits such as consorts, gambling, drugs, and jealousy of their commanders. The Principal has emphasised the \"bushido\" repeatedly, and the value of spiritual education in developing a special school elan bond as seen in Whampoa.\n\nThe very notion of this military spirit functions as the pinnacle of Chinese military professionalism. For only the professional, militarised, and nationalist soldier could decipher the direction of the nation-state, for it was his special responsibility. With a superior competence in all matters of the nation state, it is no surprise that the new Huguojun aspires to maintain a certain level of superior spirit amongst its soldiers.\n\nHowever more civilian minded officials decry the placing of military men on a pedestal. For such actions led to the direct state in which China currently resides. Suffocated by military strongmen. But others raise a counterpoint, as whilst agreeing that China is full of military men steering its direction, most do not have the spirit nor knowledge to be statesmen at the same time. And so the pursuit of spiritual education for the Kunming students is merely a corrective action."
 YUN.earlygame.005.a: "Only the military know what is right!"
 YUN.earlygame.005.b: "This very notion enabled the warlords!"

 YUN.earlygame.006.t: "Previous Generations of Yunnan Cadets"
 YUN.earlygame.006.intro: "Promulgated under Tang Jiyao's initiatives on December 25th, 1922, the first erm of the Yunnan Aviation School officially opened with thirty students, who were all organised into an aviation recruit team, and trained together with the 17th class of recruits from the Kunming Military Academy. In April 1923, Tang Jiyao would later approve the admission of four Korean students to the class, Li Yingmao, Zhang Zhiri, Li Chun, and the first female pilot, Quan Jiyu, otherwise known as Kwon Ki-ok.\n\nMaintaining a two year curriculum, the Yunnan Aviation School featured six months of military training, following by one and a half years of aviation training. From 1922 to 1935, the Yunnan Aviation School opened four flight classes, and two mechanic classes, with 142 people graduating from the flight department (including 13 female pilots), and 100 from the mechanic department.\n\nWith 30 graduates from the Fourth class in 1935, a new class for a new era of the school has been drafted, seeing extensive recruitment from both inside and outside Yunnan. Alongside this, the staff of the revitalised school has sent out recruitment letters to old students and faculty alike, to moderate reception."
 YUN.earlygame.006.d_kmt: "$YUN.earlygame.006.intro$\n\nMost crucially for the Kuomintang however, is the endeavouring spirits of two daredevil pilot trainees with important familial backgrounds. With the enlistment of Chen Xianfu, son of Chen Qimei, and that of Dai Anguo, son of Dai Jitao. Hoping to do their part for the success of the national revolution, their enlistment shows the true dedication of their families to the National Revolution."
 YUN.earlygame.006.d_nokmt: "$YUN.earlygame.006.intro$\n\nWith the fifth class of the school officially enrolled, many within the high command are hoping that Yunnan will be the hotbed for China's fledgling aviation talents, to rival that of Baoding."
 YUN.earlygame.006.a: "May these brave pilots soar high!"

 YUN.earlygame.007.t: "The Marked history of Wujiaba"
 YUN.earlygame.007.d: "Wujiaba, located four kilometres south-east of Kunming, is situated on the bank of the Dianchi Lake. Originally a wasteland, overgrown with weeds for thousands of years, the area did not even feature a place name. Later several families with the surname Wu would travel to the area, reclaiming it and settling there, with the village that developed gaining the moniker \"Wujia Village\". Due to Yunnan's mountainous nature, the people are used to calling flat land surrounded by mountains \"bazi\", and therefore the flat land where Wujia Village was located was referred to as \"Wujiaba\" by the old Kunming peoples.\n\nTravelling to the modern era, under the Qing the flat land of Wujiaba outside of Kunming was raised by the Relief Bureau to build artillery barracks, and Wujiaba was transformed into a large training ground with 1,137 barracks. During the Xinhai revolution, Cai E and Li Genyuan led the revolutionary army in Yunnan to launch the \"Double Ninth Uprising\" in the Wujiaba barracks, overthrowing the Qing regime in Yunnan. Wujiaba would then become the base camp of the revolutionary army.\n\nForcing the villagers around Wujiaba to move away in 1922, Tang Jiyao would convert the barracks into an airport, buying 30 old fighters and 15 old trainer planes from the German Air Force in Vietnam, officially establishing the Yunnan Air Force. At that time, Wujiaba Airport was the earliest aviation training airport in the Asian mainland, training a large number of flying talents spanning multiple nations.\n\nEven comparatively to regimes ran by fellow endeavouring warlords such as those by Yan Xishan and Lu Rongting, the Yunnan Aviation Programme saw remarkable success, rivalling that of the Central Government's own programme."
 YUN.earlygame.007.a: "The true birthplace of China's airforce!"

 YUN.earlygame.008.t: "The Dubious Navy of Kunming Academy"
 YUN.earlygame.008.d: "With our freshly achieved coastline, the exiled naval commanders residing within Yunnan have finally been able to see their time in the limelight. Coalescing around Admiral Ouyang Ge, he has sought to establish his own naval academy, ostensibly a wing of the Kunming Military Academy, that he has dubbed \"The Lightning School\". Not under the jurisdiction of any independent naval department, the school is directly under control of Kunming Academy, and therefore has been referred to as the \"Kunming Military Academy in the Navy\", which is further enabled by the majority of personnel having been students at the institution.\n\nWith graduates referred to as the \"Lightning and Thunder\" department, the new clique has flung itself into the state of Chinese naval cliques all across the nation. Despised as newcomers that do not belong on their territory, the Guangdong naval clique has rallied in opposition, not recognising Ouyang Ge's own rank in the navy, or that of graduates from the Lightning School, effectively sequestering them to commands within Yunnan's own influence.\n\nEven further, the Fujian clique has attempted to obstruct the possibility of \"Lightning and Thunder\" graduates from wearing naval uniforms, reportedly harassing individuals that do so."

 YUN.earlygame.008.b: "This is encroachment on the true seafarers!"

 YUN.earlygame.009.t: "Yunnanese Affairs in the Colonial Administration"
 YUN.earlygame.009.d: "Reports have flooded in from border guards across the Yunnan-Indochina border, and those who travel the Kunming-Hanoi railway, of a series of mysterious shipments leaving Yunnan's provincial borders, and disappearing within the Indochinese miasma. Perhaps these reported shipments are being supplied by [YUN.GetLeader] to colonial resistance under the auspices of ejecting our administration from his immediate borders, ultimately losing our monopoly on the resources of the province.\n\nHowever there is also the possibility that such occurrences are merely the incompetence of Yunnanese officials to properly demarcate where their trade goods are ending up. Nonetheless, many officials have advised [ROOT.GetLeader] that it would perhaps be viable to completely shut off all trade between the colonies and Yunnan, as it would potentially sink the fragile Yunnanese economy, and cease the shipments.\n\nOthers however, advise that such action may inflame tensions even further, and that whether the Yunnanese support the INC or not does not matter, for the Indochinese National Congress will never be able to beat the Kriegsmarine on the battlefield."
 YUN.earlygame.009.a: "Such insolence! Enact an embargo!"
 YUN.earlygame.009.b: "We have little time to further rile up [YUN.GetLeader]."

 YUN.earlygame.040.t: "Russian Military Advisors"
 YUN.earlygame.040.d: "In our bid to modernise our army, we have successfully lobbied the Russian government to send us military advisors to aid us in creating a force structured along Russian lines. Their experience in the Russian Civil War has led them to develop the concept of \"Deep Battle\", which we hope they can pass onto us.\n\nIndeed, the old Whampoa began with the help of Red Russian exiles, and though these new advisors are former White Army officers their belief in a patriotic breed of soldier and an inspiring officer class that will fight to the bitter end is quite familiar to us.\n\nIlluminating a new bright partnership between those within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government is Pyotr von Glazenap, a veteran of Kornilov's shock regiments. Apolitical and keen to focus on military matters, he has had major involvement and experience with the latest reforms of the Russian army as a member of Kornilov and Denikin's staff. Having extensive knowledge of how to organise an army from nothing, he will prove an invaluable asset.\n\nAccompanying Pyotr is Georgy Elvengren, close to both Kornilov and Savinkov. He serves a role akin to a diplomat-soldier, stressing the importance of ideology in an elite army and utilising his considerable experience in organising insurgent guerilla operations against a numerically superior foe. Vsevolod Ivanov meanwhile is a competent cavalry officer with a total war mindset, stressing the importance of mass propaganda and is experienced in fighting within regions of poor infrastructure.\n\nWhilst largely apolitical in Chinese matters, all have begun to integrate themselves efficiently into the structure of Kunming and their mission serves to further bolster our military direction and potentially open a new partnership on the world stage. They have brought with them many useful ideas for the direction of our military."
 YUN.earlygame.040.a: "Honing in on strategy, we triumph!"
 YUN.earlygame.040.b: "An elite army paves the way to victory!"
 YUN.earlygame.040.c: "Only through total mobilisation can we win!"

###- KMT Unique Military Events-###

 YUN.earlygame.050.t: "The Extent of Politics within the Army"
 YUN.earlygame.050.d: "Owing its successes primarily due to its traditional bureaucratic organisation independent of political influence, the Yunnan Army of the past maintained a form of \"apolitical\" militarism. Whilst indeed maintaining a clear overall view on the strategic and political goals of their campaigns, they nonetheless ran their operations like a well-oiled machine. With the rise of the party-state army, the merits of the integration of politics into the soldiery and the fanaticism produced by revolutionary loyalty are strikingly apparent. With the increasing encroachment of politics into the military, the civilian cliques of the party have tried their hand at extending their influence into the military command structure.\n\nThe first candidate asking for a commission, with the backing of Political Science, is that of its very own face, Zhang Qun. With experience as a classmate and staff officer of Chiang Kai-shek, he relatively recently transitioned to civilian affairs. However with such a time of crisis, he has requested once again to serve in the battlefield.\n\nThe second candidate pushed is that of the CC Clique's very own Chen Guofu. Similarly seeing service in Xinhai, Chen Guofu would sequester himself to pseudo-military roles there onwards, working in recruitment for Whampoa. The ever industrial machinations of the CC clique remain a mystery, but such an appointment would extensively spread their influence into their one unconquered facet of the party, the army.\n\nFinally, there is the peculiar case of the Blue Shirt Society. Already firmly integrated into military affairs, they have requested the appointment of Liu Jianqun into a military capacity. Their main ideological theorist, Liu has seen little to none actual military service, having mostly served in staff or political roles, such as Confidential Secretary to He Yingqin.\n\nWhatever the case, their appointments receive extensive pushback from the likes of Gu Zhutong and Wei Lihuang, NRA stalwarts who deride the interference of slimy politicians in the art of war."

 YUN.earlygame.051.t: "Blood of Martyrs"
 YUN.earlygame.051.d: "The legacy of the revolutionary struggle in China is a long and arduous one, however it remains emblematic of the sheer determination of the nation's patriots to fight for its salvation. From the precursor revolts before Xinhai, to 1911 itself, to the Constitutional Protection Movement, to the National Protection War, to the Northern Expedition. China's revolutionary martyrs are innumerous, uncountable. The very cause is built upon a mountain of their corpses. Yet fully acknowledging this fact, our brave soldiers continue to sacrifice their hopes, their dreams, everything they thought had meaning, all for the revolutionary cause.\n\nThis is not any more evident than in the memory of the fallen, and in particular, the memory of the young Ca Guanzhu. Perishing in 1925, he had written a letter addressed to his brother, the day before giving his life to the National Revolution.\n\n\"Dear Brother. I will probably not return alive from battle tomorrow. I will never forget how our mother fed and raised me, how you loved me, and my friends helped me. Today, however, my duty is to promote the Three Principles, for the good of all of China rather than loyalty to family and friends. As I ponder the many heroes who have given their lives in the past, I feel very ashamed. Tomorrow, therefore, I will devote my entire energy, sacrifice my life, to the cause of the Three Principles.\"\n\nA true fighter to the very end, stories akin to Ca Guanzhu's flow through the very spirit of the National Revolutionary Army, although some within the party continue to hesitate at the full release of the people's ferocity, fearing the personification of a death cult of futility."

 YUN.earlygame.051.b: "A great soul, but refrain from idolisation."

 YUN.earlygame.052.t: "In the Shadow of the NRA"
 YUN.earlygame.052.d: "The roots of the National Revolutionary Army lie in its origins as a force born from desperation. Unable to control his \"allies\" in the Yunnan Army of Guangdong, Dr. Sun Yat-sen sought the establishment of a truly loyal army, one dedicated not to perfidious local leaders but towards the party and revolution. With the establishment of Whampoa, the National Revolutionary Army was a small force, with shortages in equipment and manpower. It became increasingly reliant on decisive, mobile campaigns that aimed to avoid confronting more than 1 opposing army at a time, outlined in the doctrine of \"Suzhan, Sujue\" — Quick Battle, Quick Resolution.\n\nBattle tactics of the NRA involved an emphasis on the army's manoeuvrability, organisation, cohesion and adaptability, with elements of surprise proving pivotal for Generalissimo Chiang's armies in the early stages of the Northern Expedition in Hunan and Jiangxi. For the longer a battle occurred, the more precious resources would be expended.\n\nDespite this, calls for the adoption of such military doctrines have faced resistance and opposition among the Yunnan army's high command, with many citing the very failure of the Northern Expedition and the Wuhan Debacle as a testament to the shortcomings of such risky strategies. This is compounded by the fact that the mobile warfare tactics of the NRA remain untested in the mountains and valleys of Yunnan, with the province's large and under-trained army leaving little chance of doctrinal success. However, younger military innovators and theorists remain adamant that a combination of new training initiatives, ideological indoctrination and the promotion of officer decisevness may be just what the provincial army needs to thrive in a new age of mobile war. For whomever dares, wins."

 YUN.earlygame.052.b: "The Huguojun won with coordination."

 YUN.earlygame.053.t: "Anniversary of Mianhu"
 YUN.earlygame.053.d: "One of the most important battles of the early National Revolutionary Army, the Battle of Mianhu is heralded as the foundational event of the Whampoa spirit within the army. Taking place in February of 1925, in the First Eastern Expedition to eject Chen Jiongming from Guangdong, the forces mustered by the Kuomintang was that of the Gui Army under Liu Zhenhuan, the Yunnan Army in Guangdong under Yang Ximin, the fresh teaching regiments of Whampoa under He Yingqin and Wang Boling, alongside the Guangdong Army under Xu Chongzhi.\n\nQuickly capturing swathes of territory, defeating Hong Zhaolin, the Yunnan Army and Gui Army ultimately held back their forces, causing the Whampoa regiments to face more than 20,000 elite troops with little more than 3000. Triumphing magnificently against Lin Hu's soldiers, the heavy casualties and tenacity seen here served to further bolster the morale of the new NRA, and the teaching regiments would form the basis of the NRA 1st Army.\n\nHe Yingqin has recently held a rally for veterans of the battle, stressing the importance of the victory but also the manner in which they achieved it. Viewing it as the key to the revolution, he reportedly rallied for the revival of the \"Whampoa Spirit\". Gu Zhutong joined his superior, stating that the spirit of self-sacrifice served as the critical factor which decided the victory in the Eastern Expedition, and the future successes of the NRA.\n\nNonetheless, in spite of the veterans, the likes of Jin Handing and Fan Shisheng — members of the Yunnan Army in Guangdong, alongside the civilian cliques have downplayed its importance, chastising the likes of Qian Dajun, He and Gu for their idolisation of a spirit that lost them the Northern Expedition."

 YUN.earlygame.053.b: "Yet Whampoa spirit could not save the Northern Expedition."

 YUN.earlygame.054.t: "An Overall Strategic View of Chinese Armies"
 YUN.earlygame.054.d: "In terms of the military thought process for the Yunnan Army, three titans have emerged as progenitors of its strategy. The first, was Li Genyuan, founding principal of Kunming Military Academy, Li would be the driving force behind the Yunnan Army's bureaucratic selfless militarism. Second, was Cai E. A name that is titanic in of itself, Cai would lead Yunnan in its most pivotal moments, crushing the armies of Yuan Shikai, Sichuan, and any others who dared to face the Huguojun. Lastly, there was Tang Jiyao. Whilst most would decry him as an incompetent buffoon, there was merit in his best attempts to preserve the soul and merit of his Jingguojun, however its fate was already sealed.\n\nThe second of that trio, Cai E, was perhaps one of China's greatest military tacticians and strategists of the modern era. An accomplished studier of military history and strategy, Cai was the progenitor of the Chinese variation of the \"luring the enemy in deep\" strategy, valuing the experience of the Boers against the British, and the Russians against Napoleon. China maintained a lot of land, he posited, and therefore one can sacrifice said land whilst waging a continuous harassment campaign, ultimately striking back when the time is right.\n\nHowever various military men in the establishment — such as the Whampoa hardliners of He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong and Teng Jie — disagree with such a notion, as the modern China should have the capacity no matter the situation to be able to fight toe-to-toe with any foreign imperialist power."
 YUN.earlygame.054.a: "Cai E is right, let the vastness of China engulf them."
 YUN.earlygame.054.b: "The Chinese Spirit best prevails on the offensive!"

 YUN.earlygame.055.t: "Post-Battle Conferences"
 YUN.earlygame.055.d: "Architect of our new military theory, Zhu De has espoused a new-found critical importance on the training and educational benefits of his hypothesised \"after-battle conferences\". In which, all commanders and soldiers would collaborate and analyse recent battles and campaigns. Any of the participants can discuss and or criticise battle or campaign plans, and likewise, criticise the conduct of individual commanders or soldiers, questioning and critiquing future battle plans and campaigns.\n\nAddressing these mass meetings in person, the overseeing general would explain the broader political and military situation to the soldiers and officers so that they could understand the overall situation in order, according to Zhu, to keep the army \"democratic\". Thus information is shared equally between ranks.\n\nUsing these sessions to correct mistakes, remove incompetent commanders, or promote others on merit, Zhu considers these conferences of high educational and technical value to the army, with plans to publish their results as pamphlets to be distributed as study material for soldiers.\n\nOpposition has arisen from the more conservative top brass of the army, Liu Zhi, Guan Linzheng and He Yingqin, whom argue that such conferences might result in the removal of commanders based on mutual soldier hatred for them, accusing them of \"incompetence\", when in reality they merely didn't trust the vision of their superior, or lacked the spirit to follow through."
 YUN.earlygame.055.a: "Such conferences are bound to upset the command structure!"
 YUN.earlygame.055.b: "There is a proper need for reflection if we are to succeed."

 YUN.earlygame.056.t: "Equalisation of Command Posts"
 YUN.earlygame.056.d: "Imperative to the successes of the Yunnan Army and the National Revolutionary Army, the aspect of training and instruction is frequently overlooked in warlord armies. However, with Zhu De prescribing a systematic approach to his officer and soldiers, he has begun to advocate for the adoption of recently developed Western doctrines and systems. His methodical, detail-oriented approach to military training and teaching has been evident in the directives he has been issuing to the army. \"How to evaluate officers and soldiers\", \"How to select and educate new recruits\", \"How to improve physical training and marskmanship\", amongst others.\n\nHowever one directive drawing particular ire is that of \"How to determine potential appointments\", wherein Zhu has drafted a system to test and evaluate officers and men for promotions, determine their roles in the military, and approve of their transfers. Alongside the implementation of a formal education system for officers and men, and designated organisations for carrying out testing using the recently developed Dalton System.\n\nAlas the issues arive with the serious blowback from conservative commanders in the NRA, such as Jiang Dingwen, Li Genyuan and Gu Zhutong, who fear that such a directive encroaches on their right to appoint their own men. Albeit the young guard, those of the likes of Chen Cheng and Teng Jie's flock, support such notions, stating that it allows meritocracy to flourish."
 YUN.earlygame.056.a: "The true National Revolutionary Army shines on merit!"
 YUN.earlygame.056.b: "Acknowledge where you stand, Zhu."

 YUN.earlygame.057.t: "Strategy and Tactics of the New NRA"
 YUN.earlygame.057.d: "Based upon the strategic theory of the likes of Zhu De, Chen Yi and Tang Huaiyuan, the new National Revolutionary Army has seen an overwhelming influx of focus on speed and mobility as being the greatest assets to assure victory. That it should avoid combat with stronger enemy units until conditions were at their most favourable to launch an attack. Realising that the NRA units would be high priority targets for any opposing force, the commanders have advocated for the concentration of Red Army units in difficult terrain deep within Kuomintang territory, to entice enemy forces to advance.\n\nWith enemy forces usually advancing in an uncoordinated fashion, along separate routes, over difficult terrain, and in unfamiliar territory, they would be ripe targets for a surprise counter-attack against isolated battalions. At the tactical level, such a strategy invokes the need for local guerilla units around various villages, whilst the operational level necessitates NRA units to manoeuvre over large areas that could encompass several provinces. A novel idea, such strategies saw proto-use in the MinGan insurgent zone, proving effective there.\n\nHowever opposition to such strategies are multi-faceted, as it comes from both civilian and military sections of the party. Civilian cadres fear that such deep enemy incursions into KMT territory would see significant damage done to the economy, population and local institutions, whilst army hardliners fear that any strategic benefits would be declared null and void, if the NRA's own units end up encircled."
 YUN.earlygame.057.a: "Interesting, but highly impractical."
 YUN.earlygame.057.b: "It is the only way to beat a superior enemy!"

 YUN.earlygame.058.t: "Principles of the New NRA"
 YUN.earlygame.058.d: "In outlining his reform plan for the National Revolutionary Army, Zhu De has begun to formulate a series of doctrinal principles for the army as a whole. Outlined in a document passed onto [ROOT.GetLeader], it begins with a quotation: \"Practice divorced from theory is like groping in the dark; theory divorced from practice is purposeless theory\". According to Zhu, even though the NRA had much practical experience, it lacked in general a theoretical knowledge of tactics. It was imperative that the army improve its capabilities through practice and study of theory. Setting out principles derived from his experience in both theory and field, he begins:\n\nFirst, one should be flexible in the battlefield, and one must be accommodating for all manner of variables.\nSecond, in commanding any number of troops, you should choose the principal direction of assault, concentrating your maximum strength there to engage in a decisive battle. One must merely deploy containment forces in other directions.\nThird, strategy involves discovering the enemy's main strength, whilst tactics involve discovering weak points. Total victory is the aggregation of numerous small victories.\nFourth, in coordinating formations, each and every unit should understand their strategic objective, and the essence of the superior's decision.\nFifth, the main goals of recon are to determine the enemy's situation and terrain, but a commander should still function with incomplete information if it is necessary.\nSixth, if forces are caught in a pincer or encirclement, they should seek a wide interior arc to allow easy manoeuvrability.\n\nDivorced from political sentiment, such principles have reached complete agreement amongst most in the high command, with the few remaining holdouts being the old guard, such as Li Genyuan, or Jin Handing. They fear that the principles of experimentation at such a crucial stage in the revolution are too risky to be implemented at the moment, but accepts their merit in the future."
 YUN.earlygame.058.a: "An army of revolution, undefeatable!"
 YUN.earlygame.058.b: "Now is not the time to experiment."

 YUN.earlygame.059.t: "Offensive Objectives of the Party Army"
 YUN.earlygame.059.d: "Following on from Zhu De's outlining of new Principles of the army, he has carried on with further revitalisation and reflection of the army's objectives. Naturally starting with offensive objectives. He has derived that the NRA has three immediate objectives in offensive strategy, that of survival of the party, gaining of territory, and annihilation of enemy military forces.\n\nWhen describing the survival of the party, Zhu clarifies that he intends to use party and army synonymously, for without the party there is no army, and without the army there is no party. Indicating that the army is harder to replace than [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] itself. Furthermore, the fundamental law of war itself is to destroy the enemy, whilst preserving oneself\n\nIn the gaining of territory, Zhu desires the preservation and expansion of geographical \"base areas\" controlled by the NRA. Stating that said base areas should be functionally independent from each other, only expending influence in their local areas.\n\nLastly, in regards to the annihilation of enemy military forces, Zhu clarifies that it does not necessarily mean killing, more so the elimination of an enemy force as an obstacle, as stipulated by Clausewitz.\n\nHe has encountered severe opposition from Whampoa once more, with Liu Zhi, He Yingqin and Gu Zhutong avidly fighting against even the mere concept of propagating independent \"base areas\". That such institutions would be paramount to local warlords yet again."
 YUN.earlygame.059.a: "These soldiers would fight for their own survival, not the greater cause!"
 YUN.earlygame.059.b: "Independence of units ensures survival of the army."

 YUN.earlygame.060.t: "Defensive Objectives of the Party Army"
 YUN.earlygame.060.d: "Despite opposition, Zhu De has carried on by finishing his strategic principal outlining. Focusing on more defensive matters this time around, Zhu has derived there to be a new way of waging war for the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nOne should initially focus on defending either base areas or army headquarters from attempted hostile military invasion, with three critical objectives to maintain: preservation of the defensive area, preservation of the military defence force, and annihilation of all or part of the attacking force.\n\nWhilst retreating into the defensive zone, the NRA should manoeuvre themselves into a favourable position, and grant themselves time for the preparation of military assets and the concentration of manpower. The further an enemy pursued, the more frail his supply and communication lines, and the lower his morale. When the conditions are optimal for a counter-attack, one should be pursued post haste, and decisively.\n\nMost controversially however, Zhu refused to recognise the concept of a \"strategic point\", a title attributed to cities, or monuments, areas of cultural or political importance. Instead, he advocates for the maximum control of the overall amount of territory in a region.\n\nNaturally such a claim has raised concerns from all across the party and army, with joint opposition from the civilians championed by Yang Yongtai and Song Ziwen, alongside the likes of Li Genyuan, Liu Zhi, and Guan Linzheng, all of whom decry the loss of cities as destabilising economic interests. Although Chen Cheng and his Civil Engineering Clique have granted token support for Zhu De's pragmatism."

 YUN.earlygame.061.intro: "Following through with his implementation of After-Action Conferences amongst the soldiers and officers, Zhu De has presided over a recently controversial meeting, wherein a large amount of the discussion was based around the performance and capability of the recent Generalissimos both in field and political matters.\n\n"
 YUN.earlygame.061.d_kmt: "$YUN.earlygame.061.intro$With regards to He Yingqin, Zhu De pointed out the rather slow advance and gains of He Yingqin's 1st army during the initial foray of the Northern Expedition, resulting in limited development of party control in Zhejiang province. Furthermore, following the German seizure of Guangzhou, and the re-direction of He Yingqin's 1st Army southwards to launch their doomed 2 week counter-attack, Zhu raised the critical flaw of He's ill preparation for the siege of the city.\n\nIn a far more scathing critique, Zhu draws parallels between He Yingqin and the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The fact that despite supposedly being Chiang's confidant and close friend, he still supported the bid to oust the Generalissimo in 1926, and even now, fails to carry the same charm and magnitude of control over the NRA that his predecessor had.\n\nAppalled by what he considers to be uncouth, petty mockery of what a good soldier should strive for, He Yingqin has gone on the offensive in return. Accusing Zhu De of politicising the army, exposing it to the Syndicalists, and being beholden to the likes of the spineless Wang Jingwei."
 YUN.earlygame.061.d_kmtsatellite: "$YUN.earlygame.061.intro$Whilst the \"Two Zhus\", as they were known at Kunming, have long shared common brotherhood and even friendship, Zhu De was nonetheless highly critical of his superior. Accused of the numerous defeats in light of Sun Chuanfang's advancing Southern Zhili armies during the Northern Expedition, Zhu De further drilled into his friend's reputation, by levying accusations of incompetency in handling political matters, and in controlling the disparate factions of the National Revolutionary Army. Mostly, in part, due to Zhu Peide being de-jure the highest ranked general and head of the National Revolutionary Army in Guizhou, yet evidently his influence only stretched to a portion of his own 3rd Army. Sharing his position with the likes of He Yingqin, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian and Tan Yankai.\n\nResolute and steadfast, critiques from his own classmate and friend shattered what little faith Zhu Peide continued to maintain in amicable terms between the two commanders. Levying his own critiques of Zhu De, he has criticised the latter's lack of assistance during the Northern Expedition, his constant clamouring to be seen as the \"Successor\" of Cai E, and his continued association as the ringleader for leftists within the Yunnan Kuomintang."

###- Early Game Economic Events -###

 YUN.earlygame.200.t: "Berlin's Response"
 YUN.earlygame.200.d: "In the twilight decades of the Qing Dynasty, much of the country was carved up into economic spheres. Just as the Northeast was put under Russian and later Japanese influence, Yunnan was brought into the French sphere. When the Qing Dynasty finally fell and the warlord era began, many different warlords sought different foreign backers. Duan Qirui and the Anhui Clique developed a relationship with the Japanese, and was nearly entirely reliant on Tokyo's finances and military aid.\n\nThe Old Marshal in Shenyang also reached out to the Japanese, but his powerful economic base gave him the liberties to reach out to a multitude of benefactors. Yunnan under Cai E undertook a concerted effort of militarisation in the pursuit of unification by military means, but Yunnan's geographical position dictated that the province's military ambitions would be at the mercy of Paris, Kunming's only weapon supplier. When the French Republic fell to revolution and the Germans took over French Indochina, Berlin replaced Paris' economic dominance over Yunnan with their own as well as their position as Kunming's sole weapons supplier.\n\nEver since Berlin's China Policy brought Beijing closer to German interests, Tang's weapon supplies became less and less frequent in order to keep the Yunnanese Army in check. On top of Tang's ambitions, Yunnan's lack of Vietnamese bandit policing was also not to Berlin's favour. However, with the collapse of Zhili Hegemony, Germany's interests in China are greatly threatened and Governor Tang could always sooth Berlin's concerns by promising to use the gun shipments to combat banditry and maintain the German order in Southwestern China..."
 YUN.earlygame.200.a: "I can't believe that worked!"

 YUN.earlygame.201.t: "Tin and Rails"
 YUN.earlygame.201.d: "While Yunnan remains poor, backwards, and agricultural, the province is incredibly rich with natural resources. When the French colonised southwestern China, they immediately began opening up Yunnan to commercialisation. The cities of Mengzi, Manhao, and Longzhou were established in Yunnan and Guangxi. After the Sino-Japanese War, the French secured a 99 lease on Guangzhouwan, as well as more railroad and mining rights. The French would build the Kunming - Haiphong Rail, otherwise known as the Dianyue Iron Road.\n\nThis rail whilst boosting Paris' modernist agenda massively boosted transportation between French Indochina and Kunming, and the Gejiu to Jijie section of the rail became the most profitable part of the rail and massively increased French exports. Before its construction, Gejiu's exports never exceeded four thousand tons, but from two years after the rail's construction all the way to the French Revolution, Gejiu exported over ten thousand tons annually. Regardless of export revenues, the rail was not particularly profitable but the benefits it provided made it a worthwhile venture for Paris.\n\nBefore the rail was built, the French relied on intermediaries and middle men in the tin trade, but the rail made them obsolete and delivered all commercial benefits directly to the Indochina Colonial Administration. While Germany's Colonial Indochinese Administration has been less successful at consolidating control, Berlin has maintained full control over the Dianyue Iron Road, and maintains the same level of interest in resource extraction as Paris did. While Yunnan's future direction is very much contested, there is full agreement that Germany's foreign economic dominance must be broken."

 YUN.earlygame.202.t: "A History of Financial Hardship"
 YUN.earlygame.202.d: "Yunnan even while never especially rich and prosperous was devastated without respite in the 19th century. In 1855, the Bubonic Plague which ravaged the world twice before struck Yunnan province for 15 years, killing millions. Shortly after, Yunnan province was engulfed in the Hui-led Du Wenxiu Rebellion, where a million on both sides died. The population drop caused mining to drop, which in turn caused the currency to devalue, which led to rampant banditry. Han and Hui tensions remained high after the Hui Rebellion, as well as a distrust for foreigners due to British support for Du Wenxiu. Anti-foreign sentiment led to the death of a British national possibly on the orders of the provincial government, which provoked the British into renegotiating the 1858 Tianjin Treaty.\n\nThe new treaty allowed London to increase trade from Burma into Yunnan and lease certain border regions, which further inflamed anti-foreigner sentiment. When the French began moving into Vietnam, Chinese mercenaries were hired by the Vietnamese government to fight off the French. 50 thousand Chinese soldiers would enter Vietnam to resist the French, but Paris secured control over the region regardless. The British and French developed a syndicate to control the mining rights of Mengzi, which continued until the French and British Revolutions, and fell into the hands of the AOG. Nearly a century has passed since the Bubonic Plague ravaged Yunnan, but the province remains unhealed."
 YUN.earlygame.202.a: "The story of suffering is all too common in China."

 YUN.earlygame.203.t: "Reclaiming Economic Agency"
 YUN.earlygame.203.d: "Ever since the Xinhai Revolution, economic reform has been unanimously hailed as the primary goal for the Yunnanese provincial government. The road to economic reform remains hazardous and rife with treachery however. The last Qing viceroy of the Yun-Gui region Li Jingxi attempted to revitalise Yunnanese mining and restore Yunnanese industry, but alienated the gentry in the process. The gentry forced Li to cut back on government spending and kept his reforms contained to Kunming and Mengzi.\n\nLi Jingxi's former subordinates, Cai E and Tang Jiyao, inherited Li's legacy and agenda in the wake of the Xinhai Revolution but faced many of the same challenges. Conservative elites and weak revenue streams continually hampered the Governorship, and Cai E's militarisation programme only exacerbated the problems. Regardless, the ambitions for economic development remain strong even to this day, and [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration hopes that the Yunnan Economic Commission will succeed where earlier reforms failed.\n\nIt is widely understood that heavy economic intervention is required in the Southwest, for incentivising foreigners to build factories and then reverse-engineering western technologies as is done in Eastern China is infeasible. The immediate five undertakings of the Economic Commission are to develop cotton spinning and weaving, hydro-electric power, cement manufacturing, light engineering, and critical investments. While just ambitious goals at the moment, there is a current of hope that perhaps Yunnan's century of strife may finally be coming to an end."

##Section 2c (400-599): Early Game KMT Political Events
 YUN.earlygame.400.t: "A Nationalist Junta in the Southwest"
 YUN.earlygame.400.d: "In the immediate aftermath of the anti-Tang Jiyao coup, the Kuomintang wasted no time in establishing themselves in Kunming. While Zhu Peide has taken up the position of Governor (translation note: the Kuomintang referred to Provincial Executives as Chairmen, but for simplicity they will henceforth be referred to as Governor), He Yingqin, Long Yun, and Hu Ruoyu exercise substantial authority in the administration as well. Although the Kuomintang is the dominant power in Yunnan, Zhu Peide recognised the need to align the local power players in the province, including the gentry. However, not all is well for the nascent Yunnanese Nationalist Junta. Student radical groups who were initially enthusiastic about the Kuomintang takeover found themselves severely disappointed by this moderating position.\n\nIn an ironic twist, student groups found themselves in cooperation with Tang Jiyao's loyalist remnants in opposing the new Kunming Administration. The anti Kuomintang agitation was such that the Chamber of Commerce reported several instances of disruption. On top of marginalised groups outside of the government, Zhu Peide finds opposition from inside his government too. Long Yun, while the instigator of the anti-Tang coup, hopes that the Kuomintang rule in Yunnan is merely temporary, as the Kuomintang ambitions lie in Guangdong, the birthplace of the National Revolution.\n\nHu Ruoyu, while far more amenable to the Kuomintang takeover, has similar views and has ambitions to take the province for himself. However, the 3rd Army of the NRA, which Zhu Peide leads, displays substantial regionalist sentiment, preferring to consolidate Nationalist control of Yunnan. On the other hand, He Yingqin and the 1st Army of the NRA have pushed hard for a military campaign west for the restoration of a Nationalist presence in Guangzhou. To them, Yunnan is but the stepping stone to the true base of the KMT. If Zhu Peide is to govern Yunnan well, he will have to balance the competing interests of his subordinates, or fall as Tang Jiyao did."

 YUN.earlygame.4000.d: "At the end of the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary Army underwent a \"Long March\" west to Guizhou. Written off as a doomed effort by the Zhili, they were left to eventually be consumed by neighbouring warlord cliques. They were proven wrong. Yunnan Clique warlord Tang Jiyao attempted to launch an invasion of Guizhou, only to be utterly trounced and his own generals betrayed him.\n\nZhu Peide, the leader of the Kuomintang junta, has been installed as governor over Yunnan with the reluctant support of the provincial gentry. But few believe that the Kuomintang will be satisfied with merely the two provinces."

 YUN.earlygame.4000.b: "The Southwest falls to revolution..."

 YUN.earlygame.401.t: "The Kuomintang's Legacy in Yunnan"
 YUN.earlygame.401.d: "The roots of the KMT in Yunnan go as far back as the existence of the party itself. One of the leading organisers of the Tongmenghui, Li Genyuan, became the supervisor of the Kunming Military Academy in 1909. When the Wuchang Uprising occurred, Li Genyuan worked with Cai E and Tang Jiyao to launch a similar revolt in Yunnan and declare for the revolution. Li spent the 1910s opposing Yuan Shikai, and worked with Cen Chunxuan to form the Old Political Science Clique. The Old Political Science Clique, which would be dedicated towards mending relations between Beijing and Guangzhou, would find itself in opposition to Sun Yat-sen, Tang Jiyao, and Chen Jiongming.\n\nHowever, Tang had alienated Li Genyuan's protégé Gu Pinzhen by favouring his own brother Tang Jiyu, which prompted Gu to force Tang Jiyao to resign as Governor. When Tang prepared to make his return, his allies Li Liejun and Zhu Peide broke with him. While Tang and Gu were fighting, Sun schemed to have Jin Handing take Yunnan, but that ended in failure and Tang retook Yunnan. The Yunnanese KMT in the aftermath of Gu's death was exiled to Guangzhou and coalesced into the 3rd Army, with Jin Handing and Fan Shisheng's armies being integrated into the 3rd Army in the 30s.\n\nAll emerging from different roots, Zhu Peide, Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing, and the rising star Zhu De all demonstrate great political diversity as a result. Fan Shisheng and Jin Handing are considered to not be particularly ideological. Zhu De's contingent of the 3rd Army displaces socialist tendencies. Zhu Peide himself finds himself very much in line with the Old Right. Thus, Zhu's decision to bring back Li Genyuan to Yunnan at the behest of Fan, Jin, and Zhang Qun will in all likelihood be a hugely controversial decision, as the latter betrayed Sun all those years ago. He Yingqin and the Whampoa have already made their dissatisfaction clear to the Generalissimo."

The various bureaus across Yunnan undoubtedly have some affinity for their old governor, a fact Zhu Peide would be a fool to ignore. To remove them would be even more troubling still. While Hu Ruoyu and Long Yun ushered the National Revolution into Kunming, they largely expect a continuation of the status quo. Yunnan's political history has always been somewhat more stable than its northern neighbours, and there has always been a contiguous line of reformism undertaken by its governors.\n\nAfter Viceroy Li Jingxi was ousted by the Xinhai Revolution, Cai E and Tang Jiyao maintained Li's political agenda, albeit with a more militaristic tilt. Various bureaus were established in the name of tax collection, economic development, and constitutionalism. The Kuomintang has historically been a force based in Guangdong, and is not descended from the political traditions of Yunnan. For Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu, maintaining the Yunnanese Bureaucracy is even more important due to its impacts on the military. The Yunnanese Army has long been a bureaucratic institution, with each army not just being bound by loyalty, but by the fact that commands came from higher up in the name of the entire institution.\n\nAuthority was not in the person but the position, and positions were a pyramid hierarchy. However, the Kuomintang's Revolutionary agenda is not necessarily compatible with Yunnan's bureaucratic tradition. To Kuomintang radicals, Yunnan's bureaucracy is a messy hodgepodge of Gentry interests and warlordism. Hu Ruoyu has taken it upon himself to appeal to Zhu Peide to find a compromise which will preserve Yunnan's bureaucratic machine, having already reached out to Zhu De, Fan Shisheng and Jin Handing, hoping that Zhu's respect for Cai E and the other two's more apolitical outlook."
 YUN.earlygame.402.a: "Yunnan's Bureaucracy will now serve the National Revolution."
 YUN.earlygame.402.b: "The National Revolution will not utilise the playthings of warlords!"

 YUN.earlygame.403.t: "Whampoa's Last Stand"
 YUN.earlygame.403.d: "While Sun found success in proliferating the cause of the Tongmenghui across Southern China during the Xinhai Revolution, the divergence of interests caused many to turn away from his call for a Second Revolution. Those that remained would form the core of Sun's inner circle. When Sun returned to Guangzhou, he spent years dealing with wayward allies and opportunistic warlords who would betray his cause on a dime. Cynical from the betrayals and lack of western support, Sun came to court the Syndicalist Powers for an alliance, and the Internationale Mission helped Sun reorganise the KMT into a disciplined, revolutionary party.\n\nOn the military end, Sun required a devoted military dedicated to his ideological goals and prioritised the party above all else, and so he created the Whampoa Academy. Sun chose his most loyal disciple, Chiang Kai-shek to be the Headmaster and train the first generation of Whampoa officers. Bringing the teachings of the Baoding Academy and Imperial Japanese Army Academy, Chiang and his old classmate He Yingqin would instil every aspect of warfare and the core ideological goal of the National Revolution and the tenets of the Three Principles of the People to their Whampoa Cadets.\n\nThe Whampoa Clique would bring Chiang Kai-shek to prominence within the Kuomintang and achieve many victories in the Northern Expedition, but suffered greatly when German and Zhili forces collapsed on them from all sides and their beloved headmaster was slain. He Yingqin brought his portion of Whampoa remnants in the First Army to Guizhou, which houses some of the most ideological officers within the NRA. While merely a ragtag force at the moment, it would be a mistake to compare them to other rump warlord armies, a point the Whampoa Clique would be quick to point out."
 YUN.earlygame.403.a: "The interests of the Whampoa Clique must be respected..."
 YUN.earlygame.403.b: "What a pretentious grouping of moralising cronies..."

 YUN.earlygame.404.t: "Zhejiang's Revolutionaries"
 YUN.earlygame.404.d: "By the 1900s, the Green Gang controlled all crime activity in Shanghai. The Green Gang became involved with the Kuomintang when Chen Qimei joined them in 1908. A few years prior, Chen had been working in Japan for Sun Yat-sen, and met fellow Zhejiangers Chiang Kai-shek and Dai Jitao. During the Xinhai Revolution, Dai, Chiang, and Chen all participated in the Shanghai Uprising. Chiang, Chen, and Dai operated in Shanghai and formed the Zhejiang Revolutionary Comrades Society. The Trio fled to Japan after the failure of Sun's Second Revolution, and made an impression of Sun as one of the few revolutionaries who swore an oath of allegiance to him.\n\nIn 1916, Chen was assassinated by Zhang Zongchang. Chiang mentored Chen Qimei's nephew Chen Guofu thereafter to honour his death. The ZRCS resumed its Shanghai Activities after Yuan Shikai's death, often collaborating with the Green Gang, including setting up illegal stock exchanges. Chiang spent much of his time with stocks until he lost a small fortune, while Dai would write fervently in newspapers. In 1924, Sun recognised Chiang's loyalty and made him the Headmaster of the Whampoa Military Academy. After Sun died in 1925, Chiang would become one of the leading figures in the Kuomintang, alongside Wang Jingwei.\n\nDai Jitao and the Chen brothers would also rise to high positions, and alongside Zhejianger Whampoa Alumni would form the nucleus of Chiang's inner circle. The rise of the ZRCS in the Kuomintang would be broken by the death of Chiang Kai-shek, and much of his vast array of associates and networks would crumble. Dai Jitao and the Chen brothers fled to Shanghai in the chaos of the NRA collapse, and continued their earlier Shanghai Activities underground until the Kuomintang seized Yunnan. While Dai and the Chen brothers now work in Kunming, they maintain their connections to the Green Gang as well as their less savoury business operations, such as the illegal stock exchange."
 YUN.earlygame.404.a: "The Green Gang remains a true ally of the National Revolution!"
 YUN.earlygame.404.b: "You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than in Shanghai..."

##Section 2d (600-799): Early Game UPC Political Events
 YUN.earlygame.600.t: "The Federalist Outpost in the Southwest"
 YUN.earlygame.600.d: "The Yunnan Army has overrun Guizhou, securing Tang's northern flank. The road to Guangzhou is open, but Tang still needs to persuade his people to embark on a military adventure more perilous than Guizhou.\n\nIn 1918, Tang Jiyao proposed to the provincial assembly a confederation between Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou. In a lavish Chongqing ceremony, he assumed command of the Allied Army of Seven Provinces, nominally also of Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan and Shanxi. His attempt at a Northern Expedition was beset by infighting as power gradually shifted from Kunming to Guangzhou. Funding ran out, forcing them to rely on opium and banditry. Resentment against Yunnan's \"guest armies\" rose until in 1920 a coalition of Sichuanese warlords backed by Guangzhou revolted. Tang Jiyao himself would be overthrown by his routing units in the Guangzhou-backed Gu Pingzhen coup - demonstrating how defeat abroad can quickly reverberate at home.\n\nUpon Tang's return to power in 1922, he prioritised domestic stability over \"export militarism\", purging his Japanese-educated peers such as Gu Pinzhen, Luo Peijin, and He Guojun. The proud Yunnan Army's equipment rusted, pay reduced and it was placed under the command of Tang's brother Tang Jiyu, whose loyalty was unquestioned but his competence was. Still, Tang was able to create a bureaucratic, rather than personality based army hierarchy, and reallocate funding towards civilian development.\n\nTang's march on Guangzhou in 1925 also proved to be a folly - destroyed by the disunited Guangxi clans before they could even make it to Guangdong. In addition to military failings, it was a hard lesson on modern Chinese political trends. Tang failed to communicate whether intended to link up with his exiled Yunnan Army rivals or destroy them, resulting in their hostility or neutrality. His disciplined but regionalist Yunnan Army could not match the radicalised KMT-aligned warlord armies. Returning home defeated, he faced yet another coup. If things are to end differently..."
 YUN.earlygame.600.a: "...We'll need an ideological coalition of our own."
 YUN.earlygame.600.b: "...Tang will need to consolidate his power."

 YUN.earlygame.601.t: "Yunnanese Forces Storm Guizhou"
 YUN.earlygame.601.d: "The Yunnan Clique was once the premier power in the south, leading revolutionaries against Yuan Shikai's Monarchy in the National Protection War and playing a pivotal role in the Constitutional Protection War. Crushing defeats against both Beiyang and Guangzhou aligned governments forced them into isolation as they bid their time.\n\nNow, seeing favourable winds, Governor Tang Jiyao has led his forces into battle - eliminating the Kuomintang remnant holed up in Guizhou. It is clear his ambitions do not end there - with his northern flank secure it is clear his next steps are national."
 YUN.earlygame.601.a: "A southwestern ally in our quest for a Chinese federation?"
 YUN.earlygame.601.b: "From the Southwest, Cai E's unworthy protégé returns..."

 YUN.earlygame.602.t: "Zhang Taiyan, the Federalist Icon"
 YUN.earlygame.602.d: "In Kunming resides Zhang Taiyan, a scholar also known as Zhang Binglin. An aging Federalist intellectual, he is a relic of the Xinhai Revolution - achieving fame in the 1906 Su Bao sedition case where he was imprisoned by a joint Qing-Shanghai Concession court for three years.\n\nHis work as an anti-Manchu writer and his belief in the so-called \"National Essence\" inspired the Yunnan Miscellany, a paper which inspired many young Yunnanese revolutionaries. Its \"Yunnan Essence\" (Dian Cui) included biographies of many civilian and military leaders in Southwestern China who had resisted Qing control over the years, promoting this belief that Yunnan had a unique, heroic regional identity. It also championed nine reformist \"ideas\": nation, solidarity, public spiritedness, progress, braving danger, honoring the military, industry, local self-government, and the quality of men and women.\n\nZhang Taiyan continued to be an extremely respected statesman in the 1920s, particularly in Federalist circles. Tang Jiyao and others in Yunnan were compelled by his promotion of regional autonomy for the provinces, who would then band together to be strong enough to resist foreign invasion. While Zhang himself admitted his more radical ideas might be too utopian to be practical, he continues to be an influential intellectual.\n\nOriginally based in Suzhou and a participant in Sun Chuanfang's government, he grew disillusioned with Sun's authoritarianism and refusal to break with Zhili centralism. In 1932, he fell out of favor with Sun and was forced to flee the League altogether. He found refuge in Tang's domain, somewhat disgraced along with the broader Federalist movement after the Zhili successfully unified China. Tang and Zhang managed to revive their fortunes somewhat with the merger of Zhang's United Self-Rule Party with Tang's flagging People's Government Party."
 YUN.earlygame.602.a: "Through Zhang's idealism, Federalism regains hope!"
 YUN.earlygame.602.b: "Through Tang's leadership, Federalism is revived."

 YUN.earlygame.603.t: "Managing the Regionalists"
 YUN.earlygame.603.d: "The gentry and merchants are essential pillars of power in virtually all provinces throughout China, and Yunnan is no different. After rebellions of the mid-1800s, the gentry took a lead role in the reconstruction of the province, allowing them to take control over Yunnan's administration, finances, and mining/trade networks.\n\nThis power allowed them to dominate local assemblies, which they used to fight both the central government's bureaucracy and the exploitation of foreign corporations. Their control over local politics and economy made them a potent force of both reform and reaction - the 1911 Li Jingxi reforms were scuttled everywhere outside of Kunming and Mengzi due to gentry concerns over the deficit. Around the same time, their discontent over the British occupation of Pianma allowed them to organise the Baojiehui (Society for the Protection of Territory) massive boycotts against the British and call for revolution against the weak central government, leading to many Baojiehui members joining the revolutionary Tongmenghui.\n\nThis push and pull between reform and reaction as well as regionalism and nationalism continues today. The Yunnan gentry and merchants are reluctant to back significant reforms that would alter the balance of power in the countryside, yet insist on some form of constitutionalism and an elitist democracy in the form of the provincial assembly. They are hostile towards the prospect of war and the socio-economic disruption it entails, but also seek the unification of the country on patriotic grounds. Yet in this unification they desire considerable regional autonomy that no central government appears willing to give. It will take a lot of convincing to secure their support for a unification war."
 YUN.earlygame.603.a: "It is our national duty to liberate our countrymen!"
 YUN.earlygame.603.b: "We fight in order to defend our right to self-rule!"

 YUN.earlygame.604.t: "Phases of the Crescent Moon"
 YUN.earlygame.604.d: "The waning Crescent Moon Society can be found teaching in Kunming's universities. Founded in 1923 by Xu Zhimo as a fashionable upper-middle class intellectual social club with a shared interest in dramatic theatre, the loose collection of friends attracted liberal scholars such as Hu Shih and Zhang Junmai, and quickly rivaled the realist-oriented Literary Association and the romantic-oriented Creation Society. They took a middle road amid New Culture iconoclasm, advocating for a re-assessment of Chinese tradition while evaluating Western culture in a rational manner.\n\nLuo Longji, Wen Yiduo, Liang Shiqiu and the Qinghua Literature Society soon joined the CMS orbit and were targeted together by their enemies in the socialist League of Left Wing Writers (successors of the Creation Society). As the CMS became increasingly political and joined by non-intellectuals, Xu grew discontented about its \"unbearable petty bourgeois odour\" and disbanded the club amid the turmoil of 1927.\n\nNevertheless, they reconvened in Shanghai, opening up a bookstore. No longer content with merely talking about literature but also politics amid the rising prospects of unification, they began publishing the Crescent Moon Monthly. Its name originated from Indian independence activist Rabindranath Tagore's \"Crescent Moon\" poetry collection, who Xu admired, stating that \"although it is not such a powerful symbol, the seemingly fragile crescent is implying and embracing a full hope in the future.\"\n\nIts political turn divided its membership but it gained steam during Zhili liberalisation. Xu Zhimo's untimely 1931 death in an air accident (many believe he was assassinated) sent the society into mourning and heavy League suppression the following year saw Hu Shih and the Peking University faction return north. Luo Longji and the Tsinghua University faction sought greater intellectual freedom in the south, finding positions in Yunnan where they continue to publish. With some funding, perhaps the Crescent Moon may wax again."
 YUN.earlygame.604.a: "Tang prizes their reach across the nation."
 YUN.earlygame.604.b: "They represent hope for a democratic future."

 YUN.earlygame.605.t: "The Real Ruler of Guizhou"
 YUN.earlygame.605.d: "Guizhou (or at least the western portion of it) has been secured, a valuable prize in Tang Jiyao's efforts to rebuild his southwestern empire. In the Governor's previous campaigns in Guizhou, he aided the reformist Association to Prepare the Constitution backed by the upper gentry against the revolutionary Self Government Society backed by the lower gentry.\n\nThis detour into Guizhou, defying Cai E's orders to advance into Sichuan, would permanently alter the course of Tang's career. It began the split between him and Sun Yat-sen, who came to the aid of the exiled \"Anger at Injustice Group\" (Yuanfentuan) and his brother Tang Jiyu's tenure as his de facto military prefect in Guizhou contributed not only to their defeat in the Yunnan-Guangxi War (Tang Jiyu was accused of failing to relieve Long Yun in time because of his corrupt opium dealings) but also Hu Ruoyu's coup d'etat shortly afterwards.\n\nGuizhou under the Constitutionalists was ruled by Liu Xianshi, the patriarch of the Liu Clique, who dominated the province across the 1920s but was supplanted by Yuan Zuming and later Kuomintang exile forces. He died exiled in Kunming in 1927, never seeing his home province again.\n\nHis relatives however, have been quick to follow the Yunnan Army into Guizhou. His cousin, General Liu Xianqian, has attempted to assume the governorship but this has been contested by his nephew Liu Gongliang who was said to be the de facto governor during his elderly uncle's later days. Other Liu family members such as Liu Shengchang and Liu Xinwu (both military officers) as well as family associates such as Yi Rongqian (a warlord turned philanthropist and businessman) have taken sides on the matter.\n\nTang Jiyu has also returned to Guizhou, a source of contention given his reputation. However, it might be for the best that he remains there - in addition to keeping the province under Tang's thumb, it also keeps him away from Yunnan where he is even more resented by the Governor's officers."
 YUN.earlygame.605.a: "Liu Xianqian unites the Liu clan against outside interference."
 YUN.earlygame.605.b: "Tang Jiyu helps install Liu Gongliang into the governorship."

#Yunnan-Guangxi War Setup Events (800-809)
 YUN.earlygame.800.t: "The Road to Canton"
 YUN.earlygame.800.d: "Yunnan's relationships with Liangguang (the \"Two Guangs\" of Guangdong and Guangxi) in the post-Xinhai Era has been complicated. The three provinces banded together during the National Protection War along with Guizhou and Sichuan (then under Yunnanese dominance), Shaanxi, Hunan, and Zhejiang. This Southwestern Alliance continued into the Constitutional Protection War, where Yunnan and its Sichuan and Guizhou satellites found themselves on the same side with Guangxi and Guangdong.\n\nBut tensions slowly increased over the years as Yunnan found itself sidelined by Liangguang. The rise of the Political Science Clique after the Yunnan Army was driven out of Sichuan meant Yunnan found itself playing second fiddle to Guangzhou (also known as Canton), and after Tang Jiyao was able to reclaim power in Yunnan he then found himself in conflict with Kuomintang-dominated Guangdong. The KMT alleged that Tang was supporting Chen Jiongming against Sun in a Federalist alliance, and when Sun died in 1925 Tang made a fateful decision to march on Guangdong in hopes of claiming southern leadership for himself. What he failed to account for however was the tenacity of the Guangxi Clans sitting between Kunming and Guangzhou. Yunnan's forces were smashed long before they could reach their goal, severely destabilising Tang's rule.\n\nYunnan would remain mostly neutral during the Northern Expedition, while Guizhou found itself loosely allied with the KMT before ultimately being split at the end of the conflict between the pro-Beiyang Yuan Zuming government and the KMT junta in Guiyang. As [YUN.GetLeader] looks towards Guangzhou, he must carefully weigh his options."
 YUN.earlygame.800.a: "We continue to mull our options."
 YUN.earlygame.800.tt: "§RShould a war with Liangguang not go our way, the stability of our government will be in grave danger!§!"

 YUN.earlygame.801.t: "The Second Dian-Gui War"
 YUN.earlygame.801.d: "[YUN.GetLeader] has made the fateful decision to go to war, ordering his troops to cross the border out of Yunnan and Guizhou. While his ultimate destination is the critical city of Guangzhou, which he needs to proclaim a rival government, his men's immediate target is Nanning - the Capital of Guangxi and a vital logistics hub along the way.\n\nDuring the first Yunnan-Guangxi War in 1925 (Dian is the abbreviation of Yunnan, Gui is the abbreviation of Guangxi), triggered by the death of Sun Yat-sen and the ensuing power struggle, the Yunnan Army under Long Yun was able to capture the city but were encircled during the Guangxi counter-attack led by Li Zongren. A failed relief effort by Tang Jiyao and the subsequent recapture of the city by the New Guangxi Clique ended the war as Yunnanese morale collapsed. This had fateful implications for Southern China as the disgraced Governor Tang narrowly avoided being overthrown by his disgruntled generals while the Guangzhou government was able to complete its reorganisation.\n\nThe coming war is expected to be similarly decisive. Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi are all heavily militarised provinces but much poorer than Guangdong. If the Yunnan-Guizhou forces fail to move aggressively and knock out Guangxi quickly, they risk severe consequences down the line. On the other hand, should Guangxi and its rugged defensive lines fall, Guangdong will be vulnerable."
 YUN.earlygame.801.a: "We must move quickly to achieve victory!"
 YUN.earlygame.801.b: "We will hold the line like we have always done."

 YUN.earlygame.802.t: "The Fall of Guangzhou"
 YUN.earlygame.802.d: "[YUN.GetLeader]'s gamble was a resounding success! Sweeping away defenders in the rugged hills and forests of Guangxi and the rivers of Guangdong, the armies of [YUN.GetNameDef] accomplished with their predecessors in 1925 could not and took Guangzhou in a decisive battle. Plenty of more work still needs to be done, but the significance of this accomplishment cannot be ignored or downplayed by even the greatest of naysayers. With the strength of the [YUN.GetRulingParty] proven, the generals can be calmed and we can begin looking forward to the next stages of national unification!"
 YUN.earlygame.802.a: "Quite an accomplishment, if I do say so myself."

#The Kunming Coup (810-839)
 YUN.earlygame.810.t: "Plotters in Kunming?"
 YUN.earlygame.810.d: "Yunnan has been teetering on the verge of collapse for some time now, with battlefield defeats taking a toll on their army's morale. The Yunnan High Command has always been reluctant to support external military adventures after the disastrous failure of their \"Export Militarism\" of the 1910s and 1920s, instead preferring armed isolation. We have received word from representatives of Generals Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu that they would like to see the end of the war, offering to overthrow [YUN.GetLeader] in exchange for Yunnan's continued autonomy in domestic affairs.\n\nWith that, our options are open. While we could press for a total conquest of Yunnan, their armies are tenacious fighters on defence and the province is mountainous while the returns of such a conquest are expected to be poor. It may be better to offer terms sooner or later (perhaps after improving our bargaining position a little) and save our resources for more important objectives."

#Guangzhou Conference Chain (100-129):
 YUN.midgame.100.t: "The Canton Conference"
 YUN.midgame.100.d: "Tang Jiyao has finally returned to Guangzhou, not as a disgraced exile but as a victor - overcoming Liangguang forces at last. The city, though damaged from conflict, remains a potent symbol for revolutionary forces in China: it was home to several southern governments seeking to challenge Beijing's dominance in the 20th Century.\n\nWith multiple southern provinces under his thumb, Governor Tang has been empowered to call a conference where he is expected to become \"President Tang\". His attention now has shifted: Yunnanese matters are not (and cannot be) his priority - he now commands a regional government. Among the Liangguang factions, Guangdong is home to a larger Federalist movement centered around Chen Jiongming and his Yue Army. The province is also a hotbed for various strains of revolutionary socialism and conservative reaction - the merchants have organised an Association of All Classes to Save Guangdong against KMT and CSP rule. Guangxi is more conservative, divided into regionalist clans collectively known as the Old Guangxi Clique. Often feuding, they are nevertheless united against external interference in their politics.\n\nFederalist leaders from around the country have been flowing into the city, including some of the recently subjugated. A few interested warlords have sent unofficial representatives, avoiding any direct commitment to the pending government at this time. They come with different, sometimes conflicting ideals - a testament to not only how decentralised the movement always was, but also how fragmented it has become since their devastating failures in the 1920s. Most are staunch advocates for constitutionalism, while others hope democratisation in China, and plenty have joined for the movement's promises of regional autonomy. All demand unification and a fight against imperialism, but some seek a peaceful route, others a war of liberation."
 YUN.midgame.100.a: "We fight for a constitutional democracy."
 YUN.midgame.100.b: "We will not stop until our nation is united again."
 YUN.midgame.100.c: "We will defend our right to self-rule."

 YUN.midgame.101.t: "The Grand Republican Alliance"
 YUN.midgame.101.d: "The Grand Republican Alliance was a joint project first founded by the sidelined Chen Jiongming and Duan Qirui in 1931 amid swelling anti-concessionism and disillusionment following the failure of Zhili-Fengtian reunification talks. Tang Jiyao and Zhang Taiyan's revitalised PGP joined the GRA along with Chu Fucheng's ZAM the following year as Zhili authority began to recede amid the 1932 Shanghai Uprisings. Others, wary of offending Zhili authorities, operated in parallel - including Zhao Hengti's PRS and Xiong Kewu's PFAPO.\n\nThe GRA's identity as a Federalist coalition took shape in the ensuing years, helping keep Federalism alive even as many began to see it as a disgraced, unpatriotic ideology. The Cao Kun Constitution's nominal provisions for provincial autonomy led many to question whether or not Federalism had run its course, and if it was merely an excuse for provincial warlords to continue to divide the country.\n\nThe failure of the Zhili not only to follow through with their constitutionalist promises, but even to keep the country together has allowed Federalism to get a second look by many in China. While not as radical as at the height of the 1920s movement, the revitalised GRA has attracted many disgruntled democrats who are former participants in the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties and witnessed first-hand the failure of the FCDP to coax democratic change out of Beiyang.\n\nThe GRA vows to unite warlords, intellectuals, and other Chinese patriots to build a federal democracy. But before it can do that, it must resolve some simmering tensions within its ranks. Chen Jiongming is the incumbent chairman of the GRA as head of the PIP and had offered Tang the Vice-Chairmanship in the past, which he was ambivalent about accepting as to avoid subjugating himself to Chen. Now that Tang has emerged on top, it would only make sense for him to take on leadership of the GRA. But forcing Chen out would cause him to lose face, and alienate a potential ally."
 YUN.midgame.101.a: "Tang is our undisputed leader, and will easily win an election."
 YUN.midgame.101.b: "Leave Chen as nominal Chairman as an olive branch."

 YUN.midgame.102.t: "Embers of the FCDP"
 YUN.midgame.102.d: "After the 1936 Seven Gentlemen Incident, many southern republicans disgusted by the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties's muted response abandoned the coalition altogether. The largest party of the FCDP and the target of considerable ire was the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, the conservative successors of Liang Qichao and well integrated into the Beiyang establishment. Many left-Liangists, social democrats, and progressive liberals in the south gathered in Guangzhou to found the Democratic Socialist Party shortly afterwards.\n\nThe DSP is made up of two major factions. The first and more dominant one was the National Renaissance Society faction led by Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun. Both were European educated reformist socialists who attempted to synthesise Eastern philosophy with Western political developments. The second was the Crescent Moon Society led by Luo Longji, Wen Yiduo and Liang Shiqiu, a more humanist-liberal oriented group educated in the United States. Both factions drew support from the intelligentsia and middle class professionals.\n\nThe party has vowed to \"awaken the common consciousness of the nation, to fulfill the harmonising function of society, and to achieve the free development of the individual - all through the strength of the nation,\" proposing a mixed economic system and a democratic republic led by scholars.\n\nStill there has been considerable disputes over their tactics. Zhang Junmai, the party's initial chairman, has eschewed a mass following in favor of using the traditionally privileged status of Chinese scholars to influence policy through education and culture. Many disagree however with this Confucian-esque philosophy, preferring to seek direct reform through widespread public pressure. Luo Longji in particular has come out in support of anti-imperialist and even anti-capitalist protests. Some of these disputes are rather personal too - Zhang's autocratic style of leadership has many detractors, and his leadership has been weakening."
 YUN.midgame.102.a: "The DSP's internal desire for change topples Zhang."
 YUN.midgame.102.b: "Tang Jiyao's suspicion of socialism ensures Zhang's ouster."

 YUN.midgame.103.t: "Luo Longji Emerges"
 YUN.midgame.103.d: "Zhang Junmai's downfall was predictable given the circumstances, but the DSP's rapid consolidation around Luo Longji's leadership was a surprise. Though Zhang initially vowed to fight for his position, under pressure he withdrew and fully endorsed Luo.\n\nLuo Longji grew up in Jiangxi after the Hundred Days Reforms were crushed by Empress Cixi. He attended Tsinghua University and became a student leader during the November 4th Protests. Brave and enthusiastic, he also had a pragmatic side - hiring a burly student-athlete to serve as his bodyguard. Later he enrolled in Columbia University, writing his PhD dissertation on \"The Conduct of Parliamentary Elections in England.\"\n\nIdeologically he was inspired by Harold Laski and other Fabian socialists, but tended towards a humanistic liberalism. He admired the American government's separation of powers - a bicameral legislature, three branches of government, and a Federal system that prevented excessive concentration of power. He also incorporated elements of his traditional Confucian education, fascinated by order in society, the transformative power of education, the responsibility of government to the people, and a gravitation towards \"expert politics\".\n\nLuo returned to a much changed China shortly after the collapse of the Northern Expedition. He joined the Crescent Moon Society along with his former classmates Wen Yidu and Liang Shiqiu. He slowly became opposed to Zhili authoritarianism, publishing \"On Human Rights\" in 1929 ahead of elections and later denounced the Zhili as imitating the repressive absolutistism of Kings Charles I and Louis XVI but not even efficiently.\n\nTargeted during the crackdowns following the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, he was arrested and blacklisted. He joined the National Renaissance Society and FCDP in Guangzhou, but ultimately found a position in Kunming University. He has been an energetic propagandist and campaigner, though has struggled to balance the left and right wings of his movement."

 YUN.midgame.104.t: "Stewardship of Yunnan"
 YUN.midgame.104.d: "With Tang Jiyao and much of his staff relocating to Guangzhou, the lingering question is who will manage day to day operations in Yunnan. The province, while poorer than Guangdong, remains Tang's core power-base and one he cannot afford to lose lest his house of cards come quickly crashing down. The Tang Clique's hold on the province also remains unsteady given Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu's questionable loyalties, though the situation is much improved from what it was before the expedition to Guangzhou.\n\nZhou Zhongyue would be the steady choice, a senior advisor in Tang's provincial government for many years. An ethnic Bai and a fellow Japanese-educated politician, Zhou was trained to be an educator but was recruited into Cai E's office as Secretary-General and Chief of Education, on top of several major economic roles. He was also briefly governor from 1919-1920. A well-cultured elder statesman, appointing him governor would be a natural continuation of Tang's rule.\n\nDong Ze is Tang Jiyao's brother-in-law. Another ethnic Bai, he served as secretary in the Governor's office before Cai E sent him to study abroad in Columbia University. He also served as a liaison to Hong Kong during the National Protection War. An educator in Yunnan University and later Director of the Education Department, he was known for hiring foreign educated scholars and promoting democratic school management. Despite the nepotism, he may be seen as a more liberal choice for the province.\n\nLastly there is Tang Xiaoying, Tang Jiyao's son. A Japanese educated economist, he has frequently been seen at his father's side during his political rallies and is reported as having sympathies to the YCP and FCDP. He has also had various minor roles in administration and the military. With Tang Jiyu now situated in Guizhou, he might be Tang Jiyao's closest relative and he is a fresh face in politics. This may lead to significant tensions however as some question his ability to control the unruly petty warlords."
 YUN.midgame.104.a: "Zhou Zhongyue is an establishment choice."

 YUN.midgame.105.d: "After several weeks of deliberations, the final outline of this latest Guangzhou Government has taken shape. It will be built along Federalist lines, vowing to respect provincial autonomy and unite the provinces - through diplomacy first, by force if necessary. Tang Jiyao naturally assumed the Presidency after a speedy vote, he also named Chen Jiongming as his Vice President to appease the Cantonese Federalists.\n\nA provisional legislature has been established, and Zhang Taiyan tasked with organising them as Prime Minister. Despite their similarities, there have already been some clear differences in their governing philosophies. Tang has advocated for a stronger central government, capable of fighting foreign imperialism and that can also play referee between the different provinces. Zhang has at times called for the near abolishment of the central government, arguing that China is too large to manage and prior central governments were prone to selling out to foreign powers - he has sought to empower the various provinces instead. Chen and most others have adopted a more moderate stance between them, and the new government is expected to operate as a compromise between the two extremes, held together by common fears of external attack.\n\nThere are many challenges ahead for the new government. The provinces across China are taking sides in the looming battle for reunification. Many question whether or not the Federalist regime will be able to resolve its internal contradictions, and whether they can do so peacefully."

The latest leader to declare himself a contender is Tang Jiyao, who has rallied several southern provinces under his banner. Aligning with various warlords, intellectuals, gentrymen, and merchants, this new government claims to be fighting for a federal democracy in China - a reversal of fortunes for a movement many wrote off as doomed and unpatriotic a decade ago.\n\nStill, many question whether or not Tang's rule will be meaningfully different from those the tyranny he claims to fight. His authoritarian, adaptable, and sometimes progressive rule has won him both admirers and detractors throughout the years."

#UPC Narrative Events (130-159):
 YUN.midgame.130.t: "Governing Liangguang"
 YUN.midgame.130.d: "Like other regions of China stricken with civil strife following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, Liangguang is no exception. At the helm of Guangdong politics is the leader of the Federalist movement Chen Jiongming and Chen Lianbo of the Merchant Corps. Guangxi on the other hand is dominated by the Old Guangxi clans now led by Lin Hu and Liu Zhenhuan's \"Guangxi Army.\" But now the twin provinces face a new master aside from Beijing, governorship by Kunming. And with this new leadership comes new problems.\n\nTang Jiyao has allied with Liu Zhenhuan of the Guangxi Army in order to hopefully mitigate the potential of rebellions and unrest due to Guangxi's more rural and rebellious nature. However, Tang certainly has reservations about the Guangxi warlord. Liu is a serious opium addict, an ambitious warlord himself, chronic gambler, and hasn't been in Guangxi for a while. Tang has promised Liu the province but perhaps Lin Hu would be a better choice due to the fact he was one of the original governing triumvirate in Guangxi.\n\nGuangdong unlike Guangxi is a revolutionary and federalist hotbed. Strong Federalist sympathies lie with the Yue Army and the gentry. Chen Lianbo is mayor of the city and leader of the merchant dominated Association of All Classes to Save Guangdong, an association determined to ally liberals and the Political Science Clique to form a regionalist bloc.\n\nYunnan's occupation and intervention into other provincial matters is not unique to Tang's policies. During Cai E's leadership, Yunnanese forces were garrisoned in Sichuan at the expense of other provinces. Indeed such expeditions have prepared Yunnan for the extraordinary task of southern unification.\n\nBoth Guangdong and Guangxi regional assemblies have been suspended for the time being due to political chaos. If the old assemblies are allowed to convene and vote, they will likely select regionalists close to the old order. If we \"vet\" who gets to return to the assembly, will anger some people but will ensure \"true\" federalists remain in power."
 YUN.midgame.130.a: "As long as they are loyal, we will respect provincial autonomy."
 YUN.midgame.130.b: "Warlords and other subversives shall be replaced before elections."

 YUN.midgame.131.t: "The Tang Jiyao Government"
 YUN.midgame.131.d: "In the ever expanding Yunnanese bureaucracy that now encompasses Southern China, Tang Jiyao's bureaucracy and government has been ever growing. His inner circle are still made up of his family members such as his brother in law Dong Ze, his brother Tang Jiyu, and his son Tang Xiaoying. His secretaries maintain critical positions within the government such as Wang Jiuling, Li Yukan, and Bai Zhihan and are close confidents to the general's secrets and plans.\n\nThe PGP and Zhang Taiyan are championed as the political base of the Party, a mix of Federalist and liberal intellectuals and legislators. They also by extension include the now merged Grand Republican Alliance, an umbrella of pro-Federlaist groups. While the GRA is a prima facie democratic coalition beset on ending years of instability and autocracy; Tang is worried in regards to the factionalism within the groups. In particular, the Vice President, Chen Jiongming's Cantonese and Hakka origins holds sway in Guangdong while Zhao Hengti, the Federalist governor of Hunan has long ruled the province.\n\nThere is also the military, which is dominated by the Yunnan Army but has been forced to supplement themselves with absorbed military forces, militias, and even bandits. Even the original Yunnan Army was not fully loyal to Tang, with Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu proving to be less than trustworthy deputies. In their absence, Tang has staffed his military leadership with favorable candidates such as Zhang Weihan and Sun Du, who bring with them - both experience and loyalty to the ever evolving regime."
 YUN.midgame.131.a: "Tang Jiyao can always count on the bureaucracy to execute his will."
 YUN.midgame.131.b: "Zhang Taiyan and the Federalist movement are why we fight!"
 YUN.midgame.131.c: "To win, we must trust our officers and our allied provinces."

 YUN.midgame.132.t: "Luo Longji Organises the Crescent Moon"
 YUN.midgame.132.d: "Since his publications on human rights, Luo Longji has acheieved a name for himself within the southern liberals and democratic bloc. As the now rising star of the liberal movement, he has been at work with slowly repairing the connections between the Crescent Moon Society (CMS) and the old Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties (the coalition of various independents, minor parties, and cliques - who are following the federalist movement but wary of the potential of authoritarianism). In addition to organising the day to day operations of the FCDP, Luo also has been hard at work in publishing articles and opinions in the Minzhu Zhoukan (Democratic Weekly) and Minzhu Ribao (Democratic Daily News); sometimes containing a tint of leftist admiration in his writings in support of the democratic principles behind the Second French Revolution.\n\nWith new found power and role, comes new found responsibility in preparation for national unification. Of course, Luo could certainly strengthen the Chinese democratic coalition by tying in the activities with the CMS with Tang Jiyao and the Grand Republican Alliance. There are of course problems to this - Tang is still a warlord and there are may be some hesitance in how committed the military leaders are to the preservation of democracy. In the alternative, Luo could could also focus on \"constructive critique from the outside\" and try and gather more wavering intellectuals into the CMS movement. This could encourage free speech and thought in the democratic process although at the cost of southern unity. Finally, a third option, could be to simply align with the various warlords under Tang's rule and take their money and sanctuary. Perhaps Tang Jiyao cannot be trusted after all and it may be in Luo's best interest, to find a greater benefactor before a potential ousting."
 YUN.midgame.132.a: "Tang is capable of leading the revolution!"
 YUN.midgame.132.b: "A healthy opposition creates a vibrant democracy."
 YUN.midgame.132.c: "There are better options than Tang."

 YUN.midgame.133.t: "A History of Federalism in China"
 YUN.midgame.133.d: "The first stage of federalism (1895-1911) drew on from the observance of Chinese intelligentsia who looked to the United States and Switzerland. Liang Qichao led the initial charge by stating that federalism did not make a vast country like China weaker and the Tongmenghui echoed these calls by declaring that China deserved a republican government. Provincial assemblies operated de facto independent of Beijing's government and some provinces even flirted with the idea of autonomous provinces bound together in a federation.\n\nThe second stage of Federalism (1912-1920) drew upon the betrayal by Yuan Shikai towards the Republic of China. Federalism emerged as a weapon against the Yuan Shikai government, by increasing provincial autonomy and promoting true democratic ideals. After Yuan's death and the subsequent split between the Chinese Nationalist Party and Chinese progressives; federalist ideals largely fell on deaf ears. But in 1917 when reunification talks failed, federalism movements again became popular with politician Xiong Xiling pleading for the provinces to come together to draft a federalist constitution and convene an assembly.\n\nThe third and current stage of Chinese Federalism thus reflects the pinnacle of the federalist revolutionary movement. In 1920, Hunan took the first step and created a provincial constitution. Such ideas were also found to be in tandem with the success of Meiji Japan and the strength of the West. A true democracy is one where popular sovereignty belongs to the people and with powers unreserved given to the provinces. These sentiments were also reflected by the growing regionalism of Chinese politics with cliques and parties now being drawn from loyalty to their home provinces rather than Beijing. Federalist writers argue that the independence of the provinces and their unique strengths will ultimately strengthen the greater nation-state rather than weaken it, by allowing self government and development independent from the halls of Beijing."
 YUN.midgame.133.a: "Federalism is our way to restore harmony between nation and provinces."
 YUN.midgame.133.b: "Federalism is a means to the end of a constitutional, democratic republic."

 YUN.midgame.134.t: "Legacy of November 4th"
 YUN.midgame.134.d: "Following the leaking of documents that exposed the Beiyang government's secret deals trading Shandong for predatory Entente loans in October of 1919, a vast array of national unrest especially in Beijing broke out in November 4th.\n\nThe anti-imperialist outlook of the protests triggered a new wave of intellectualism that flourished and developed contemporary Chinese political thought. Influenced by this evolutionary, teleological notion of time and history, many November 4th intellectuals viewed the modern \"to be 'new' (xin), to be consciously opposed to the 'old' (jiu).\" This progressive and temporalised way of understanding modernity \"Occidentalism\", a radical and iconoclastic ideology that in its extremist expression called for a complete \"westernisation of Chinese culture.\"\n\nThe Crescent Moon Society, have for the most part - rejected this iconclaism. Instead, they reflected critically on the nature of western thought on Chinese political and cultural institutions. To them, there was no difference between the old and the new. Rather efforts should be devoted to appreciating both the Western and the East, the old and the new. Writers like Wen Yiduo have affirmed the \"fluctuation of new thoughts\" brought about by the new literary movement, because it \"represented our consciousness to seek for the spirit of a new time.\" In all, they seek a new syncretic ideal without explicitly rejecting the old and promoting the new, but the start of a new political culture.\n\nTang Jiyao himself was initially sympathetic to the nationalist unrest in November 4th but has also tried to restrict student activism and has enforced strict decrees that require representatives to assembly rather than protest. He has also remarked that the new culture thought of those like the Crescent Moon Society are mere philosophical and political ramblings without apparent justifications; suspiciously finding them as counter-productive."
 YUN.midgame.134.a: "Truly we embrace a new culture!"
 YUN.midgame.134.b: "Their pontificating is pointless."

 YUN.midgame.135.t: "America and the Federalist Movement"
 YUN.midgame.135.d: "The Federalist Movement has historically had two inspirations; the United States of America and the German Empire. Many in the Crescent Moon Society had studied in the United States and early Federalist intellectuals found that the American experiment was the first true federalist democracy. With the collapse of the States into its second civil war, these ideas are of course challenged especially given China's precarious situation.\n\nOne of the predecessors of the Crescent Moon Society was the Great River Association. During the early 1920s, Liang Shiqiu, Wen Yiduo, and Luo Longji had met at the Drexel hotel (not far from where Wen and Liang were students at the University of Chicago). There the men drafted a manifesto and formed the Da Jiang Hui (Great River Association), which they believed symbolised the glorious past of China by likening it to China's historic Yellow River. Their manifesto argued that (1) Nationalism is needed to fight foreign imperialism, (2) Democracy and human rights must be implemented, and (3) a state controlled economy is needed to change the nation and prevent class struggle. This system would be driven by American federalist principles; seeking a strong federal government with checks and balances at each turn to ensure a vibrant democracy.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhang Taiyan rejected the American federalist model as incompatible with China. First, the structure of power of the federalist Chinese republic would be based in local communities. Instead of power centralised at the top in the hands of the premier and the president, the federalist republic would disperse power among the civilian and military leaders in the provinces. Second, the source of power of the federalist republic would be drawn from the local, treating the provinces as sovereign states and creating a confederation based on agreement.Third, there would be a central government implementing national policies and representing China in the \"family of nations,\" but the power of the central powerful would be severely restricted."
 YUN.midgame.135.a: "A democracy just like the American states!"
 YUN.midgame.135.b: "To emulate America is to be un-Chinese."

 YUN.midgame.136.t: "Red Scare in Southern China"
 YUN.midgame.136.d: "As the federalist revolution continues to grow in southern China, it has naturally come into conflict with the hotbed of the Chinese socialist movement ranging from anarchists, communists, syndicalists, and of course the Kuomintang. From their guerrilla bases in Guangdong and Fujian to the dockyards of Shanghai and Hong Kong, the socialist movement brutally suppressed in 1932 continues to grow as the capitalist world recovers from the aftershocks of black monday. From pamphlets to open strikes, the socialists have denounced the Federalist movement as an unholy union between the warlords and the bourgeoisie, staining the glories of the social nationalist revolution with blood soaked hands and capitalist greed.\n\nSome liberals had found an ideological partner within more libertarian socialist groups such as the anarchists. Zhang Taiyan has long written on his idea of a utopian democracy that shares many of the similar views of Chinese anarchists in denouncing feudal Confucian world views in favor of a greater Datong. Zhang's break with the Paris Anarchists (the \"Four Elders of the Kuomintang\") over matters concerning the direction of the revolution and revolution versus evolution, would lead to the former breaking with the socialist revolutionary movement.\n\nWhile calmer voices advocate for peaceful relations with the Reds, many like Liang Shiqiu in particular have taken aim at leftist literature from those written by prominent Chinese syndicalists in the port cities to even those written by Kuomintang leftists in exile in Europe. Liang has taken direct aim at political works advocating for class struggle as merely nothing but \"crypto-Narodism\". Leftist newspapers have been shut down or told to diminish their publications. In some cases, strike and labour leaders have also been openly arrested for inciting insurrection against the democratic revolution. It's clear from both the Federalist movement and the Crescent Moon Society; that the communist revolution cannot and will not overtake their efforts for a free China."
 YUN.midgame.136.a: "Give peace a chance."
 YUN.midgame.136.b: "Better dead than red."

 YUN.midgame.137.t: "Criticisms within the Crescent Moon"
 YUN.midgame.137.d: "The Crescent Moon Society (CMS) had not always been the political force it is today. Originally, like many parties - it began with a group of friends with a vision and a dream; and now encompasses an electric ideology that blends social democracy and right. As the movement grew, some of its founders like Xu Zhimo felt that its true ideals were drenched with the filth of \"unbearable petit bourgeois odour.\" To Xu, the ideal CMS is one akin to gatherings around those like Rossetti and Shaw, as the minds of few open boundless political, aristic, and ideological fields.\n\nXu Zhimo had been the face and glue of the CMS, holding its disparate factions together. He had married the younger sister of Zhang Junmai in what had become a turbulent, dramatic, and whirlwind romance that ended with the two being close friends. A student of Betram Russel and Harold Laski, at Cambridge - Xu then remarried a second time to a married woman and was subsequently cut off from his family. Disgraced by his family, Xu turned to writing and several jobs before passing away in a tragic plane accident in 1931. His artistic prose style was marked by a departure from halyconic tunes and a greater embrace of the uncertainty of a nihilistic future.\n\nIn the absence of his death, the CMS has betrayed his vision and has become a much larger political third force; but his influence still remains prevalent. There are those within the movement, such as Sun Dayu and Shao Xunmei - who have embraced these tunes - drawn by the terrifying nature of machines, industry, sensual imagery, and grotesque themes. These writers advocate for the CMS' doctrine to turn more to the left; while others have advocated for a more orthodox approach to the political right. These so-called rightists have urged that the direction of the movement be drawn to the current establishment in order to make them mor amenable to the ever-evolving political landscape. Alternatively, simply letting the factions criticise each other may simply make them more moldable to our own purposes."
 YUN.midgame.137.a: "There is beauty in the violence of the modern world."

 YUN.midgame.137.c: "The factions remain torn apart."

 YUN.midgame.138.t: "Federalist Nationalism"
 YUN.midgame.138.d: "Nationalism dominates Chinese political thought in this era of the anti-imperialist struggle. However, for the Federalists this has been a difficult banner to fly under. While of course the Federalist movement hopes to destroy the foreign concessions and drive out China's imperialistic enemies like the German and Japanese Empire; the Federalists must also maintain a careful line with regionalist authorities.\n\nTang Jiyao himself believes in a powerful central state that could manage the province's autonomy but is ultimately devoted to the concept of a nation-state that is able to repel foreign influences. Indeed in Yunnan, nationalism varies from those who seek to be seen as commercial equals with the foreigners and the others who hope to drive the devils from Chinese shores at all costs. A unique nationalistic regionalism has thus emerged by building national autonomy through local development which in turns creates a unique identity.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhang Taiyan holds more...esoteric beliefs. Zhang's concept of nationalism was trapped between conflicting narratives of what a nation is - one that continually is moving forward together, but is somehow also tied to the past. National Essence therefore is the solution to true nationalism. National Essence is one where a nation does not have a state, and one whose presence/return needs institutional embodiment in the state. Local provincial governments may at times be more helpful to deal with foreign governments rather than relying on the bureaucratic nature of a centralised state."
 YUN.midgame.138.a: "The central government must be strong enough to fight off imperialists!"
 YUN.midgame.138.b: "We can only rely on the collective provinces to fight off imperialism!"

 YUN.midgame.139.t: "Education and Thought Control"
 YUN.midgame.139.d: "Despite being the standard-bearer of the Federalist revolution, Tang is nonetheless still described by his opponents as nothing more than an opportunistic warlord. He has already begun to implement his influence in universities by reforming them and propagating his ideology. The recently constructed Donghu University staffed by Tang Jiyao's brother-in-law mandates a curriculum that is molded and approved by Tang's top officials. Denouncements from the Crescent Moon Society have arisen as a result of reported clashes between Donghu students and leftist students in the provinces.\n\nTang's mass education programme has extended not just to universities but also to popular education, building primary schools, vocational schools, night schools, and lecture schools. Radical students have taken it to organise vernacular and patriotic dramas and plays expressing socialist sentiments which has often led to clashes between the Donghu students. In some cases, military cadets have also reportedly stormed student headquarters and dorms; often to the muted responses from Tang's office.\n\nLiang Shiqiu of the CMS has denounced the suppression against free speech and thought within the provinces. He writes that the result of thought control would drive the people into three groups. In the first group would be those who had ideas but could not compromise their principles with the practice of thought control; consequently, they would either be forced to retire or compelled to join the revolution. The second group were the opportunists, those who had the education but had no principles and were without courage. The last group would consist of those who would not think except in blind obedience. Under such circumstances, the best brains and most courageous ones would be purged; only the opportunists and the ignorant masses remained. As such, Liang in his writings has pleaded for tolerance, freedom of thought, and liberal education."

 YUN.midgame.160.t: "Reflections on Human Rights"
 YUN.midgame.160.d: "In an age of great political thinkers and nationalists eager to revive the Chinese nation; Luo Longji is one of the few prolific liberals within the Chinese nation. Admitted in 1913 to Tsinghua Preparatory School for Studying in the United States in Beijing, Luo became a student leader during the November 4th protests. In 1921, he went to study political science at the University of Wisconsin, Columbia University, and then the London School of Economics and Political Science. Following Sun Chuanfang's purge of the centre left and socialists in 1932, Luo and the Tsinghua University faction found a haven in Yunnan, where they continued to publish liberal critiques of the current government.\n\nIn his latest work \"On Human Rights\" - Luo writes that \"To be a person, speaking frankly, requires that one have the happiness of being a person, and life requires that one have the well-being of life. In order to enjoy the well-being of life, the various conditions [mentioned above] clothing, food, shelter, and bodily safety-are not enough.\"\n\nDrawing heavily on the traditions of the West, Luo creates an ontological study of liberalism from the Magna Carta to the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. In his magnum opus, Luo defines human rights as what one can enjoy and contribute to society, providing for instance the freedom of speech and how infringement of such a right constitutes a deprivation of natural rights. Moreover, he also goes on to explain the nature of the social compact, invoking Hobbes' imagery of a state that betrays its part of the social compact as a state that is not worth obeying. Where human rights are lost, then there is a revolution - of course, Luo clarifies that this is not a revolution of the Marxist nature (of class struggle) but rather one of freedom. He finally concludes his work with remarks on the importance of the rule of law, and that a nation's legal framework begins with a firm understanding of constitutional law - a clearly defined constitution that will protect the rights of all the states' citizens."

While the society is dominated nowadays by Luo Longji, Wen Yiduo, and Liang Shiqiu following the untimely death of Xu Zhimo, there are other Chinese intellectuals who have fled to the Southwest in the hopes of finding a safe haven for their ideas.\n\nPan Guangdan is a Tsinghua graduate who studied in the United States. A sociologist, eugenicist, and ethnologist, he is most interested in working with the ethnic minorities in Yunnan and the Chinese Southwest.\n\nZhu Guangqian left the mainland to study at the University of Hong Kong, the prestigious western-oriented university in the Legation Cities. During his studies, he became heavily influenced by the New Culture Movement by Liang Qichao and Hu Shi - tying their work to his own interest in aesthetics and psychology.\n\nWu Wenzao is a sociologist, anthropologist, and ethnologist - interested in the study of the Tibetan peoples. Influenced by writers such as Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, Sun Yat-sen, Hu Shi, and Liang Qichao - Wu is also a Tsinghua graduate who has studied for sometime in the United States.\n\nLi Gongpu is a former member of the Chinese Kuomintang but has since distanced himself from the Nationalist Party even before the collapse of the NRA during the Northern Expedition. He then moved to the United States before studying at Reed College. Following a brief stint in the States, he returned to Shanghai where he worked as a newspaper editor with socialists such as Liu Xi and Ai Shiqi.

 YUN.midgame.162.t: "Lunatic Zhang and the Su Bao Case"
 YUN.midgame.162.d: "Not even a generation ago, revolutionary sentiment flowed throughout China as hopeful dreamers dared dream of a free and revived nation. Zhang Taiyan like many of the brave martyrs also joined the call for freedom as a patriot. In 1903 after falling out with Kang Youwei and Sun Yat-sen (finding the former not radical in hatred against the Manchus) over how to carry out revolution, he published \"Refuting Kang Youwei's Theory of Revolution\" criticising the Qing monarchy and wrote a preface for Zou Rong's \"Revolutionary Army\" which was published in the Su Bao, a radical newspaper that called for the overthrow of the Qing.\n\nAs the newspaper was situated in the jurisdiction of Shanghai, the International Settlement authorities and the Qing court tried and convicted Zhang and Zou of inciting insurrection against the Great Qing. In an initial sentencing that shocked audiences in the west due to the draconian nature of the punishment sought by the Qing, with the influence of western authorities - Zhang and Zou was sentenced to three years in prison. During his time in imprisonment, the zealous revolutionary continued to write from his cell praising that \"Heaven has given me the national essence.\"\n\nBoth Zhang and Zou pledged a hunger strike to protest the tyrannical Manchu oppression on the freedom of speech. Unfortunately Zou's fragile health combined with the hunger strike led to his death at the early age of twenty. Zhang persisted through the tribulations and insisted that it was his near fanatical study of the Buddhist sutras that kept him alive throughout the ordeal.\n\nAfter leaving prison, Zhang became a national hero and a celebrated revolutionary hero. Nicknamed \"Lunatic Zhang\" for his outspoken zealous advocacy and passion for a truly liberal and democratic Republic of China, the long standing exploits of this hero are told in books, novels, and in the classroom as one of the brave heroes against imperial authority. Today, nationalists look to the Su Bao case as either a case of free speech or one where martyrs do anything to drive out imperialists."

 YUN.midgame.163.t: "The Direction of the PGP"
 YUN.midgame.163.d: "After 1925, Tang Jiyao reached out to Duan Qirui in an attempt to lobby support from the north. When that failed, in July of 1926 - opposing the revolutionary factions that had sprung up in the Chinese south - Tang formed his own political party. The now Minzhidang (People's Government Party) claimed to have a unique ideology independent of foreign influence - compatible with Zhang Taiyan's Chinese essence. The party champions a democracy of a federalist nature devoid of autocratic vanguardist leadership but seeks to also syncretise with the concept of national essence. Several members from the Awaken Lion Society also joined Tang, finding an ideological compatibility.\n\nNational Essence derives itself from Japan and seeks to create China's own Kokutai, realising the nature of Zhonghua by studying the Chinese classics. Zhang and other nationalists look to the halcyonic days when China's cultural, territorial, and societal integrity were kept intact before the rapine nature of the barbaric northern hordes. National Essence is one where a nation does not have a state and one whose presence return needs institutional embodiment in the state. Once China had achieved her National Essence, she was to help the other oppressed countries find their own - such as India.\n\nWhile the two men may have come from different backgrounds, in the ever changing Chinese political landscape; both Tang and Zhang have found common ground. Zhang founded the Society for Promoting the Self Rule Movement in 1922 and sought to find military support. Given that his followers were composed mostly of intellectuals (such as the Society for National Learning) who would much rather focus on the Chinese heroic epics and classics; Zhang sought time and time again to find military support for his revolutionary movement. Following his entry into Yunnan, he has found an eager ear in Tang Jiyao's PGP - whose federalist ideology now seeks to syncretise with Zhang's National Essence nationalism."

 YUN.midgame.163.b: "Truly we strive to achieve National Essence!"

 YUN.midgame.164.t: "Tang Jiyao, Yunnan's National Champion"
 YUN.midgame.164.d: "For the past years, Yunnan Province has been led by the dominating presence of Tang Jiyao. While denounced as a warlord by many, Tang is just one of many complicated characters in China's turbulent revolutionary history.\n\nBorn to a wealthy family, like many of his compatriots determined to have a strong education - Tang became a soldier in Tokyo and participated in the Lujuntuan (Army Society) and Wuxueshe (Military Study Society) during his stay. One of the authors of the Wuxue Zhazhi (Military Studies Magazine), the ever patriotic Tang joined the Tongmenghui as an early member. However, early doubts were raised regarding his loyalty when he apparently refused to go on strike against a Japanese crackdown and was accused of betraying his fellow students to the Yunnan Provincial Assembly. Critical of the \"spiritual education\" that Japanese troops received, Tang advocated for a detailed study of Wang Yangming. He became friends with the legendary general Cai E and helped the former plot the 1911 revolution in Kunming.\n\nWhen the revolution created a new Republic of China, the ever cautious Tang sided with the reformist side following the conflict between the reformers and revolutionaries in the chaotic early Warlord period. Since the death of Cai E, Tang's leadership of Yunnan has seen the province either intervene in nearby Liangguang politics or refuse to partake and to wait out the storm. A military man who insists on ruling as a civilian leader and is indeed officially outside the military hierarchy; there is no question that Tang maintains absolute control of the military and his affairs. A grandiose figure with his portrait frequently seen on coinage, schools, and newspaper articles - there is no doubt that Tang's presence in China's southeastern province is insurmountable. The province and his military either follow the esteemed leader in his martial leadership or his apparent commitment to a true revolution."
 YUN.midgame.164.a: "We follow the man himself!"
 YUN.midgame.164.b: "He represents something far greater!"

 YUN.midgame.165.t: "Tang Jiyao's Inner Circle"
 YUN.midgame.165.d: "Tang Jiyao casts himself as a strongman, a savior in China's distress - even playing himself in the 1926 film \"The War of Hongxian\" set in the National Protection War. Of course, even strongmen cannot lead without the aid of his trusted men. Tang Jiyao's top brass consists of men from the military and politicians who have a sworn provincial loyalty to their beautiful mountains and to the ever grand leadership of the province's warlord.\n\nWang Jiuling is a Japanese educated Yunnan politician. He participated in Yunnan's Xinhai revolution and as a result of his loyalty to the new republican regime was rewarded a handsome position as Tang Jiyao's secretary and finance director. A tacit negotiator, Wang helped organise several deals with the Beiyang Government and was rewarded a post of Minister of Education under Duan Qirui. In 1924, he returned to Yunnan to work in the Salt Commission and Fudian Bank.\n\nDing Zhaoguan, is also a Japanese educated politician who served in the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department before returning to Yunnan to serve as principal of Yunnan Law and Politics College. A prominent attorney, Ding became a judge and has played the role of legal counselor to Tang Jiyao.\n\nMeng Youwen, is Tang's head of security; in charge of ensuring the warlord's security and safety from enemies within the province and abroad. Tang Shaoqing and He Shixiong are some Yunnan Military Academy officers who are said to be among Tang Jiyao's most trusted generals and have stated that they will follow the general to whichever future he so desires."
 YUN.midgame.165.a: "A province is built by finance and administration."
 YUN.midgame.165.b: "Of course the gun is mightier than the pen."

#Democratic Enthusiasm Ladder (190-219):

 YUN.midgame.190.t: "Banditry and Warlordism"
 YUN.midgame.190.d: "Even before the collapse of central government authority following the Xinhai Revolution, banditry has long been aproblem in Yunnan with bandit gangs and warlords taking advantage of the chaotic unrest following revolution. Throughout the 1920s, discharged miners, discontented ex-soldiers and hungry villagers were amongst the bands of bandits that roamed the countryside and even frequented village and city centers. Of course to many, there is little distinctions between military generals, warlords, and lowly bandits and at times the lines are certainly blurred. Overmilitarisation has also played a part in the growth of banditry across the province. With warlords and generals hiring thousands of conscripts, militias, and paramilitaries - these overzealous hirers forget the limited nature of their treasury coffers and often have defaulted on paying their soldiers. As a result, many of these violent and battle-hardened veterans have turned to banditry, street gangs, and mercnaaries to local landowners.\n\nEven Tang Jiyao's personal secretary Li Yunkun, is accused of holding connections with prominent Yunnan bandits like Zhang Jieba and Wu Xuezian. These bandits , with their large forces of former soldiers, are notorious for having launched mutinies in the past and whom have terrorised the locals. Not only do they typically steal riches, crops, weapons, and silver but opium while officially generally banned in the province is a popular commodity. Especially amongst the rural peasantry in the countryside, these bandits are terrifying with horror stories and rumors of bandits like Zhang Jieba eating the hearts of his enemies.\n\nWith these bandit groups growing even larger and organised all over [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s territory, the situation has grown increasingly dire as popular support for the Federalist movement is wavering. While Federalism of course champions local democracy and self government, a lack of popular support will render any enthusiasm for the federalist revolution to be moot. On the other hand, dealing with the bandits while some may argue to be necessary; is also a serious strain on the government's resources and capabilities."
 YUN.midgame.190.a: "Bandits can be cowed, it just takes time."
 YUN.midgame.190.b: "Someone must DO something!"

 YUN.midgame.191.t: "Warlords and Philosophers"
 YUN.midgame.191.d: "While many are in agreement that the revolution in China must be won with the help of military power due to the existence of foreign imperialists who are preparing to seize the entire Chiense country; tensions with those advocating for a more genuine and \"democratic revolution\" have frustrated the government's bureaucracy.\n\nLed by the scholar-intellectuals of those like Zhang Taiyan, growing criticism has arisen towards [ROOT.GetLeader]'s leadership. These criticisms have argued that [ROOT.GetLeader] is acting as a dictator and stifling learning by installing censorship and increasing the government's budget in favour of the military. Indeed for the most radical Federalists and liberals; the existence of a federal government is in itself tyranny and oppression of the peoples. These radicals have argued that the existence of a central government, a constitution, a parliament, and a national executive would merely bring the country towards a centralised dictatorship or towards endless civil war. Rather they preach that local autonomy must be championed as it has functioned so well in the absence of a central authority. To them, the three vices of Constitution, Congress, and President must be eradicated and that federal forces should instead be disbanded; with military power in the hands of the provinces. Only then will the military be used to serve the common defence and not for the exploitation of the people.\n\nThese ideas are largely supported by military generals and warlords who would love to keep their autonomy from centralised control and who pledge that they will use their forces for the security and protection of their home provinces. However, centralists and nationalists, have argued that these ideas seem to reinforce the concept of warlordism and that generals will simply monopolise power in their provinces for their own selfish desires."
 YUN.midgame.191.a: "A central government will breed a Chinese Savinkov."
 YUN.midgame.191.b: "This is just warlordism in sheep's clothing."

 YUN.midgame.192.t: "An Ancient Vice"
 YUN.midgame.192.d: "Papaver somniferum is an innocent looking flower but one that has earned the scorn and hatred of Chinese nationalists across the country. Users of the plant, commonly known as opium, report a euphoric high devoid of any pain and one that allows them to escape into their wildest fantasies.\n\nIt's not secret, that opium is widely used across the country despite the historic ban on this illicit substance. Southwest China is of course no exception, with the climate and dry arid heat perfect for cultivation of the cursed plant. Members of society from both the high classes to the lowest beggar on the street consume the drug; typically by smoking with it's dazy and flowery scent flowing openly through city streets. Opium travels here from South and Southeast Asia and into the rest of the country. Despite the government's nominal ban on opium, regulations remain loose as magistrates and enforcers have typically turned a blind eye for favours and bribes.\n\nThroughout the territory of [ROOT.GetNameDef] the issue of corruption extends not only to opium control but also the control and monopolies of public resources such as copper. Prominent individuals in the government have connections to these gentry and new aristocrats which has earned the suspicion and scorn especially amongst activists and journalists who have denounced this outright corruption."
 YUN.midgame.192.a: "Nothing wrong with a little smoke break."
 YUN.midgame.192.b: "Corruption must be thoroughly purged!"

 YUN.midgame.193.t: "Nationalism and the Federalist Movement"
 YUN.midgame.193.d: "As the Federalist movement is gaining traction, there is concern amongst nationalists and patriotis that the Federalist movement's championing of local provincial autonomy will divide the country rather than sustain it. While nationalists are united in their desire to see their country unified from Shenyang to Kunming and for the territories lost to the imperialists to be returned; such sentiments come into conflict with more local identities. The past few decades of warlordism have shown that people place greater faith in their local governments, their towns, their mayors and perhaps governors but nothing more beyond that.\n\nIndeed regional identities may very well challenge the unity of the Chinese people. Of course, written Chinese is the same but linguistical dialects from Cantonese to Hokkien to Hakka, to Miao are greater than just stylistic differences in tones but can themselves be classified as unique languages.\n\nNationalists proclaim that the Federalist movement is one to protect national integrity and that the nation is in itself and always will be China. However, with the growing emphasis on de-centralisation and local autonomy; a greater number of voices especially within the Federalist cause have urged that nationalism will only breed centralism and that true democracy belongs to China's many peoples and tribes rather than as one nation."
 YUN.midgame.193.a: "Let's tone down the regionalist rhetoric."
 YUN.midgame.193.b: "We are a country made of others, not of one."

 YUN.midgame.194.t: "Breaking the Elitist Mold"
 YUN.midgame.194.d: "Named after the Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore's Crescent Moon poems, the Crescent Moon Society has always prided itself on its pseudo-elitist organisation. An attendee at Sun Yat-sen's funeral, Chen Xiying has written in his \"Some Thoughts on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Funeral\" how unserious the young masses have become by shouting slogans and showing little mourning.\n\nIndeed the concept of an elitist group guiding the revolution rather than the revolution being led by the masses is an idea that is popular amongst members of the CMS. Luo Longji has called for a \"government by specialists\" likening the concept to Bernard Shaw, while others such as Liang Shiqiu - inspired by Irving Babbitt - share the distaste for extreme and radical ideas. As the logical and calculating CMS champions the classic values of reason and restraint over the general atmosphere of radical emancipation, they nonetheless did not fully negate emotion and imagination fully.\n\nDemocrats across the country claim to represent the common people but few can truly proclaim that they have spent years, months, or even days with the peasants toiling in the fields. With support for the federalist movement ever so high however, the CMS and other Democrat-aligned parties have appealed that the stage of military rule and governance shall end in favor of democracy now. Of course given their history, it's certainly ponderable whether or not they seek merely power for their own gain or truly power for the people."
 YUN.midgame.194.a: "Like scholars of old, we must guide the masses."
 YUN.midgame.194.b: "We'd be no better than mini-dictators..."

 YUN.midgame.195.t: "\"What am I Working For\""
 YUN.midgame.195.d: "Liang Shiqiu has recently completed an article for the Guangming Bao (Light Newspaper) titled \"What am I Working For.\" The article has spread rapidly across journals and outlets across China with many claiming it to be Liang's best piece and a true thesis of the Chinese democratic movement.\n\nTo thoroughly carry out resistance to the imperialists, recover China's complete territorial integrity and oppose all compromises with the imperialists.\n\nTo realise the spirit of democracy and end dictatorship and to establish an organ in which various parties and groups can discuss national affairs\n\nTo strengthen internal unity between various parties and groups.\n\nTo aid the Federalist Movement in executing National Reconstruction.\n\nTo firmly establish the unity of national authority, there must be a proper division of central and local authority.\n\nTo ensure the armed forces belong to the nation and are loyal to it, oppose party organisations within the military and the use of the military in party conflict.\n\nTo carry out the rule of law, protect the people's freedoms of life, property and person, and oppose all illegal punishments.\n\nTo respect intellectual and academic freedom, protect all legal speech, publication, assemblies and associations."
 YUN.midgame.195.a: "Our cause is just!"
 YUN.midgame.195.b: "This says hardly anything outstanding."

#UPC Satellite Narrative Events (300-329):
 YUN.midgame.300.t: "The Southern Confederation"
 YUN.midgame.300.d: "Huang Xing's Jing Flag now flies proudly in Kunming. Representatives from [YUN.GetLeader]'s government have arrived in Guangzhou today, officially declaring the creation of a Southern Confederation with Guangzhou. Indeed Federalists in the early 1920s had talked or perhaps even dreamed of forming a confederation to resist the whims of Beijing and the dictatorship of the Kuomintang. Truly, the dream of the National Protection Alliance and the Constitutional Protection Government, the true Republican dream for a unified China under a democratic government will be achieved.\n\nWith the Federalist movement now in full swing in Yunnan, hope and unification fever is rising throughout the ranks from the city streets to the highest political office. Tang Jiyao of course, has always ostensibly been a federalist but the Federalist movement faced true uncertainty and collapse with the Zhili victory and Xuantong Restoration. Now with the South unified under one Federalist confederation, the dreams of a national unification under a confederation of Chinese provinces is ever so near. Of course, with Federalism the main ideology of this democratic revolution; Zhang Taiyan's voice in government has emerged even louder. Zhang certainly holds strong if not radical and esoteric federalist tendencies and working with Zhang will prove to be an interesting dynamic.\n\nAs governor of Yunnan and of its military forces, Tang Jiyao has also had to deal with the fate of his chief rival and underling, the ambitious Long Yun and defence commissioner of Zhaotong. Of course Long Yun's service to Tang has long been admired but it's no secret that two men are contested in a bitter rivalry for control of the province. Some of Tang's private advisors have advised Tang to simply weaken and essentially exile Long Yun permanently by promoting him to the post of liaison officer between Guangzhou and Kunming (an essentially worthless job). On the other hand Long Yun's influence and experience can still prove to be useful and keeping him around in command may serve the greater good."
 YUN.midgame.300.a: "A new post as a liaison officer will suit him well."
 YUN.midgame.300.b: "Keep him by our side under close watch."

 YUN.midgame.301.t: "Democratic Education"
 YUN.midgame.301.d: "With the success of the Federalist revolution in the South, China's democratic revolution of federalist principles has arrived in Yunnan. The revolutionary fever that had filled the streets during the National Protection War has once again found itself in the streets of Kunming and Dali. Luo Longji and the Crescent Moon Society are now frequently in Guangzhou negotiating and working with the Federalist headquarters. In their absence, local Yunnan democrat organisations and parties have sprung up and have taken the initiative in local politics.\n\nTang Jiyao's mass education programme intends to help spread popular education, increasing the number of primary schools, vocational schools, night schools, and teacher training schools. The actual implementation of these schools is delegated to Su Honggang and Cun Shusheng who have been in charge of creating these schools and staffing them. As a result of a need of teachers, scholars and intellectuals from the North have been invited, which have earned them the moniker of the \"Beijing Group.\" This group's writings have also been criticised as radical by conservatives within the province but nonetheless they have stayed in their teaching roles at the encouragement of Su Honggang and Cun Shusheng - likely due to a lack of adequate professionals.\n\nThese programs have attracted a number of leftist radicals. Radical student groups led by ambitious patriotic students such as Wu Deng and Zhao Qinxian within the province have intermixed with these left-wing groups creating a united front named the \"New Yunnan Society\" with CSP funding. Naturally the creation of such radical left-wing groups is certainly one of concern for Tang Jiyao. While their nationalist slogans and ideas certainly resonate with the rest of the democratic revolution; their radical left wing ideals and declarations of class struggle could be problematic and divisive. Perhaps then, it is better to crack down on these radical leftist groups and to ensure that their participation in public meetings are limited."
 YUN.midgame.301.a: "These groups are examples that our democracy works."
 YUN.midgame.301.b: "Keep an eye on them with a heavy fist."

 YUN.midgame.302.t: "Addressing Military Regions"
 YUN.midgame.302.d: "Under Tang's pre-existing model of implementing federalism - the provincial government was the highest level of authority. Here, as the provincial governor, Tang had the virtually unlimited and unchecked power to appoint or dismiss all other officials until a constitution is drafted. Backed largely by the Yunnan chamber of commerce, Tang's government also tried to separate the military and civilian organisations. Yunnan was thus divided into four military regions; Hu Ruoyu in Kunming, Long Yun in Zhaotong, Li Xuanting in Dali, and Zhang Ruji in Mengzi.\n\nDespite the appearance of a government infrastructure, the decentralised aspect of Tang's rule has naturally led to problems within military districts. Giving garrison commanders their own districts only made them more autonomous and troops frequently extorted cash or resources from local cities and districts for money to upkeep their soldiers.\n\nAfter the failure of Tang's invasion into Guangxi, there were fears of a Kuomintang invasion into the province. Having originally divided his provincial command structure into four regions, he reshuffled it and scapegoated Zhang Ruji. Thus Long Yun received Kunming, Hu Ruoyu received Mengzi, and Li Xuangting remained in Dali, but reshuffled it again after the 1927 counter-coup. The outcome is now Tang Jiyao rules Kunming, Long Yun is sent back north to Zhaotong, Hu Ruoyu, Li Xuanting, and Zhang Ruji are stuck in Mengzi. Sun Du, a former Hu Ruoyu subordinate and rival of Zhang Ruji, was rewarded with the fief of Dali.\n\nNow with Yunnan a key player in the democratic revolution, there does not seem to be a need to maintain these military regions. At the behest of democrats within the province, Tang could formally abolish these regions and redistribute powers to counties and local provincial assemblies. On the other hand, trusting these democrats with local rule may be ineffective and lead to anarchy - and perhaps appointing loyalists from Long Yun's old regions will ensure peace and stability."
 YUN.midgame.302.a: "It's time to trust the will of the people."
 YUN.midgame.302.b: "The military regions are fine as they are."

 YUN.midgame.303.t: "Regionalism and the Republic"
 YUN.midgame.303.d: "As China's southwestern most province, despite being incorporated during China's early Han Dynasty - Yunnan has always enjoyed a history of independence and self-soverignty. Until the Mongols conquered Yunnan, the province was ruled separately of imperial China by the Kingdom of Nanzho and Dali. Furthermore, the province's cultural influences by Thervada Buddhism also reinforced the unique nature of Yunnanese cultural regionalism frmo the rest of China. Early attempts at independence during the Qing Dynasty failed under Wu Sangui (who attempted to found his own dynasty) and later an Islamic revolu under Du Wenxiu, who attempted to find \"Pingnanguo\" (Peaceful Southern Nation). Li Wenxue, the leader of a Yi tribe in Ailaoshan, also tried to launch an uprising against seemingly oppressive Han overlords.\n\nBy the late Qing Dynasty, dissatisfaction towards the Manchu and even Han led to the outbreak of sporadic violence and sentiments of Yunnanese independence. \"Sever-or-Die\" societies along with \"Protect-the-Land\" and \"Promote-the-Han\" societies were among those that formed in the collapse of Manchu authority and of which demanded immediate Yunnanese secession from the central government.\n\nThe Federal Government of the United Provinces of China ultimately seeks to bring all the territorial claims of the Republic of China under one national banner. Of course, this naturally means Yunnan and the potential fate of Yunnan being subject to yet another national government has provoked pro-regionalists and those falling within Zhang Taiyan's camp - who argue that Yunnan's identity is unique to that of Beijing. It's also suggested that perhaps Tang Jiyao shares a similar position of favouring a more local regional identity but Tang's true interests which he has conveyed publicly is the creation of a strong state to defend and defeat against foreign imperialism. Indeed, is it not important that it is the Republic which is supreme above all the provinces?"
 YUN.midgame.303.a: "Our regional identity is ours alone!"
 YUN.midgame.303.b: "But together we form one Nation!"

 YUN.midgame.304.t: "Provinical Constitutionalism"
 YUN.midgame.304.d: "During the early days of the Republic, when Republican and Federalist ideals were not diminished by the reality of the Warlord Era; there were many in Yunnan who wanted the province to have an autonomous constitution like Hunan. At the time Tang Jiyao refused to recognise a provincial constitution like Hunan. Tang has stressed time and time again the need for a strong central government which would thus eliminate the need for military activity and warlordism. And even when Cao Kun passed the 1923 Constitution, Tang refused to recognise Beijing's legislation and dug in on his beliefs.\n\nEven after the return of the Zhili Clique to national prominence in 1929, Tang Jiyao has still yet to accept the demands for a provincial constitution. The merchants and gentry have supported Tang's stance, likely enjoying their current lack of restraint of influence onto politics. However, since the establishment of a Federalist government in Guangzhou, democrats and democrat-aligned groups throughout the province have been demanding that a local provincial constitution be drafted at once in order to guarantee basic rights of assembly, property, speech, and right to pursue happiness.\n\nConfronted with the growing unrest and unhappiness of yet another year without provincial constitutional guarantees, Tang is once again confronted with the prospect of drafting and passing a Yunnanese constitution. His advisors have encouraged him to undertake significant caution in doing so and it is rumored that should Tang agree to a constitution; it will be a slow and arduous process with many drafts and revisions to accomplish. On the other hand, the success of the Federalist movement hinges on the unificaiton of the country under the Jing flag. Until then, guarantees on individual liberties will have to wait."
 YUN.midgame.304.a: "We'll begin the draft process (slowly)."
 YUN.midgame.304.b: "Unification is paramount."

 YUN.midgame.305.t: "Two Years and a Half of Rural Work"
 YUN.midgame.305.d: "Cun Shusheng was born in Heshun Township, Tengchong County, Yunnan. He studied in private school and later entered Heshun High School. During the first year of the Republic of China (1911), Cun Shusheng was admitted to Dali Middle School and graduated with distinction in 1915 and returned to teach at Heshun High School. After spending some time studying in Japan where he grew left-wing ties with the Creation Society.\n\nIn Yunnan, Cun has recently accomplished local provincial fame as the principal of Yiqun Middle School. The school is trained in accordance with the Hellenistic tradition of \"Spartan training\" and a strict Spartan training and spirit is enforced in both physical and academic work. Teachers and students help pull weeds carry soil, grow vegetables, plant trees, and repair the campus by themselves. Even the cleaning of roads in the township of Yiqun are undertaken by students. Students are organised in a student fire brigade to help fight fires as well as a assist farmers with winter ploughing, protecting forests, building water conservancy projects, develop fisheries, and create poultry industries. In order to improve the quality of teaching, Cun has also invited technical and educational specialists from Kunming.\n\nIn response to his successes with the education in Yiqun, Cun has published his experiences in his book \"Two and a Half Years of Rural Work.\" Critics like Wu Han have described that the book depicts how \"a single spark can start a prairie fire and that the torch of the towsnship will give bright enlightenment to the whole country and the whole nation.\"\n\nGiven his new found prominence in provincial and even national politics, Cun's influence can certianly help bolster the Tang Jiyao regime. Cun certainly supports Tang's nationalism and working with Tang to secure the liberation of China from anti-imperialism but has also commented against Tang's more authoritarian principles. Owing to his left-wing and democratic ties to the Creation Society; criticism of Tang's regime will surely benefit Yunnan's left wing."
 YUN.midgame.305.a: "Tang will help achieve revolution!"
 YUN.midgame.305.b: "Tang the Tyrant!"

 YUN.midgame.306.t: "A New Legislature?"
 YUN.midgame.306.d: "In the 1920s, like many other provincial governors - Tang Jiyao attempted to install democratic reforms in his home province. In an ambitious legislature overhaul attempt, Tang attempted to redistribute delegate seats to allow poorer areas to vote for representatives through met pushback. These reforms would extend participation to all levels of society, but has been met by resistance by conservatives who refuse to accept a greater diluted democratic process. While not explicitly provided in any Yunnan law, gerrymandering effectively dominates the electoral process as those in the legislature are able to draw the borders between electoral districts.\n\nThe Political Science Clique and Gu Pingzhen continued to stall the strengthening of the legislature however and the assembly divided into rival factions that kept fighting and installing their candidates. Furthermore, these divisions have only sowed horrid tensions between sectors of society with the left-wing actively denouncing the local gentry and merchant class for classism and elitist attitudes in denying their less fortunate brothers and sisters the chance to participate in democracy. Now in [GetYear], the legislature is essentially ossified as it's controlled largely in the hands of Yunnan's gentry, merchants, and other local (warlord) elites. The Democrats of Yunnan have urged that the districts are to be redrawn and for gerrymandering to be outlawed in favour of more fair district borders. Of course, this has attracted the irate of conservatives and those who prefer the current status quo (such as Hu Ruoyu's camp); who have instead held that they will not hold new elections for the time being. The resulting backlash has led to an outcry of fury among the democrats with many finding allies within Yunnan's left such as the New Yunnan Society."
 YUN.midgame.306.a: "No new elections for the time being."
 YUN.midgame.306.b: "Ok, maybe they have a point."

 YUN.midgame.307.t: "Campus Wars"
 YUN.midgame.307.d: "Since 1902, Yunnan provincial schooling was drastically changed by the Guangxu Emperor's edict which closed traditional schools like Kunming Academy and reorganised them into modern schools. Two normal schools were founded, one for each gender, and also a School of Mines and a School of Law and Politics. By the 1920s, around 2,000 students had been enrolled in Kunming's 10 modern schools with students being naturally politically active. Those that went to study in Beijing or the major cities and who returned to Yunnan have been known to be increasingly radical.\n\nIt all started with a pamphlet denouncing the Tang Jiyao regime in the halls of Number One Provincial Middle School. The pamphlet declared boldly that Tang Jiyao and his warlord generals were going to draft all students and force them into the military. The pamphlet extended to a list of demands: the importance of anti-imperialism in the national revolution, the end of all military funding in favor of provincial development, pacifism to destroy the power of the warlords, and the resurrection of defunct groups such as the Dian Chao student publication and Da Tong Association. What started as a simple protest soon escalated to other schools with students demanding the Kunming Military Academy be shut down. Violence has extended past mere brawls and fighting words as well; the Director of the Military Academy has issued a direct order to forbid his students from carrying knives.\n\nTang has tried to move students with the carrot and not the stick by reasserting his influence in universities and reforming them and propagating his ideology. Supported by his brother-in-law Dong Ze, his Donglu University seeks to be a model institutional hall of benevolent education. Donglu's loyalist sentiment has attracted the hatred of radical students who view the school as nothing more than the establishment's cult of personality. Clashes between the radical students and Donglu students have become more frequent - school headmasters have pleaded for Tang to act quickly."
 YUN.midgame.307.a: "These schoolboys will wet themselves with blood."
 YUN.midgame.307.b: "Let's all just calm down now."

 YUN.midgame.308.t: "Yunnan's Local Self-Government"
 YUN.midgame.308.d: "As one of his more immediate democratic reforms, Tang had previously sought to strengthen local self government in Yunnan. His programme to create committee meetings and departments amongst local villages staffed by both those from the upper and lower classes may have been hopeful - but has attracted nothing more than anger from local leadership.\n\nVillage heads and officials, citing a shortage of funds and lack of trained personnel to execute the self-government programme, have denounced Tang's plans as hopeless and stupidly idealistic. In areas where the reform measures were fully implemented, officials complained of basically endless committee meetings lasting from sundown to sunrise with effectively zero conclusive results as a result of whole nights of bickering and virtually no compromises. In his first iteration, Tang attempted to readapt the self government programme to only roughly eight relatively wealthy districts (Kunming, Ami, Mengzi, Yiliang, Geju, Simao, Huizi, and Tengzhong) as these wealthier districts may have more ltierate populaces. These attempts saw some local successes but still saw a widening gap between rich and poor districts.\n\nIn 1923, a power struggle had also emerged in Maguan District between the incumbent district official and newly elected head of the local self government committee, which saw the district official fired. The district official however simply stayed on and the resulting chaos led to a severe rice shortage. The district capital was then seized by a Yi bandit leader, Wang Shizen, who then drove out the district official and seized power for himself.\n\nWith the Federalist Movement now in full swing and the constant pleading for power to be delegated to the towns, villages, and small cities of China - Tang has once again reasserted his former local self-government plans in the hopes of improving support for the federalist revolution. Of course, the gentry have voiced their opposition; citing Tang's past failures and that such measures will be a lack of resource. They have insisted to maintain the current status quo and to allow things to be ruled as they are."
 YUN.midgame.308.a: "The gentry is right."
 YUN.midgame.308.b: "Who cares what the gentry thinks, Tang is right."

 YUN.midgame.309.t: "The Continued Issue of Banditry"
 YUN.midgame.309.d: "During his leadership of Yunnan and prior to the National Protection War, Cai E had petitioned the government in Beijing to allow the Yunnan Army to leave Guizhou. Tang Jiyao had supported this petition but Yuan Shikai had sided with Guizhou's elites and appointed Tang as governor. While Tang had been warned against setting the precedent of a province annexing its neighbour, the Guizhou Expedition was also a justification for Tang to suppress banditry.\n\nThe Expedition cemented Tang's status as Governor of Yunnan. All in all, the forces of Guizhou were foribily disarmed, and a number of them were put to the sword under Tang's supervision and tossed in a mass grave in order to send a message. The rest of Guizhou's forces and civilians were imprisoned without trial. Of particular interest to Tang would be those who belonged to the Self-Government Society and Gelaohui members. The brutality of the occupation can be attributed to both the factionalism of the time period and Tang's venomous hatred of the region's presumed \"rapists and robbers.\"\n\nIn the end, Tang managed to secure control of Guizhou through his relationship with the Constitutional Association who lobbied on Tang's belief and were responsible for administration. But Tang's brutal occupation of Guizhou has certainly proven to be an effective precedent in dealing with banditry. It's no secret that banditry continues to plague Yunnan especially given the province's vast expanses and mountainous terrains. Troops often cut deals or even joined these criminal-gangs in Kunming which at one point even openly sold plundered wares and kidnapped women off the street. Children of wealthy families have been reported to be kidnapped from schools and held at ransom. As such with banditry a continued problem, perhaps an heavy hand is needed to bring law and order. On the other hand many bandits are also former soldiers. As manpower issues may arise the longer our wars continue, perhaps utilising their services for the good of the people will be helpful as well."

##Section 3c (400-599): Mid Game KMT Political Events

#RKMT First Congress Chain (400-429)
 YUN.midgame.400.t: "The National Congress at Guangzhou"
 YUN.midgame.400.d: "With the fall of Guangzhou, the Kuomintang junta has enough legitimacy to hold a national party congress. This Congress is expected to attract figures far beyond the military men who first holed up in Guizhou. The right wing of the Kuomintang is a diverse collection of factions, divided even before Kuomintang began the Northern Expedition.\n\nThey can be broadly subdivided into three camps with fault lines in the power struggles that emerged after Sun Yat-sen's death. The \"Old Right\" primarily consists of those who supported Hu Hanmin and generally includes civilian factions with lineages from the liberal, pre-Xinhai Tongmenghui. These include the Elders Clique (EDC), the Western Hills Clique (WHC), and more loosely the Reconstruction Faction (RCF) and the Old Political Science Clique (PSC). The \"New Right\" is used to describe Chiang Kai-shek's followers, who tentatively supported the United Front with the CSP against the \"Old Right\" but ultimately had a falling out with the left Kuomintang down the line. These factions include the Whampoa Clique, the Zhejiang Society of Revolutionary Comrades, and their various right wing splinters. Lastly, there those who can be retrospectively classified as the \"Regional Right\", various warlords with a more local focus that aligned with the Kuomintang like the New Guangxi Clique (NGX), the New Guangdong Clique (NGD), and the Third Army Clique - each with varying degrees of integration with the broader Kuomintang apparatus.\n\nThere is an on-going fear that these long-held divisions even with camps will devolve into ceaseless infighting. From the ashes of Liangguang, Li Zongren of the NGX, Chen Jitang of the NGD, and leading scions of the \"Moscow Committee\" including Hu Hanmin of the EDC and Lin Sen of the WHC have all received Central Committee seats to appease them. Sun Fo of the RCF has also received a seat in absentia due to his prestigious pedigree. But many of their followers will expect party sinecures in exchange for their loyalty."
 YUN.midgame.400.a: "Quite an array of figures..."

 YUN.midgame.401.t: "Divisions in the Old Right"
 YUN.midgame.401.d: "Hu Hanmin and his Moscow Committee have been at the forefront of the right wing of the Kuomintang for the better part of the decade, at least internationally. With Chiang's death and his army's retreat to Guizhou, the exiled rightist leader has dominated the right Kuomintang's intellectual scene, trading barbs with Wang Jingwei and his Paris Committee in an editorial war. So naturally he is quite resentful that his supposed authority holds little weight among the \"crude\" and \"unrefined\" military men that he finds himself with.\n\nAs the days go on, there has been little agreement between the Old Right and the Regional Right that dominated Guizhou. Despite the Moscow Committee's snobbish behaviour, Hu Hanmin seems to be holding out with the expectation that amid all the infighting leadership of the party will default to him anyway. He confidently, perhaps arrogantly, expects the various generals to beg him to lead - not necessarily an unwise move given that Hu expects to be more than just a puppet. His stubbornness in enacting his far reaching agenda has drawn multiple comparisons to Mustafa Kemal.\n\nZhu Peide's leadership, derived from his previous leadership of the junta, has suffered a severe blow thanks to major internal leadership challenges within the Third Army by Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing, and Zhu De all who have agitated for further power sharing. Hu Ruoyu has been in attendance at Guangzhou, but Long Yun has remained in Kunming, showing little interest in the national project. There is an increasing urgency for many Yunnan delegates to return home to forestall another provincial coup as the Third Army falls into disarray. Doing so however, will weaken their hand in on-going negotiations."
 YUN.midgame.401.a: "Guangzhou is our top and only priority."
 YUN.midgame.401.b: "Send them home to keep an eye on Long."

 YUN.midgame.402.t: "Return to Whampoa's Shores"
 YUN.midgame.402.d: "The Third Army are not the only ones undergoing significant upheaval after arriving at Guangzhou. As the senior officers make a pilgrimage to their old Military Academy, General He Yingqin can sense the tensions among his staff. Though no one has come out to challenge him yet, there are lingering questions about his leadership and old grudges and resentments have emerged.\n\nHe Yingqin's \"Old Guard\" faction represents the Whampoa mainline, and his loyalists are conservative military men trained to obey the party orthodoxy. The General is able to exert his influence through the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Association (WMAAA), established by Chiang as a rival to Deng Yanda's leftist Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Classmates Association (WMARCA).\n\nTwo blocs have begun to organise against He Yingqin's leadership. Chen Cheng was a rising star and protégé of both Deng and Chiang, and his \"Civil Engineering Clique\" includes many left-leaning officers with sympathies to Deng's PAC but remained loyal to Chiang during the Long March. Their rivals are the Blue Shirts Society, an underground cabal of ultranationalist military officers inspired by the successes of Boris Savinkov and the SZRS.\n\nFor now however, the legacy of Headmaster Chiang lives on - the various Whampoa officers seem content to rally behind their nominal leader. He Yingqin himself learned this the hard way during the Northern Expedition. Under pressure from other factions he ousted Chiang in the name of party unity but soon found the First Army, organised by a former cadet named Zhu Shaoling, refusing to accept his commands until Chiang returned. When an enraged Chiang was inevitably restored, he warned General He that \"without Chiang Kai-shek, there is no He Yingqin!\" Well, Chiang is long dead and whether or not he was right remains to be seen."
 YUN.midgame.402.a: "Whampoa Bears the Revolution for All of China!"
 YUN.midgame.402.b: "The First Army Rallies Behind General He."

 YUN.midgame.403.t: "New Allies in a New Right"
 YUN.midgame.403.d: "The military dominated leadership of the Kuomintang junta has left a major void in civilian leadership, something that has become a major problem as the movement's territory quadruples in size. Inefficient governance and comparisons to the warlords has become a drag on party legitimacy. Hu Hanmin and his Moscow Committee have a de facto monopoly on civilian party leadership, something they continue to hope to leverage to their advantage. However, with negotiations stalling smaller factions have rapidly proliferated and swelled in size.\n\nDai Jitao and his Zhejiang Society of Revolutionary Comrades have emerged from their bases in Jiangnan (a region that encompasses the mouth of the Yangtze river including Shanghai and parts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), recruited by He Yingqin. Both Dai and Chen Guofu were senior Whampoa Political staff and Chen Lifu was Chiang Kai-shek's confidential secretary so they are all known quantities to General He. Dai Jitao is also considered a towering intellectual figure on the right, one of the few who can rival Hu Hanmin in influence.\n\nZhang Qun, the de facto head of logistics for the First Army and a classmate of Chiang and He, has recruited Yang Yongtai and a coterie of civilians to form the \"New China Construction Society\". However, it is more commonly referred to as the \"New Political Science Clique\". Yang Yongtai was a member of the older iteration, accused of betraying Dr. Sun in favour of Lu Rongting and negotiations with Beiyang. This newer version however appears more sympathetic or at least more docile in outlook towards Kuomintang party-rule. Their expertise and deep connections are invaluable for the party but their loyalty is in doubt.\n\nThe military is how power is won in China, over the years the need for a strong civilian apparatus has been recognised by all factions across the nation. Within the Kuomintang, Chiang was one of the few who could simultaneously command a large military and civilian following, something no one at the moment seems to be able to replicate on a large scale. For, this will have to do."
 YUN.midgame.403.a: "The Moscow Committee has the most loyal candidates."
 YUN.midgame.403.b: "The Zhejiang Society has produced a practical crop of men."
 YUN.midgame.403.c: "The Political Science Clique know all the people worth knowing."

 YUN.midgame.404.t: "The Canton Compromise"
 YUN.midgame.404.d: "After several weeks of the Conference seemingly going nowhere, General He Yingqin of the First Army and leading party theoretician Dai Jitao of the Zhejiang Society of Revolutionary Comrades has struck an agreement, outflanking the previously dominant Moscow Committee and Third Army Clique. Under their proposal, General He will assume the Presidency of the Revolutionary Government, Chairman of the Kuomintang, and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission while Dai Jitao will become the first Premier of the (provisional) Executive Yuan and Deputy Chairman of the Party, controlling the executive branch of the government as effectively a Prime Minister.\n\nHe Yingqin, who has gotten along shockingly well with Huang Shaohong and to a lesser extent Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of the New Guangxi Clique, has managed to secure their support for the proposal. Huang is expected to be named Minister of the Interior as part of the arrangement, with favourable appointments to Li and Bai who still de facto control Guangxi along with Huang Xuchu.\n\nDai Jitao in turn has been able to convince Hu Hanmin and his allies not to walk out of the conference, leaning on their past friendship and an offer to make Hu Hanmin Premier of the (provisional) Legislative Yuan and Ju Zheng Premier of the (provisional) Judicial Yuan. He has sworn to work to uphold civilian rule and that this arrangement will be a temporary matter until unification.\n\nThough far from a perfect setup, the fact that any consensus was found brought a relief to most delegates, who quickly fell in line with the He-Dai government. The herculean horsetrading that was required however bodes poorly for the long term prospects of this government, and it is clear that things are far from over."
 YUN.midgame.404.a: "A great act of statesmanship by both sides."

 YUN.midgame.405.t: "The Guizhou KMT Return to Guangzhou"
 YUN.midgame.405.d: "In a sudden turn of fortunes, the Kuomintang junta that retreated to Guizhou after losing the Northern Expedition was able to make their return to Guangzhou a decade later. Defeating warlords and rivals that stood in their way, the National Revolutionary Army has taken control over Liangguang, bringing the party-state back to the same position they were in 1925.\n\nForming a new Guangzhou Nationalist Government has not been as easy however. The party's right seemed hopelessly divided between various figures and negotiations dragged on until a compromise was finally struck between General He Yingqin and party theorist Dai Jitao. With most of the party falling in line afterwards, their attention now turns Northwards."
 YUN.midgame.405.a: "They never gave up, and neither will we!"
 YUN.midgame.405.b: "It seems they have beaten us to Guangzhou."
 YUN.midgame.405.c: "Another decade, another failed revolution."

#Zhu Peide's Rebellion Mini-Chain
 YUN.midgame.410.t: "The Third Army's Backlash"
 YUN.midgame.410.d: "While Zhu Peide always expected to have to share power, even when he was the head of the Guizhou Junta he always was merely first among equals, watching the Congress unfold the way it did was nothing short of an outrage. While Zhu is still a CEC member and Governor of Yunnan, the only position he has received in the new government is a token position on the Military Affairs Commission chaired by He Yingqin - an active attempt to sideline him.\n\nWith the situation rapidly escaping his control, Zhu has mused staging a coup with what forces he has before the junta is formally disbanded. However, the headwinds seem to be against him. He is still not on the best of terms with Hu Hanmin and the Moscow Committee, having seen multiple rounds of contentious negotiations fail. Hu Hanmin, despite his open disdain for General He, is a notorious stickler for party unity and commitment to democratic centralism, and has made his opinions well known. Meanwhile, the other regionalist generals needed to make a coup work like Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Jitang have largely been bought off. Faced with these warning signs, his fellow Third Army officers have informed General Zhu that they are simply too divided and that most of the rank and file simply would like to go along with the show and project unity."
 YUN.midgame.410.a: "General Zhu Speaks Against the Compromise!"
 YUN.midgame.410.b: "Governor Zhu Returns to Yunnan to plan."

 YUN.midgame.411.t: "General Zhu Humiliated"
 YUN.midgame.411.d: "Zhu Peide's outburst against the He Yingqin-Dai Jitao compromise has achieved little traction. The New Right factions have locked ranks, regional generals from Guangxi and Guangdong have remained silent, and most damningly Hu Hanmin has joined with Dai Jitao in denouncing Zhu as an upstart warlord who threatens party unity for his own ambitions for leadership.\n\nOf his fellow Third Army comrades, only Zhu De and other leftists have stood by him (worsening perceptions among the right), while other Yunnan figures like Fan Shisheng and Jin Handing have been quick to say that he was acting alone.\n\nHis poorly thought out plan having backfired, Zhu Peide could do little but try and save face - surrendering his CEC seat and returning home to Yunnan in disgrace. Zhu remains Governor, but no one knows for how much longer."
 YUN.midgame.411.a: "Go home to Kunming socialist traitor!"

 YUN.midgame.412.t: "Zhu Peide Passes Away"
 YUN.midgame.412.d: "Ever since the humiliating incident at Guangzhou, Zhu Peide has been working twice as hard as Governor of Yunnan to salvage his reputation as a patriot. Combined with the stress of managing his emboldened rivals, his health worsened. The questionable quality and access to medicine in Kunming finally struck when Governor Zhu took low quality anti-anemia drugs imported from Germany to avoid missing a meeting, causing him to grow extremely ill and pass away after a stay in the hospital.\n\nPrior to his death, he is quoted as telling [ROOT.GetLeader], who came to visit him in the hospital, that he has three remaining things to say. First, the war of resistance is imminent and national strength is limited, so he asked to be buried simply rather than expend money on a state funeral. Second, he asked that his family and children fend for themselves rather than receive preferential treatment. Lastly, he asked that his family nurse not be blamed for his death because ultimately China's medical science is underdeveloped.\n\nIf Zhu's goal was to rehabilitate his reputation, it seems like it has worked. Public praise from all sectors of the party, including from the left, has poured in. Major figures have noted his diligence, humility, and patriotism. The National Government has formally issued a decree to commend him:\n\n\"General Zhu Peide...was a man of great military skill and intelligence. In his early years, he followed the Premier [Sun Yat-sen] and served the revolution. He was repeatedly entrusted with important military tasks. In the Northern Expedition, he led the divisions and made great contributions...He was able to devote his energy and wisdom to the difficult times...In remembrance of his past achievements, we mourn his loss...the funeral expenses should be kept simple to match his simple and frugal aspirations. His life story should be preserved and handed over to the National History Museum to honour his merits and encourage future generations.\""
 YUN.midgame.412.a: "May the loyal soldier rest in peace."
 YUN.midgame.412.b: "He will be remembered as a patriot."

 YUN.midgame.413.t: "Zhu Peide Aligns with Hu Hanmin"
 YUN.midgame.413.d: "Before leaving for Kunming, Zhu Peide and his men sit down with Hu Hanmin and his allies for one last round of negotiations. In private talks, they discussed their mutual distrust for the new military dominated government, and have agreed to consult with each other further before making any moves.\n\nHu Hanmin is hard at work expanding his influence within the legislature and party apparatus, checking the influence of Dai Jitao and Zhang Qun. His connections with the Guangdong government and Chen Jitang in particular has given him a degree of hard power that most other civilian figures lack. They are hopeful that they will be able to secure the support of the New Guangxi Clique, who are still in the process of rebuilding, and potentially Guizhou and Hunan for their quest to reassert control over the party."
 YUN.midgame.413.a: "An alliance is forged."

 YUN.midgame.414.t: "The South Consolidates Behind Hu Hanmin"
 YUN.midgame.414.d: "While careful to avoid endangering the success of the revolution as a whole, Hu Hanmin has been the focal point of an intra-party resistance to He Yingqin's rule. He has worked diligently to peel off regional forces from He Yingqin, securing Guangdong, Yunnan, and most recently Guangxi. Working with warlords has always been a tough sell for the stubborn, centralist Hu Hanmin, but so is accepting military control over the party.\n\nWithin the national government, Hu has utilised his position as Premier of the Legislative Yuan and his prominence as a party leader to try and isolate He Yingqin. He has attempted on a few occasions to persuade Dai Jitao to abandon the Generalissimo, seeking to install Zhu Peide as the new Chairman of the Military Commission.\n\nHe knows that General He's position is precarious because unlike Chiang Kai-shek before him, he only really has military power and struggles to invoke genuine loyalty over the civilian apparatus. But control is more than just loyalty, and the mercenary Political Science Clique has a notorious tendency to go where the wind blows. Perhaps he would be better served securing their support. Either way the emergence of a unified southern bloc bears ominous tidings for the Whampoa government."
 YUN.midgame.414.a: "Through ideas and loyalty we save our party."
 YUN.midgame.414.b: "Through strength and control we bring down tyrants."

#Narrative Events (420-439)
 YUN.midgame.420.t: "Two Titans on the Right"
 YUN.midgame.420.d: "The two major ideological leaders of the right Kuomintang are Hu Hanmin and Dai Jitao, both close confidants of Sun Yat-sen who have published extensive works interpreting the party founder's theories. Having spent a lot of time editing each other's manuscripts late into the night, the two are close friends but their respective followers have since drifted apart from one another.\n\nThis split began with the divisions caused by the United Front, and the assembly of various rightist figures in the Western Hills suburbs of Beijing to resist the growing influence of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Most of these men remained sympathetic to a conservative, bourgeois democracy more akin to the original Tongmenghui. Dai Jitao was violently ejected from the proceedings, accused of socialist sympathies.\n\nDai would ultimately rally members of the so-called New Right, a faction of rightists who initially sought to maintain the United Front but later backed Chiang Kai-shek in his quest to fight off the Chinese Syndicalist Party while not imperilling foreign aid from the Internationale. They distinguished themselves by claiming to purify Sun's ideology from foreign elements, mixing a Leninist vanguard political structure with traditionalism.\n\nWhat the right Kuomintang share is a common dedication to revolutionary nationalism and an attachment to Dr. Sun's theories but a rejection of the need for class warfare. While both Hu and Dai may have started their careers attracted to left wing ideas such as Marxism and Anarchism, ultimately it was with the intention of furthering a nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda and both would end up discarding those theories as ineffective or outright hostile to Chinese sovereignty. Hu Hanmin, in contrast to many of his followers, not only believes that the party-state will prevent the revolution from denigrating into class warfare, but also save it from \"hypocritical bourgeois democratic politics.\" That said, while the party must keep their rivals out, when the state is ultimately created it must in turn keep the party in check."
 YUN.midgame.420.a: "We need to hold onto the ideals the party was founded on."
 YUN.midgame.420.b: "We need to embrace change and dynamism to win!"

 YUN.midgame.421.t: "Whampoa's Cliques"
 YUN.midgame.421.d: "The First Army prides itself on representing all of China. Unlike the regional biases of the other armies of the NRA (even if in practice Whampoa students and staff tended to be drawn from a select few loyalist provinces), the Whampoa brotherhood that emerged gave them a sense of interprovincial connectivity.\n\nThat has not prevented them from disagreeing on their plans for the future. The Old Guard, led by He Yingqin, takes inspiration from earlier conservative reformers in China as well as Japan's successful modernisation efforts. Holding many prominent positions in the establishment, their priority is maintaining order and balance, throughout the revolution.\n\nThe Civil Engineering Clique gets its name from Chen Cheng's command of the 18th Army (formed from defeated Guangdong Army units) and the 11th Division. The Chinese characters for 11 (Ten and One) when put together resemble the character for earth (Tu). The characters for 18 (Ten and Eight) when put together look like the character for wood (Mu), so put together one gets Tumu (Engineering). They are notorious for their absorption of leftist units and their arrogance - proudly walking in front of friendly forces and ignoring them, deriding their lessers as \"tofu troops\" or \"oil residue troops.\"\n\nTeng Jie has long planned to set up an organisation with leading graduates drawn from Whampoa's ranks. He has developed cells in the police, army, and government railing against foreign imperialism. German, Japanese, and Legation authorities have circulated the name the \"Blue Shirts Society\", with alternate names like the Blue Jackets, Blue Shirt Group, and Jinwanghui (Save the Nation from Ruin Society) being floated - the name drawn from the blue patches on their uniform in addition to the party colours.\n\nEach has competed for influence within the broader army, assembling overlapping patronage networks to secure promotions for their members."
 YUN.midgame.421.a: "He Yingqin and the Old Guard Know Best."
 YUN.midgame.421.b: "Chen Cheng and the CEC embrace the future!"
 YUN.midgame.421.c: "Teng Jie and the BSS will save the nation!"

 YUN.midgame.422.t: "Rise of the CC Clique"
 YUN.midgame.422.d: "Ever since Dai Jitao first took command of the Executive Yuan, he has remade it in his image. His followers, mainly Zhejiang provincials, dominate the top posts and are hard at work implementing Premier Dai's agenda. Given the exhaustive portfolio Dai received from his compromise with President He, there are few domains beyond his reach: the military remains controlled by He Yingqin and Whampoa, the Financial and Economic sectors is under the Political Science Clique, and the Legislature and Judicial Yuan under Moscow Committee Clique appointees.\n\nTo meet the Dai administration's growing demands, the Zhejiang Society of Revolutionary Comrades has evolved into a larger entity often referred by outsiders as the CC Clique (an abbreviation for either the Central Club/Committee Clique or a reference to the two Chen brothers). Its supposed existence however has been thoroughly denied by Chen Lifu as an attempt to sow party divisions and cast doubt on Dai's leadership. Whatever the case both Mr. Chen and his older brother Chen Guofu have emerged as Dai's leading lieutenants in the party-state's administration.\n\nWhat all three men prize is education, discipline, and the party's revolution. While Dai Jitao is the face of their clique and Chen Lifu is his understudy, Chen Guofu is their silent workhorse. He is said to enjoy a simple life according to Confucian terms - never drinking, smoking or going to movies. His only hobby apparently is reading books, spending money on them even if it was his last dollar. His greatest regret in life is said to be that he was denied a higher education due to joining the party at age 18, and thus glad to encourage young men to begin advanced studies. In poor health due to the lingering effects of tuberculosis, he nevertheless continues to work and lecture. He is quoted as saying \"the most important weapon to fight sickness is to forget that you are ill\", truly an example for us all."
 YUN.midgame.422.a: "The CC Clique works to advance President He's agenda!"
 YUN.midgame.422.b: "Dai Jitao lifts and the minds and souls of our comrades!"
 YUN.midgame.422.c: "There is no CC Clique, only one party and one revolution!"

 YUN.midgame.423.t: "The Theory of Political Discourse"
 YUN.midgame.423.d: "Neither iterations of the Political Science Clique really fit in with the New or Old Right of the Kuomintang. The Old Political Science Clique, led by Cen Chunxuan and Li Genyuan, were notorious for sabotaging efforts by the Guangzhou government to write a new constitution and their growing dispute with Dr. Sun saw them collaborate with Guangxi warlord Lu Rongting to eject Sun from Guangzhou. Similarly, their attempt at securing Yunnan from Tang Jiyao ended in Gu Pinzhen's head being mounted on a pike.\n\nZhang Qun was a staffer under Cen, but similarly failed to fit in in Beiyang after the Kuomintang ousted the Political Science Clique, but found stable employment under Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin. The new Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan and concurrently War Minister (with a minor portfolio in the Foreign Ministry), he has built his clique around technocratic control over economic organs.n\nYang Yongtai, a former affiliate of Huang Xing and a finance minister for the Constitutional Protection Government, aligned with Cen and Li against Sun. When their government fell, he was forced to flee to the Beiyang government but after a brief stint found himself in exile in Shanghai. Recruited after nearly a decade of retirement by Zhang Qun, he is eager to avoid finding himself out of power again, adopting a policy of political flexibility whilst remaining loyal to the Generalissimo.\n\nYang has proposed to solve the problems of the Beiyang Warlords (irreconcilably and actively against the Kuomintang) by military means, the problems of the Southern Warlords like Li Zongren (who possess military might but are fiscally poor) by economic means, and to solve the problems of Hu Hanmin and the Moscow Committee (militarily weak but with a strong political reputation) along with the foreign powers by diplomatic means."
 YUN.midgame.423.a: "Through military means we will bring down the traitors!"
 YUN.midgame.423.b: "We shall keep our \"allies\" in line through economic incentives."
 YUN.midgame.423.c: "Through diplomacy we shall keep the party together."

 YUN.midgame.424.t: "The Sword and the Pen"
 YUN.midgame.424.d: "The revolution is carried by the zeal of its acolytes, but they have been bitterly divided into competing factions. Though traditionally China's bureaucracy is said to be divided into the sword (men of action/the military) and the pen (men of knowledge/the bureaucracy), the largest Kuomintang camps can be compared to the colours of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth Flag that adorns almost every building in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThe Blueshirts (Blue) have grown tremendously in influence across the military, selling a radical vision for China governed in a similar lines to the fanatical, disciplined, and revolutionary order of their idealised memories of the old Whampoa academy. For the many young former cadets turned senior officers, they have known nothing but instability, revolution, and war since childhood, and are determined to save China at any cost - even if it means discarding a corrupt and bloated party apparatus and incorporating foreign ideas imported from Europe.\n\nThe CC Clique (White) dominated the party apparatus. Building a mass movement among civilian party cadres calling for a Neo-Confucian revival and strict adherence to Dai Jitao's interpretation of Sun Yat-sen's theories, they appeal to a more intellectual form of ultra-nationalism centred around the party's Orthodoxy. Their control over much of the establishment and education makes them potent, however many have a declining opinion of the military and their association with opportunists like the Yang Yongtai and the Political Science Clique.\n\nThe Civil Engineering Clique (Red) are another young guard branch, consisting of those disillusioned with the brutality of the BSS and the corruption of the CC Clique. Also harkening to the old days of Whampoa, they have cultivated a mass following for their discipline and care for the people while rejecting the radicalism of the socialists.\n\nThe three factions have wasted little time undermining one another, sometimes even more than party outsiders. As the party expands in territory, competition for influence has grown fierce especially as each maintains their own intelligence network, youth organisation, and patronage networks. All under the watch of the Generalissimo."
 YUN.midgame.424.a: "Blue like the sky and the uniforms of our heroes!"
 YUN.midgame.424.b: "White like the Sun and the party that illuminates the land!"

 YUN.midgame.424.e: "Carefully balanced, as all things should be."

 YUN.midgame.425.t: "Faithful Guizhou"
 YUN.midgame.425.d: "After the Long March, western Guizhou has been the centre of power for the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army. There were few regional state enterprises or really any industry prior to Kuomintang rule, something the junta had worked to partially address though not particularly successfully. Nevertheless, with the Kuomintang relocating its main bases to Guangzhou, a power vacuum has emerged as factions jockey for influence.\n\nWang Boqun is the brother-in-law to He Yingqin and the brother of Wang Wenhua, who led some of the original Kuomintang revolutionaries in the province against their uncle Liu Xianshi. A civilian with deep ties to the province, he is dogged by allegations of corruption. and He Yingqin is wary of the appearance of nepotism should he appoint him to the Governorship, especially since his younger brother He Jiwu is concurrently seeking an appointment to Mayor of Guiyang (the provincial capital).\n\nGiven Guizhou is his home province, it is quite valuable to the Generalissimo. Another potential member of his circle that is in consideration is his secretary and fellow native, Liu Jianqun. A propaganda officer responsible for keeping tabs on the BSS, he is said to have grown enamoured with their ideology.\n\nHe Yingqin's main rival in the province is Gu Zhenglun, a former ally before they had a falling out. His younger brothers are prominent members of Wang Jingwei's leftist RCA, which has cast a cloud of suspicion on him despite his anti-socialist tendencies. Another Kuomintang figure, Lu Dao, remains around but largely not in consideration - he has thrown his lot in with General Gu.\n\nGiven the extremely charged personal politics involved, there has been little room for Politicac Science or Central Club to make their own appointments; albeit, both cliques have solicited the support of Gu Zhenglun for their appointment to out-flank General He and Liu."
 YUN.midgame.425.a: "Wang Boqun, the Generalissimo's Brother-in-Law."
 YUN.midgame.425.b: "Gu Zhenglun, Guizhou's remaining strong-man."

 YUN.midgame.426.t: "News and Newspapers of the Party-State"
 YUN.midgame.426.d: "Despite prevalent censorship, the people's desire for gossip and news about their government can scarcely be quenched. To meet this need, a variety of party or quasi-government sponsored newspapers have sprouted up.\n\nCapital News is said to be the spiritual successor of Dai Jitao's Min Quan Li (People's Rights). Founded by the CC Clique, its stated mission was to publicise the Three Principles and their access to the confidential sectors to get first hand, exclusive stories while avoiding printing any state or military secrets. Publishing extremely late at night and including pictorial supplements about social satire as well as serialised novels, the money they made allowed them to create spin offs like the Current Affairs Monthly magazine, Political Review Monthly and Cheng-chung publishing house. Their pointed political commentary has often resulted in military and political figures complaining directly to President He to demand a retraction.\n\nThe Society Mercury is a militant paper associated with the BSS. Claiming that \"National Populism is the only tool of self-salvation of nations on the brink of destruction\", it insists that \"there is no solution other than imitating the spirit of violent struggle like in Romania and Russia\". Praising the ideology as \"the most positive, most courageous, most forceful, concrete manifestation of the national spirit\", they denounce \"the inherited poison of democracy\" as well as anarchism and individualism for the powerlessness of the present Kuomintang.\n\nModerate party members subscribe to Sun Fo's Reconstruction Review and Hu Hanmin's Three Principles of the People Daily. The Political Science Clique has sought to revive some smaller papers that have come and gone over the years like Modern Review and Guowen News Agency.

 YUN.midgame.427.t: "The War on the Left"
 YUN.midgame.427.d: "Premier Dai Jitao has begun a vicious \"War on the Left\". Originally a Marxist, having published several articles on socialism including a translation of Kautsky's Karl Marx's Economic Theories, Dai admired their ability to reach the masses. Despite being part of the Marxist Study Association, he refused to join the CSP in 1921 and ended up opposed to class struggle, believing that the workers' movement was worthless without a conscious leadership.\n\nAs Dr. Sun's secretary and literary assistant, he claimed to be one of the foremost interpreters of Sun's and noted his lack of Marxist inspiration for his earlier works. Dai published the Philosophical Foundations of Sun Yat-senism, which sought to discredit Marxism and its supposed scientific value. Appealing to the author's own sense of nostalgia, pride in race, traditional ethics, evocations of nationalism, vague socialism, appeals to orthodoxy, idealised view of the Zhou Dynasty, Dai linkens Sun to Confucious. He also denounced the New Culture Movement and iconoclasm, synthesising a revolutionary right-wing current that included Sun Yat-sen's teachings, xenophobia, and a reclamation of traditional values that he believed was an antidote for the scientific socialism of the left.\n\nHis calls for a crackdown on socialism, while broadly popular, is not universally well received. Socialists sympathies are pervasive among the Third Army, and even among its rightists there is a sense of solidarity against central government overreach. Zhu Peide, Fan Shisheng, and Jin Handing have all been noted in protecting their socialist comrades, and will continue to resist attempts to purge them.\n\nWith Whampoa's ranks, even with the earlier purges of socialists there remain leftists who seek to bridge the left and right to return the Kuomintang to its roots as a syncretic revolutionary party. The Civil Engineering Clique, with its sympathies to the Provisional Action Committee, have sought to reduce socialist support by implementing wide-ranging social and economic reforms of its own."

 YUN.midgame.428.t: "Building a New Government"
 YUN.midgame.428.d: "Building a new government is a formidable challenge. The Kuomintang seeks to build a party-state, but there is a dire shortage of qualified professionals, much less loyal party cadres across China. Only Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu actually have fully organised provincial party branches, making up 94% of the total number of city and county branches. Virtually every other province has temporary party affairs directory committees or a singular party agent sent by the Chen brothers directing party matters.\n\nThe bureaucracy meanwhile has been run almost directly from the Military Commission, with Military Councils having extensive power over regional administrations. Yang Yongtai is chief architect of this system, organising the creation of Bandit Suppression zones with three priorities: Administrative Efficiency, Political Education, and Political Mobilisation. Yang's reforms are directed around having separate provincial executive departments communicate horizontally rather than only with their Central Government and local equivalents, and also empower County Executives and sub-county forms of governments in local villages. This included creating the Baojia system, a rural militia supplemented by short term party education centres in the villages to fight bandits and socialist insurgents.\n\nTheir reforms have been stifled however by the slow speed in which they have been implemented and its heavy dependence on military solutions in the meanwhile. Only a few provinces, usually dominated by Political Science Clique officers, have implemented Yang's reforms and poor communication technology means a lot of these changes have only caused more confusion. The Baojia system has primarily appealed to the gentry, angering many peasants. Yang's attempts at centralisation has angered many regionalists and drawn envy from the CC Clique. Accusations of elitism and corruption have pushed many to call for reforms and the ejection of Political Science Clique leaders."

Li Genyuan's return has similarly been controversial even after all these years, and his attempts at reasserting the Old Political Science Clique's influence has not been received well. Fan Shisheng and Jin Handing have begun to waver in their support thanks to these controversies, remaining loyal primarily due to their suspicion of Whampoa's influence.\n\nLong Yun and Hu Ruoyu, both who accepted the initial Kuomintang rule with the expectation of retaining local power and autonomy, have grown more bold in undermining the mainline Kuomintang apparatus, setting up their own Kuomintang party committees and appointing their loyalists to prominent positions - sometimes forcibly expelling Zhu's appointees.\n\nLiu Zhi, one of Whampoa's Five Tiger Generals and a former Yunnan Army officer, has been dispatched with a detachment to \"sort provincial affairs.\" With so many moving pieces, it is unclear who will emerge on top in the protracted struggle for the mountainous province."

With various individuals within the [ROOT.GetNameDef] continuously flirting between the Left and Right wings, few prove particularly stringently opposed to Wang on ideological grounds. Many, if not all, support the 1924 Reorganisation, albeit few support an alliance with the International or cooperation with the Chinese Syndicalist Party, but instead provoke the need for party unity in dire times. Whilst this perhaps falls directly into the RCA's desires, the most stringent opposition arriving from men such as Li Genyuan has, rather paradoxically, induced more within the ranks to support Wang's efforts to reconcile.\n\nUnlike the left, the right wing of the Kuomintang sees the end goal of the revolution as building a harmoniously cooperative national body, bound together by culture, acting in concert against mutual threat. Men like Dai Jitao, Hu Hanmin and Chiang Kai-shek saw themselves as truly revolutionaries despite their conservatism, and it is no surprise the left and right regularly branded each other as counterrevolutionary.

While Dai approved the vanguardism of the 1924 Reorganisation, he argued that a true revolution could only be enacted via the masses rather than a radical minority and disapproved of the alliance with the Internationale.

The rivals to the CSP, themselves divided into wings, are the anarchist (New) World Society led by the Four Elders of the Kuomintang.\n\nThe CSP, and the LCS by extension, is the raison d'etre of the right Kuomintang, which formed in opposition to the United Front. The right believes that China's unique socio-economic circumstances means class warfare and the dictatorship of the proletariat are unnecessary. While they reject the influence of the free market and note the social defects of the wage system, the right Kuomintang believe that Chinese capitalism is rudimentary enough that there is not yet a capitalist class consciousness.\n\nBelieving most stringently in the application of the Three Principles as opposed to any form of Marxism or Anarchism, Zhu Peide has nonetheless tentatively tabled discussion of incorporating the Chinese Syndicalists into the National Revolution.\n\nOne of the first members of the CSP, Wang Fusheng has been placed in a superior position within the party due to recent events, having been able to establish a provincial committee on behalf of the CSP's leadership. Operating with individuals such as Li Xin, the duo have entrenched themselves within the local student and worker movements.\n\nRather curiously, across the aisle, the Four Elders and their World Society have been viewed as far more palatable.

 YUN.midgame.450.d: "As part of his initial initiatives as the Minister of Education, Chen Lifu has drafted the [GetYear] Proposal to Determine Educational Objectives and their Methods of Implementation. Even despite the modernisation attempts following the Xinhai Revolution, education in China still remains one of the most chronically underfunded sectors of Chinese society. free schooling for all would cost hundreds of millions of yuan, and budget allocations have never scratched even 20% of that at its peak, and averages around 10% of what is needed. Even rudimentary schools are dispersed and difficult to attend in rural areas and in major cities less than 5% went to high school despite their greater access to resources.\n\nIn addition, to expanding funding for education, Minister Chen's proposal would incorporate the Three Principles of the People into the core curricula of all levels of schooling, replacing civic classes with party doctrine orthodoxy and an emphasis on Dr. Sun's life, teachings, lectures, and writings. Older students would be expected to learn Kuomintang policy and orthodox party histories as they prepare for a life of national servitude to their nation. Furthermore, this comprehensive plan calls for a \"Movement for Plain Speech\", replacing classic literary Chinese with the vernacular, a plan that is expected to gain traction in the cities though will struggle in troubled rural schools.\n\nNonetheless, a considerable opposition has arisen in regards to the political nature of the curriculum with some arguing that the party's doctrine should be supplementary but not mandatory towards the growth of a civic education. They instead argue that an emphasis be placed on traditional Chinese history with a focus on literary Chinese to preserve ongoing traditions."

 YUN.midgame.451.d: "After the original Xinhai Revolution, the Tongmenghui divided into those who believed it was possible to complete the revolution through parliamentary means and those who believed the party must remain a vigilant, revolutionary force. Although Huang Xing and Song Jiaoren won the majority of seats in the ensuing election, they were quickly quashed by Yuan Shikai's Beiyang army with the help of reactionaries in the legislature. Since then, Sun and many of his close followers have disavowed parliamentary means, denouncing Huang and Song as foolishly naive.\n\nFor Dai Jitao, this meant a transformation from believing in liberal individualism as the basis for an ideal state to one built on an ideological foundation backed by military power. He wrote that:\n\n\"There is no basis of unity in a political party other than ideology. Ideology is the nerve system of a party. Ideology also constitutes the blood veins of a party. Without a nerve system and blood veins, an animal could no longer be an animal. Without ideology, a party could no longer be a party\"\n\nFor Dai and his ideological successors across the New Right, this ideology meant a mix of nationalism, revolution, and traditional values. He believes that the force of the masses is necessary, even if they do not fully understand what they are fighting for. His ideas for morality were built on his experiences organising revolutionaries in Sichuan where Dai observed that the people behaved in four ways: the way of killing, the way of asking Gods for blessing, suicide by opium addiction (a fate he barely avoided), and escapism. Broad love is what is needed to escape superstition, the Three Principles to cure the ailments of the world.

Alerted of this problem, Dai has written extensively on the necessity of revolutionary shock troopers—soldiers driven by sheer moral fortitude and patriotic self-sacrifice who are armed with ideas, not just guns.\n\nThese soldiers would not just be driven by a sense of nationalism but rather they should feel called to their purpose; of which is to project and transmit the glories of the Three Principles of the People. As they march from town to town, they would instruct and guide the people on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, and to proclaim the necessity of adopting the four rights so that the people may learn and understand democracy.

With the failure of the Second Revolution, Sun's cynicism and pessimism drove him to more authoritarian heights, taking it upon himself to bear the burden of saving China. As a result of the oaths of loyalty, many of the liberal supporters throughout China and outside of his powerbase in Guangdong, simply abandoned his movement. Sun hated them in turn, seeing them as turncoats from the necessity of national salvation. Leading protégés of his including Hu Hanmin and Dai Jitao who wished to see a party entirely of Kuomintang loyalists, argued that formal institutions were not necessarily needed so long that a party is unified under a central orthodoxy.\n\nWith the Kuomintang seeking to make its ascension into Chinese national politics once more, members of the so-called Political Science Clique and those even within the CC Clique, identify themselves more closely with technocratic administration.

The Kuomintang's model for policing began with the Canton Bureau of Public Safety, built along American lines. Indeed, all future Kuomintang police agencies have been called \"Bureaus of Public Safety\". Even today, the National Commission of Police Experts and the Central Police Academy have sought experts from the FBI to help transform their agents from merely \"ruffians\" to elite spies, investigators, and assassins. Zhang Qun, who has had some experience running police departments and de facto includes the Ministry of Justice in his portfolio, has advised [ROOT.GetLeader] to continue along this direction.\n\nHe is not alone among those who want to build up a party police. Chen Lifu, among other positions, has assumed the responsibility of coordinating the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Kuomintang, a group of about forty well educated amateurs divided into three sections (one for civilian counterintelligence under Xu Enzeng, one for military counterintelligence, and one general affairs section under Ding Mocun).\n\nCommanding the Military Section however is Li Shizhen, a Whampoa graduate with BSS ties who has effectively created his own intelligence force that reports directly to the Military Affairs Commission dubbed the \"Tewu\", a euphemism meaning special services. Having studied policing in Japan and now seeking a Headmastership of the Central Police Academy, he has sought to organise his forces into two branches. The Detective Department would include a Military Secret Service under Wang Bailing and a Special Secret Service under Gu Jianzhong. The Assassination Department would include the Public Security Bureau and the Blood and Iron Corps headed by Gu Shunzhang."

 YUN.midgame.456.t: "The Youth of China"
 YUN.midgame.456.d: "The Kuomintang have long celebrated the youth as the future of China, even if they are suspicious of them organising. In recognition of this, March 29th has replaced May 4th as Youth Day in China (to avoid the obvious socialist connection), and large numbers of party-backed youth organisations have sprouted up. The definition of \"Youth\" in this context has been controversial, with men sometimes as old as 35 retaining membership in these organisations, much to the chagrin of certain leaders.\n\nThe party has created the Blue and White Corps, while the army has created a youth wing of the Blue Shirts Society. While both are technically illegal, they have received extensive patronage from leading party figures. Chen Lifu has compared them to special forces, recruiting patriotic youths to act as auxiliaries for the army and train new party members in lieu of the poorly equipped existing party training infrastructure.\n\nLess directly affiliated with the party are the Scouts of China, which as the Kuomintang take increasing control some, have proposed changing it to the Scouts of the Nationalist Party. Although mostly an urban phenomenon, despite its Western roots many party figures admire it for promoting a disciplined, patriotic mass organisation for the youth that encourages civic action. Known for their grand jamborees, where girls learn feminine work like needlework and boys learn art, athletics, and regimentation, they attract the support of less political families.\n\nCompetition between these groups has been fierce. The Blueshirts have attracted scrutiny by insisting that their members (of an ostensibly secret society) not be automatically enrolled in the Kuomintang at age 25, drawing allegations of disloyalty. Chen Cheng has proposed the creation of a Three Principles of the Youth League directly associated with the party, merging all three entities into one cohesive one (that his allies would implicitly dominate). This has attracted the nominal support of all factions, though continued jockeying within this League can only be expected."

 YUN.midgame.457.t: "Recasting Confucius"
 YUN.midgame.457.d: "Since the days the Qin Emperor united the various warring states following the Spring and Autumn Periods, Confucianism has been a staple bedrock of Chinese philosophy and culture. Associated with its tradition and an idealistic nostalgic lens into days long gone, Confucianism found itself rocked by the century of humiliation and the subsequent upheaval of the Xinhai Revolution.\n\nThe resurgent right-wing of the Kuomintang has long interpreted Dr. Sun's interpretation of Confucius as a necessary moral groundwork to lay a revolution in a world driven by concepts such as materialism and imperialism. While many acknowledge that concepts such as fillal piety should be encouraged and the great sages taught and learned (through public holidays and schools), others like Dai Jitao have explicitly argued that the Analects properly described how to run a country. To Dai, it is Sun, who properly understood Confucius as the moral and vital spirit that China must revitalise.\n\nAnd there are even others, who see Confucianism as beyond China's moral ideology. Those in the Blueshirts Society venerate China's historic authoritarian regime nearing despotism, a time when free thought was subjugated and pure obedience guided all."

 YUN.midgame.458.t: "The Christian Crisis of Soul"
 YUN.midgame.458.d: "The nature of Christianity has long been a subject of great controversy within China. First, Christianity was certainly seen as the foreigner's religion; the barbarians from around the world carried their crucifixes with their guns as they carved up the Chinese country. It was these very Christian nations that had sought to divide China, the same fierce struggle encapsulated by the Boxer Rebellion more than 30 years prior.\n\nWithin the Kuomintang, the relationship with Christianity is a rich tapestry of diverse perspectives. Party leaders such as Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling, and Chiang Kai-shek identified as Christians, while others like Liao Zhongkai (founder of the Anti-Christian Federation) and Wu Zhihui denounced Christianity. Many viewed Christian schools in China as symbols of imperialism and a foreign ideology that had no place in the new China. This sentiment was echoed by Dai Jitao, one of Christianity's most vocal critics.\n\nAnd yet even within the Nationalist Government today, promiment figureheads like He Yingqin (a Catholic) and Zhang Qun (a convert thanks to his wife) defend Christianity as good principles that should be emulated in addition to Chinese morals. It has been rumoured that Chen Cheng's wife was said to have described that Jesus himself, was the leader of a social and religious revolution - a truly national revolution. Though Chen Cheng does seem to waver on this issue himself, as in a recent interview, he has mentioned that he does believe Christian missionaries have historically and still do, treat the native Chinese with a disrespectful and condescending attitutde.\n\nThis issue seemingly threatens party unity as the debates have grown more fierce in recent days, with Dai explicitly calling for the expulsion of Christians, the abandoning of protections to the Church, and the rejection of having Christian schools in China. Yet, the bitter irony is despite the Kuomintang's rejection of Christ, was it not a fact that the great eternal premier was a disciple of the Holy One above as well?"
 YUN.midgame.458.a: "Christian values have always had some influence on the party."
 YUN.midgame.458.b: "Jesus was a good man, but Christians need to be better."
 YUN.midgame.458.c: "There is no place for foreign, imperialist religions in China!"

 YUN.midgame.470.t: "The Rise of the Whampoa Clique"
 YUN.midgame.470.d: "The death of Chiang Kai-shek was thought to be the end of the Whampoa Clique as a force in politics. At the time the budding faction built on personal connections between military officers was an upstart political movement which shook up the existing right-left paradigm in 1920s Kuomintang politics.\n\nNow, under General He Yingqin the Whampoa clique is once more at the forefront. Like Chiang, they have leveraged the might of the National Revolutionary Army to achieve political dominance, while maintaining the front of political neutrality to play off the different ideological cliques within the party. All the while, the Whampoa brotherhood seems indivisble, at least to outsiders, built on a shared \"Whampoa Spirit\" cultivated at the academy that combined Sun Yat-senism, Socialist revolutionary energy, Japanese Bushido, and a prevailing sense of ultra-nationalism and fanaticism.\n\nAt the helm is He Yingqin. General He at his core is a military man. To him, the military is the power of the government, and thus the Kuomintang needs to establish a strong and modern military to ensure the party and nation's continued existence. Though a reasonably competent officer during the Northern Expedition, his transition to a logistical and administrative role has also seen an evolution in He's beliefs. More and more he weighs whether or not he was right that \"everything is possible with the Whampoa spirit\", and perhaps there is a need for greater numbers via conscription."
 YUN.midgame.470.a: "The Elite Whampoa Spirit will Save the Nation!"
 YUN.midgame.470.b: "It is time we embrace mass movement to join the army and people!"
 YUN.midgame.470.c: "He Yingqin allows a younger generation to take the lead."

 YUN.midgame.471.t: "The Generalissimo's Cult of Personality"
 YUN.midgame.471.d: "The Kuomintang is no stranger to cults of personality, having been effectively built on one ever since Dr. Sun first demanded personal loyalty oaths to himself following the Second Revolution. It has always been a major source of contention, but it appears that it will not be going away any time soon.\n\nIf anything, it has only expanded in size. A twelve foot tall effigy of General He Yingqin was raised on the 10/10 parade in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], a symbol of just how entrenched he has become. Official histories have worked overtime to solidify He Yingqin's revolutionary credentials, building a connection to Dr. Sun Yat-sen himself through his close friendships with Chiang Kai-shek and Dai Jitao (who had a more intimate, direct relationship with the Eternal Premier). Whampoa's history with the party is also being written to be heavily intertwined with the party, leaving no doubt who the saviours of the revolution are.\n\nThere is an extremely ideological undertone to this effort. If resurrecting the nation was a goal to be exalted above all else, then Society Mercury editors claim that \"the establishment of a central idol is the important condition of a unified Kuomintang and the first step towards resurrecting China.\" They have written that \"the youth of China have developed anarchistic ideas and have emphasised individualism, considering veneration of an idol as backwards. But this is wrong, because an idol serves the important function of strengthening the power of national culture, and unifies the trust of the mass spirit.\" To put it more simply, Liu Jianqun has dismissed the comparison of a republican dictator to reactionary Emperors and Kings, instead claiming that it is a very progressive means of resurrecting the nation."
 YUN.midgame.471.a: "Long live General He!"
 YUN.midgame.471.b: "He has gone too far this time."
 YUN.midgame.471.c: "A central idol is needed, but he is no longer Generalissimo."

 YUN.midgame.472.t: "The Generalissimo and his Philosopher"
 YUN.midgame.472.d: "It is not uncommon for Emperors and Presidents to have powerful confidants, but the relationship between President He Yingqin and Dai Jitao was always a peculiar one. Neither men are particularly cut out for the spotlight - General He is more of a follower really personality wise while Dai is more of a schemer. With their mutual associate Chiang Kai-shek dead, it has been difficult to find an outgoing face for the \"New Right\".\n\nTheir personalities clash (or some say compliment one another) in other ways. Despite being a soldier in a revolutionary party, He Yingqin himself is no pathbreaker, viewing himself as an obedient soldier for his government. It is said while in training, his physical education instructor once castigated him in front of other students and ordered him to stand at attention to the side. Even after class ended and other students and the instructor had left, a young He Yingqin remained at rigid attention since he had not been told to do otherwise.\n\nDai is a revolutionary through and through, though often preferring to act as a \"shadowy alter-ego\" to another personality, following Sun Yat-sen in his travels and interpreting, ghost-writing, and liaising on his behalf. When Chiang Kai-shek stepped up to resist Wang Jingwei's domination of the party, Dai supported his friend but worried that his war on the left would get him killed, something he unfortunately was proven correct about.\n\nThere has always been a question of who is really in charge in the regime. On a high level, with Chiang long gone, no one quite holds the same degree of control over both the army and party at the same time."
 YUN.midgame.472.a: "Dai Jitao and the Party speak for the people."
 YUN.midgame.472.b: "He Yingqin and the Army defend the nation."

 YUN.midgame.473.t: "Chen Lifu's Vitalism"
 YUN.midgame.473.d: "As the CC Clique rises in influence, so too has the ideas of their leading spokesman, Chen Lifu. In his book \"Vitalism\", a Chinese interpretation of the Henri Bergson's medical/spiritual philosophy, Chen has argued that liberal democracy is an outmoded form of government. He points to the infighting of the Republicans and Democrats in America and how it has sown disastrous division.\n\nAt the same time however, Louis XIV's l'état, c'est moi principle no longer works in a modern republic. The President of the Republic ought to be a \"patriarchal benefactor of all classes\", perhaps more akin to a Louis Bonaparte. Rather than an imposed power foreign to the masses, Chen's concept of a dictator is one that fully embodies popular sovereignty. His state would do more than simply maintain social order, but instead serve as an idea for the \"realisation of our loyalty to the nation\".\n\nThe ideological tenor of Chen's minions has been compared to Romanian Iron Guard's celebration of the peasant and the Russian SZRS's drive for modernity, machines and industrial violence. Like Dai Jitao before them, the CC Clique synthesises primitive and avant-garde beliefs, invoking both futuristic and traditional symbols to advance their state.\n\nDriving home his demand for progress, Chen Lifu (an engineer by training) once compared the political situation to Newton's Second Law of Motion. If Force is a function of Mass and Acceleration, then the mass organisation's Prowess is directly dependent on its Size and Fanaticism. The CC Clique welcomes a global war, arguing that mass violence has the potential to regenerate the nation and mobilise the faith of the masses in party doctrine."
 YUN.midgame.473.a: "The future waits for no one! We must seize our destiny!"
 YUN.midgame.473.b: "We must find a benevolent patriarch for our nation!"

 YUN.midgame.473.e: "Through violence and death we regenerate a nation!"

 YUN.midgame.474.t: "Yang Yongtai, the Generalissimo's Workhorse"
 YUN.midgame.474.d: "Yang Yongtai is a consummate politician, for every important issue he always secretly brings two plans - one in favour and one against the present course of action. After sounding out the President's opinion, he would present the plan that aligns with the President and act as if they were in agreement all along. Thus, like a magician, he is able to create the illusion of being perfectly in sync with his leader.\n\nThe Political Science has no formal organisation (the fleeting New China Construction Society was quickly disbanded to avoid running afoul party rules on splitters, and hardly met anyway) and are fairly cliquey in nature. They have been compared to court personalities, remaining close to the centres of power while never courting the masses. The clique being built on connections between the elite have distanced themselves from the public, which has benefited in some ways (most notably, the military does not see them as a threat) but the lack of mass movement has made them easy targets for their growing ranks of enemies.\n\nTheir growing influence in the national bureaucracy, regional administration, and even segments of the army have raised the ire of rivals on all fronts. The CC Clique have conspired to undermine them from within the government while the Civil Engineering Clique have sought to raise the masses against them, and the Blueshirts have begun to target their membership for violence. They have all called up [ROOT.GetLeader] to cut them down to size."
 YUN.midgame.474.a: "We must entrench ourselves before our rivals can!"
 YUN.midgame.474.b: "Let us slow down and work within the system."

 YUN.midgame.475.t: "The Banks are Made of Marble"
 YUN.midgame.475.d: "As the Kuomintang revolution advances, the lack of available talent has forced them to appoint many members of the Political Science Clique to prominent positions of power at the behest of Zhang Qun, Yang Yongtai and Li Genyuan. They have achieved a dominance of the bureaucracy that has threatened to eclipse all the other factions combined.\n\nWhile the envy of the CC Clique, Civil Engineering Clique, and the Blue Shirts are well known, the growing influence of the Political Science Clique has unsettled even their usual allies in the Moscow Committee and their Whampoa patrons. Zhang Ji, a prominent Moscow Committee scion, has reviled the lack of transparency by saying \"if you want to know the true picture of China's political situation, you have to go to the Bank of China to find out.\"\n\nThe aforementioned Bank of China is the unofficial headquarters of the Political Science Clique, and where Zhang Qun, Yang Yuting, and Wu Tiecheng have set up their headquarters. Many of the well to do in Nationalist China have flocked to their ranks despite the discontent it has sown. These include wealthy bankers and financiers like HH Kung, Jiang Tingfu, and Wu Dingchang; leading scholars, jurists and intellectuals like Gu Zhongxiu, Wang Shijie, Wang Youyong, and Zhang Yaozeng; and of course military men, administrators and politicians.\n\nThe sheer flexibility of the clique, including many ex-Beiyang (especially ex-Anhui) figures means many of these men are holdovers from the old order and hardly Kuomintang figures at all. Zhang Gongquan, a wealthy tycoon, banker, and poet within the Crescent Moon Society, is the brother of Zhang Junmai and a notorious funder of federalist causes - welcomed into the Kuomintang's ranks by the Political Science Clique.\n\nThe mass disaffection of \"true\" party members is growing steadily. Many feel as though they are being passed up for promotion in favour of connected, corrupt elites and this is being exploited by the clique's rivals to create an easy scapegoat for the nation's woes. As the clique's de facto leadership meet, some have advised being proactive in protecting the clique's gains."

 YUN.midgame.476.t: "The Lushan Conference"
 YUN.midgame.476.d: "Since the early days of the morning bugle calls at the Whampoa barracks, certain cadets felt that the National Revolution might, in the future, be overtaken by something much more sinister - the spectre of syndicalism. It was in these very hallowed halls of martial revolutionary education and spirit, that groups coalesced, some pledging to follow the teachings of the Generalissimo and to combat the growing influence of the socialists within the academy. As cliques formed like the Whampoa Alumni Association, often in secret, there were some that believed in even more radical beliefs.\n\nAs radicalism and revolutionary zeal rise, He Yingqin has typically sent his secretary, Liu Jianqun, to monitor these meetings in the past. But on this day, he has decided to pay a visit himself. There, in the backdrop of the Lushan mountains, he declared to the hundreds of military and Blueshirt leaders present that now, more than ever, the revolutionary spirit must be rekindled.\n\nBlueshirt leaders like Teng Jie have declared that their doctrine seeks to reorganise a new Three Principles of the People: National Defence, Ultra-Nationalism, and a People's State. The Vokshod Programme in Russia, Japan's bushido spirit and successful modernisation, are seen as potential templates for a new Chinese state. As the meeting debated the nature and implementation of these concepts, some even brought up that it may indeed be time to reject the Three Principles of the People - abolish democracy and strive for National Populism.\n\nCertainly there are controversial elements within the ideologies of SZRS and the Romanian LAM, such as the fact that LAM is a movement that seeks to reconcile with the past and glorify the monarchy while SZRS strives towards the people's populism under authoritarian republican leadership. Many within Whampoa's military leadership favor a revolution on conservative lines, while more radical elements argue for an advance into a new future."
 YUN.midgame.476.a: "Peace must be made with the past in order to move forwards."
 YUN.midgame.476.b: "We must advance to the next stage of revolutionary evolution."

 YUN.midgame.477.t: "The War on Socialism"
 YUN.midgame.477.d: "Recently, a sense of dread has settled upon the territories of the Guangzhou Nationalist Government, as unparalleled violence has exploded in both the rural and urban areas of the country. Operating independently of the National Revolutionary Army, radical military officers and soldiers of the Blueshirts Society have organised the \"Special Task Force\" (Biedongdui) to terrorise socialist communes and militias in the rural countryside. In the cities and towns, leftist and liberal newspapers and trade unions are reporting attacks from organised groups like the Municipal Comrades Association for the Extermination of Traitors, the Youth Strength Society, the Middle Vanguard Society, and Municipal Mutual Aid Societies.\n\nIronically, it was the socialists who had first taught the most radical officers of Whampoa's cadre. Red Russian Cheka exiles had instructed curious-eyed cadets on the most effective means of torture, while former China Revival Society members had themselves studied under the British NIB during their stay in the Third Internationale.\n\nEvery day, the Minguo Ribao reports yet another assassination on a busy street or a massacre in the dead of night. Even more troubling, are scandalous newspaper articles describing the discovery of kill lists, many of which name prominent Chinese liberals and socialists. Within the Party, members of the Political Science Clique have denounced this violence on liberals and businesses, citing concerns of harming both the Party's legitimacy and the national economy. They are joined in by Chen Cheng's clique within the military, who argue that plenty of socialists adhere to Dr. Sun's principles, including those that fought so valiantly in the MinGan Insurgency. The Whampoa Clique and CC Clique are in silent agreement that the pervasive influence of the Reds must be curbed at all costs, but worry that this may seek a poor precedence of encouraging rabid hooliganism within the Party's ranks."

 YUN.midgame.477.b: "The tree of the nation must be watered with the blood of its traitors."

 YUN.midgame.478.t: "Chen Cheng's Complex Character"
 YUN.midgame.478.d: "There is certainly something complex in regards to Chen Cheng. A Baoding graduate, he finds himself a bit of an outsider unlike most of the \"first class\" of Whampoa's stellar cadets who emerged following the 1924 Kuomintang Reorganisation. And despite his increasingly passionate attachment to the headmaster and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Chen displayed a political and economic orientation that was considerably leftist.\n\nIt's with these connecitons that Chiang's spiritual successor, He Yingqin, enjoys having Chen's presence within the revived National Revolutionary Army. Shockingly effective at getting people on board with the Whampoa programme of revolutionary discipline, Chen enjoys prestige with his connections, but nonetheless, his radical nature and sympathies towards the leftist movement allow him to exploit potential enemies within Whampoa's radical right to see Chen as nothing more than a syndicalist in military uniform.\n\nAs he rises in popularity, he finds himself thus at a crossorads. Certainly loyalty to He Yingqin might yield rewards, but perhaps a better partnership may be formed with the country's regional leftists who seek a much more democratic and equitable society. Alternatively, his Baoding connections may come in hand, or perhaps the time has come for Chen to realise his true destiny and take it upon himself to save the National Revolution."

 YUN.midgame.479.d: "They say that we never really forget where we came from and one can say that the same applies to Chen Cheng. Having grown up in abject poverty, Chen was unable to afford a proper education - instead having to opt for a career in the military. Chen never forgot where he came from and with the Nationalist Government controlling vast swathes of territory, he has taken it upon himself to transform and lift the provinces of China to escape the cycle of poverty.\n\nThe Civil Engineering Clique's first attempts at national reforms are in the province of Hubei which Chen has taken over as the local head of administration. They have began initial efforts to ban smoking, prostitution, dancing, and other frivilous activities of immoral decadence. Along with Yan Lisan and Zhu Huaibing, they plan to make greater sweeping reforms in the province; which would bring them into conflict with the layers of corruption underneath. Much of the wealth in the province is secretly controlled by the underworld linked by criminal organisations and the CC Clique.\n\nLeftists within the province have urged Chen to take greater measures as part of the National Revolution's commitment to minsheng, the principle of livelihood. However, members within the Whampoa Clique have expressed privately their concern at the tensions this may cause with the CC Clique in the government. Certainly now is not the time for greater factional disputes within the Party, but surely something must be done to help the people. Regardless, Chen finds himself now at a crossroads once more, pulled from all directions in an ever complex national revolution."

 YUN.midgame.480.t: "From First Protégé to Figurehead"
 YUN.midgame.480.d: "It was said that during the days of the Guangzhou Nationalist Government following the death of Sun Yat-sen's, the three men that ruled the revolutionary junta were Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek. Despite his nominal recognition as the defacto head of the Kuomintang Right, he finds himself increasingly excluded from party politics as the Premier of the Legislative Yuan. These days, he bitterly finds himself forced to accept frequent mediations by Generalissmo He Yingqin, especially in discourses with Dai Jitao and the Executive Yuan.\n\nNonetheless, Hu still commends tremendous respect especially among the Kuomintang's Old Guangdong guanxi; with individuals such as Chen Jitang, Gu Yingfen, Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, and Zou Lu frequently on his side. As Whampoa's influence in Guangdong finds itself increasingly curbed by the pushback of the Guangdong Clique, He Yingqin's attempt to control the province from outright rebelling by leaning on the notoriously regionalist warlord Chen Jitang - seems to be faltering in recent days as Chen continues to back Hu.\n\nOf course, the status quo still maintains an allusion of peace and keeping the orthodoxy might continue to appease Hu from breaking out into revolt. There can also be potential allies with the New Guangxi Clique, who are not fans of Whampoa's influence in the revolution, but nonetheless are frequent rivals with the cliques of Guangdong. Generalissmo He could look into Hu's civilian rivals and seek to cultivate a broader alliance of civilian leaders to curb Guangdong's growing renown."

 YUN.midgame.481.t: "The Legislative Yuan"
 YUN.midgame.481.d: "As the Kuomintang's right-wing-led revolution continues to press on, growing tensions have emerged within the Kuomintang parliamentary process. As the Head of the Legislative Yuan, Hu Hanmin had participated in an uneasy coalition with Dai Jitao, the President of the Executive Yuan. Despite being forced to share power with the rest of the Kuomintang's right-wing, Hu is still regarded as one of the most prolific and profound understanders of the Sanminzhuyi. Having been with Sun since the Tongmenghui days and one of his most beloved followers, Hu welds considerable power within the party apparatus.\n\nNow, with coalitions and party alliances being ever more apparent, Hu may seek to reach out to the other factions within the party to consolidate his position. Gu Zhongxiu and Huang Fu within the Political Science Clique might prove to be apt allies although the Political Science Clique has achieved a reputation of being more grounded in economic planning than any real revolutionary ideology which might prove to be uncomfortable for Hu, who is vested in the concept of adhering to an orthodox true revolution of the Three Principles of the People. The Zhejianger Chen Guofu might not be all too similar to Hu either, but he has in recent days, made meetings to Hu's office in secret. Chen's support would certainly reconcile Hu with Dai, and perhaps Hu could use both to curb the power of the Generalissimo. Alternatively, securing power with his own clique in Guangdong, especially the favour of the Crown Prince, Sun Fo, may prove the key to retaining Hu's prestige and influence in the party."

For it is Zhu Peide who participated in Double Ninth, a lowly soldier. For it is Zhu Peide who fought in the National Protection War, and again in the Constitutional Protection Movement.\n\nDutiful to the utmost, Zhu's distinguished service would see him join the Central Executive Committee, and drive himself to command the Third Army of the National Revolutionary Army. A friend of many, ranging from Tan Yankai, Li Jishen, Deng Yanda, Dr. Sun and Zhu De to that of Chiang Kai-shek, Zhu's achievements earned him the moniker of \"Tiger General\" from the Guofu himself. Undeterred, Zhu's 3rd Army would fight valiantly, and with determination, scoring remarkable victories against Deng Ruzhuo. With the 3rd experiencing notable casualties in the Northern Expedition, it would become all the more bitter as it collapsed and Generalissimo Chiang ordered the retreat to Guizhou.\n\nIn the disastrous fallout, Chiang would be assassinated, and the stewardship of the Right Kuomintang would fall unto Zhu. Assuming control, Zhu managed to secure passage of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 16th and other NRA armies to Guizhou, a true light shining in the darkness. Continuing onwards, Zhu would not falter; establishing a council between NRA commanders, and guiding the Guizhou KMT through the tumultuous period of the 1930s.\n\nThrust once more into action, Zhu has yet to disappoint the Party, and yet he is running amok with allies new and old. Li Genyuan, back from the ashes of history, or even that of Zhu De, a friend and socialist cohort. Undoubtedly they will decide the character and legacy of Zhu for years to come.

 YUN.midgame.483.d: "It is true that the \"Right Wing\" of the Third Army, that it has recently earned the moniker of, is not just Zhu Peide's show alone. For whilst yes individuals such as Fan Shisheng, or Jin Handing, persist within the Third Army, and there are of course subordinates such as Zhu Shigui, Zhang Yanchuan, Gan Fang, Liu Yaoyang, Yuan Jixi, and plenty of others. However none carry quite the same weight, influence, or character than that of Li Genyuan. Considering the dark influence behind Zhu's throne, Li has always been a particular favourite within Yunnan; a folk hero, a man who has done wonders for the nation, the \"Prime Minister of the Mountains\".\n\nWhilst Li started out as a soldier, and a great one at that, he was always destined to be an administrator, and a leader. A man who would guide the youth and propel his community to a brighter future. Known for his charitable projects in constructing schools, Li has consistently provided for his community all throughout his life. In 1911, he established Dali Model Middle School, in 1912 it was Tengchong Normal School. In 1917 as Shaanxi Governor, Li banned opium, protected cultural relics and historical sites, expanded the provincial library, established Shaanxi Normal School and so much more. In 1926, Li did much of the same, returning to Yunnan to work with local officials and the likes of Huang Yanpei in order to set up rural democratic cooperatives, and all throughout his career Li has endeavoured to protect China's history and culture.\n\nAnd so it is Li that the people of Yunnan turn to, more often than not. For it is Li that has undeniably done the most for the people, be it through service in war or service in administration. And it is Li who has personally endured hardship so that his beloved people can live a better life. Yet such sentiment has won him much animosity amongst the Kuomintang, for Li is considered one step above an outright traitor, only coasting on his ties to the gentry, establishment and Political Science. Ultimately, who's to say what Li's actual intentions are? Nonetheless one cannot deny that he has been a positive force."

 YUN.midgame.483.c: "There is clear politicking behind these endeavours!"

 YUN.midgame.484.t: "Life as a Warlord, Eternity as a Soldier"
 YUN.midgame.484.d: "To mark down the true ideology of Zhu De would be that of a resolved case. A military man first and foremost, Zhu himself has always deigned it as his role to merely be the driving force of the revolution militarily, fighting on the battlefields and planning out the campaigns, as opposed to debating in symposiums and forums. To be expected, naturally, given his character as one of Cai E's protégés — a man infamous for his detesting of politics and politicians. That isn't to say however, that Zhu is without ideology, or socialist convictions, or that he even separates political thought from military affairs. Stipulating that his ideal composition of an army is that of workers and peasants, he believes that the military and political cadres should only come from urban proletarians.\n\nFurthermore, Zhu views militarism in a Social Darwinist mindset much akin to his fellow Yunnan soldiers; for the military can be the flag bearer of China's salvation, and soldiers should be consciously aware of exactly what they fight for. Lest they fall to influences such as corruption or greed. And Zhu himself knows that tendency of human nature more than anyone, as following Cai E's death, and admittedly Zhu laments this, he would become nothing better than a local warlord in Sichuan. Appointing his relatives to positions, seizing wealth, and even becoming addicted to opium. Yet the path to recovery is ever present, and following Zhu's departure to Europe, he would be instilled with new purpose.\n\nValuing the National Revolutionary Army as the most important defender of Socialist political power, Zhu upholds the ideals that it must be a class army, in mission and in spirit. That it must not be isolated from the masses, an instrument to oppress the workers and peasants such as the forces of imperialists. Instead the NRA should be the armed power of liberation for the masses of workers and peasants, an army with an international mission. For it is not technique, modern armaments, or extreme firepower that decides a revolutionary war, but that of politics, political systems and the inclination or disinclination of people's hearts. For in that ideal and hope, is why Zhu De serves and fights."

 YUN.midgame.485.t: "Yunnan's Socialist Stars"
 YUN.midgame.485.d: "The Third Army, having secured the Kuomintang's new stronghold in the Chinese Southwest, has undoubtedly played a crucial role in the irreversible march towards modernity and advance of the National Revolution. Yet, a clear vision for the future remains unclear. General Zhu Peide is no stranger to compromise and is flexible on the outlook of a Nationalist China.\n\nMany in the 3rd Army have more radical views on China's future, seeing the Kuomintang National Revolution as a Socialist Revolution. Zhu De, as the head of the 3rd Army's Officer Training Corps, has worked to see the 3rd Army become a force for the peasants and workers of China, slowly shifting the Army towards a leftward direction, with two rising champions of the working class taking the spotlight.\n\nWang Desan found himself in socialist circles in the early 1920s, having joined the Marxism Research Society as a French translator. In 1922, he joined the CSP through Deng Zhongxia's introduction, and became associated with the Kuomintang when he later became a political instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy. Wang is one of the main faces of socialism in the Chinese Southwest.\n\nThe other rising star, Luo Binghui, was born to a family of destitute farmers. When he began his military career, he served under Tang Jiyao. He eventually came to oppose him, and joined Zhu Peide's Nationalist army. Luo's upbringing left him with strong hatred towards landlords and gentry and led him to secretly join the Chinese Syndicalist Party and drift towards Zhu De.\n\nWith the rise of the aforementioned stars, and of so many others in the leftist sphere, many have begun to refuse to recognise the authority of Zhu Peide, or of Li Genyuan. Even to the point that various members of the common soldiery have begun to only report to leftist aligned officers, such as Chen Yi, or Wang Jun. Such events have, rather obviously, caused friction between the bands of brothers known as the Third Army Rightists and Leftists, even in spite of the common comradery many on both sides still feel for each other."

 YUN.midgame.486.t: "Forever a Fighter"
 YUN.midgame.486.d: "Such resounding spirit! Such a storied history! Such daring endeavours! An unrelenting force of nature destined to spawn the revolution of future generations! That is who Li Genyuan is! A man to which many owe their revolutionary legacy to, and yet he is besmirched by the Kuomintang, by Cai E, by Beiyang. But not by Yunnan itself, no. For he himself is a true son of the southwest. Enduring, rugged, strong, and powerful. A soldier, a military instructor, a principal, commander, bureaucrat, governor. Li has been many things, and he continues to expand his ever increasing repertoire of professions and experiences even now.\n\nYet so committed was he to the military profession, that as a young student from the Shikan Gakko, the mere prospect of switching to nonmilitary studies mortified Li Genyuan when he fell sick in 1905 — that he \"would rather die\" than do so. The strength of Li Genyuan's commitment would be incomprehensible if his patriotism was merely routine, automatic, no more than a veneer. Here lay the consolation for the many experiences of Li's lifetime which were not easy or pleasant.\n\nLi's dedication has reached the souls of many, for his words are forever engrained both within Kunming Academy, and the nation. \"If a military spirit does not arise, brave men will not come forth. If brave men do not come forth, the national soul is lost. If the national soul is lost, how can the state survive? Let us hope China's bushido will now appear. With it, the preservation of territory and the defence of the state will be very easy\". With such words, with such vigour, it is glaringly obvious to all around Yunnan that Li Genyuan is the true King of Yunnan's nationalism, and it is no surprise that his following amongst the officers and people grows day by day.\n\nWhatever the case, Li's legacy is ingrained in the soldiers of the present. Be it through his protégé, Gu Pinzhen, who successfully fought the likes of Wu Peifu, and who's spirit — instilled by Li — remains within his students Jin Handing and Hu Ruoyu. All soldiers of the present revolution, from Zhu Peide to Long Yun, they all owe their livelihood to Li in one way or another, and without Li the nation may very well have suffered under Yuan Shikai's disaster."

#Zeal Events (490-499)

 YUN.midgame.490.t: "The Party and the Qing Bang"
 YUN.midgame.490.d: "Since the early revolutionary days of resisting the Manchu monarchy, the patriotic and heroic revolutionaries could be found in not just the Nationalist Party but also in the Chinese underworld. Many of the party's leaders, such as Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and Chen Qimei, held links to the secret societies of triads and gangsters, bound together by the ethereal vice of greed but yet displaying a curious sense of heroic loyalty, one akin to that of the Japanese Yakuza or Italian Mafia. While these criminal ties helped the Nationalist Party in some of its weakest days, these unsavory connections have damaged their reputation since then.\n\nBoth the CC Clique and the Blueshirts (despite their mutual animosity and distrust for one another) hold extensive ties with the Green Gangs. Liu Shanchan for example, is a Blueshirts member but also holds close ties with Shanghai's underworld - boasting about 10,000 followers in the Big Sword and Small Swords societies. In recent times, the parties have even employed triads to enforce Kuomintang loyal unions and resolve labour conflicts in attempts at yellow unionism. While unions have generally been viewed with skepticism within the party due to the CSP and LCS, enforcing sole Kuomintang unions is a lot easier with the control of violent gangsters especially in the coastal cities.\n\nAs many of the party's right-wing sees the goal is to ultimately absorb the Triads, at the time being it does not seem possible given their pervasive influence. Scandals have already emerged when the gangster Shi Liangcai has discovered a secret silver deal between top Kuomintang officials like Kong Xiangxi, who has in turn through the Political Science Clique demanded that Shi be quietly dealt with. But with party cynicism at an all time high and corruption and brutality so normalized, one has to ask who the real criminals are?"
 YUN.midgame.490.a: "Criminals must be dealt with, no matter our past ties"
 YUN.midgame.490.b: "Sometimes one must be morally flexible."

 YUN.midgame.491.t: "The Cycle of Corruption"
 YUN.midgame.491.d: "Guanxi, which does not have a direct translation (Guan means closed and caring, Xi means system), is heavily embedded in Chinese culture. It describes a deeply personal network, a connection stronger than a mere business relation or a personal contact, which has its origins in Confucianism and plays a role in politics, business, and society.\n\nTo many outsiders in the Republic however, this term has become synonymous with \"Corruption\" and \"Nepotism\" in the Nationalist government. A growing sense of cynicism and ruthlessness in the Kuomintang movement has created a sense of malaise, weakening the bonds of ideological loyalty in favour of personal transactions. With patronage becoming such an important factor in major appointments in the government, political reform has been stifled and the party's popularity has plummeted as well.\n\nEven personally incorruptible men have struggled to confront the rising tide of corruption, with the rot becoming so embedded into the system that cracking down on it would likely result in any man - including perhaps even the President - losing power.\n\nThe support base of the party has begun to slim down. In order to protect their favourable Guanxi networks, party officials have tended to stress that the masses stay in their \"proper place\", away from the halls of power. Their Neo-Confucian justifications have done little to ingratiate them with the population, and many fear it will further destabilise our government."
 YUN.midgame.491.a: "The people must have faith in us and our well-informed leaders!"
 YUN.midgame.491.b: "To have harmony, the masses must know their place and their leaders behave honourably."
 YUN.midgame.491.c: "With revolutionary gusto, we shall shake up the system!"

 YUN.midgame.492.t: "Corruption Scandals in Guizhou"
 YUN.midgame.492.d: "As a party dedicated to the uplifting of China's masses, the issue of land is one that has torn apart the party at its ideological seams - with both the left and right wings of the Kuomintang unable to come to a compromise as to how to best handle the issue of land. Particular criticism has been leveled at Generalissmo He, who owns extensive land holdings in Guizhou despite the government promising fair and adequate land reforms. The Generalissmo's brother-in-law, Wang Boqun has also come under public scrutiny. An early member of the Tongmenghui who was associated with Dr. Sun Yat-sen during the attempted peace conference after the Wuchang Uprising, Wang had recently served as the Minister of Transportation and has been noted for his accomplishments in improving communications, railways, and even aviation. However, a public campaign in recent months has exposed Wang for participating in the opium trade, with many in the government, especially those in the Civil Engineering Clique, calling him to resign. Gu Zhenglun, the prominent Guizhou politician, has also called for an investigation into the Generalissmo's holdings (perhaps in an attempt to undermine He's control of the province) - a declaration supported by those in the Political Science Clique. To a lesser extent, He Yingqin's younger brother He Jiwu, who has worked under Wang Boqun as the Vice Chairman of China Airlines, a Provincial Government member, and a candidate for Mayor of Guiyang (the provincial Capital), has come under scrutiny."
 YUN.midgame.492.a: "It's all nonsense really."
 YUN.midgame.492.b: "We need to investigate this further."
 YUN.midgame.492.c: "Gu Zhenglun takes the initiative."

 YUN.midgame.493.t: "The Zhejiang-isation of the Party"
 YUN.midgame.493.d: "The Kuomintang, long based out of Guangzhou, is a primarily southern dominated party. Cantonese politicians and others hailing from Guangdong used to make up the bulk of the party apparatus. However, due to the influence of Dai Jitao, Chen Guofu and the late Chiang Kai-shek, the New Right draws much of its rank and file from Zhejiang and to a lesser extent Guizhou. This has caused resentment and a protracted battle for influence with the Cantonese old guard.\n\nShanghai, and the wealthy Jiangnan region has been a major hub of political activity among the Kuomintang right, even after the establishment of the Legation Cities. Guanxi networks that tie many leading party members to the city have allowed men like the Chen brothers to tap into family, social, banking, regional, and political connections to develop the CC Clique as a political force, and the memory of revolutionary leader Chen Qimei still carries weight even in a changed Shanghai society. Many of the \"patriotic\" elite have begun to cast their bets on the Kuomintang, sending the party millions in loans. Likewise, plenty of the secret societies, especially the infamous Green Gang, have begun to lock ranks behind the Zhejiangers against the socialists and the Cantonese factions of the party.\n\nThat is not to say that the Cantonese, which dominate the Moscow Committee Clique, are a spent force. They continue to be the intellectual vanguard of the party and retain extensive financial and political connections which continue to rival the Jiangnan gentry, merchants, and industrialists that have rallied behind the New Right. Moreover, many northerners have found greater sympathy with the Political Science Clique, finding them more amenable and less radical. The political transition however, though not always immediately obvious, is well underway - the Zhejiang intellectual elite like Dai Jitao and Chen Guofu have inherited a more conservative, gentry-scholar inspired reformism common in their home province, moving away from the Taiping heritage of the party."
 YUN.midgame.493.a: "Order and revolution are not necessarily opposed."
 YUN.midgame.493.b: "Perhaps they can find more stable partners?"
 YUN.midgame.493.c: "We must retain the dynamism of old!"

 YUN.midgame.494.t: "Building a Party Line"
 YUN.midgame.494.d: "Building a cohesive party-line has been the tireless mission of the Central Political School, dominated by the CC Clique. Dai Jitao and Chen Guofu personally had helped to pick out many of Whampoa's earliest classes, and Chen Lifu's involvement in the Organisational Department of the Party has helped to keep out unwanted fifth columnists like socialists.\n\nBut there is more to a Party Orthodoxy than simply excluding the disloyal. The Kuomintang must present a new vision for Chinese Society, one that can mobilise the masses to make the sacrifices needed to give them victory.\n\nThe New Culture Movement has influenced the party, both in opposition and in favour of its various ideals. Many of the civics textbooks printed by the Party School have emphasised the modern and egalitarian nature of the Three Principles of the People, mirroring New Culture demands for increased production, progressive development, women's rights, and social and economic welfare for the working classes.\n\nHowever, the party has also, under the influence of Dai Jitao, come down strongly against the anti-traditionalism and individualism of the movement. They have called for an organically integrated society, built and guided by the party which would simultaneously be integrated but also an independent, objective, and tutoring entity.\n\nThere are some internal contradictions within this concept of an ideal Kuomintang society. More traditionalist thinkers conceive it as reinvigorating the old family-based hierarchies of the idealised past - this Neo-Confucian style civilisation would be built on strings of hierarchical relationships that combine into a collective mass. More modernist philosophers have suggested instead that society ought to be effectively homogenised - one organically united party-state."
 YUN.midgame.494.a: "We can restore the harmonious bonds that nurture us!"
 YUN.midgame.494.b: "We can build a modern, progressive society!"
 YUN.midgame.494.c: "We will have one nation, one people, and one future!"
 YUN.midgame.494.e: "The people ought to be able to think for themselves."

 YUN.midgame.495.t: "The Purpose of Revolution"
 YUN.midgame.495.d: "\"What is the purpose of revolution?\" Dai asked, before giving his answer. \"It is to wrest the new culture which destroyed our old culture away from the minority so that the common people as a whole can reclaim the privileged position where they can partake of that new culture. Our goal is not excessive, for our ancestors had always possessed such privilege. In places where the encounter with \"modern civilisation came somewhat late, even a man in his middle age like myself can recall the beauty of human sentiments and happiness of the common people\"\n\nWith nationalistic conviction at an all time high, faith in its ability to fundamentally change society has climbed with it. To the Right Kuomintang, there is little that it cannot do. Nationalism, and only nationalism and the Nationalist Party, can create an egalitarian society with a culture free of hedonistic consumerism. This utopian society will instead be built on a moral enterprise inherited from Confucious, which Dai maintains has inspired Dr. Sun more than Marx or Lenin.\n\nThe basis of the nationalism in the Three Principles of the People then, \"is the ethics of filial piety.\" Similarly, \"the basis of democracy is the ethics of trust and righteousness.\" and \"the basis of the people's welfare is the ethics of benevolence and people.\" In other words, the Three Principles of the People represent both China's past and future - inspired by Confucian teachings but fundamentally revolutionary in its ability to save China from decay."
 YUN.midgame.495.a: "Through filial piety, we unite a nation!"
 YUN.midgame.495.b: "Trust and righteousness is what maintains a republic."
 YUN.midgame.495.c: "Benevolence and peace is what builds our livelihoods."
 YUN.midgame.495.e: "What type of nonsense is this?"

#KMT Satellite Narrative Events (500-519)
 YUN.midgame.500.t: "Zhu Peide Purges Long Yun"
 YUN.midgame.500.d: "Zhu Peide's submission to the central government in exchange for their recognition of his governorship has strengthened his hand considerably. Having received secret authorisation from the Central Executive Committee, Zhu has moved to arrest Long Yun and many of his closest allies, bringing Zhaotong firmly under his control.\n\nKunming's submission to [ROOT.OVERLORD.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has shifted the balance of power, not only in the broader Chinese political scene, but also in the southwest. The once powerful General Long's arrest demonstrates that the Kuomintang are not simply \"passing through\" Yunnan before marching on Guangzhou as the local gentry hoped, but rather are determined to stay and reorganise the province along the lines of the party-state.\n\nZhu is not the only one strengthened by this recent turn of events. The wily Hu Ruoyu, still in command of Mengzi to the south, was one of the first major Yunnan clique leaders to switch uniforms in hopes of retaining power despite his prior associations with German and Zhili interests. With his two greatest rivals (Tang Jiyao and Long Yun) eliminated, many of the old provincial elite turned to him to resist the encroachment of the revolutionaries.\n\nFor now however, Zhu Peide's position is secure. Hu Ruoyu continues to openly profess his loyalty, even painting himself as a leftist at times to shore up party support and avoid sharing in Long's fate. However he is also advising the government to release Long Yun into his care to ease the fears of the gentry. A sometime competitor and occasional ally of convenience to Long, General Hu is unlikely to let him far off his leash but the possibility of General Long retaining field command concerns many."
 YUN.midgame.500.a: "Long Yun will remain in custody in Kunming."
 YUN.midgame.500.b: "Long Yun will be transferred to house arrest in Mengzi."

 YUN.midgame.501.t: "Li Genyuan's Second Chance"
 YUN.midgame.501.d: "In order to preserve his tenuous hold over Yunnan, Zhu Peide has been forced to lean on a host of different pillars. These include leftist radicals in the Third Army, his fellow rightists (of dubious loyalty) in the Third Army, the Yunnan Gentry, and now increasingly the resurgent Political Science Clique - carefully balancing all of these actors against one another.\n\nZhu's partnership with Li Genyuan is in some ways a natural one and in others a dangerous gamble. General Li remains an openly ambitious man, even if he nominally remains in the back seat. A former Cai E deputy and instructor at Kunming Military Academy, his has historically clashed with Tang Jiyao and the Yunnan Gentry over his revolutionary charisma but also broke with Sun Yat-sen and the mainline Kuomintang for his support of Cen Chunxuan and promotion of North-South unification talks in the 1920s. Many wonder if Governor Zhu will be much different from Gu Pinzhen (who's brief Governorship was marred by accusations of being a puppet of Li), though Zhu has always been capable of political independence of his own right - having remained neutral during the Gu-Tang conflict.\n\nThe Political Science Clique's influence extends to Guizhou too. Zhang Qun is a prominent head of logistics for the old First Army, having cultivated his own \"New Political Science Clique\". Slightly closer to the Kuomintang establishment, Zhang is loosely connected with Li's faction though remains a separate entity.\n\nAll in all, Li Genyuan is expected to be an essential partner for stabilising the province, but he also threatens to undermine Zhu Peide's rule thanks to his own unpopularity and ceaseless ambition."
 YUN.midgame.501.a: "A welcome help to regional administration."
 YUN.midgame.501.b: "Another threat to the integrity of our rule."

 YUN.midgame.502.t: "He Yingqin's Fading Light"
 YUN.midgame.502.d: "He Yingqin's relationship with his fellow National Revolutionary Army commanders has always been contentious, seen as too much of a Chiang lackey to be trusted but having betrayed Chiang at a few crucial moments that have undermined trust within the Whampoa circle. His chief advantage in maintaining his influence during the exile period was his extensive ties to Guizhou. But now that the Kuomintang has reasserted control over many other provinces, his leverage has weakened considerably. Not particularly intimidating as a person or exceptionally charismatic, he has been easy to isolate on a national scale.\n\nThanks to Zhu Peide and Li Genyuan's scheming, the Central Government has quietly pressured the Whampoa General to resign from his Governorship over Guizhou. They have noted his disloyalty and corruption, and accused him of insubordination to the national revolution. He has been replaced by Zhang Qun, an ascendant Political Science Clique alumni and a long-time Chiang Kai-shek staffer.\n\nZhang has promoted extensive reforms and close cooperation with Kunming,but has been unable to prevent a power vacuum from emerging. He Yingqin and his allies retain ties among prominent members of the local gentry. Zhang Qun's decision to recruit Yang Yongtai, a former Political Science Clique associate previously exiled, is expected to mend some ties, but they have proven obstinate with their leader's fall\n\nMore concerning is the reaction of many members of the First Army, which is dominated by Whampoa Military Academy graduates. Disillusioned by the liberal, \"counterrevolutionary\" turn of the regional government, many have flocked to the young, charismatic Chen Cheng who has stepped up calls for anti-corruption, land reform, and other populist promises. This leftward turn will be much harder to stop, with Whampoa officers being notoriously cliquish and ideological."
 YUN.midgame.502.a: "Chen Cheng and Whampoa are outraged by this turn of events!"
 YUN.midgame.502.b: "Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai's reforms will bind the region together."

 YUN.midgame.503.t: "Leftists in the Southwest"
 YUN.midgame.503.d: "The southwest has historically been a relatively conservative region, though revolutionary nationalism and leftist sympathies are hardly unheard of. There was a considerable revolutionary Tongmenghui presence during the 1911 Revolution, even as they competed with reformist factions for influence. Wang Fusheng and other Yunnan students studying under Li Dazhao in Beijing established an underground circle of syndicalists known as the New Dian Society, vowing to bring the revolution to their home province.\n\nThe arrival of the Kuomintang following the Long March brought another wave of leftism into the region. Wang made an attempt to establish a clandestine socialist circle in the College of Law and Politics, publishing the Minguo Ribao (Daily Republic) but was quickly evicted. The New Yunnan Society (sometimes translated as the New Dian Society, Dian being the Chinese abbreviation of Yunnan), broke from the more urban focused approach of the mainline CSP and fled to the countryside in hopes of organising the peasants, local minorities, and bandits against Tang Jiyao's rule.\n\nThe more serious contenders however are backed by the military. Chen Cheng is a protégé of both Deng Yanda and Chiang Kai-shek, embodying the revolutionary left-nationalism of the early Whampoa Military Academy. Nicknamed the Civil Engineering Clique, they have cannibalised other Whampoa factions in Guizhou.\n\nZhu De is another rising star. A close friend of Zhu Peide and with ties to Fan Shisheng and Jin Handing, he is prominent within the Yunnan military. In correspondence with Zhang Bojun, a prominent Provisional Action Committee member (a leading political force within the Kuomintang in the MinGan insurgency zone), his circle is a notable outpost of leftism in the province."
 YUN.midgame.503.a: "Wang Fusheng and the New Yunnan Society clash with the gentry!"
 YUN.midgame.503.b: "Chen Cheng and the Civil Engineering Clique battle for Guizhou!"
 YUN.midgame.503.c: "Zhu De and the Third Army Leftists struggle for Kunming!"

 YUN.midgame.504.t: "The Party and the Tusi"
 YUN.midgame.504.d: "The Kuomintang has had a complex relationship with minorities in China, mirroring the Han dominated Xinhai Revolution's own complicated attitudes towards Chinese nationalism. The Kuomintang claims to stand for all Chinese, regardless of ethnic heritage, but has frequently suffered accusations of Han Chauvinism. Their nationalism and social darwinism often clashes with their egalitarian ideals, which has been further complicated in practice by their webs of local alliances with warlords, the gentry, socialists, and minority groups.\n\nYunnan and Guizhou are both home to a large population of ethnic minorities. These include the Yi, Bai, Buyei, Dong, Tujia, Miao, Hani, Zhuang, Dai, and many others. Minorities have played a complex role in regional politics, historically the Qing Dynasty sought to enlist their leaders as allies, classifying native chiefs as Tuguan (for civilian roles) or Tusi (for military ones) and seeking to educate their children to create a reliable caste of vassals. This has played a role in border disputes with the British over Burma, where even after Qing authority receded local provincial leaders continued to recruit Tusi to stake Chinese claims over disputed territories and demanded tribute. Miao traders in Yunnan also played a role in commercial disputes against concessions.\n\nEthnic minorities in Yunnan have also played a major role during the Xinhai Revolution. Zhang Wenguang published a republican, populist manifesto and tried successfully to capture Dali with a Tongmenghui army that consisted of many minorities and Muslims. One of his chief deputies was Dao Anren, a minority chieftain who died in exile trying to make contact with Sun Yat-sen.\n\nWith the Kuomintang's victory in the region, many are watching to see how they treat local ethnic groups - a delicate matter when nearly a third of the population are non-Han. The role of the Tusi in particular can be contentious, with some arguing that they are critical allies to empowering local groups to oppose the gentry while others arguing that they are just as much backwards reactionaries as the gentry they oppose."
 YUN.midgame.504.a: "Let it be known that the Kuomintang seek to empower all people in China!"
 YUN.midgame.504.b: "The Kuomintang is a force of progress and unity and will enlighten them!"

 YUN.midgame.505.t: "Dueling Outlooks in Yunnan"
 YUN.midgame.505.d: "Pre-Xinhai Revolution Yunnan had been dominated by two duelling political outlooks regarding the encroaching influence of foreign concessionists, one of reformist nationalism generally carried by the Yunnan gentry who sought to eliminate unfair foreign trade practices through domestic economic development and some cooperation with foreign traders and the other of revolutionary nationalism by commercial firms and ethnic minorities who sought to promote a freer domestic market and the nationalisation of foreign rail monopolies.\n\nThis divide between reformists and revolutionaries continued after the Xinhai Revolution, with Cai E's decision to side with the reformists being decisive in swinging provincial politics against the radical Tongmenghui. Attempts by the Tongmenghui and later the Kuomintang to instigate rebellions against the reformist status quo were harshly quashed, with Kuomintang generals like Gu Pinzhen, Li Genyuan, Zhu Peide, Fan Shisheng, and Jin Handing finding little success in their various endeavours to \"liberate\" their home province.\n\nHaving settled into power, Zhu Peide, Li Genyuan, and Zhang Qun find themselves the new status quo, but are still forced to contend with reformist elements backed by the Yunnan gentry and the conservative General Hu Ruoyu. At the same time however, radicalism remains in the vogue for many in the party, with Zhu De and Chen Cheng seeking to radically reshape the southwest. The vocalness of these men inhabiting the radical fringe make them difficult to ignore.\n\nThe pace of change has always been a delicate balance and it is no easy thing to decide. At the end of the day there will always have to be a mixture of philosophies, but all can agree that change is not only needed, but probably at close hand."
 YUN.midgame.505.a: "Adjusting to a more reformist mindset will ensure steady change."
 YUN.midgame.505.b: "Maintaining the radical course is how real change can come about."

 YUN.midgame.506.t: "Zhang Qun's Reign in Guizhou"
 YUN.midgame.506.d: "After an uneven start, Zhang Qun's administration in Guizhou has begun to make some progress. The leftward drift of the region has made it difficult to root out, with many local workers and peasants finding sympathy with the Civil Engineering Clique of the First Army. Zhang, under the counsel of Yang Yongtai, has quickly come to the conclusion that using military force would be ineffective against Chen Cheng's growing influence.\n\nTo strengthen his regime, ostensibly for the benefit of [ROOT.OVERLORD.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Zhang has begun the reintroduction of the Baojia militia system by creating household registers, training local militias (often led by sympathetic gentrymen), building fortifications, searching and arresting socialist elements, and beginning a campaign of \"clearing and suppressing\" First Army elements who chose to defect and attempt an insurgency in the countryside. With many Sichuan refugees fleeing into the neighbouring Guizhou, Zhang's forces have been busy providing aid, reducing taxation, and also bringing the budget back into balance.\n\nChen Cheng, having rejected the path of some of his more radical subordinates in favour of official loyalty to the Guizhou administration, has chosen to bide his time instead. He has increasingly become a parallel authority figure, with many army units preferring to go through his headquarters in lieu of Guiyang. He argues that the solution to China's rural instability is 70% Political and 30% Military, championing anti-corruption, land reform, and political reform to eliminate banditry and win over the peasants. He has established (with the reluctant approval of Governor Zhang) the Provincial Grain Administrative Bureau and a People's Training Committee. In areas where Chen's forces dominate, there is a decidedly more leftist and populist atmosphere even if in many ways Zhang and Chen's objectives overlap."
 YUN.midgame.506.a: "Zhang Qun and the steady approach of the PSC brings prosperity."
 YUN.midgame.506.b: "Chen Cheng and the CEC's populist reforms brings hope."

 YUN.midgame.507.t: "Zhu Peide and the Yunnan Provincial Assembly"
 YUN.midgame.507.d: "The Yunnan Provincial Assembly is dominated by the local elite, including gentrymen, merchants, and the intelligentsia. It has proven to be a conservative liberal force, insisting on government accountability but also resisting the revolutionary reform promised by the Kuomintang. This phenomenon is hardly unique to Yunnan, with many provincial assemblies being established in the waning years of the Great Qing as imperial authority fragmented.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, Cai E and his militaristic rule tended to ignore the provincial assembly, a trend Tang Jiyao continued somewhat, but in his drive to build a federal, democratic province he was also willing to offer some concessions to the assembly. While Tang has fallen from power, many of his followers remain, creating a liberal and conservative blend in the provincial assembly that has clashed with the influx of Kuomintang aligned legislators.\n\nThis reflects Zhu Peide and Li Genyuan's similarly complex history with the Provincial Assembly. Both have proven willing to work with the institution, with Li beginning his career as an ideological militarist like Cai E but swapping to a more civilian focused approach as the revolution developed. He has summarised his approach by saying that \"unless the officials and gentry cooperate with one mind, it is truly difficult to rid ourselves of trouble\".\n\nZhu Peide has also expressed some openness to civilian oversight, but he has also spent much of his career as an outsider - having been exiled to Guangzhou fairly early in the revolution. This has left him with few friends among the Yunnan elite, and many leftists and even some rightists in his circle advising him to stack the assembly with more representatives \"of the people\" rather than cater to the establishment. Doing so would weaken the assembly in favour of party rule, effectively erasing the small gains made under Tang's decades long rule."
 YUN.midgame.507.a: "The Assembly has a place in our province's future."
 YUN.midgame.507.b: "It is the party that truly represents the wishes of the people."

 YUN.midgame.508.t: "The Bazhai Uprising"
 YUN.midgame.508.d: "The gentry and officials appointed by Kunming are often at odds, a challenge that stalked prior administrations and reflects the continued difficult realities of Kuomintang rule. The landed elite often control local security militias that are usually operating independent of government directives.\n\nOne of these many battles has played out in the village of Bazhai, reflecting the complex nature of the Yunnan political situation. The Maguan district government attempted to confiscate weapons from local tribespeople after a local militia captain refused to submit and was accused of collecting taxes without approval. This triggered a revolt, which was quickly backed by agitators from the syndicalist New Yunnan Society, allowing it to gain momentum.\n\nTo many's surprise, the local landlords threw their weight behind the Bazhai rebels, sending their militias to support the rebellion and intimidating government forces into backing down. The alliance between minority tribesmen, socialists, and the gentry quickly proved to be a shaky one, as leftists and reactionaries battled for influence within the movement, allowing the government to send reinforcements as the revolt stalled.\n\nIn the face of the government advance, radical commanders have advised a surprise attack in hopes of turning the tide before the gentry switch sides and leave them to take the fall. Gentry militia captains have instead advised negotiations with the government, hoping to end the conflict with little bloodshed."
 YUN.midgame.508.a: "An aggressive surprise attack allows surviving socialist forces to get away!"
 YUN.midgame.508.b: "The rebels negotiate to preserve their numbers for the future."

 YUN.midgame.509.t: "Guizhou's Rising Stars"
 YUN.midgame.509.d: "Zhang Qun, in his quest to bring the First Army under his control in Guizhou, has elevated many younger and less politically connected generals into positions of dual military and civilian authority. Xiong Shihui has been the most promising of this young guard, long an accountant of the Administrative Affairs Committee in Guizhou and well known among Zhang Qun's circle.\n\nDespite his military background (or perhaps because of it), his focus has been on public works projects, streamlining taxation, and fighting banditry. Appointed by Zhang as Director of the General Office of the Guiyang Headquarters, he has received praise for building parks, bridges, guest houses, roads and also abolishing over a hundred exorbitant taxes.\n\nThis has naturally drawn comparisons to the reforms of the Civil Engineering Clique, who boast of rising stars of their own. Zhu Huaibing is another military man and a classmate of Chen Cheng with ties to Yunnan as well. Veering rightwards to bolster the CEC's credentials in promoting stability, Zhu has outlined his \"Political Combat Plan for Guizhou's Counties\" and a \"Plan for Building a New Guizhou\", organising local militias (including those of the gentry), merging and reorganising villages, and increasing sentries. Despite his humble claim to \"do great things instead of being a big official\", he has attracted criticisms for his draconian slogan of \"if one family is in contact with the bandits, five will be punished\".\n\nBoth Xiong and Zhu have sought to take command of the Guizhou Provincial Enterprise Committee and its freshly proposed Guizhou Industrial Company. This state-run corporation is set to take control of over fifty local companies and mines that the Kuomintang nationalised when it first arrived in Guizhou, often mismanaged by party cadres. With the final roster of its board of directors being elected or appointed in the coming weeks, both men promise that they will bring fresh blood in to revitalise Guizhou's economy."
 YUN.midgame.509.a: "Xiong Shihui and his band of Western educated technocrats will do the job."
 YUN.midgame.509.b: "Zhu Huaibing's cadres dedicate their lives to the revitalisation of industry."

 YUN.midgame.520.t: "Socialist Advisors Arrive in Kunming"
 YUN.midgame.520.d: "With Yunnan's submission to [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the leftist Central Committee have found Kuomintang allies in the southwest, though not necessarily ones they trust. Both Zhu Peide of Yunnan and He Yingqin of Guizhou are noted rightists, but Zhu Peide is known to be open to leftist advisors in his ranks and He Yingqin is a former Chiang Kai-shek deputy and thus a known if not necessarily liked quantity among Whampoa officers.\n\nAll the same, to help steer Kunming and Guiyang back to the revolutionary orthodoxy, the Central Executive Committee has seen fit to dispatch a delegation of \"advisors\" to the region. This delegation is headed by Zhang Bojun, a prominent Provisional Action Committee aligned leader who travelled to Europe on the same boat as General Zhu De in 1922 and became friends and roommates with the Third Army protégé.\n\nIn Guizhou, General Zhou Zhirou was reunited with his sworn brothers Chen Cheng and Luo Zhuoying. A fellow Baoding graduate and Whampoa Instructor, during the exile period he studied military aviation in Europe, becoming a leading expert in the field. He is also a known affiliate of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Comrades Association (WMARCA) and thus associated with General Deng Yanda. Joining him is Yan Lisan, another Whampoa Instructor and close friend of Deng, who has been promised positions of importance in Guizhou's civil administration.\n\nWang Jingwei and the RCA are not without allies in the region. Zhou Enlai is also a friend of Zhu De, and believes that if push comes to shove he will remain loyal to the civilian party over WMARCA putschists. In Guizhou, Gu Zhenglun is the somewhat estranged elder sibling of the Gu brothers, two noted RCA organisers. Though divided by politics, family often transcends ideology.\n\nRegardless these men have one job - to prevent Yunnan from falling back into gentry hands and to ensure its continued loyalty to the socialist establishment."
 YUN.midgame.520.a: "Zhang, Zhou, and Yan will help shape Yunnan in a leftist direction."
 YUN.midgame.520.b: "Zhou Enlai and the Gus will do a fantastic job."
 YUN.midgame.520.c: "We all head to the Southwest together! (Switch to Yunnan)"

 YUN.midgame.520.f: "The true revolution will prevail."

 YUN.midgame.531.t: "Rural Reconstruction Aid from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 YUN.midgame.531.d: "General Chen Cheng's calls for extensive rural land reform, including land-to-the-tiller, rent caps, and streamlining of taxation is seen as a scaled-down version of the more radical proposals of the left Kuomintang but perhaps that was necessary to get those proposals through the door in conservative Guizhou.\n\nThe National Reconstruction Commission has offered to fund these efforts, approving several major grants and offering to deploy technocrats to the Guizhou countryside. Doing so would grant Chen a major political victory and shift attitudes in the countryside in favour of the Civil Engineering Clique.\n\nWhile the prospects of large-scale economic development in Guizhou are tantalising, some advisors in Governor Zhang Qun's circle have advised us to stall or otherwise obstruct projects the provincial government would not be able to directly control, lest the countryside fall to the socialists."
 YUN.midgame.531.a: "This aid will be vital for Guizhou's reconstruction."
 YUN.midgame.531.b: "This aid is but a ploy for our ultimate destruction."

 YUN.midgame.532.t: "[FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Arms the Civil Engineering Clique"
 YUN.midgame.532.d: "Chen Cheng has recently been appointed commander of the 18th Army, split from the old 1st Army that encamped in Guizhou. Combined with his direct command of the 10th Division, his faction has been dubbed the \"Civil Engineering Clique\" (a visual pun) and represents the leftward drift of Chiang Kai-shek's Whampoa Clique. While perhaps not truly socialist, Chen's affiliation with Deng Yanda and the PAC has made him the most visible leftist in Guizhou.\n\nThe Military Affairs Commission has ordered a major weapons shipment to the 18th Army, particularly the 10th Division, with a broad mandate for General Chen to strengthen party control, reinforce existing units, and raise new ones. Guizhou security forces aligned with Governor Zhang have been snubbed, leading to resentment.\n\nTo seize these weapons shipments would likely cause more bloodshed and weaken the cause as a whole, but to not do so would destabilise Governor Zhang's control over Guizhou."
 YUN.midgame.532.a: "I suppose raising another security division or two would make Guizhou safer."
 YUN.midgame.532.b: "One would think socialists would understand the need to share resources."

 YUN.midgame.533.t: "[FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Cultivates Third Army Leftists"
 YUN.midgame.533.d: "General Zhu De is perhaps the most visible leftist in the Third Army, a brilliant strategic mind and well connected among regional revolutionary generals including Zhu Peide, Fan Shisheng, and Jin Handing. With personal politics often taking priority to ideology in the southwest, he is seen as a vital asset by the central committee.\n\nThe Military Affairs Commission has offered to fund major renovations to Kunming Arsenal and Kunming Military Academy, no doubt hoping to gain leverage over Yunnan's military. As a quid pro quo, General Zhu and his followers would likely receive the lion's share of appointments to oversee these projects, threatening to turn the proud Yunnan Army red.\n\nOn the other hand however, turning down such a valuable offer would not only weaken our defences but also likely be unpopular among the army as well. And Governor Zhu Peide promises he can keep his protégé in line."
 YUN.midgame.533.a: "These initiatives will go a long way in bolstering our defence against imperialism."
 YUN.midgame.533.b: "Yunnan has never needed outsiders to protect our frontier."

 YUN.midgame.534.t: "[FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Empowers Zhang Bojun"
 YUN.midgame.534.d: "Zhang Bojun is a socialist party cadre deployed to Yunnan as an \"advisor\", in practice acting as their plenipotentiary to the southwest. Zhang is a fairly effective diplomat - well educated and charismatic, he is able to weave his way into local intellectual circles. With many Yunnan students and professors disillusioned by recent political developments, they are ripe to be converted, he claims, if only the central committee would be generous with his allowance.\n\nIt would appear that he has finally received his request, and he has been hard at work making use of it. His ability to mobilise the intellectual classes for the Kuomintang has been useful for making the government run more smoothly, but there is a growing suspicion towards the leftward drift of the Yunnan party."
 YUN.midgame.534.a: "Zhang Bojun is doing good work harmonising socialism and good governance."
 YUN.midgame.534.b: "It would be a shame if some \"accidents\" were to befall his supporters."

 YUN.midgame.535.t: "[FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Recognises the New Yunnan Society"
 YUN.midgame.535.d: "The Yunnan Special Bureau of the Chinese Syndicalist Party is a covert group of former students turned revolutionaries with military-political training from Whampoa. Led by brothers Wang Desan and Wang Fusheng, they have achieved some success infiltrating the province on behalf of the broader New Yunnan Society, a society of Yunnan born syndicalists within the CSP. Official recognition to these rabble rousers by the Central Government has allowed them to step out of the shadows, spreading their malicious lies in the open.\n\nThe long term beneficiaries of this political development remain in the air. The New Yunnan Society is expected to expand in size thanks to the proclamation, but not all Yunnan syndicalists are confident in the CSP's long term ability to hold onto the region. Instead, some have sought an alliance with Zhang Bojun and Zhu De, hoping the protection of the larger left Kuomintang will allow syndicalism to prosper in Kunming.\n\nThe Yunnan government's ability to clamp down on them is limited, risking drawing the ire of the central government. Some have advised trying to co-opt the leftist energy with populist policies of their own, potentially undercutting the New Yunnan Society but at the expense of further legitimising leftism in the province."
 YUN.midgame.535.a: "The New Yunnan Society expands their ranks."
 YUN.midgame.535.b: "The Third Army's leftists seizes the moment."

 YUN.midgame.580.d.he_yingqin: "He Yingqin is no stranger to war and politics, having participated in the Xinhai revolution under Chen Qimei's group and in the struggle for Guizhou with Wang Wenhua before becoming Chiang Kai-shek's leading deputy. Always more of a follower than a leader, he largely stayed out of politics but changing circumstances has thrust him into the spotlight. While hardly the most adroit politician or the most charismatic leader, there is a certain stability associated with the Generalissimo. He has been able to parlay his recent victories on the battlefield to great political effect, and been dubbed the \"Lucky General\" for his ability to survive tight engagements intact."
 YUN.midgame.580.d.chen_cheng: "Chen Cheng has claimed multiple victories on the battlefield in recent days, elevating his profile on a national stage. The protégé of Chiang Kai-shek and Deng Yanda, he takes from the former a Confucian-inspired, spartan lifestyle and from the latter a leftist populist platform. His public image is one of a stern disciplinarian, leading by example by insisting on no more than four dishes on the table per meal and living ascetically. The areas under his jurisdiction have seen frivolous behaviour like smoking, liquor and dancing banned and his troops take great pride in their commitment to the revolution. He also has a lighter side, known to be polite, considerate and gentle to guests."
 YUN.midgame.580.d.teng_jie: "Teng Jie is the master of the illusive Blue Shirts Society, which has come under greater scrutiny in recent days as General Teng and his men demonstrated their fanaticism on the battlefield. Primarily a political officer, his appointment to field command came as a surprise to some, but he quickly silenced any doubt with his acumen in leading his divisions to victory. The extremism of his men, inspired by the global national populist movement, as well as their tendency to buck orders from the civilian wing of the party has drawn concern, but their effectiveness is hard to doubt. Whether or not they will be a liability in the future is another question."
 YUN.midgame.580.d.li_genyuan: "Li Genyuan is an experienced military man, organising exiled revolutionaries in Japan in preparation for the Xinhai Revolution. One of his first acts of leadership was the Double 9 Rebellion, which solidified his reputation as a committed republican revolutionary. Li Genyuan remains in the press thanks to his recent accomplishments in service of the National Revolutionary Army, bringing the Political Science Clique and their advocacy for constitutionalism to the forefront. In an already deeply politicised military, moderation is a break from the norm and his successes are proof that fanatical extremism is not the only way to save the nation."
 YUN.midgame.580.d.wang_boling: "Wang Boling was a prominent revolutionary and co-founder of Whampoa, but retired to a Buddhist Temple shortly after the Northern Expedition. Studying under Master Yin Guang and receiving the Buddhist name Hui Chang, most assumed that his public career was finished. But like the rest of the Kuomintang, the revolution received a second wind in 1936 and Wang was summoned out of retirement. He has well lived up to expectations, winning significant engagements against the enemy and bringing honour to his allies in the CC Clique. Outside of his military responsibilities, he is known for championing Buddhist causes, growing close to Master Taixu and advocating for the reconstruction of the Jiuzu Mountain Dojo."
 YUN.midgame.580.d.zhu_peide: "Zhu Peide is perhaps the most outstanding officer of the Yunnan Army, having spent several decades fighting for the national revolution. Known for his diligence, humility, and honesty, the Third Army continues to be a prominent force in Kuomintang affairs - bolstered by General Zhu's recent victories on the battlefield. Known for his advocacy of building up China's national defences and for material simplicity, his faction generally supports a more moderate interpretation of the Three Principles closer aligned to the \"Old Right\" of the party. His prominence on the national stage has given some relief to those who are suspicious of the more radical strains of the party."
 YUN.midgame.580.d.zhu_de: "Zhu De has lived a storied life, growing up in poverty before becoming a soldier for a variety of military men. His life changed when he became a revolutionary, dropping his opium habit and learning more about socialism and military theory in Europe. He returned home a different man, and has been instrumental in reorganising the Third Army into a potent revolutionary fighting force for the people. They proved their worth in recent days, driving back their foes in a gruelling campaign that has won Zhu the admiration of many leftists in Yunnan. With the support of the people and his innovative tactics, he vows to liberate the entire nation!"

 YUN.midgame.581.t: "The Fall of Hunan"
 YUN.midgame.581.d: "With Changsha firmly in our control, it's paramount we appoint a loyal Governor to the Province, and end its military occupation. To that end, we have a few options for Governor open to us\n\nFirst is the civilian candidate Qin Zhen, as a member of the Western Hills clique, he's naturally backed by the Moscow Committee. An old guard revolutionary, he would make a natural fit for Governor and could show a commitment to civilian rule from the KMT. The concern, of course, is that his ties to the Moscow Committee means he would serve as a potential future rival.\n\nThe second candidate, 6th Army Commander Cheng Qian, may be able to bridge that gap. Sympathetic to the Moscow Committee, Cheng was also a teacher at Whampoa, making him a solid pick to form a bridge between the Moscow Committee and He's Whampoa clique. However, Cheng is infamous for his Hunanese regionalism, to the point of leaving Guizhou and moving to take power in Hunan instead of marching on Kunming.\n\nThe third major candidate is Tan Yankai, while former commander of the 2nd Army, he was always more of a civilian figure, and has been Governor of Hunan three times in the past, still remaining popular in the Province. He left the Guizhou Junta for Hunan when the remnants of his Army were placed under Cheng Qian. Despite this, he kept contact with our forces, specifically with his son-in-law, Chen Cheng, and is attempting to leverage those connections in his bid for Governor.\n\nThere is a fourth candidate, while he may not hold the same clout as the other three, He Jian, a subordinate of the Left's Tang Shengzhi, has made a bid for Governor. A committed anti-socialist, he has tried to cultivate ties with the Whampoa Clique to gain the Governorship. An untested figure, he may be a controversial pick, but he would help shore up He Yingqin's position in Government."
 YUN.midgame.581.a: "Go with the civilian option, Qin Zhen."
 YUN.midgame.581.b: "The moderate Cheng is the right choice."
 YUN.midgame.581.c: "Tan Yankai is a popular figure, appoint him."
 YUN.midgame.581.e: "Appoint the dark horse, He Jian."

 YUN.midgame.582.t: "The Northern Kuomintang"
 YUN.midgame.582.d: "As the National Revolutionary Army crosses the Yellow River, the possibility of a Kuomintang victory in the Northern Expedition draws ever closer. Talk of the Kuomintang finally toppling Beiyang and installing their own vision for the Republic has created considerable chatter across the country, especially regarding what would happen next?\n\nThe Kuomintang, despite their pretensions of representing the entire country, is primarily a southern-based party. Sun Yat-sen, Hu Hanmin, and Wang Jingwei were all from Guangdong, and their successive governments were based out of Guangzhou. Chiang Kai-shek and Dai Jitao were from Zhejiang, and a smaller subset of the party comes from the southeast. Many of the party's rank and file come from the wider south, and the party has a short bench of candidates for leading northern branches of the party.\n\nAmong the party faithful, Ding Weifen and Yu Youren are the leading figures of the northern Kuomintang and thus have been rewarded with CEC seats. Ding Weifen has been described as reticent and a man of few but very impactful words. He had been a leader of secretive societies like the Grand Alliance, Revive China Society and Practice Society, active in provinces like Shandong and Hubei, which served as Kuomintang front organisations. Yu Youren has been described as a man of optimism and sincerity, with a powerful build and speech that epitomises the strength of the north, undeterred by age.\n\nDespite the hard work of our comrades Ding and Yu, there is a shortage of trustworthy party cadres. However, there is no shortage of people willing to be loyal to the party, as Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai have pointed out. They believe that with their connections to Beiyang, they can secure the defection of many moderate republican figures like Huang Fu and unite the nation at last. This has raised the ire of the hardliners, who denounce these men as corrupt sellouts who dilute the party. They call for tried and true loyalists to be sent north to reinforce and “teach” a new generation of party members."
 YUN.midgame.582.a: "Let us lean on our northern comrades' connections to filter candidates."
 YUN.midgame.582.b: "The only way forward is to unite with our Beiyang brethren."

##Section 3d (700-999): Mid Game NPA Political Events

#NPA Introduction Events (700-729):
 YUN.midgame.700.t: "The Kunming Coup"
 YUN.midgame.700.d: "With most officers, including many loyalists of the old regime, understanding that the tide of the war had turned irrevocably against Yunnan, Generals Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu were able to stage a coup d'etat and bring the war to an unfavourable but accepted end. Yunnan Army units under Hu Ruoyu at the front line mutinied and arrested loyalist senior officers, Long Yun was able to seize Kunming with the help of sympathisers in the police and garrison. Other regions fell shortly afterwards as other generals defected to the conspirators.\n\nTang Jiyao is nominally still the governor, with no outsiders having recognised any change in leadership since his overthrow. However, he has not made any public appearances and it is an open secret that he has been detained with no access to outside communication - a lesson Long and Hu learned the hard way during his original overthrow in 1927. In the meantime, the two Generals are fighting over the spoils.\n\nThe disaster that was the Second Dian-Gui War likely marks the final end of Yunnan interventionism as Yunnan turns inward. As defeated troops march home with their tails between their legs, anger surges - some blaming their leaders for sending them on yet another doomed campaign, others accusing them of stabbing them in the back. In Kunming, there has been a similar upswing of anger and radicalism from both supporters and opponents of the war, a crisis that will have to be addressed soon. But leaders outside of Yunnan sigh in relief as the once belligerent province returns into isolation."
 YUN.midgame.700.a: "An ignominious failure."

 YUN.midgame.701.t: "Yunnan Generals Stage Coup in Kunming"
 YUN.midgame.701.d: "Despite their bluster and their proud military heritage, the armies of Yunnan and Guizhou ultimately failed to make meaningful progress during the Second Yunnan-Guangxi War. With their advances either stalled or driven back, fears abounded that their opponents would invade Yunnan proper, propelling leading Yunnan Army officers to overthrow their own government and sign an armistice.\n\nLeadership in Yunnan is in a flux. Official documents continue to be signed by externally-recognised Governor Tang Jiyao, but he has not been seen in public in some time. The other names coming out of Kunming are Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu, who are said to be fighting for supremacy. Either way, this likely marks the end of Yunnan's military adventuring as the mountain province turns towards isolationism."
 YUN.midgame.701.a: "The Yunnan dragon sleeps."

 YUN.midgame.702.t: "An Uneasy Truce"
 YUN.midgame.702.d: "The post-coup political situation is chaotic and uneasy as Yunnan polarises into different camps. Among the two ascendant strongmen, Long Yun generally represents the status quo, courting Tang Jiyao's old ministers and promoting a message of order and stability. He hopes to combine his extensive military ties with his former mentor's political patronage network to control the province and ensure a smooth transition.\n\nHu Ruoyu on the other hand has taken a reactionary stance, hoping to drastically shake up the government and eliminate the \"corruption\" of the Tang regime. While occasionally pandering to socialist and nationalist sentiment, he ultimately hopes to assemble a gentry-merchant coalition, promoting demilitarisation and negotiations with the central government. He is also willing to use bandits, foreign support, and even ex-KMT activists to get his way.\n\nNeither men have absolute sway over the gentry, merchants, and other provincial elites whose support will be vital for their ultimate takeover. Both have courted them extensively through their competing messages, but their support remains fickle. While having a stronger army is vital, so too is the endorsement of the elite.\n\nA dark horse in these times in Lu Han, one of Long Yun's officers and a relative of some sort - their exact relationship is unclear, Lu Han married one of Long Yun's cousins but they were close prior to the marriage and there are rumors that they are half brothers or kinsmen of some sort as well. General Lu has ridden Long's coat-tails to prominence, and is said to be plotting to make a bid for power of his own through a populist angle. But for now at least, a showdown looms between General Long and General Hu."
 YUN.midgame.702.a: "Long Yun represents an orderly transition to isolation."
 YUN.midgame.702.b: "Hu Ruoyu stands for peace and national unity!"

 YUN.midgame.703.t: "The Death of Tang Jiyao"
 YUN.midgame.703.d: "Tang Jiyao died in his home, ending weeks of speculation about his fate. Negotiations were tense between the Long and Hu camps, with the former preferring that he remain imprisoned to prevent him from raising another army outside the province and to project the image of stability to outsiders while the latter sought his exile or execution. Tang's followers, fearing for his declining health and his safety, asked for his safe passage out of the province.\n\nTang's death is officially due to illness, but he is widely believed by his supporters to have been poisoned. Whatever the case may have been, the fragile truce between the conspirators was broken. Hu Ruoyu struck first, surrounding Long Yun's home and disarming his bodyguard. Long was captured alive, albeit with an eye injury, and this may have been the end of it except most of his generals escaped and rallied forces in Zhaotong. A counterattack by General Lu Han, Long Yun's relative, shattered Zhang Ruji's attempt to seize the city. A siege is looming, and Long Yun's forces have the advantage - except Hu Ruoyu has been quick to point out that their leader remains imprisoned in a literal iron cage.\n\nMeanwhile, General Wang Jiexu has betrayed Hu Ruoyu and his Mengzi Clique. He and many Tang Jiyao loyalists have gathered in Dali in an effort to restore Tang Jiyu. The presence of a third force in the province and the prospects of a civil war forces the two sides to the negotiating table."
 YUN.midgame.703.a: "Long Yun's army helps him secure favourable terms for his release."
 YUN.midgame.703.b: "Hu Ruoyu's control of the railroads gives him bargaining power during talks."

 YUN.midgame.704.d: "Long Yun has been released, ending the conflict between the Long camp and the Hu camp for now. But Tang Jiyu remains a serious concern, having been allowed to return from his brief exile for his brother's funeral. With the original 1927 coup explicitly targeting ten of Tang's closest loyalists, including Mayor Zhang Weihan of Kunming, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Finance Xu Zhichen, Manager of the Yunnan Tin Company Wu Kun, and many of Tang's top generals including Tang Jiyu and Chen Weigeng, this one is bound to be little different.\n\nRealising the gravity of the situation, they rallied under Tang's brother Tang Jiyu in Sun Du's fortress of Dali. General Tang, hoping to make a claim for his brother's old position, has sought to move quickly on Kunming in hopes of garnering the support of the gentry and uniting Tang's scattered loyalists across the province. Rumors have spread that they have even gotten the sympathy of General Lu Han, one of Long Yun's leading generals, for their plot - a great betrayal if true.\n\nHowever, the attempt was largely in vain. Many of Tang's forces are ex-bandits like Generals Wang Jiexiu and Wu Xuexian and melted away when facing their opponents. His brother's ex-guard units have mostly tried to defect to either Long Yun or Hu Ruoyu or are simply too isolated to do much. Within a few weeks they have been forced to surrender or go underground.\n\nWhile Long has resolved to absorb Tang's leading officials, the fate of his generals is another matter. Ironically, his position with Hu Ruoyu has been reversed, with Hu hoping to retain some of them like Meng Youwen in his desperation to gain an edge over Long and Long ordering the execution or exile of his armed opponents."

 YUN.midgame.705.t: "A Dying Dream of Democracy"
 YUN.midgame.705.d: "The budding democratic movement Tang Jiyao and Zhang Taiyan have cultivated in Yunnan across the late 1920s has suffered severe setbacks with Tang's fall. Tang was an authoritarian man to be sure, but the two men who have replaced him pay even less lip-service to democratic ideals, preferring backroom deals with known quantities in the provincial assembly than pursuing greater representation or reform.\n\nThe civil war after Hu Ruoyu's putsch, however brief, served to further demonstrate the powerlessness of Yunnan's intellectuals as they could do little but watch as the two strongmen traded blows. The elderly Zhang Taiyan has mostly retreated into retirement and Tang's People's Government Party has faded to basically nothing but another name in China's history books. His son Tang Xiaoying, who has been elected as his father's successor as Chairman, has mostly turned his attention to the youthful activism of the Young China Party while serving as a minor functionary for Long Yun.\n\nFor the remaining democrats, their options are limited. Some return to the traditional haughty aloofness intellectuals took during the high warlord era, either leaving the province for more prestigious academic jobs in wealthier provinces or limiting their activism in the province. Long Yun and Lu Han have made limited entreaties to groups like the Crescent Moon Society. Others, still hungry for political change and direct action, turn towards socialism, turning their rural schoolhouses and literature clubs into underground networks for radicalism."

#NPA Narrative Events (730-759):
 YUN.midgame.730.t: "The Long Yun Clique"
 YUN.midgame.730.d: "Born Naji Niaoti, the half Han-half Yi grandson of a Tusi headsman took the Han Chinese name \"Long Yun\" (Dragon Cloud), which resonates with his growing aspirations. A former Tongmenghui revolutionary and commander under Tang Jiyao, Long seized power in the name of stability but he dreams of much more.\n\nLike Tang before him, Long has been eager to staff the government with those he can trust. His brothers in law Jiang Yingshu, Li Peitian and Li Peiyan are part of his inner circle, with the Li brothers in particular dominating provincial finances and bureaucracy. Other relatives like An Enpu and Zhang Banghan have been appointed as Commissioners of Water Control and Provincial Reconstruction, respectively.\n\nLong has been keen to place members of the Yi minority in government to balance out Han influence. The reserved and taciturn Lu Chongren has close connections to the gentry class and represents their voice in the new government. General Zhang Chong is another ethnic Yi with bandit ties who later was given a job in the Yunnan Salt Administration (the salt gabelle has traditionally been a valuable source of revenue requiring armed guards to enforce it).\n\nPerhaps the most notable beneficiary of the new regime is Lu Han, a childhood friend, classmate, and apparent relative of Long who became part of the \"Three Musketeers of Zhaotong\" along with Zou Ruoheng when they were young. An ethnic Yi, he graduated from Yunnan Military Academy and became one of Long's chief military lieutenants. He was rewarded with the chairmanship of Fudian Bank and Director of Finance but he has grown increasingly disquieted by Long's decision to reconcile with defectors from Tang's circle."
 YUN.midgame.730.a: "Long rewards his friends and family to cement his control."
 YUN.midgame.730.b: "Long preserves the old Tang status quo for stability."

 YUN.midgame.731.t: "The Mengzi Clique"
 YUN.midgame.731.d: "Ambitious, cunning, and always scheming - Hu Ruoyu has been called many things but there is no denying his influence within the province. A warlord operating in Southern Yunnan, the so-called \"Mengzi\" Clique keeps watch over the Yunnan-Indochinese trade routes and has received German support from Indochina since the 1930s. While ideologically flexible, Hu's open courting of Wu Peifu has made them susceptible to Zhili influence. For Hu, the latest coup in the province provides a new chance to grow his influence.\n\nThe Mengzi Clique is made up of military men and gentry who are determined to keep their lucrative position. Li Xuanting and Zhang Ruji were former Defence Commissioners under Tang, bitter about being sidelined in the 1920s. Wang Weiyu is a Mengzi businessman who opened a cake and snack stand at the age of 15 before moving into the mining business along with Li Pin. The growth of their mines along with German investors attracted bandit attention, and the two formed a militia with miners and mine owners and began working with the Mengzi Clique to fend off extortion attempts.\n\nDespite their past conflicts, they have also allied with some of the remaining bandit groups in the region. The old bandit heydays of Li Shaozong, Mo Pu, Pu Wenrong, and Tang Songlin - terrifying names in the 1920s under Tang's rule - are in the past now, most have been absorbed into the administration somehow or are functionally mercenaries. Wang Ruwei is the most powerful of them, a graduate of the Yunnan Military Academy and veteran military officer serving since Xinhai who carved out his own fiefdom in Maguan. A powerful but untrustworthy asset, he has been courted by Long Yun, Zhang Ruji, and the KMT alike - blurring the lines between soldier, bandit, and politician."
 YUN.midgame.731.a: "The forces of reaction in Yunnan rally behind Hu Ruoyu."
 YUN.midgame.731.b: "The flow of the tin trade puts Hu in a powerful position."

 YUN.midgame.732.t: "The Situation in Guizhou"
 YUN.midgame.732.d: "Despite the chaotic rout in the Second Yue-Gui War, Long Yun still has aspirations for maintaining Yunnanese influence over neighbouring Guizhou. The neighbouring provinces became even closer when Tang Jiyao intervened in the conflict between Guizhou's Constitutionalists and Self-Government factions. He continued to back the exiled Liu Xianshi for the Governorship until the latter's death in 1927, and his family continued to operate out of Yunnan while plotting their return.\n\nDespite recent reverses, no central government has been capable of extending their influence into the southwest, emboldening Long Yun to try to reassert Yunnan's dominance over Guizhou. Since the Yue-Gui War, Guizhou has been ruled by Liu's family, including his cousin Liu Xianqian and his nephew Liu Gongliang. Their feeble attempts at asserting Guizhou's independence from Kunming has been undermined by outside governments' indifference towards Dian-Qian affairs.\n\nHe has attempted to aid Zhang Ruji and the Mengzi Clique to check Long Yun's dominance, fearing the latter's ability to extend his power out of his base in nearby Zhaotong. Long has responded by sowing discord between the Liu clan and also funneling support towards local elite Yi Rongqian. Neither have much hope of truly escaping Kunming's orbit, but as the two sides circle one another with Yunnanese weapons, the proxy conflict has taken greater regional significance."
 YUN.midgame.732.a: "The more powerful Liu family fends off their new challenger."
 YUN.midgame.732.b: "With Long Yun's help, Yi Rongqian defeats the larger but divided Liu clan."

 YUN.midgame.733.t: "The Elder Statesmen Challenge Long"
 YUN.midgame.733.d: "Tang Jiyao may be gone forever, but remnants of the old regime still remain. Despite his overtures, Long Yun's efforts at consolidating control has drawn resistance from Yunnan's old guard. The Provincial Assembly, those functionally subservient to the Governor, is a powerful symbol of legitimacy and a clique of elders led by Ding Zhoaguan, Wang Jiuling, and You Yunlong have stalled Long's agenda.\n\nDing Zhaoguan is a Japanese educated politician who served in the Sichuan Provincial Financial Department before returning to Yunnan to serve as principal of Yunnan Law and Politics College. A jurist by trade, he was appointed to multiple senior positions in the Department of Justice under Tang and was appointed Director of Civil Affairs by Long, but has since threatened to resign.\n\nWang Jiuling was also educated in Japan and participated in the Xinhai revolution before becoming Tang Jiyao's secretary. Tang later made him director of finance before sending him to negotiate with the Beiyang Government, where he was made Minister of Education under Duan Qirui in 1924, before returning to Yunnan to work in the salt commission and Fudian bank. An honorary president of Donglu University as well, he also holds roles in various social groups such as the Yunnan Provincial Buddhist Association, the Institute of Sinology, and the Southern Yashi Society.\n\nFinally, You Yunlong was the founder of the Yunnan Daily newspaper. He played a key role helping organise the National Protection War and served as acting governor of Yunnan while Tang was away. The former Director of Education as well as an industrialist, he was also the speaker of the Second Yunnan Provincial Congress and was recently elected Chairman of the Senate.\n\nThough mostly seen as antiquated and in prestigious but powerless positions, with Hu Ruoyu constantly searching for opportunities to undermine Long, handling these men quickly is essential for Long's survival."
 YUN.midgame.733.a: "Long outmanoeuvres the elders and consolidates his position."
 YUN.midgame.733.b: "The elders humble Long, weakening his grip."

 YUN.midgame.734.t: "The Role of the Modern Military Man"
 YUN.midgame.734.d: "In traditional Chinese society, being a career military officer was generally looked down upon by respectable families. Of course, the apex of society constituted the scholar-officials who contended themselves with nothing more than the complexities of poetic discourse and bureaucratic administration. Of course from time to time they may have to lead the common rabble into battle, but that was merely a temporary sacrifice they had to make. Soldiers on the other hand, required no education and sophistication; they were merely expected to serve as sacrifices for the protection of their lords and superiors and to guarantee China's protection from barbarians.\n\nBut with the National Protection War, a curious intellectual passion for the military has arisen. The idea of a National Army dedicated to the support of Chinese constitutionalism and the Republic has resonated deeply with many especially in a province like Yunnan; which was the first province to secede and declare a war of protection against Beijing's autocracy. Military service was encouraged and conscription frequently practiced; as a necessary evil in the face of much larger superior military forces. By the time Tang Jiyao had reasserted control over the province however, civilian control was restored over the army and warlords - as military leaders like Tang asserted themselves as benevolent rulers rather than a perpetual sense of martial law.\n\nNow as Yunnan enters yet another turbulent period in its history, the question remains. How long should the military's rule over the people really last? On one hand, the military's leadership was undeniably needed in a time of crisis but crises abate and for now, there is time before the province must be fully mobilised. The military's presence however, provides a strong deterrent towards banditry and criminal behavior - that is surely well appreciated in these trying times."
 YUN.midgame.734.a: "We only use good iron to make nails in times of desperation."
 YUN.midgame.734.b: "The Generals keep us safe in these trying times."

 YUN.midgame.735.t: "Lu Han, the Discontented Kinsman"
 YUN.midgame.735.d: "Lu Han has been at Long Yun's side since they were boys, studying martial arts together in Zhaotong. After graduating from Yunnan Military Academy, the two served together in the Yunnan Army. At one point they were so close to each other, that it was even rumoured that Lu Han was Long Yun's younger half brother. However, as of late, Lu Han has privately expressed his discontent with the direction of Long's regime. A myriad of potential issues illustrate the reason for Lu's break from Long but at its core, it appears that Governor Long's staffing decisions both in the ministry and in the military has apparently favoured many of the former Tang loyalists.\n\nThe crux of this issue is the recent appointment of Zhang Weihan. A politician under the Tang regime, Weihan was the former General Affairs Section of the Provincial Administrative office and the mayor of Kunming. After the coup, Long had merely retained Weihan in his position of power and both Weihan and Lu Han have never been able to agree on anything.\n\nWhile most of Tang's former camp that has been allowed to reside in the province sided with Long Yun, there are those who can be swayed with enough persuasion. Sun Du, is a graduate of the Yunnan Army Academy and served under Tang for a very long while. Appointed as the Director of Yunnan Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau, he remained loyal to Tang until the very end. Known as the Confucian General and \"Little Zhuge\" for his courage, he seeks strong admirable initiative and leadership; which Lu Han offers and of whom could be a potential ally in any move against Long Yun."
 YUN.midgame.735.a: "Long Yun finds ways to mollify his misguided relative."
 YUN.midgame.735.b: "Lu Han begins to undermine Long's clique from within."

 YUN.midgame.736.t: "Loyalty and Competence"
 YUN.midgame.736.d: "Yunnan has been trying to stave off bankruptcy for some time. The treasury has been under strain for years due to expensive military adventures, chronic mismanagement of overambitious projects, an overreliance on opium, and endemic corruption. The coup may have saved Yunnan from being completely subjugated to the other southern provinces but for now, the economy is essentially dysfunctional.\n\nCharged with preventing total financial ruin is Miao Yuntai (also known as Miao Jianming), who is one of the few American-educated provincial businessmen. A successful tin industry executive, he was appointed by Long to co-manage Fudian bank and also oversee economic reconstruction in the province. His ambitious plans include shifting from a predominantly opium-based economy (the prices of which have collapsed due to virtually all warlords having the same idea, oversaturating the market) in favor of a tin-based economy and industrialisation.\n\nMiao has proven his worth time and time again, a true financial genius. But though Long values his services, unfortunately Miao and other successful technocrats' efforts have been hampered by many of Long's other appointments. Tang Hongtao, one of Long's former secretaries, in particular has attracted scandal due to his mismanagement of the Yunnan Tin Company. Despite his engineering background, he has proven horribly incompetent, neglectful and possibly outright lazy.\n\nThe clash between Long's patronage appointees, which are vital for bringing the economy under his control, and Long's technocratic appointees which are vital for bringing the economy under control is expected to continue to play out as investors weigh their options."
 YUN.midgame.736.a: "We must put our trust in Miao Yuntai and other experts!"
 YUN.midgame.736.b: "Trust comes first, results will follow eventually."

 YUN.midgame.737.t: "Reflections on 1915"
 YUN.midgame.737.d: "What was the National Protection War? Socialists like Guo Murou argue that it was a militarist conflict between the warlords, although even they disagree among themselves over the role of the masses and the Progressive Party and the Kuomintang. Other historians argue that Sun's revolutionary Kuomintang played a major role and that the masses themselves sought liberation during the war. In Yunnan, Tang Jiyao supported Liang Qichao and his Progressives during the war, but resisted Sun's demands for a revolution.\n\nIndeed the National Protection War reflected but also failed to resolve the on-going nationalist question in China. Among the Yunnanese gentry and traders by the Mengzi mining areas - nationalism meant becoming an equal partner to the foreigners and resolving trade imbalances. The so-called \"reformist nationalist\" programme sought to create a local industrialised state with the help of the foreigners and not without them. Indeed Germany's investments in Yunnan led to the development of new factories and mills with their help. On the other hand, the revolutionary side of the province (especially private merchants and traders who were hurt by foreign trade domination significantly) wanted China to be rid of foreigners and imperialists once and for all. These nationalists see foreign influence as pervasive and domineering and that if China is to be free, she must be free of the imperialists for good.\n\nAnd finally, for some the National Protection War was ultimately a war to preserve the constitution and the developing seed of Chinese democracy. After the war Tang Jiyao tried to install democratic reforms in the province but the results of these reforms have yet to be realised. Disillusioned by the collapse of cooperation between the North and South, Tang's manifesto following the end of the war sought to lay the foundations of a future democracy - to limited success. When re-evaluating the war, perhaps it was the first step towards building a democratic China."
 YUN.midgame.737.a: "The National Protection War was a fight for national liberation!"
 YUN.midgame.737.b: "The National Protection Junta protected Yunnan's autonomy!"
 YUN.midgame.737.c: "The National Protection Era was the building block of democracy."

 YUN.midgame.738.t: "Socialist Hopes Dim in Yunnan"
 YUN.midgame.738.d: "In Yunnan, 75% of the peasants own most or all their land but they usually own less than 5 mu which rendered their ownership virtually useless in face of taxes and levies. Driven by the spirit of progress, democratic reformers like Cun Shusheng and Su Honggang have been active in the countryside providing rural education (with varying degrees of support from the provincial government) and seeking to improve the plight of the peasants.\n\nBut the limitations of these reforms have driven many others to a desperate radicalism. However, unlike in MinGan where the socialists were able to garner support from the peasantry and the bandits, their Yunnanese counterparts have failed to achieve meaningful class cooperation. As their movement began to fail, they sought shaky alliances with local magistrates.\n\nProvincial agitator Wang Desan and his New Yunnan Society tried to trigger an uprising in Liuliang country amid conflicts between the gentry and Kunming magistrates. Vowing to penetrate the \"social relationships which underlie appearances\" between the tenant farmers, rich peasants, the gentry, and the minority tribes, Wang sought the support of local magistrates seeking to check gentry militias, disaffected army officers and bandits (who are often populist if non-ideological), the various rural schools and teachers (Liuliang County has a disproportionately high number of students), and tribesmen discontent from recent attempts at disarming them.\n\nBut though the magistrates and gentry resent one another, they fear the socialists more - setting aside their differences to put down the rebellion. As Red hopes dim, Long Yun has instructed magistrates to go out and work with men like Cun to promote peaceful relations with the peasants while still dealing harshly with rebel ringleaders. But the violent uprisings have given Hu an opening to court the fearful gentry, many of whom blame Long for allowing leftist infiltrators into their villages in the first place."
 YUN.midgame.738.a: "Peasant uprisings convince the gentry that only Hu Ruoyu can protect them."
 YUN.midgame.738.b: "Long's magistrates and teachers help bring the countryside to heel."

 YUN.midgame.739.t: "Yunnan and the Central Government"
 YUN.midgame.739.d: "Protected by the mountains in China's distant southwest and home to a melting pot of cultures, Yunnan's isolation has created a complicated history with central authority. After the bloody 1800s rebellion, secessionism was crushed. But the locals feared European imperialism, and resented the central government's inability to police their borders - often taking matters into their own hands.\n\nDespite often being rebels themselves, Yunnanese leaders often spoke of the need for a strong central government. Virtually all of Cai E's stances revolved around that principle, insisting Beijing remain the capital to help maintain China's influence in Manchuria and Mongolia. He also stated that China was unsuited for federalism - instead proposing provinces be abolished as a governing unit. Yunnan itself could be ruled by four circuits with senior officials appointed directly from Beijing.\n\nCai resented the Tongmenghui legislature's obstinance towards President Yuan and believed corruption could be avoided if Presidents could remain impartial in their appointments rather than rely on partisan politics. Valuing national unity and strength over ideology, he prophetically warned that the parties would seek to each build an army around themselves and local despots would carve their own domains in the provinces. He stipulated that soldiers should not be part of any party, lest the army \"be distracted and disturbed by external matters, [and] the task of leading armies will bit by bit fall to civilian weaklings\" and unqualified secret society members.\n\nHis successor Tang Jiyao also supported a strong national government but embraced Federalism to resolve the contradictions Cai's National Protection War brought. He divided Yunnan into four defence commissions, but also moved towards civilian control over the military in his later rule. By Long's rule, a sense of regionalism has returned and though they still seek national unity, they insist on even terms and self-governance."
 YUN.midgame.739.a: "China needs a strong government, but it must be a responsible one too."
 YUN.midgame.739.b: "We must carefully safeguard our own interests until one arises."

#NPA Party Popularity Ladder Events (760-789):
 YUN.midgame.760.t: "Su Honggang, Educator of the Masses"
 YUN.midgame.760.d: "While Yunnan has traditionally hosted a number of liberal elements following the Shanghai Uprising of 1932 and the subsequent brutal crackdown by Zhili forces, the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League in Yunnan certainly brings its own weight to the table of anti-Beijing intellectuals. Su Honggang, one of the Provincial CDL's leading voices, was born in 1878 into a middling family in the village outskirts of Kunming.\n\nAlthough his family was not particularly wealthy, Su's father often aided poorer members of the village, a noble act that inspired Su Honggang as a child. After growing up, Su embarked on an educational career, staying in his home village to teach after his father's passing. Su became enthralled by the revolutionary politics of the Tongmenghui in 1903, and committed himself to utilising education to save the nation after the Republicans ousted the decrepit Qing monarchy. In the 20s, Su worked on establishing a private school that would eventually become one of the most famous middle schools in Yunnan.\n\nAfter the League crackdown in 1932, Su Honggang welcomed the fleeing intellectuals and together collaborated to establish the Southwest Associated University, which became a hotbed for progressive politics. Although not always particularly fond of newer idealistic progressive elements, the [ROOT.GetLeader] administration has seen fit to maintain a friendly relationship with Su and his colleagues at the Southwest University."
 YUN.midgame.760.a: "Su Honggang and the CDL are a credit to the people, indeed."
 YUN.midgame.760.b: "A bold dreamer with the administration's ear."

 YUN.midgame.761.t: "The Duel for Youth Support"
 YUN.midgame.761.d: "It is often said that the intellectual class has preferred to stay in their ivory towers of learning and distrust the intellectual ability of the masses, but that certainly does not extend to the Chinese youth in academia. Viewed as a critical battleground in the war of ideas, various intellectual political groups are often found preaching to various student bodies in the hopes of attracting young minds to their political organisations. The China Democratic League's Yunnan branch is no different from the rest in this regard, and has launched an extensive educational campaign to draw supporters in various Universities with members serving as faculty.\n\nAt the centre of it all is of course Southwestern Associated University, which serves not only as the centre of the China Democratic League's Provincial Branch, but also the Crescent Moon Society. Recruiting from the student masses has become all the more important, as in the Northern plains, it is the nationalistic and militant Young China Party which has dominated student recruitment, becoming a mass party rivalling the Kuomintang through its impressive recruitment drive. Although differing substantially in political outlook, the progressive intellectual camps of the south have taken note of their approach to politics, and attempt to become mass intellectual movements themselves."
 YUN.midgame.761.a: "The CDL shall be the forefront of a Free China!"
 YUN.midgame.761.b: "Allies in the fight for a Free China."

 YUN.midgame.764.t: "Miao Yuntai, the Miracle Man"
 YUN.midgame.764.d: "Perhaps suffering greater than any province, Yunnan has gone through immense hardship throughout the Century of Humiliation. Perhaps these were the conditions which led to the rise of the Yunnan Chamber of Commerce headed by Miao Jiaming. Although Viceroy Li Jingxi's reforms were blocked by gentry forces, under the [ROOT.GetLeader] administration, the YCC seems to have spearheaded reform elements in Yunnan Province. Miao Jiaming was born into a prominent Yunnan gentry family in the 90s, and learned engineering in the United States. After a brief career in America, he returned home in October 1919.\n\nGovernor Tang Jiyao quickly took notice of the young engineer, and appointed him head of the Gejiu Tin Company. When he had taken over the company, it was suffering from financial losses, but Miao was able to pull Gejiu Tin out of its financial hole and modernised it with Western Technologies, restoring its status as a respected corporation. By 1924, Miao rose to head of the Fudian Bank, which was in practice the central bank of Yunnan. Tang Jiyao's severe borrowing from the bank led to high inflation, the dissolution of the Fudian Bank, and the collapse of the currency altogether.\n\nIn 1932, Miao Yuntai as President of the New Fudian Bank was able to use a system involving reserve half-krai dollars and New Yunnan Notes to remove the old Fudian Bank Notes from circulation and restore the financial state of Yunnan Province. After repairing Tang's finances, Miao was made the general manager of the Yunnan Tin Refining Company itself, and broke Yunnan's traditional economic reliance on Opium in favour of tin mining, and substantially curtailed German economic influence through the Kunming-Haiphong Rail. Today, Miao Jiaming retains significant control over Yunnan's economic organs as head of the Yunnan Chamber of Commerce, and the Yunnanese people are all thankful for his work."
 YUN.midgame.764.a: "His shrewd management has filled our coffers."
 YUN.midgame.764.b: "His capable hands have reinforced our regime."

 YUN.midgame.765.t: "The Chamber's Coffers"
 YUN.midgame.765.d: "Beyond Miao Yuntai's impressive resume, the Yunnan Chamber of Commerce has played an integral role in the development of Yunnan's economic modernisation and reform movement. Before Miao Jiaming's time, it was Chen Jun who managed Yunnan's fragile economy. After studying politics in Japan, Chen took on the role of assistant manager of the Fudian Bank in 1912, a year after Li Jingxi's deposition in Kunming and the establishment of Republican rule. Cai E noticed his administrative talents and brought him on as director of internal affairs in Yunnan.\n\nFrom there, Tang Jiyao placed him in charge of developing the Gebishi Railway, which became China's first private railway. By the 20s, Chen had taken over Gejiu Mining Company and moved to Mengzi to oversee operations, and passed away in 1931. Yunnan's tin development was further aided by Wu Kun, who had come to head the Yunnan Mining Company under Tang's administration. The Yunnan Chamber of Commerce, having consolidated its control over the tin mining industry of Yunnan, has placed great emphasis on seeing Yunnan's economy transition away from its traditional opium poppy cultivation to exporting natural resources.\n\nTo that end, the Chamber has generally taken a supporting role in Tang's agenda, helping his attempt in separating civilian and military organisations. While students were typically leading protests against Japanese influence in China across the nation, in Yunnan it was the Chamber of Commerce who initiated such events, with students joining in after. Although uninterested in ruling themselves, the Chamber of Commerce continues to exert its influence on Yunnan's politics, urging the province to commit towards conservative gentry-led democratisation and anti-imperialism."

#NPA External Influence Events (790-819):
 YUN.midgame.790.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Aid and Praise"
 YUN.midgame.790.d: "Yunnan is among the poorest provinces in the Southwest, alongside the neighbouring province of Guizhou. Located furthest away from the capital and filled predominantly with mountains and hills, it is no surprise that Yunnan is largely neglected by central authorities when it comes to governance and economic development.\n\nWhile this is good for allowing Yunnan to remain political autonomous from the whims of Beijing, the underdevelopment on part of the Central Government has left Kunming to do most of the modernising work, especially so after the Xinhai Revolution and the Constitutional Protection War.\n\nRecently, however, [FROM.GetNameDef] has sought to do away with this economic injustice and offered to send financial aid to Yunnan, to further develop the local economy and bring the province up the par in comparison to the Eastern provinces. Alongside this offer, [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has also sent praises to General Long Yun and, surprisingly, General Hu Ruoyu in Mengzi.\n\nWhile most welcome this act of generosity by the [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership, General Long views it with suspicion. This aid might be a good thing, but it seems way too good of an offer from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to be real, even more so for it to come without strings attached."
 YUN.midgame.790.a: "How kind of them."
 YUN.midgame.790.b: "Thanks, but no thanks."

 YUN.midgame.791.t: "Reports of Bribery by [FROM.GetAdjective] Agents"
 YUN.midgame.791.d: "Recruitment methods in China is different compared to other countries that have professional armies, owing the army's fractious nature, with many local warlords forming their own personal army. From street recruitment, forced conscription, and even recruitment through familial connections, local armies are often fueled by the lack of alternative employment and plagued with corruption.\n\nDesertion is a common occurrence among soldiers, whether it be out of self-preservation, disgruntlement due to personal issues, or bribery, making local provincial armies prone to disintegrate when cracks start to show. Thus, the high alert in Kunming as a reaction to reports of bribery within the army offered by [FROM.Adjective] agents is natural.\n\nPossibly part of a wider conspiracy to expand their influence within Yunnan and have Hu Ruoyu as their preferred candidate for Governor of Yunnan, this would spell disaster for General Long Yun should internal conflicts ever emerge between Kunming and Mengzi.\n\nTo counter this rot within the army, a comprehensive purge of the army has been suggested to remove elements that have been compromised. Although it might affect the fighting capabilities of the Yunnan Army in the short term, loyalty is the most important trait among others considering the chaos China has had to endure for the past decades."
 YUN.midgame.791.a: "Signs of defection being to flood the Yunnan Army."

 YUN.midgame.792.d: "There are many ways to achieve political goals, either through warfare or diplomacy. When diplomacy is not achievable, many reluctantly seek war to accomplish their aims. But with the high cost it entails, some resort to military threats as a resumption of diplomacy through different means. For [FROM.GetNameDef], this seems to be the case as a telegraph has been issued to Kunming from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], warning the use of military means should their demands not be fulfilled.\n\nAmong other things, they demand that we bring in several individuals within our administration. Unsurprisingly, many of these individuals listed seem to be loyalists and followers aligned to Hu Ruoyu. While this could be a case of coincidence, it is clear that [FROM.GetNameDef] prefers him as Governor of Yunnan instead of General Long Yun.\n\nDespite the military threat, many in Yunnan are confident that a foreign invasion by [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] would be repelled easily, as the province's mountainous terrain provides a clear defensive advantage. Even so, the public seem to be disillusioned with war in general with Yunnan's defeat in the Second Dian-Gui War still fresh in the minds of many.\n\nFor General Long, the internal struggle between him and Mengzi rages on. Though nothing has happened as of yet, it is clear that Yunnan's autonomy as well as his own personal power would be at stake should he kowtow to [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s demands. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the maintenance of peace is far more diserable than a possible prolonged war."

 YUN.midgame.793.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Deals with Mengzi"
 YUN.midgame.793.d: "The Second Dian-Gui War had been a disaster, not just for Governor Tang Jiyao's ambitions of expansionism, but for Yunnan's internal stability. As Governor Tang fell from grace, General Long Yun and General Hu Ruoyu became the new centers of power within Yunnan, with General Long holding out in the provincial capital of Kunming, and General Hu remaining in his power base of Mengzi, plotting with his allies.\n\nDespite not becoming the new hegemon of Yunnan, General Hu still holds on to the lucrative southern mines of Mengzi, exporting the minerals to Indochinese ports and earning a massive wealth from this endeavour. As such, Yunnan's economy is massively beholden to the influence of the Mengzi Clique and their patrons, among those being the Zhili Clique.\n\nIt has come to light that [FROM.GetNameDef] has been making deals directly with Mengzi instead of Kunming, subsidising the continued exploitation of the mines without a single coin seeing its way back to us. Aside from the flagrant violation of Yunnan's autonomy, this deal only serves to further increase General Hu Ruoyu's influence within the province.\n\nTo save face and rebuke obvious [FROM.GetAdjective] interference, there is nothing much we can do beyond sending a basic telegraph expressing our frustration to [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], though some have suggested that looking the other way may be the better course of action to save ourselves from further political embarrassment."

 YUN.midgame.794.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Peace Feelers"
 YUN.midgame.794.d: "The national unification has been the goal of many ever since China fractured with the death of Yuan Shikai. Whether through negotiations or forceful means, all efforts failing to achieve such due to a multitude of reasons. With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces when Marshal Sun Chuanfang was shot and Qi Xieyuan took over as League-Marshal, the illusion of Chinese unity under Zhili domination was shattered.\n\nWithin South China, Yunnan was the only province in South China not to be devastated by warfare and internal bickering, honing its strength to capture the province of Guizhou from one of the last Kuomintang strongholds still left. However, Governor Tang Jiyao almost undid a decade's worth of patience by invading the twin provinces of Liangguang, eyeing the city of Guangzhou for himself. For the salvation of Yunnan, Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu detained Governor Tang and steered the province towards isolationism.\n\nTaking advantage of the new diplomatic turn by Yunnan, [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has sent peace feelers to Kunming to discuss the posibility of reunification between North and South. Though national unification is rather popular within the province, many are skeptical whether this is sincere or just a ruse to entrench [FROM.GetAdjective] influence within Yunnan.\n\nFor General Long Yun, the Yunnan Clique can ill afford foreign entanglement lest it jeopardises Yunnan's autonomy and drag the province into wars it has no business in. At the same time, refusing a simple peace offer that seeks to further the cause of national unification risks making the Kunming Administration unpopular among the people."

 YUN.midgame.796.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Pressures Us to Swear Loyalty"
 YUN.midgame.796.d: "For most of Yunnan's recent history, the province has rarely been invaded by outside forces, instead invading its neighbouring provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and even Sichuan, as part of Governor Tang Jiyao's Export Militarism, seeking to expand Yunnan's influence in the Southwest. Inevitably, this reckless expansionism had come to a head when Yunnan failed to invade Liangguang in the Second Dian-Gui War, causing the Yunnan Clique to retreat back into isolationism as Governor Tang was overthrown by General Long Yun and General Hu Ruoyu.\n\nNow, in a twist of irony, Yunnan is now faced with an ultimatum to submit to an outside power, seeking the subjugation of the province and diminish its cherished autonomy. Perhaps confident in their ability to subdue the Southwest, [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has demanded General Long to swear an oath of allegiance to [FROM.GetNameDef] or risk its wrath.\n\nFor General Long, he had wished to preserve Yunnan's autonomy through non-alignment and have the province focus inwards rather than expand its influence. However, with war on the horizon, risking his men in another bloody war which may see the destruction of the Yunnan Clique is not appealing whatsoever."

 YUN.midgame.797.t: "Yunnan Stands Defiant!"
 YUN.midgame.797.d: "Yunnan was the first province to defy Yuan Shikai's restoration of the monarchical system back in the National Protection War, when Governor Cai E escaped from Beijing and returned to Yunnan to lead the province against the world. Through sheer miracle, Yunnan was victorious when other provinces rose up against Beijing, solidifying its reputation as a \"democratic fortress\" against Beiyang tyranny.\n\nSince then, Yunnan had embraced a mixture of expansionist militarism and isolationism under successive governors, with General Long Yun as its current hegemon. Above all else, the province values its autonomy from the Central Government. Despite our efforts to absorb the Southwest into our sphere, Kunming has remained defiant.\n\nWith the Yungui Plateau acting as a natural defence against foreign invasion, it might be wise to let the Kunming Administration be, considering the military advantage the Yunnan Army possesses within their own terf. At the same time, we might not have another opportunity to bring the rogue province back in line should we leave Kunming to their own devices."

##Military Events
 YUN.lategame.000.t: "Confucian Military Heroes"
 YUN.lategame.000.d: "A nation long marred by eras of conflict followed by eras of peace, common Chinese thinking is that civil and military functions (wen and wu) were evidently meant to be complementary — unequal but not opposing. In the millennia of history that amounts in Chinese dynasties, peace and unity has been repeatedly interrupted by violent periods of disorder and division. In those latter periods, a premium would be placed upon military expertise. Therefore, for the young Tang Jiyao to have extolled the role of the military leader or hero was merely a modification, not a rejection of the prevailing traditional Confucian attitudes of society. Having written about such a mindset at the Shikan Gakko during his time as a student, Tang began:\n\n\"It is the sage who appears when the world follows the Way and retires when it does not. It is the hero who retires when the world follows the Way and appears when it does not.\". With the 19th and 20th centuries having been periods of great turmoil and crisis, it is most certainly a time for heroes; there is no doubt that the Chinese world is not \"following the Way\". Continuing in Tang's youthful writings: \"Today the reinvigoration of domestic affairs is China's important task, but ordinary men are incapable of it. Therefore getting a scholar who is skilled and energetic is not as good as getting a hero who is a bold strategist.\".\n\nWith his aforementioned writings having recently surfaced to the public, it has become evidently clear to the Chinese cultural zeitgeist that Tang Jiyao himself fancies himself to be the \"hero\" necessary to revitalise the Chinese nation. Seizing the initiative with the spotlight on his recent writings, Tang and his high command have utilised this sentiment to mobilise the people to serve in the New Huguojun, stipulating that militarism is not a product of rootless men blown adrift from tradition, but merely that the long-held cultural traditions require men to take on the mantle of a hero, as Tang has. However critics have arisen of Tang's stance, insinuating that men like Tang are the reason for China's descent into darkness, and for the warlord era as a whole."
 YUN.lategame.000.a: "Only the military can see China's salvation!"
 YUN.lategame.000.b: "Militarism is the exact cause for our predicament now!"

 YUN.lategame.001.t: "Chinese Warrior Spirit"
 YUN.lategame.001.d: "Largely considered the progenitor of the modern state of Yunnan, and of the current generation of its leadership, Cai E has undoubtedly left a concrete impression upon the province and nation. Being the \"Father of the Huguojun\", Cai E's writings have received a new section of prominence in philosophical discussions. Most intriguing of which being the writings from his youth. Collaborating with his best friend, Cai and Jiang Baili had both drafted two articles for Liang Qichao's journal, \"Xinmin Congbao\", \"A Militaristic State-People\" and \"The Education of a Militaristic State-People\" respectively. Considered the first introduction of military nationalism, an export from Japan and Germany, into the Chinese political sphere, both articles elaborate and advocate on the implementation of universal military training for China's citizens.\n\nIn Cai E's article in particular, he laments China's modern \"effeminate spirit\", and the dire need for China to develop its own martial spirit. Tracing the lack of a militarist spirit back to Chinese education, Cai further places the blame on Chinese philosophy, literature, customs and music. That unlike their neighbour Japan, China's youth has their energies wasted on \"useless formalities and ornamental phrases\" whilst the Japanese were indoctrinated in loyalty, patriotism, and martial qualities. Docile, and ill of a warrior's temperament, it is no surprise that China has constantly kowtowed for foreign imperialist powers.\n\nIn Cai E's world where only the strong survive, he feared that China would very much be smothered by foreign powers if it could not muster enough strength itself, both mentally and physically, forging a new national spirit that can adapt to the world's trends. Whilst Cai E's writings on Social Darwinism are the backbone of the new military establishment of [ROOT.GetLeader] alongside the very nature of Kunming itself, there has arisen a strong sense of concern from the civilians within the nation. Drawing fears that even further glorification of military men is bound to lead to a directionless stratocracy."
 YUN.lategame.001.a: "Our own Bushido!"
 YUN.lategame.001.b: "It would be wise to be hesitant, of the military man unbowed."

 YUN.lategame.002.t: "Our Shared Nation-State"
 YUN.lategame.002.d: "In the legacy of the Huguojun, nothing is more important than its critical founding moment in which the brave soldiers of Cai E, Tang Jiyao and Li Liejun's armies stood defiant against the monarchical ambitions of the despot Yuan Shikai. His conviction that the military is responsible for the nation's well-being has been continuously reiterated throughout the existence of the Yunnan Clique, yet nonetheless a sparkling moment is that of one of Cai's addresses to his soldiers on the eve of the NPA war. Advocating that the elected president of the Chinese Republic was expected to create a \"shared nation-state\", in which everybody would assume their respective responsibility of the nation-state — thus ensuring its survival — and therefore he condemned Yuan for having done the exact opposite: immediately after his election Yuan supposedly had begun to undermine the political institutions of the Republic and to abuse his powers to his own personal advantage, thus eroding national unity.\n\nWorse still, Yuan had pretended to heed the will of the people when proclaiming his Hongxian Monarchy. For these reasons, Cai stressed \"this army cannot bear the thought that our nation-state is on the brink of destruction. I am therefore calling on the military circles in other provinces, as well as the people of high ideals, to join forces with our troops to get rid of Yuan and to jointly preserve our republic.\" The same ideals would later be reiterated by Tang Jiyao, adding that the abandonment of Republicanism was tantamount to renouncing the forces of evolution.\n\nSupported by our nation's most ardent militaristic men, there has been muted opposition from civilian circles, insinuating that it is not up to China's military to determine the needs of the nation, and that if Yuan Shikai had not been elected, had not risen to such prominence, and a civilian had taken charge, it very well could've saved China from the disastrous Warlord Era."
 YUN.lategame.002.a: "Our Army is our saviour!"
 YUN.lategame.002.b: "Is the current military not incurring the same infractions?"

 YUN.lategame.003.t: "Role of the Military Man in the Nation-State"
 YUN.lategame.003.d: "Cai E's brave concepts of the Chinese Militaristic Nation-State were not merely posited by just himself and his followers, isolated to the armed forces, for shortly after the outbreak of the War of National Protection, the so-called \"National Protection Lecture Society\" was established in Yunnan, and a series of lectures were given in Kunming to gain public support for the valiant soldiers and their anti-monarchical cause. In one of these lectures, it was reiterated that it had been the \"duty\" of the National Protection Army (Huguojun) to declare war on Yuan. Had Yuan been allowed to proceed unchallenged with his monarchical plans, the Chinese people would once again have had to suffer as mere imperial subjects without political agency, their blood being spilt for the sole benefit of a single person.\n\nIn another lecture, the legal considerations that underlay Cai E, Tang Jiyao and Li Liejun's decision to go to war were explained in an easy vernacular: \"The people are the constitutive body of the Republican nation-state, the president is, according to law, elected by the people to head the government. However, at present Yuan Shikai uses his presidential office for his selfish benefit; he wields the presidential powers to smash the Republic and to presumptuously declare himself emperor.\" Since the people were not yet fully aware of their own responsibility to curb Yuan's machinations, Tang, Cai and Li all had to step in to save the nation.\n\nFinally, another street lecture was given by the society, concerned with the following question: \"So, what is the most glorious duty of the Republican state-people?\". The answer, lying evidently and clear with the prominent status the military man had already acquired in Chinese Nationalist and Statist thinking, was convincingly obvious: \"To serve as a soldier, of course!\"."
 YUN.lategame.003.a: "The Prominence of such Military Men is to be welcomed!"
 YUN.lategame.003.b: "Our institutions are suffering under your tenure!"

 YUN.lategame.004.t: "Pride of Yunnan"
 YUN.lategame.004.d: "A tradition long held by the Yunnan Army is the constant primacy and reminder of its heroic history. Even in the days of the early 1930s, where the army was but a shell of its former self, they continued to parade, grant speeches, and exalt the role of the Yunnan Army in national politics and provincial culture. Reiterating such sentiments, [ROOT.GetLeader] has held a series of grand celebrations in Kunming, holding a speech addressed to large swathes of the soldiers and officers, flanked by their superiors, in a bid to greatly inspire their efforts.\n\n\"Today's celebrations mark the continuous history in which your Yunnan Army has relentlessly risen up to defend China's institutions. On the 24th of December, 1917, on that day the Yunnan Army rose up first to recreate the republic, on that day your predecessors took to arms and with a mighty and unprecedented effort overthrew the Hongxian pseudo dynasty and cut short Yuan Shikai's imperial system. Before this day comes the Wuhan Anniversary, and the anniversary of the Two Kwang Self-Rule; but had it never occurred there would be no way of preserving the Wuhan anniversary, and the Two Kwang Self-Rule could not have happened. Today, our fellow countrymen at home and abroad without exception consider this enormous and brilliant achievement, turning around heaven and earth, as the work of the Yunnan Army. How it left its province to exterminate bandits, for several thousand li, fighting dozens of battles large and small, it is an achievement such as those engraved on the ancient bronze bells and tripods.\"\n\nReceived to resounding applause and acclamation, the resurrection of such army anniversary celebrations is an element unique to the new Huguojun, for very little armies in the whole of the Chinese nation can boast such a storied and remarkable history. Stepping down from the podium, [ROOT.GetLeader] would later that day pay homage to the revolutionary martyrs' memorial in Yunnan, highly publicising such an event."
 YUN.lategame.004.a: "Never forget the heroes of the Huguojun!"
 YUN.lategame.004.b: "They would be ashamed of us, even now."

 YUN.lategame.005.t: "Five Tiger Generals"
 YUN.lategame.005.intro: "With the military reforms of the new Huguojun now reaching completion, the successes of Cai E's own Huguojun live on in deep spirit amongst all of our commanders and soldiers alike. A long and arduous road with many pitfalls, the army has now finally once again attained its position as the Champions of the Nation. The Officers, instilled with duty and virtue, are fully conscious of their role to play in the Chinese Militaristic Nation-State. Amongst these officers however, there remains a select few who rise far above the mere average general selection of leadership. Just like the exceptional men of the Yunnan Army from history, Tang Jiyao, Cai E, Luo Peijin, Li Genyuan and Gu Pinzhen, the exceptional men of today have taken on the challenge of leading the nation towards salvation.\n\nThis new brand of men are referred to as the \"Five Tiger Generals\", scribing an appellation referring to the top five commanders serving under a lord, originating from the Three Kingdoms period.

Well known already for his military talent and excellence, the Great Commandant has long been regarded as Yunnan's Sword of Damocles ever since his first attempted coup against Tang in the late 1920s.\nFollowing closely behind is that of the \"Loyal\" General Lu Daoyuan. An excellent officer, and a youthfully daring one at that, Lu has served with distinction as of recent, and is known for his apolitical nature in the quagmire of Dian politics.\nThirdly there is the \"Lucky\" General, Lu Han.

 YUN.lategame.006.d: "With the outbreak of conflict between China and foreign imperialist powers drawing increasingly near, Yunnan has received a new spotlight. Due to its relatively isolated interior position within the nation, it has drawn increasing strategic importance in the minds of the Chinese high command. To this end, the [YUN.GetRulingParty] and [ROOT.GetLeader] have endeavoured to move all important air assets from Baoding and Hangzhou to Kunming Wujiaba Airport, with the concept that Wujiaba will transform itself into the location of the Central Government's Aviation Headquarters. China Airlines and Central Airlines will also be forced into moving their operational base to Kunming, with Wujiaba becoming one of the \"two aviation\" centers of the nation.\n\nBecoming a gathering place for both the National Air Force and Civil Aviation, and to meet the demands of war, the Provincial Authorities of Yunnan have been ordered to expand Wujiaba airport. The Yunnan Provincial Construction Department, Aviation Department, General Staff Department, Military Supplies Department and Kunming County Government have all sent personnel to jointly prepare for the expansion and renovation of Wujiaba Airport, forming the Wujiaba Airport Expansion and Renovation Engineering Committee.\n\nPractically transitioning to China's only international import and export airport, the project is aimed to increase the two original parallel runways to two thousand two hundred metres, one of which is to be converted into an asphalt pavement, and to build a brick-and-wood waiting room and corresponding material warehouses.

 YUN.lategame.007.d: "In the ever modernisation and advancement of Yunnan's martial spirit into the very consciousness of the Chinese people, there have been constant parallels drawn between the likes of a Yunnanese soldier, and the likes of an Imperial Japanese one. Yet it is nonetheless superficial, for the citizenry of Japan exalt and extol their warriors as the new samurai, as soldiers fighting for the glory of the nation and emperor. Whilst on the contrary within China, even now intellectuals and peasants alike continue to treat the common soldier with a certain level of estrangement and distrust, fearful of their true intentions.\n\nHaving observed the common Chinese citizen's perception of a soldier, Cai E once wrote about the Japanese's own impression of their warriors: \"They respect their soldiers and are courteous to them, when a man enters the army members of his clan or neighbourhood collect money to give to him, pennants to congratulate him, and offer lavish feasts to entertain him, when younger sons enter service, the parents consider it glorious. Whenever he visits, he only pays half price, when soldiers move into the countryside, the villagers treat them as guests with exceptional kindness. If a soldier flees in battle, or does something else which blemishes the good name of his unit, the parents, brothers and fellow clansmen all feel deep shame and disgrace.\"\n\nIf the Chinese soldier is truly to stand up against his Japanese counterparts, the Yunnan Army still has a long way to go revolutionise and transform the cultural mindset behind the military profession.

 YUN.lategame.040.intro: "Emerging as an issue in Sino-British relations after the British Annexation of Upper Burma in 1886, the frontier between Yunnan Province and the territorial expanse of Burma has long been a point of contention for Yunnan authorities. British, and later Burmese concepts of the frontier and border lie within the information provided by officials of the old Burmese Kingdom, identifying states that had previously only paid nominal tribute to Burmese kings as rightful Burmese territory. In effect, the British authorities claimed all territories that had once belonged to the Burmese dynasties. Including but not limited to: the headwaters of the Irrawaddy River, the upper valleys of the Salween, Mekong and Yangtze rivers, however these regions were home to distinct yet sparsely populated indigenous communities of Shans, Kachins, Chins and Lashis. Pre-colonial Burmese influence did not likely even reach these areas.\n\nRepeated negotiations between the Qing and British failed to resolve the complete extent of the border, although by 1910 two distinct regions were unsettled. One in the north, and one in the south. Remaining unresolved due to the fundamentally different conceptions regarding the national boundary, with the dominance of the frontier by local subservient Tusi regimes, who were fluid and ambiguous in territorial extent. With the British seizure of Pianma in 1910, Cai E maintained a conciliatory policy towards the British, yet maintained in his heart's desire the goal of liberating Chinese land from British, and now Burmese, control.\n\nEven more pressing, was the location of a series of valuable silver mines within the southern region of dispute, Lufang, which were of particular note of the Yunnanese Provincial Government. Serving as a rallying point decrying foreign imperialism for two decades, the time to strike and retake lost territory had arrived at the zenith of Yunnan's military might. No longer kowtowing to any foreign powers, the Yunnanese launched a series of border raids and skirmishes, aimed at securing control of the small isolated forts manned by Burmese frontier guards.\n\n"

 YUN.lategame.050.t: "Reinstitution of the Joint Responsibility Law"
 YUN.lategame.050.d: "In the old legacy of Whampoa, the most primary force for a revolutionary soldier was that of Nationalist Spirit. For under heavy influence from Nationalist Officers who had studied from Japanese instructors, they witnessed the greatest tenacity from those with the strongest warrior spirit. Alongside, in a pragmatic way, the Nationalist Soldier more likely to enter bayonet combat is a Nationalist Soldier less likely to use valuable resources such as munitions. In Kunming a new culture has taken root, heavily influenced by the merging of Kunming and Whampoa's martial emphasis.\n\nThe constant exhortation of those outstanding cadets that are not merely soldiers, but a raw revolutionary force, those that are willing to sacrifice one's life, to take on great odds and persevere, has led to an elite militarist mindset for the common soldier. And yet, for the higher leadership, for those remnants of the original National Revolutionary Army, they have been perhaps whittled down by their time in exile. Extremists and disciplinarians, such as the likes of Teng Jie and He Yingqin, have rallied for the implementation of the late Generalissimo's \"Law of Joint Responsibility\", or (Lianzuofa), wherein the execution of officers is permitted if they either fled or left their positions in the battlefield without explicit orders to do so.\n\nSuch a radical initiative has naturally caused an upturn in military clique circles, as even marked militarists or students from Whampoa themselves, such as Li Genyuan, Gu Zhutong, or Wei Lihuang, have advocated strongly against such a law. Accusing the Blueshirts and He Yingqin of desiring discipline where there is no more discipline to be had, and that it is natural for a man to choose self-preservation in dire circumstances, that one cannot force self-sacrifice."

 YUN.lategame.051.t: "New Strategies for the New Stage"
 YUN.lategame.051.d: "With the national situation now somewhat stabilised, the reformers carrying on Zhu De's military plan have begun to propagate for the adoption of a more offensive strategy for the National Revolutionary Army, seeing as how the capacity for more aggressive action is available. Following through with their focus on encirclement and annihilation, and with their strength increasing in relation to that of their opponents, they have begun to extol the objective of enhancing their own territorial control through the destruction of large enemy forces as viable obstacles. With new offensives following the previous principles of offensive strategy, the roles of the opposition and of the NRA have actually been reversed. The burden of counter-encirclement now rested on the opposition, and with their lack of popular support and the other advantages with which the NRA possess, it is posited that their failure in such tactics is assured.\n\nWith a basic match-book in play, the reformers have espoused a basic pattern of success. The first phase of this strategic offensive is regarded as the phase of disconnection, wherein success relies upon the skilful coordination by NRA commanders of three types of operations: guerrilla disconnection, mobile disconnection, and positional disconnection.\nGuerilla disconnection involves disruption of opposition communications and coordination through harassment, ambush, or sabotage; the second entails manoeuvring of NRA regulars between separated opposition forces; the third, attacks at weak points in opposition defences.\n\nFollowing this phase would be the second phase of strategic encirclement, wherein the disconnection of enemy units is complete, albeit remaining strategic in nature. Afterwards, the third and final phase would come, that of annihilation. Employing a varied tactical arsenal to annihilate the encircled forces, be it short attacks, single and multi-point attacks, or shock attacks. With little to no opposition to the new successes of the new NRA, the reformer's plans have been put into action."

 YUN.lategame.051.b: "Soldiers of the NRA, forward!"

 YUN.lategame.052.t: "Clash of the Old and New"
 YUN.lategame.052.d: "Perhaps to be expected, numerous older National Revolutionary Army commanders continue to struggle in coming to terms with the new reformist doctrine espoused by Zhu De, Chen Yi and the young reformers in the army. Inspired by their initial successes, and intent on taking the army reforms to its natural conclusion, the reformers have begun to stipulate that in a war, mobile warfare should be primary, with varying stress on guerilla and positional action according to the stage of the conflict they are fighting.\n\nWith specific regard to the advance of any foreign imperialist power into Chinese territory, mainly concerning that of Japan, the reformers have stated that their intrusion would begin the first stage of mobile warfare operations, where the mobility of forces and flexibility of strategy is most important. Following this, the Japanese would have to consolidate their influence within the nation, ceasing to advance. Therefore in this phase it would be prudent to focus on guerilla harassment campaigns, and mobilising mass resistance in the enemy's rear. The third stage begins when the Japanese have been exhausted in their entirety, in which case a full offensive campaign would be launched forcing gradual Japanese retreat under heavy Chinese attack. At this point, mobile warfare is initially priority, with positional strategy slowly overtaking it to assume the chief position.\n\nOpposition to such theories has arisen quite strikingly from Liu Zhi, Wei Lihuang and Gu Zhutong. Hardcore proponents of traditional Whampoa strategy, they have instead fought back with their own concept of traditional NRA doctrine, in which they would rather pursue a policy of local encirclement of enemy forces through spearheads from the onset. With sheer force of will, and the stacking of decisive engagement after engagement, victory is assured with minimal suffering of the Chinese people. As opposed to what they view as waging a war of attrition."

 YUN.lategame.053.t: "Guardians of the People"
 YUN.lategame.053.d: "With our valiant conquests of further and further territory, the National Revolutionary Army has found itself once more outside of the Yungui Plateau, welcomed by some, met with scorn by others. Unfolding within our recently liberated territory however is an unfamiliar and outstanding sight. Entering recently captured counties, soldiers of the NRA have been seen meeting with existing Kuomintang guerilla groups, reviving morale and local administrations. Furthermore, they have been establishing popular organisations, reinforcing local guerilla forces, creating an unarmed \"Self-Defence Corps\" in order to patrol the roads, carry info, and care for the wounded. Even further, the people have been instructed in the Three Principles through plays, speeches, songs, dance and wall newspapers promoted and setup by the NRA.\n\nWhilst yielding exceptional benefits to both the local economic conditions and administrative conditions, a large component of the civilian wing of the party have levied complaints about the conduct of these soldiers towards [ROOT.GetLeader]. Stating that whilst they agree that the soldiers are functioning as an overall moral good, it is overstepping the boundaries of what the nation's army should manage. That they are actively undermining the role of bureaucrats and magistrates in the managing of reconstruction and new territory. Whilst believable, it could also just be a ploy by the pawns of Political Science and the Chen brothers, for their influence is being undermined once again by the army."

 YUN.lategame.054.d: "Continuing with his series of directives aimed at army reforms, Zhu De has requested that [ROOT.GetLeader] himself posit a directive to move forward with the reformation of recruitment methods currently pursued. As drafted by Zhu De, the \"Directive on Enlisting and Educating New Recruits\", he aims to solve the issues facing the Nationalist Revolutionary Army in acquiring fresh, and proper, recruits. As it stands, units were inducting recruits who were too young, or diseased, or had physical disabilities, and therefore were unable to fight. The prior directive would set forth the following standards for new recruits.\n\nThey must be over sixteen but under thirty years of age, in good health, and at least five feet tall. All new recruits in regular battalions are required to be examined by the unit's medical officer, while those recruits operating in guerrilla units are to be examined by their detachment commander or political commissar to ensure that they met the standards set forth in the directive. The education and training of new recruits is to be done collectively. Newcomers would be organised and trained in new recruit battalions or platoons, and only after their education and training had reached a certain level would they be added to front-line military units.\n\nWhilst quite amicable in terms and conditions, receiving overall support from the majority of military cliques in the NRA, it naturally has received opposition from the CC Clique. Questioning the validity of such claims of poor recruits, when they themselves are in-charge of military recruitment. Furthermore, Chen Lifu has raised the idea that such extensive examinations would serve to be a bureaucratic drain on the party and army, and that it is best to leave such matters to the experts, namely, his brother and his clique."
 YUN.lategame.054.a: "Granted. Better soldiers, better results."
 YUN.lategame.054.b: "Such measures are untenable."

 YUN.lategame.055.t: "Revitalising Physical Training"
 YUN.lategame.055.d: "Once again Zhu De and his group of reformers have approached [ROOT.GetLeader] with an interesting directive to address the issues of the field training methods of the National Revolutionary Army's common soldiers. In his espoused \"Directive on Building up Physical Strength and Improving Shooting Skills\", Zhu has set his sights on improving the physical fitness and marksmanship of both soldiers and officers, hoping to develop high standards in both to make up for any potential NRA deficiencies in firepower or ammunition. Intent on ensuring the survival of the NRA in the light of enemy armies, and to be able to defeat them, the reformers are aware that the National Revolutionary Army's soldiers need to be able to out-march and out-manoeuvre any enemy unit in mountainous or otherwise difficult terrain.\n\nStating that physical exercise and target practice are the two most important facets of military training, Zhu De has personally set out an exercise regime to be adopted by all units, including extensive callisthenics and gymnastics. Alongside that, Zhu has endeavoured to lay out a system of shooting instruction and setup a series of intra-army marksmanship competitions. Fully conscious of Zhu's ambitions, [ROOT.GetLeader] could easily allow his plan to go ahead. Yet nonetheless, is now really the time to implement such an extensive reform plan, potentially affecting the army's own combat ability, at such a critical time? Would it not be more viable to merely place it at the end of national unification, after demobilisation of unnecessary divisions?"
 YUN.lategame.055.a: "Improving the gallantry of our men is a priority!"
 YUN.lategame.055.b: "Postpone it until unification."

 YUN.lategame.056.t: "Militarist Tradition, Diluted"
 YUN.lategame.056.d: "With the ever growing expanse of Kuomintang Territorial control, the increasingly developing National Revolutionary Army has necessitated increasingly expansive recruitment protocols. No longer are we merely recruiting Yunnan and Guizhou natives, but those outside the provinces too. Most concerning however, is that many of these new recruits into the NRA do not share the same convictions or backgrounds of their fellows, of the core. With the expansion of territory, some parts of the National Revolutionary Army preserved their core militarist tradition, and due to this, the masses have tended to feel isolated from the NRA.\n\nOn the opposite side however, the NRA has also made errors in permitting wide scale partisan warfare without enacting strict army discipline. This has led towards a tendency of individual action amongst certain units, instead of a broad interest in the National Revolution. Such autonomy has permitted the maintenance of the peasant ideology with an inclination towards revenge against those who had committed perceived infractions. With the masses always more radical than the National Revolutionary Army, they always desire more killing than can be permitted. Although the NRA comes from the masses, it should not reflect the peasant tendency towards revenge.\n\nTwo camps of support have arisen within the NRA in regards to their new, bloody and ruthless recruits. Whilst both camps agree that such actions are intolerable for the good image of the party, people and army, the split lies in how exactly to reprimand those that have been caught committing such atrocities. The likes of the radicals within the army advocate for a light hand, as one can commonly become absorbed in the presence of a people's revolution against the elites. Whilst the flip side advocate for a harsh policy, detaining and arresting all offending parties, allowing the military courts to decide their fates."
 YUN.lategame.056.a: "They were merely swept up in revolutionary fervour."
 YUN.lategame.056.b: "We are liberators! Not tyrants!"

 YUN.lategame.057.t: "Disciplines and Rules"
 YUN.lategame.057.d: "Ever the whizzing architect of military reform, Zhu De has petitioned [ROOT.GetLeader] for the creation of an official National Revolutionary Army pamphlet, drafting a series of reform rules to be published as a memo to every soldier and officer. Advocating both for a strong disciplined spirit, Zhu has stipulated that the greatest lesson that can be learned in warfare is that a people can fight victoriously with what resources happen to be on hand. The masses can get their guns if they have determination. It is easy to capture arms from the enemy by sudden attack and night battles. The people can even fight with bad arms, or without any formal armaments at all. Any kind of weapon, if utilised correctly and with proper spirit, can defeat the enemy.\n\nTo this end, his disciplinary pamphlet endeavours to instil a sense of revolutionary spirit into the soldiers. For as long as they have the pamphlet and the willpower, they can fight with or without arms. Drafted as the \"3 Major Disciplines and Eight Rules of the National Revolutionary Army\", Zhu's Three Major Disciplines are that soldiers should: Obey All Orders, Take not even a needle or thread from the people, Turn in all goods confiscated from Local Bullies and Evil Gentry. Alongside that, his Eight Rules are that soldiers should: Put back the doors you have taken down for bed-boards, Speak courteously to the people and help whenever possible, Return all borrowed articles, Pay for everything damaged, Be honest in buying thins, Be sanitary; dig latrines a safe distance from home and fill them up with earth before leaving, Don't bathe within sight of women, Do not mistreat prisoners.\n\nUnilaterally agreed upon as a general improvement in the discipline and regulation of the army, neither military clique draws particular ire with the stipulations drafted. However, they do have concern with Zhu De's growing direct influence within the army, concerned that he very well may be stealing the men from underneath them. That they would begin to answer only to Zhu De, and not their commanding officer."

 YUN.lategame.058.d: "With such autonomy having recently been delegated to the National Revolutionary Army Officers, the emphasis on lower-level initiative and independence follows the general global trend of adoption of \"Auftragstaktik\", or Mission Type Tactics, under the purviews of global German dominance, most notable for its utilisation in their Heer. Before an NRA operation, the higher-level commander's intent and overall objectives for the battle are communicated to lower-level commanders; they in turn would be granted flexibility in how to achieve said objectives. Posited by the reformers and Zhu De: \"Obeying orders and displaying independent initiative are not contradictory. Functioning independently should never be mistaken for disobeying orders. It is also inadvisable to execute orders mechanically without exercising any independent initiative\".\n\nIn coordinating the actions of large troop formations, it is essential that each and every unit understand, when accepting their assignment, the essence of their superior's decision and what role its own task plays in carrying out that order. If the situation has changed and communications have been severed, they should function independently according to the superior's order and local conditions, which should not be interpreted as disobeying the superior's order.\n\nYet a counter-strain of thought has risen against the tides of Zhu De's theories, as fairly recently occasions have arisen wherein officers have acted outwith their superior's general understand of the best course of action, effectively acting on their own initiative against the desires of the overall strategic plan. Raising contention amongst the likes of the high command, such as Jiang Dingwen, Qian Dajun, and Xiong Shihui, who have feared insubordination within their ranks."

To this end, the devising of plans for the establishment of a \"Three People's Principles Youth League\", also known as the \"Three Youth League\", had gone underway. Intent on being a youth organisation for the promotion of Dr. Sun's principles to the next generation of China, plans have been put on hold with the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, nonetheless, through the efforts of the famous musicians Ma Jilin and Que Zhongyao, they have drafted an anthem for the Youth League, known as the \"Youth March of the Three People's Principles\".\n\nWar flames filled the sky, blood spread all over the land, and the Chinese nation suffered an unprecedented catastrophe.\nWe grow up in suffering, we are tempted by the furnace of the catastrophic era, and we have become a revolutionary youth.\nThe rebirth of the party and the rejuvenation of the nation are two tasks that are firmly pressing on our shoulders.\nWe swear to fight for our principles, we swear to sacrifice for the revolution, and we can only move forward for the sake of the War of Resistance.\nOur bodies are like steel.

When Yuan made his imperial ambitions known, Cai escaped to Yunnan and coordinated with Tang to launch the National Protection War and establish the Huguojun.\n\nEven after Yuan's death, Cai E sustained the Yunnanese Army at great expense, which incentivised him to invade Sichuan to secure the local resources and lessen the economic strain of the army on Yunnan.

In order to pursue his political reforms whilst not offending the established regional power players, Chen Jiongming forged an alliance with Chen Lianbo and the Merchant Corps, which pushed the peasants into the arms of the Kuomintang. After the Guangzhou Nationalist Government collapsed from German intervention, Guangdong was split between various powers.\n\nThe Beijing-backed governor Shen Hongying controlled the northern regions of Guangdong, Chen Lianbo's Merchant Corps controlled the area surrounding Guangzhou including the city itself, and Deng Benyin ruled Qiongya. This state of affairs was brought to an end when the Yunnanese Army marched into Guangzhou bringing the four provinces of Southern China under a single administration.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] has deemed fit to reduce merchant privileges drastically and place the economy under the watchful eye of the provisional government.

Carrying over to the 20th century, Guangxi became one of China's leading republican provinces and joined in the Xinhai Revolution as earnestly as all other southern provinces. Lu Rongting's Old Guangxi Clique had similar ambitions to Cai E in Yunnan, and militarised the province to a similar level as Yunnan.\n\nThe New Guangxi Clique briefly controlled Guangxi after ousting Lu, and their ambitious reconstruction programme attempted to modernise and industrialise the province whilst also maintaining Lu's militarisation policy.

When Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor, Cai E and Tang Jiyao established Yunnan as the face of the republican movement, and it was the Yunnanese Huguojun which defeated the Beiyang Army in Sichuan and thwarted Yuan's imperial ambitions. Cai E's militarist aspirations led him to militarise the province further so that it could compete with Yunnan's surrounding provinces.\n\nAfter Cai E died, Tang Jiyao similarly held militarist aspirations for Chinese Unification, believing that a Federalist China must still maintain a strong military in order to defend the nation from foreign threats and imperialism. Aware of Yunnan's untenable economic situation, Tang pursued some demilitarisation efforts, but his militarist ambitions kept these reforms from taking full effect.

During the highs of international trade, the silk road would see times of prosperity, as Central Asian cities became popular destinations, acting as the middleman of international trade. China would retain this status until the 19th century, until the British opened up Chinese trade and broke the trade imbalance via opium.\n\nVarious regions of China were carved up among the Imperialist powers, and resources were extracted and traded away at their leisure. In many regions, Chinese businesses were locked out of international trade, as Western and Japanese companies ended up becoming the middleman that sent produce to the markets in the West and Japan for the consumers. This state of affairs led the Yunnanese Economic Commission to prioritise development of local companies and bring an end foreign economic dominance.\n\nWhile there is only so much that can be done at just the provincial level, Southern China's trade imbalance has indeed seen much less reliance on German business and mining operations, and much more of the wealth has gone into the hands of the Chinese state and local businesses. The increased state revenue from Yunnan combined with the Cantonese system's trade imbalance in China's favour has massively increased state revenue, and many in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government have already laid out plans for its uses."

China's large size, geographical diversity, and wealth of natural resources led to provincial specialisation and the provincial barriers acted not too differently to the barriers between countries.\n\nWhile Northern China traditionally produced wheat, Southern China's different climate and geography made rice farming far more advantageous. When dividing Chinese regions even further, one of Yunnan's traditional exports was gemstones, which found a market further north in China, especially in the wealthier cities like Beijing. While the Imperialist powers sought to open China up for trade, interregional trade continued to take place as it had for millenia, and became the more popular method of trade as international trade was viewed as a den of exploitation.\n\nThe Yunnanese Economic Commission not only sought to balance trade with the Western powers, but also open up further economic integration between provinces. In the past Yunnanese tin was transported to Hanoi for transport to the west where the French were both middleman and consumer, Yunnanese resources now find themselves travelling east to Guangzhou, where the Cantonese System will ensure that wealth is retained by the Chinese people.

Being situated along two major river systems, the ancient Chinese came to become a very agricultural people, a trait that has been carried down for millenia. Even in the modern age as industrial wonders emerge everyday from Europe and America, the Chinese people have by and large stayed agricultural, for better or for worse.\n\nIt is believed that even if China should modernise and industrialise along western lines, the middle kingdom will still root itself in agriculture, albeit while using more modern techniques and technologies. As such, Chinese agricultural and land reform has been the centre of Chinese modernisation. Chinese agriculture and society has always been unequal, and modern China is no different. Chinese peasants comprise most of the population, but a small class of landlords own most of the land.\n\nMore radical thinkers believe that an egalitarian and distributionist programme of land to the tiller ought to be adopted by the Chinese government in order to finally give the peasantry their just rewards.

While the National Revolution has yet to succeed, Generalissimo [ROOT.GetLeader] stands ready to begin the liberation of the Chinese people on a provincial level as an experiment for policies to be adopted on the national stage.\n\nWith agriculture's centrality in Chinese society, it is no surprise that agricultural reform came up in the Generalissimo's agenda. To Chen Lifu of the CC Clique, the Kuomintang must form several key ministries including but not limited to the economic commission, ministry of interior affairs, and ministry of finance in order to accurately assess and develop recommendations in different provinces. While finding support from Dai Jitao, this bureaucratic approach is hotly contested by the Blue Shirts.\n\nTo Blue Shirt visionaries like Teng Jie and Zhou Fang, the reason why China's rural economy failed was due to burdensome land policies and special taxes, episodic reassessments, unpredictable surtaxes, and the undermining of the incentive and enterprises of the peasants. Chen Cheng, a rising star in the Whampoa Clique and leader of the minor Civil Engineering faction, proposes a combination of the two proposals, with a focus on the rural masses, combat corrupt wealth accumulation, and make use of public distribution of goods to combat the inflation plaguing China. The party in deadlock, only the Generalissimo can decisively declare the Kuomintang's land reform policy."

 YUN.lategame.209.t: "Triangle Trade"
 YUN.lategame.209.d: "In the aftermath of the Ming restoration of a Han-led Chinese Dynastic state, the government turned increasingly inwards, and isolationism once became the policy of the nation. When the Qing conquered the Ming Dynasty, isolationism was maintained, and foreign trade was limited to the port of Guangzhou, which operated under the Cantonese system which created a trade imbalance in China's favour. Desiring to break the imbalance, the British resolved to smuggle opium to compensate for the imports of Chinese tea to their Isles. Opium took the Chinese by storm to the extent that silver became a scarcity in the middle kingdom and addictions became commonplace.\n\nThe Chinese Emperor attempted to combat Opium smuggling, which resulted in the Opium Wars and humbled the long-proud Chinese. Opium smuggling and domestic production would intensify, and the Yunnanese economy would come to be dominated by opium exports. A triangle trade emerged as a result, with Yunnanese opium being sold in Wuhan, which in turn was used to buy cotton and yarn from the Western powers in Guangzhou and Tonkin. Cai E and Tang Jiyao's governorships saw attempts to curb opium, but lack of cash from opium production hurt the provincial administration.\n\nThe Kunming administration wasn't inclined to involve itself in rural reconstruction, but the ministry of finance attempted to sell grain stocks in the granaries of Kunming's surrounding towns, as by that point Yunnanese banditry was at a low, especially in comparison to Guangxi and Sichuan. With the KMT now in charge, poppy suppression has once again been enforced, but the issues that plagued Tang Jiyao and Cai E remain, and provincial revenues in Yunnan have plummeted since the enacting of poppy suppression. Many wonder whether it had been better to simply leave the Opium suppression for a future time and only implement opium taxation, but high ranking officials in the administration are adamant that opium has no future in a Revolutionary China, and the Yunnanese model will lead the way."

 YUN.lategame.210.t: "Maintaining the Course"
 YUN.lategame.210.d: "In the last years of the Qing Dynasty following the Boxer Rebellion, the government undertook an unprecedented turn towards political and economic modernisation. In Yunnan, Viceroy Li Jingxi undertook an ambitious task to centralise the province, modernise the economy, and undo foreign dominance. Li found himself curbed by the resistance of the local gentry, and his reforms were ultimately cut short by the Xinhai Revolution. Li was succeeded by Cai E and Tang Jiyao, soldiers in the Yunnanese New Army that became sympathetic to the revolution.\n\nCai E and Tang Jiyao both ruled Yunnan with a reformist outlook, but militarism, poverty, opium, the gentry, and the warlord era prevented major reforms from being fully pushed through. Despite this, the attitude of reform always remained high in Kunming. With immediate military matters settled, the Kunming Administration has once again redirected its attention to the task of agricultural reform and modernisation. There is an undercurrent of belief that finally, what began with Li Jingxi will finally reach their natural conclusion with [ROOT.GetLeader]."

The triangle trade emerged, with Yunnanese opium being sold in Wuhan, which in turn was used to buy cotton and yarn from the Western powers in Guangzhou and Tonkin. Viceroy Li Jingxi attempted to centralise opium taxation, and Cai E and Tang Jiyao attempted to suppress the opium. Tang utilised public campaigns that included lectures, pamphlets, public demonstrations, and anti-opium songs. He also tried to levy a fine of three yuan for every mu of land planted with poppies.\n\nTang had hoped to free more arable land for food production, though government ability to enforce it outside of Kunming was so limited that the government officially decided the penalty would not be enforced south of Kunming to avoid unrest that could disrupt the Kunming - Haiphong railway. In practice, anti-opium penalties were ineffective at reducing cultivation or consumption and hurt rural regions which in turn increased banditry. Although a staple of Yunnanese economic reform, many are calling for poppy suppression measures to be dropped altogether due to poor results, and instead rely on opium revenue to modernise the economy in other areas."

 YUN.lategame.212.d: "One of the Kuomintang's leading political theorists, Dai Jitao's musings on China's economic situation is unrivalled in ambition and revolutionary fervour. Once a leftist firebrand, Dai Jitao shifted to the new right upon the realisation of the sycophantic nature of Parisian-worshipping parasites had on Chinese society and concocted a new understanding of Sun Yat-sen's principles in a pure, unfettered Chinese understanding. Unlike the leftists who would betray the Chinese revolution for the international socialist cause, Dai's vision for the Kuomintang owes loyalty only to the Chinese nation.\n\nUnlike the liberals who would betray the masses of China for useless good-for-nothing platitudes, Dai understands that liberation of the Chinese classes must be the primary undertaking. However, China's classes are not tools to be waged against one another; no, China's classes are a part of a greater social body. To achieve this great harmonic convergence, Dai reasons that revolutionary activists must be disciplined to push for the singular vision of the Kuomintang which encompasses all classes and has no higher calling than that of national revival.\n\nThe hedonistic and anarchistic chaos socialists promote have no place in the Chinese revolution, and the masses must not be led astray by such callings. No, the masses are a potent and yet unpredictable force which requires a disciplined revolutionary guard to shepard them to glory. That shepard is the Kuomintang, and the party will bring a new dawn to China.\n\nWestern concepts such as wage labour and surplus value are not relevant to the Chinese nation whatsoever, as labour is transhistorical in the middle kingdom. Thus, when the National Revolution unifies the classes as a unified machine of productivity that will bring soaring highs of development, cooperation, and prosperity, the Chinese people will have achieved that common livelihood via their own labour, the aspiration of all nations."

The China of today is leaps and bounds ahead of the China left behind by Yuan Shikai. Dr. Sun's dream of a strong and fair Chinese Republic is on the cusp of success. The free provinces of our republic enjoy the boons of economic integration, modernising transportation, and Chinese businesses flourish under the government's just watch. In the east, the western powers no longer enjoy all the privileges they had just a decade ago. The productive masses of China find themselves reinvigorated by the disciplined Chinese Revolution. Where labour leaders once fell to the spectre of socialism, they now flow against mob mentality and guide workers towards the enterprise of development. Of course, much work still remains to be done. Full comprehensive land reform remains elusive, as military unification takes priority and warlords still rule much of the hinterland. Regardless, the National Revolution has only just begun, and the day is coming that the White Sun will fly from Harbin to Dali, from Taipei to Dihua!"

 YUN.lategame.400.d: "The last sounds of sporadic rifle and cannon fire were finally vanquished as the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth was raised over the Forbidden Palace and the National Assembly. Vestiges of the Beiyang Government, such as the Five-Coloured Flag and the official seal of the nation, were torn down, and soldiers from every city block were seen handing out propaganda leaflets to commemorate the completion of the late premier's vision.\n\nWas the fraternal bloodletting necessary? Our party has always advocated the use of peaceful means to build a unified government. On the one hand, the government of the Republic of China should be built by the Chinese people themselves; on the other hand, the people's livelihood is in a state of decline and cannot bear the disaster of internal strife again. Therefore, when the late Dr. Sun went to the north, he immediately urged the whole country to convene a National Conference to resolve the current situation. Who knew that the traitor Duan would openly agree to the National Conference but secretly refuse, and the imperialists incited the warlords to become more violent.\n\nOur party pleads for the people and eliminates traitors for the sake of national salvation. We do not care about success or failure, and we willnot hesitate to make any sacrifice. In order to abide by the strategy announced by the Eternal Premier, our party has fulfilled its divine duty.

 YUN.lategame.401.d: "Generalissimo He Yingqin may have claimed the lion's share of the credit for the National Revolutionary Army's victory over their opponents during the Northern Expedition, but there is a growing sense of unease about his powers as President. Opposition has been building for some time against him, and battlefield victories have not always quenched dissatisfaction with his leadership.\n\nIn one particular case, Hu Hanmin and the Central Executive Committee approved a proposal, to which Chen Lifu then said \"we have to wait for He Yingqin's opinion\". He Yingqin was at the frontline during proceedings, and the committee was so incensed that before Hu Hanmin could reply himself another noted \"if the decision of the party still cannot be counted upon, why should we hold a meeting to discuss it?\"\n\nHis hold over his own ruling coalition, which has allowed him to largely bypass his critics in the past, is also starting to waver as well. Premier Dai Jitao and Vice Premier Zhang Qun, while loyal so far and usually can be played off against each other, have been at odds with the military dominance of the government - hoping to secure a transition towards more civilian rule while retaining He Yingqin as President. Within the ranks of the NRA, Chen Cheng and Teng Jie's respective cliques have also been having doubts, believing that the revolution is not moving fast enough under General He's conservative rule.\n\nThe party is beginning to fall apart from within, with clashing demands for direction and democracy amid worries of external threats. He Yingqin has begun to float a solution, under pressure from certain wings of the party, he has proposed the drafting of a Provisional Constitution. While the details are still being haggled over, he has nevertheless called an urgent National Kuomintang Party Congress to convene to finalise the details."
 YUN.lategame.401.a: "Could this be the solution to our party's woes?"

 YUN.lategame.402.t: "Hu Hanmin Denounces the [GetYear] Constitution"
 YUN.lategame.402.d.intro: "Hu Hanmin, a stubbornly orthodox Sunnist, has been the most vocal opponent to the Provisional Constitution. According to Dr. Sun's three stage theory of national development, no constitution can be drafted until the end of the Political Tutelage when a national convention drawn from all parties and factions in China can participate in its drafting in preparation for the Constitutional Phase. A provisional constitution then, is not a compromise but a perversion of Dr. Sun's teachings.\n\nAs the specific contents of the Provisional Constitution has been unveiled, further critiques have emerged. For the most part, the Provisional Constitution simply reaffirms what already exists - the party-state and political tutelage will be officially codified into law, Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People upheld, the Five Branches of the government will be established, and the government will respect the separation of power between the central government and regional governments except for in economic matters where the National Reconstruction Commission will directly implement Dr. Sun's agenda. However, the rushed nature of this constitution and its apparent lack of protection for human rights (outside of religious freedoms, personal freedoms are said to be determined by the law which can be changed at will), has attracted criticism from many moderates in the party and liberal outsiders.\n\nFor Hu Hanmin, this has been the moment he has been waiting for. A firm democratic centralist, he is unwilling to endorse any course of action that directly divides the party."
 YUN.lategame.402.closer: "Hu Hanmin has begun an open campaign to stop the passage of the Provisional Constitution and demand He Yingqin's resignation.

 YUN.lategame.403.d: "As the debate continues during the National Congress, figures from the various cliques have weighed in during the days-long proceedings. Vice Premier Zhang Qun is said to be among the most enthusiastic supporters of the proposal. It is claimed by his enemies that he has once said that \"the Whampoa Clique has weapons as its backing, the CC Clique has the masses as its base, and the Political Science Clique looks impressive but has nothing behind it.\" The veracity of that quote has been disputed, but what is uncontested is that the Political Science Clique is expected to gain the most from transitioning away from a haphazard party-state towards a more formal government.\n\nThey make strange bedfellows with many leftists, liberals and regionalists, who have similarly called for a provisional constitution. They claim it will elevate the people's power at the expense of the Kuomintang, and be their chance to create a more plural government. The proposal of course has been adamantly opposed by Hu Hanmin and many of the Moscow Committee factions, who tend to dominate party affairs and stand to lose the most should a provisional constitution be passed.\n\nDai Jitao and the CC Clique are said to be more ambivalent. Chen Lifu has gone on record saying that it is simply too early to begin that transition and that a constitution is not needed quite yet. Unity, to them, takes priority. On the other hand, they are reluctant to take a firm stance against the President, and have for the most part advised compromise between Whampoa and Moscow."

While the Whampoa old guard have mostly rallied behind He Yingqin, the younger guard factions have offered some private dissent and many of the mainstream officers are being forced to pick sides.\n\nLiu Jianqun has chosen his words carefully, writing in the Society Mercury that the first principle of National Populism is \"the organisation of a strong nation and the establishment of a strong government.\" He goes on to say that \"the greatest defect of the committee system is that everyone makes excuses, blames one another, and thereby dissipates the party's internal strength...in revolutionary reconstruction, no one acts...as soon as a meeting is called, there are disagreements. The number of civil wars is almost in direct proportion to the number of meetings.\" While he has been careful not to overly oppose his superior's constitution, it is well known that the Blue Shirts Society finds the idea of a constitution restraining the actions of the government anathema.\n\nChen Cheng and the Civil Engineering Clique have also been circumspect about their opinions in public, not wishing to attract retaliation from their superiors. Like many other leftists, they are said to have expressed some interest in a constitution and public accountability, though plenty are cynical about the intentions of the Political Science Clique and worry about the deviation from the long held party orthodoxy."

 YUN.lategame.405.d: "With the contents of the Provisional Constitution finalised, the final step required is ratification by a National Assembly, with hundreds of delegates drawn from all over the nation. Seats are allocated not only to provinces and cities, but also professional groups, trade unions, farmers associations, chambers of commerce, educational associations, overseas Chinese communities, and officials from the party itself. Given the circumstances, such an arrangement is no easy task - in areas not currently occupied by Kuomintang authorities delegates are often de facto appointed by the party to represent them.\n\nWith opposition growing and Hu Hanmin leading the charge, there is a sincere concern that the Provisional Constitution will fail to achieve the 2/3rds majority required to pass it. Hu Hanmin, as Premier of the Legislative Yuan, has substantial sway over proceedings, and even if the CC Clique and Political Science Clique use every dirty trick in the book and the full weight of the party apparatus, there is no guarantee the vote will go their way. Dai Jitao, having received input from the Chen brothers and their party whips, has strongly advised against going forward with this proposal.\n\nIt is however too late, at least from Generalissimo He's perspective. More and more, the vote is becoming a referendum on He Yingqin's leadership itself. Threatened, and perhaps insulted, by the growing rebelliousness of southern leaders, He Yingqin has made up his mind. In two months, just before the National Assembly convenes, he will arrest the treacherous Hu Hanmin and dismantle the armed conspirators backing him. In a rapid campaign, he plans to disarm the internal opposition.\n\nZhang Qun may be one of the chief architects of the Provisional Constitution, but the proposal has unsettled him. Similarly, Chen Cheng and his allies have expressed worry about the dangers of such a major operation. But for Teng Jie and many others who resent the lumbering inefficiency of the party-state, this is the moment of truth."

In a hotel room, Hu was charged with a variety of crimes, including conspiracy to murder the President, overthrow the government, and hinder the administration by blocking the passage of the provisional constitution.\n\nElsewhere, National Revolutionary Army forces moved quickly to secure the southern provinces - eliminating potential threats in the Kuomintang heartland. Though there was some resistance, for the most part Whampoa lead divisions swept away regional forces and within a few hours the nation was secure.\n\nIn the National Assembly meetings, it was announced that Hu Hanmin had elected to resign due to \"failing health\". Despite efforts at censorship, the truth of Hu Hanmin's fate slowly came out but most elected to keep their heads down. Any opposition to the Provisional Constitution died out with a whimper. Dai Jitao and Zhang Qun guided deliberations to passage, and the party locked ranks behind their now undisputed leader.\n\nThe Generalissimo's gamble paid off: Hu Hanmin is under house arrest, the opposition has been thoroughly dismembered and loyalist governors installed throughout the south. Guangdong is under direct military rule, and the Nation is shaken but ultimately pliant. He Yingqin has been handed extraordinary power, now the question is how will he use it?

The schism between the left and right wings of the party is infamous, but the division within the right has also been growing for a considerable period of time. This culminated in the formation of \"Old Right\" factions that generally backed Hu Hanmin, and \"New Right\" factions that generally backed Chiang Kai-shek in their respective bids for power.\n\nThe question of a Provisional Constitution has become a major flashpoint in this intra-party dispute. Hu Hanmin and his followers have condemned it on ideological grounds, maintaining that revered party founder Sun Yat-sen mandated that a constitution not be drafted until the end of the political tutelage. However, President He Yingqin and many other intellectuals have argued that a provisional constitution would increase accountability and create a more institutionalised framework for the tutelage.\n\nThe party has split along faction lines, and the President has ordered the National Assembly (with delegates freshly drawn from around the country) to convene in two months to vote on the proposal. Rumours of potential violence have circled and the matter is increasingly seen as a referendum on He Yingqin's leadership himself.\n\nThe opposition, calling themselves the Great Alliance for the Protection of Party Authority, have sent feelers out to regional factions around the country in hopes of securing our support against the Provisional Constitution.

 YUN.lategame.410.d.HighZeal: "$YUN.lategame.410.d.intro$\n\nThe National Revolutionary Army's attempt to clamp down on the southern warlords have failed amid a wave of popular dissent. The people are simply too energised and protesters have taken to the streets around the country. Newspapers have braved censorship, publishing anti-He Yingqin editorials. Party cadres are threatening to resign en masse and worryingly many divisions have refused further orders.\n\nZealots in the CC and Civil Engineering Cliques are galvanised, and the Moscow Committee dominated Judicial Yuan has formally demanded Hu's release. Meanwhile, the Political Science Clique has been weakened by defections while the Blueshirts suffer from their reputation as instruments of the Generalissimo's brutality.\n\nIronically, one of the few things He Yingqin's loyalists and detractors agree on is that Hu Hanmin's health is probably failing. Detained in a hotel known for housing political prisoners, and later in his own home with poor air circulation, the stress of the crisis is said to have driven Hu Hanmin's blood pressure to dangerous levels. He has refused care from doctors sent by General He, and his sympathisers have been turned away by his guards, leading many to worry about his long term safety as the crisis unfolds."

Fleeing arrest, many members of the Great Alliance for the Protection of Party Authority have retreated to sympathetic strongholds. The effort to oust He Yingqin from power has accelerated, with longtime Moscow Committee Clique grandees Zou Lu, Gu Yingfen, Xiao Focheng, and Lin Sen (about a third of the central supervisory committee of the party) moved to impeach the President. They have filed six charges\n\n1. Building his own empire and assuming dictatorial authority\n2. Deliberately permitting socialists to overrun various provinces\n3. Appointing Chen Guofu to various posts within the party\n4. Placing his trust in men like Kong Xiangxi who has enriched himself\n5. Placing his trust in old bureaucratic officials and militarists like Yang Yongtai and Zhang Shizhao\n6. Illegally arresting Hu Hanmin, Xu Chongzhi, and Ju Zheng (among others).\n\nThe focus of discussion has not only been on abuse of power but also incompetence in administration.

When he finally received Dai Jitao's resignation as Premier of the Executive Yuan this morning, it was clear that the situation (at least in its present form) is untenable. In one final gambit, He Yingqin has decided to tender his own resignation alongside Dai \"in the name of national unity,\" nominating Zhang Qun and Chen Guofu to \"oversee the transition\". He is banking on the new cabinet being too weak and the opposition unwieldy to rule for long, proving his point that his firm hand is indispensable for the functioning of the regime."

 YUN.lategame.412.t: "Zhang Qun's Audacious Gambit"
 YUN.lategame.412.d: "With both He Yingqin and Dai Jitao (at least temporarily) out of the picture, Minister of War Zhang Qun's appointment to the Presidency was quickly confirmed by the panicked members of the Central Executive Committee. The President-elect has turned out to be far more free-thinking than most gave him credit for however, and his first move in office has been to nominate Yang Yongtai as Premier of the Executive Yuan instead of Chen Guofu.\n\nThe stunned Central Executive Committee, which has spent the past few years effectively rubber stamping the will of the President, has awkwardly approved the appointment. The Zhang-Yang government has moved quickly to appoint sympathetic ministers from the Political Science Clique's braintrust to the cabinet, trying to sideline their rivals in the CC Clique. Similarly, Zhang Qun has assembled a small clique of aligned officers in the National Revolutionary Army, including Generals Li Genyuan, Lai Shihuang, and Xiong Shihui with orders to keep the army under control.\n\nZhang, in his hurried array of public addresses and speeches before the National Assembly, has attempted to consolidate his position. He has stressed the need for unity and negotiation with the South China Political Council and also reiterated the Political Science Clique's desire to pass the provisional constitution. How he intends to reconcile the two objectives he has not said, and given how much of a sticking point the matter has been it is unlikely to be easy. Perhaps he is gambling that the fear of He Yingqin's return (and his revenge) will motivate party moderates to action, but if that is the case he is making a very dangerous wager."

 YUN.lategame.413.t: "Dai Jitao and the CC Clique Plot"
 YUN.lategame.413.d: "Dai Jitao has been a faithful disciple of the National Revolution for decades now, and quite prescient as well. He correctly predicted that Chiang Kai-shek would lose his life fighting Wang Jingwei, and he correctly predicted that He Yingqin's ham-fisted attempt at resolving his dispute with Hu Hanmin would backfire. Now he believes that Zhang Qun, the latest military man to take the reins in China and probably the least principled, will fall.\n\nDai is determined to be the one who emerges from the ashes. Historically more of a background figure, the chronic mismanagement of the party and the intensity of the crisis has pushed Dai into a more active role. His well-timed resignation has allowed him to escape the fallout of Hu Hanmin's arrest less scratched than General He, and his long tenure in the party has given him more legitimacy than Zhang Qun. According to him, he is the only one who can truly bridge the divide between the rambunctious military and the unruly civilian party while still adhering to the principles set forth by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.\n\nHe is hardly alone in that assessment. Major party figures have historically eschewed if not outright denounced the formation of illegal internal factions, and true to form so has Mr. Dai. But it is indisputable that most of the followers coalescing around him are known as the CC Clique, spearheaded by the recently spurned Chen Guofu and his younger brother Chen Lifu.\n\nThe Chen brothers (who may give the CC Clique their name), have worked to engineer a plot in support of Dai Jitao, utilising their sway over many legislators and party functionaries to formally reject the Provisional Constitution at the National Assembly. This would deal a lethal blow to Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai's claims of being effective stewards of the party, and the ensuing momentum would make a vote of no confidence inevitable. Dai would likely be sworn in as President in the aftermath and be empowered to find a resolution to the disputes with the army and followers of Hu Hanmin."

 YUN.lategame.414.t: "The Blueshirts Approach General He"
 YUN.lategame.414.d: "Teng Jie and many other Whampoa officers who had studied abroad in Japan and Russia have long drawn up a secret plan that advised the creation of an illusive, powerful organisation within the Whampoa clique to serve as the backbone of a new state. Having shared his plans with Zeng Kuoqing, the chief secretary of the Military Department of the Central Executive Committee, the impressed senior officer invited over a dozen hand-picked Whampoa graduates to a dinner to discuss matters further. Each attendee then swore to recruit a classmate, and by the third dinner the Blueshirts had over 40 core members drawn from the first six classes of Whampoa.\n\nThe movement has only grown from there, aided by the increased radicalisation of the party and the rapid promotions of Whampoa alumni as the government expanded. Their latest agenda, adopted by their inner circle and rapidly disseminated across their networks, is to support the fallen He Yingqin in establishing his \"supreme authority and belief centre in the minds of the whole people\".\n\nA delegation led by Teng and Zeng arrived in He Yingqin's home within days of his resignation in a meeting facilitated by Liu Jianqun. The General, who had been counting on the support of his Whampoa comrades, was eager to hear their praises and their pleas to return to power.\n\nPrivately, General He has expressed dismay at the thuggishness of his new allies, having hoped that the conservative establishment would seek his return on their own. But with the Political Science Clique and the CC Clique having effectively abandoned him for their own ambitions, Whampoa will have to suffice. Whampoa does not control the entirety of the National Revolutionary Army however, and if they are to pull off their anticipated coup then all of Whampoa's cliques will have to join ranks. Enlisting Chen Cheng and the Civil Engineering Clique, who have remained on the fence, may not be as easy given mutual tensions between Chen, He, and Teng."

 YUN.lategame.415.d: "With party tensions at an all time high, the fate of the Provisional Constitution hangs in the balance. The power struggle in the party took a high stakes turn when He Yingqin ordered Hu Hanmin arrested just before the National Assembly was to meet. The detention of Hu, the Premier of the Legislative Yuan and one of the party's leading ideologues, was met with massive outrage from across the country which soon morphed into a broader denunciation of the He Yingqin regime's abuses of power.\n\nA South China Political Council was formed by Hu Hanmin's loyalists, spearheaded by the Great Alliance for the Protection of Party Authority. Faced with mounting opposition from all sides, He Yingqin made an audacious gamble - resigning along with Premier of the Executive Yuan Dai Jitao in the name of \"national unity\".\n\nZhang Qun, former Minister of War, was sworn into office as President, but has upended General He's attempt to prove himself indispensable by attempting to form a government of his own. Backed by the Political Science Clique, a group of technocrats, business magnates, and national liberal politicians, he is counting on the passage of the Provisional Constitution to rally the country behind him.\n\nHis rivals within the party have coalesced around Dai Jitao, another major intellectual titan within the Kuomintang. Backed by the nationalistic, conservative party cadres of the CC Clique, they have vowed to sink the Provisional Constitution to facilitate reconciliation with the South China Political Council.\n\nThe Army is not content to wait around for too long while the nation devolves into anarchy. There is a growing concern that General He Yingqin may attempt to make a political comeback via an armed coup d'etat.

#Hu Hanmin Crisis Negotiations and Resolution (420-429)
 YUN.lategame.420.t: "Communications with the SCPC"
 YUN.lategame.420.d: "The South China Political Council is not a monolithic entity, especially with Hu Hanmin still imprisoned. Nominally headed by Gu Yingfen, ironically his own nepotistic and autocratic style of leadership has spawned rebels within the rebel camp. Unified in their denunciation of He Yingqin, their demand for Hu Hanmin's release, and their general affiliation with Guangdong, the ensuing developments in [YUN.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and their own slowing momentum has prevented them from playing a more proactive role in the crisis.\n\nThere is a growing consensus that a negotiated reunification between the central government and the SCPC is needed, predicated on Hu Hanmin's release. Sun Fo and his progressive liberal Reconstruction Faction have indicated their preference for opening talks with Zhang Qun and the technocratic Political Science Clique. Through trusted intermediaries like Wu Tiecheng, he has changed his mind on the Provisional Constitution Question, believing that a constitution (albeit one with significant changes from the one proposed) would be the best way to constrain military rule.\n\nHu Hanmin's vocal opposition to the Provisional Constitution has diminished support for the constitution however, and more conservative figures like Zhang Ji have suggested collaborating with Dai Jitao and the CC Clique to ensure an outcome closer to Hu Hanmin's vision for a party-state run by the party's civilian intelligentsia.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is that many of the warlords backing the South China Political Council have begun to ignore the directives of the SCPC, weakening their hand. However, reconciliation between the two Kuomintang governments is a pressing concern for many National Assembly delegates, giving the council leverage if they act decisively. The bulk of the SCPC's membership is dominated by the so-called Western Hills Clique led by Lin Sen and Zou Lu, who will likely determine the final result."

Some of them were successful in worming their way into the new government, usually by leveraging their personal connections and prestige, though they remain a largely fringe and distrusted body within the right-wing government. The fact that there are any backroom channels open is a testament to the weakness of the current government.\n\nWang Jingwei and his RCA has expressed interest in working with the Political Science Clique, even if he has been careful not to be around in person during the crisis. He has utilised his time in quasi-exile to demand a constitution be passed, and the recent drive for a Provisional Constitution has validated his views. No doubt he expects his allies to receive generous promotions should they win.\n\nSong Qingling and her PAC have been scheming to topple the right-wing government altogether, attempting to enlist Chen Cheng and his Civil Engineering Clique to aid them. This dialogue has gone both ways however, and Chen has tried to tap into his own connections within the WMARCA to potentially build a base for his own efforts to reorganise the government.\n\nOf course there are many smaller factions, searching for direction.

However, as delegates began to vote one by one, it became clear that Zhang Qun and the Political Science Clique had amassed enough support (enthusiastic or not) to claim triumph.\n\nWith their victory secured, slowly but surely the party has fallen back in line like it always has. The CC Clique and their functionaries have been sidelined, many of those who resigned in protest of the government have not been hired back, the others have by now cut ties with the CC Clique and changed sides. Chen Lifu remains Minister of Education, but Dai Jitao and Chen Guofu are now effectively powerless as ministers without a portfolio.\n\nThe South China Political Council, after a contentious vote of their own, elected to rejoin the central government after securing a tentative arrangement with the Political Science Clique. This has eliminated another threat to the regime, while also helping to counterbalance the threat from the military.\n\nWhampoa's influence over the National Revolutionary Army, though still significant, has similarly been humbled. In the aftermath, many leading officers have been reassigned from their posts. General He Yingqin's gambit has failed, with most officers abandoning the conspiracy to restore him. Political Science Clique aligned officers have quietly shuffled out the more outspoken threats, claiming choice leadership positions for themselves.\n\nThe next few months are expected to be an uneasy one as Zhang and Yang consolidate their hold over the Nationalist government.

By an easy majority, Dai Jitao was named the new President. As a reward for their faithful service, Chen Guofu of the CC Clique was nominated as the new Premier, demonstrating the enduring power of the Zhejiang faction. Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai have controversially been able to retain their old portfolios in defence procurement and banking, though the various economic and production organs that previously fell in their domains have been reallocated to CC Clique stalwarts. Many of the business elite, like Kong Xiangxi, have recognised the changing winds and followed suit.\n\nThe South China Political Council, though not entirely satisfied with the outcome, have decided after a contentious vote and considerable work by intermediaries that this is the best they are going to get. With the Provisional Constitution having failed, they have mostly elected to recognise Dai as President and rejoin the national government, ending the crisis.\n\nDai, who holds a unique sway for a civilian over the military, has been able to significantly undercut He Yingqin's hold over Whampoa.

However, when Chen Cheng's name was among the top three in a signed letter from the various chiefs of the National Revolutionary Army, time had clearly run out.\n\nIn a carefully arranged exit, Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai resigned. The Central Executive Committee invited He Yingqin to return to form a new cabinet, and Chen Cheng was tapped for the Premiership as a reward for his loyalty. While Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai nominally retain their old portfolios in the war ministry and banking, and Dai Jitao and the Chen brothers in education and party affairs, in practice Whampoa cadres have been appointed all across the government.\n\nThe provisional constitution was passed silently. The South China Political Council proved to be a paper tiger in practice - after a renewed, violent campaign the unwieldy alliance of warlords and party opposition collapsed under the weight of the New Right.\n\nTo an outsider, He Yingqin has made his point: he is indispensable to the good functioning of the government. However, within Whampoa's opaque ranks, there has been a significant shift. The need for a Generalissimo, and the National Revolutionary Army to guard the revolution, is now indisputable, but He Yingqin's suitability for that role has been tarnished by his association with months of political chaos.

The greatest beneficiary of course has been He Yingqin and the Political Science Clique, but the CC Clique is not too far behind.\n\nA more careful look at the situation reveals that the intricate dynamics that dominated the party since their return to Guangzhou have effectively solidified. An outside observer describes it:\n\n\"The final decision-making power of the Kuomintang is in the hands of He Yingqin, but He is not isolated. Instead he is influenced by the various groups under him. Each are solidly under his control and none have all the power. Power is divided, with party affairs in the hands of the CC Clique, finances under Yang Yongtai and Kong Xiangxi, military matters are in the hands of the Whampoa clique, and the Political Science Clique has greater power over regional administration. In this way, each group only has a piece of power, and above all of them is General He, who creates He's regime. At the same time however, each faction has influence over General He.\"\n\nThrough this delicate division of power, the Generalissimo's government is expected to continue to rumble forward, his rule now unquestioned.

Stubborn as ever, he spends his days doing calligraphy and poetry while seeing few visitors. Efforts to get him to return to nominal office have been snubbed, the cantankerous old man continues to write damning statements against the government which are quickly censored.\n\nThe Moscow Committee factions have largely gone their own ways. The Elders clique have mostly dissolved without Hu Hanmin holding them together, their senior leadership coasting on their own prestige. The Western Hills Clique have similarly entrenched themselves in the Judicial Yuan, no longer willing to challenge He Yingqin outside of token party elections. Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction have flipped on the Constitutional issue, Sun has grown obsessed over drafting the \"perfect\" constitution that will somehow transition out of the dictatorship, a delusion General He has entertained.\n\nThe southern provinces who backed Hu have been the worst hit, almost all of them have been driven out of power. Guangdong, once the stronghold of Chen Jitang, has been under martial law, something that is only recently being lifted. The military governor thus far has been General Luo Zhuoying, a sworn brother of Chen Cheng and Guangdong native.\n\nHis transition to the political arena has been smooth but a more civilian leader might project a more conciliatory image. Wu Tiecheng is a prominent PSC figure with extensive ties with the former MCC including Lin Sen, Sun Fo, and Xu Chongzhi. Despite their long-standing antagonism with Guangdong, the CC Clique has put forward the cultured Zhang Daopan who has some experience working with the Guangdong government.

While the regime is known to be more conservative (and sometimes reactionary), plenty of factions have been working overtime to prove them wrong and to show that the Kuomintang is indeed a revolutionary movement for the Chinese.\n\nPropaganda leaflets throughout the country's urban centers, reaching even Shanghai, are adorned with pamphlets proclaiming the revolutionary glory of the Blueshirts Society or those glorifying the works of Chen Lifu and Guofu. These works frequently invoke images of a sincere and dedicated solidarity between the soldiers, workers, and peasants - in a vein similar to that done by the Kuomintang's left wing.\n\nThe irony is that the Blueshirts have sought to popularise their ideas through mass media - given their own hatred of the liberal press. Instead of advocating for class struggle, however, the political tracts call for interclass harmony - an exploited national community and a seeming struggle for national survival in a Darwinist world full of hungry imperialist powers.\n\nChen Cheng and the Civil Engineering Clique have also turned to using mass media to project their ideas, although their tones are seemingly more socialist in nature. Pushing their ideas that the CEC stands for the workers and peasants of the country seeking true land equality, their work has been denounced by the Blueshirts and the CC Clique as nothing more than closet Marxism.\n\nThe Political Science Clique has chosen to emphasise its dedication towards modernising the Chinese economy, proclaiming itself the most well-suited towards planning for a new statist economy, termed the Planned Free Economic Development. All this talk of socialism and national survival, they argue, detracts from the true solution to Chinese weakness, rapid industrialisation and aggressive planning."

From a heated discussion during a plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, Pan venomously denounced the Political Science Clique as warlord turncoats and opportunists who have defiled and soiled the revolutionary spirit of the Kuomintang.\n\nHe was joined in from those in the Reconstruction Faction under Liang Hancao who voiced similar concerns. Chen Cheng and the Civil Engineering Clique have also joined in the voices, denouncing the Political Science Clique of blatant corruption.

 YUN.lategame.434.d: "Despite, or perhaps in spite, of our soaring heights, the intra-personal cliques and factions of Whampoa could never be more at eachother's throats. Scurrying and clawing for influence, Chen Cheng and his Civil Engineering Young Guard have ran a campaign of undermining Generalissimo He Yingqin's authority within military circles. It has reached the point wherein genuine blood has been spilt. One notable case is that of infamous He subordinate Cheng Zerun.\n\nVying for influence within Whampoa, Cheng Zerun was ordered by Generalissimo He to execute one of Chen Cheng's direct subordinates, ostensibly for corruption. Permanently placing a wedge between Chen and He, the Little Generalissmo managed to institute an elaborate scheme resulting in Chen Zerun's arrest and imprisonment for embezzlement, tossed into a military prison.\n\nWith the feud ever growing, General Guan Linzheng, a notable opponent of Chen Cheng, has thrown his hat into the ring. A blunt, stubborn donkey of a man, Guan's feud with Chen starts back in 1928, where he insulted Chen's field command ability directly towards Luo Zhuoying. Not one to miss an opportunity to berate Chen, reportedly the most recent incident became brutal, wherein their conflict over the choice of subordinates by He resulted in Guan accusing Chen of retaining a superiority complex, insinuating that he desires Civil Engineering's dominance over the army. With the confrontation fierce, many believed the men would come to blows. However with Chen Cheng's stomach ulcer resurfacing due to tension, the Little Generalissimo was brought to his knees, vomiting immense amounts of blood.\n\nDismissing the bleeding Chen, Guan would have his subordinate choice of Zhang Yaoming denied anyway, with Fang Tian of Civil Engineering placed in command. As reports of the incident surface in both civilian and military circles, there has been an outpouring of sympathy for Chen Cheng, viewing him as a man pushing his body physically to the limits for the nation. Others however, decry both He and Chen, with notable opposition arriving from Teng Jie. Accusing the duo of nepotism, corruption and allowing rot to fester within the party."

 YUN.lategame.440.d: "On paper, He Yingqin commands the loyalty of the NRA - battletested soldiers from the Wars of Unification, the Second Northern Expedition. Yet there is a palpable irony in the political situation as the Generalissmo's standing within Whampoa has utterly collapsed following the Hu Hanmin Crisis. While he maintains his standing in the Presidency, the dynamics of Whampoa remain drastically changed.\n\nRevolutionary radicalism has long permeated through the halls of the Academy and now the NRA's cliques are divided between Chen Cheng and Teng Jie with the Old Guard unable to stop their growing popularity. To appease the radical military, Chen Cheng has been appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan while Teng Jie is now the Chief of the General Staff.\n\nThat has not stopped them from ratcheting up their rhetoric about the need for a supreme leader. In a highly publicised speech, Blueshirt spokesperson Liu Jianqun has claimed that for centuries China's golden years were when she was led by a true autocrat, the fortunes of the nation have both risen and fallen due to the quality of its leadership. Why change this now, when a supreme Party and an infallible national revolutionary party is finally capable of bringing eternal glory to the Chinese nation?\n\nThe Blueshirts, not even Liu, never unambiguously referred to General He as the supreme leader of the party however. They have, however, been moving quickly to secure control of the army and its vast patronage networks. Chen Cheng, with his favourable marriage and natural ability to make friends, has staked his claim over the political realm. One can only wonder with the true Supreme Leader will be."

 YUN.lategame.441.t: "A Few Ideas for the Reform of the Kuomintang"
 YUN.lategame.441.d: "Both Teng Jie and Chen Cheng have largely treated He Yingqin as a failure and a temporary leader while they focus on expanding their own influence, but Liu Jianqun knows better. Once He Yingqin's personal secretary, even as the de facto Propaganda Minister of the new government he still takes the time to court President He's favour. In a government where fewer and fewer members care for what the President has to say, this has gone a long way in expanding Liu's influence.\n\nLiu has taken the added step, without consulting Teng or Chen, of publishing a seven page manifesto simply titled \"A Few Ideas for the Reform of the Kuomintang\". In it, he outlined the major problems the party faces:\n\nThe solution for the Party was not merely to purge corrupt members and start a new reorganisation of the KMT, but to entirely scrap the old party and create a new organisation comprised only of true revolutionaries.\n\nThat the party be filled with revolutionaries in tune with the Blueshirt revolutionary spirit.\n\nTo reject material wealth and feudal relationships, even that of familial bonds. The only true bonds are those formed by your comrades. Of course, this envisioned the limitation of private property and full control of family members under the security of the Blueshirt Society.\n\nThat the Three People's Principles should be implemented with socialist like orgainisational methods but with the spirit of Japanese bushido and the strive for ultimate revolutionary modernity under National Populism.\n\nThat He Yingqin is the Kuomintang's only supreme leader and also that of China. All members must absolutely support him, follow his orders only, and make his will their own. Yes at this very hour, China needs a true Conducător or Vozhd at this stage when the revolutionary spirit is in danger!"

 YUN.lategame.442.d: "Liu Jianqun is not the only one who wants to reorganise the Kuomintang government. Amid the malaise, a growing demand for revivalism have pushed many Whampoa clique members to seek a return to the leftist revolutionary spirit of 1924, something fanned by Chen Cheng's rhetoric.\n\nThe head of the civilian government, Chen has proposed a second reorganisation, setting age limits and education requirements for all members of the government. He also has many other far reaching agenda items of both military and domestic matters:\n\nUnconventional troops are to accompany the main army in suppressing socialist traitors and reactionaries alike.\n\nThe army is to be totally reformed into a rigid, disclipined, an ideological force. No longer can the forces of the NRA be branded as merely warlord forces under the Nationalist flag.\n\nThe Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps are to be greatly strengthened with a secret police within it to purge anti-revolutionary activity. In reality, this is merely a ploy to keep He Yingqin and the CC Clique from encroaching on Chen's growing power.\n\nTo restore trust in the Kuomintang by working to mend the rift between the Moscow Committee and the Generalissmo. The ultimate goal for Chen is to bridge the party's differences with his own honesty and incorruptibility to restore faith in the Kuomintang system."

 YUN.lategame.443.t: "The Destruction of the Civilian Right"
 YUN.lategame.443.d: "The civilian right has not been having a good time ever since the Hu Hanmin Crisis. While Hu Hanmin has been quietly released into house arrest, most of his followers are either keeping their heads down or have fled the country. Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai have been sidelined, with the Political Science Clique all but dismantled. Dai Jitao has opted to accept a position as Premier of the Examination Yuan, effectively removing him from direct governance.\n\nIn the final accounting of the Hu Hanmin Crisis, presented before the Central Executive Committee, the crisis has been blamed on 1.) a lack of mass support 2.) the inability and refusal of the government to change 3.) bureaucratic mismanagement 4.) excessive factionalism 5.) disloyalty of regional governments. The need to reform after the crisis was clear as day and the ensuing purges have given a ready environment to change the party. Otherwise, the report warned, the long-term survival of the Kuomintang is in peril.\n\nWhile the CC Clique hoped to serve as a counter-balance between the CEC and BSS, their influence has been declining tremendously. Chen Cheng has utilised his position to push out CC Clique figures in short, decisive bursts rather than a gradual evolution. Still, with He Yingqin still nominally in power, this has only been a partial change. The latest target of his reorganisation of the government has been the position of Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, which manages the affairs of the secretariat itself. Chen Lifu, who is slated to be demoted to merely Minister of Education and whose brother has been effectively exiled to the Legislative Yuan, is no longer able to contest the title.\n\nNow with the CC sidelined, the CEC have pushed for Zhu Huaibing, a leftist military officer turned civilian administrator who is highly commended for his dutifuness. The BSS have pushed for Liu Jianqun, a pick whom they know would be approved by He Yingqin, and who is known for being a prolific writer yet infatuated with Narodism. Trying to preserve what is left of their legitimacy, CC and CEC members have also pushed for Zhang Lisheng, who is a CC Clique member but ultimately has close ties and interests with Chen Cheng's proposed rural land reform plans."

 YUN.lategame.444.t: "Three Phases of Development"
 YUN.lategame.444.d: "The late eternal premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen attracted controversy with his three stage theory of revolution when it came to the Chinese Revolution. Accepted by the Kuomintang as true orthodox doctrine for practising revolution, he proposed a military stage of revolution (in which the warlords would be subjugated), the stage of political instruction or tutelage to prepare the nation for democracy, and the third which would be an era of constitutional rule with the end goal of achieving total freedom from imperialism and democracy to grow.\n\nThe Blueshirt Society however argues that China ought to remain in the first stage of military rule. The establishment of civilian tutelage was merely an illusion of progress that brought needless and inappropriate demands for constitutional rule. After all...did the people truly need democracy at this stage? Federalists and other democratic idealists might opine so, but when illtieracy has not yet been eradicated and the masses uneducated, for China to install democracy today would be like asking a girl with bound feet to dance on high heels.\n\nPerhaps, therefore the Blueshirts opine - democracy is not necessarily needed in the liberal sense but a true democracy, faith in the Lingxiu's guidance and trust in the Party ought to be the third phase of revolution.\n\nChen Cheng himself vaguely agrees with the concept of a military-led tutelage but he himself is committed to an idea of an eventual democracy. The party must introduce new and energetic members to rectify the errors of political tutelage, and to prepare China for a gradual liberalisation and march towards democracy."

#Dai Jitao Events (450-459):

 YUN.lategame.450.t: "The Party-State Reorganised"
 YUN.lategame.450.d: "Peace has settled within the Party's apparatus with the Hu Hanmin Crisis finally resolved. Now, Dai Jitao finds himself the undisputed leader of the Chinese Kuomintang. An idealistic conservative, Dai believes in reviving the nature and notion of Datong that had existed in centuries past, harkening back to a time when classes lived in harmony prior to the advent of Marxism and the syndicalist revolution. A true nationalist revolution needs not class warfare but rather a united consciousness of nationalism and class; this is the true goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.\n\nTrue to his doctrine, Dai refuses to side with any particular party faction, but he is associated with the CC Clique. The two brothers, Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu, lead a faction of supporters that seek to model China with a combination of Confucianism and authoritarianism akin to that of the Russian National Solidarist movement.\n\nNow as the new President takes over, the first phase in his planned reorganisation of the Kuomintang is to take place. Certainly empowering his own cult of personality and power would strengthen Dai's own image, but seeking the strength and support of the powerful CC Clique could also increase the nature of the revolutionary spirit within the party. Alternatively, the new President can instead bridge divides in the country to focus on harmonising the nation under one pure ideology."
 YUN.lategame.450.a: "Dai is truly China's man of the hour!"
 YUN.lategame.450.b: "Towards a true harmony, shall the people strive for."
 YUN.lategame.450.c: "Empower the loyalists in the CC Clique."

 YUN.lategame.451.t: "New Media for New China"
 YUN.lategame.451.d: "In this new era of the 20th century, the eyes of the ever-growing literate masses are drawn to the giant bold letters of the newspapers, the cackle of the fireside radio, and even televised media, which can be frequented in China in grand cities. The CC Clique are obsessed with mobilising and entertaining the masses with party-approved entertainment, seeing media as an effective form of control and power that could be utilised for the sake of the national revolution.\n\nFunded by the CC Clique, the China Cultural Services Association has placed an emphasis on strengthening Chinese culture over western culture, with an emphasis on traditional Chinese opera and music. Plays focus on national heroes in Chinese history, especially those in times of great crisis, for instance, the play \"Wild Rose\" focuses on Kuomintang secret agents fighting against Japanese intelligence in the streets of Shanghai. Heroic sacrifice and tragic love are common themes, with a heavy emphasis on martyrdom for the sake of national salvation. The CC Clique have also funded the \"Young Soldier's Magazine\" which is a magazine oriented towards the youth of China. The magazines' contents are directed towards national patriotism and include songs directing children to prepare for the inevitable war against the Japanese and German imperialists while also encouraging young children to make toy aeroplanes out of glass, nails, spindle, and bamboo.\n\nCuriously, the magazine also encourages children to play a military game called \"Recovering Lost Territories.\" Players are divided into teams and line up to reclaim flags marked with the names of territories that have been lost to the imperialists such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Port Arthur."

 YUN.lategame.451.c: "Direct funding efforts towards the glorification of national duty!"

 YUN.lategame.452.t: "The Army and the Party"
 YUN.lategame.452.d: "The army has long been a voltaile force in Chinese politics and the National Revolutionary Army is unquestionably one of the main factors due to the National Revolution's success. With the army having been divieded following the Northern Expedition, the true National Revolution Army certainly acknowledges Dai Jitao as the de-facto leader of the party; given Dai's own personal political clout in the sphere of the right-wing.\n\nWith He Yingqin effectively disgraced from politics, it would appeared that the rumoured plot of the Generalissmo working with the thuggish and radical elements of the army who pledge loyalty to the Blushirt Society, has also been swept away. Within the army's ranks, Chen Cheng and the Civil Engineering Society are still demanding greater reformist energy. The Political Science Clique are also complaining that the government still lacks total legitimacy and cooperation, although they themselves may find themselves the next victims in the government's reorganisation.\n\nWith the army's loyalty behind him, Dai can certainly entertain these two factions although playing them together would create greater dysfunction between the two - allowing his influence within the CC Clique to only grow more. Alternatively, the party line certainly can be whipped and these petty factions, brought into line."
 YUN.lategame.452.a: "Keep the status quo for now."
 YUN.lategame.452.b: "Play the two factions together."
 YUN.lategame.452.c: "Bring the party in line!"

 YUN.lategame.453.t: "Intellectuals of the New Right"
 YUN.lategame.453.d: "Within the New Right, two prominent intellectuals have achieved publicity due to their commentary and ties to the party. Zhu Guangqian, a graduate of Hong Kong University, is a liberal aesthetician who has a strong and vested interest in the study of aesthetics, psychology, western philosophy, and the arts. Having spent some time in the 1920s in the socialist nations of Britian and France, Zhu deplored their fall of aesthetics - harkening towards a more \"classical\" age - despite his own liberal tendencies, his writings are quite popular amongst the Kumointang's right due to his own conservatism. Indeed Zhu has blasted the Chinese masses for being hypocritical towards their own plight, remarking that many had taken the Boxer Indemnity scholarships only to call for a \"downfall of imperialism.\"\n\nThe other notable writer is the journalist Chen Bulei. One of Dai's closer associates, Chen is an ambitious and devoted journalist, spending hours under dimly lit lights with nothing but black tea and cigarettes as sustaninence. He is a completely devoted writer of Dai's most popular speeches, a true believer in the Nationalist cause - even if his own daughter had run off to join the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Himself, a relative of the Chen brothers and the famous revolutionary Chen Qimei, Chen Bulei began his career as a Shanghai newspaper editor and became a member of the Nationalist Party under the personal invitation of Chiang kai-shek. A truly devoted member to the leadership of Dai, Chen is an unwavering candidate of complete and total obedience, determined to write and carry on for a cause greater than himself.\n\nThe Cultural Services Association under the auspicious CC Clique leadership are seeking to promote one of the two, to the esteemed honour of China's writer of the year. Backing Zhu's liberal influenced writings seems contradictory to the cause of the New Right, but there is no questioning Zhu's perfected understanding of aesthetics and philosophy - and how they can be related to the Kuomintang's revival. Alternatively, honouring Chen will continue to strengthen the President's own ever growing cult of personality."
 YUN.lategame.453.a: "Liberalism carries on with Zhu!"
 YUN.lategame.453.b: "Chen Bulei is a true writer of the Revolution!"

 YUN.lategame.454.t: "Reconcilling with the Old Right"
 YUN.lategame.454.d: "With the chaotic Hu Hanmin Crisis behind the National Government, Hu Hanmin has formally resigned all his posts within the Kuomintang and has instead returned home to Guangzhou, in a declaration of self-exile. His friendship with Dai Jitao is heavily strained these days with all that has transpired, but Dai has still consistently made overtures to rebuild his friendship with the esteemed Kuomintang elder.\n\nThe South China Political Council remains an issue to Dai's legitimacy as the party's head, with Hu having isolated himself. The Elders Clique of Cantonese party leaders have largely resigned themselves to their estates in the South, enjoying afternoon teas and discussing the later developments within China and the world. Their power, long consolidated in the cradle of Yue civilisation, continues to remain locally dominant with Dai and the CC Clique disinterested in destroying them. The Western Hills Clique continues to hold on to their positions in the Judicial Yuan while the Reconstruction Faction continue to clamor in the Legislative Yuan and amongst the diaspora community of Chinese expatriates.\n\nNonetheless, while Hu Hanmin may have escaped from the crisis without being labeled a traitor, the same cannot be said for other southern elements. While those in the Western Hills have advocated for a soft line against the rebels, many militarist elements within the Party have called for the Cantonese and Guangxi warlords who made up the backbone and muscle of the South China Political Council to be punished at once. Chen Lifu for his part has recommended a thorough purge of the turncoat traitors of the Political Science Clique, who too have fled south."
 YUN.lategame.454.a: "Hu is still a true revolutionary, we must end this feud."
 YUN.lategame.454.b: "Soften our rhetoric and build a new Party together."
 YUN.lategame.454.c: "Warlord pests must be cleansed from our nation."

 YUN.lategame.455.t: "Central Club and the Zhejiang Zaibatsu"
 YUN.lategame.455.d: "As the Kuomintang's national revolution advances far and wide across the country, the nature of the party's relationship with local elites has come into recent contention. Termed perhaps akin to an uneasy, or limited alliance, the local elites of Kuomintang inhabited regions have always tenuously bargained and exchanged with the Party, to varying degrees. It has been seen before within Guangdong, perhaps with the most catastrophic Merchant Corps Rebellion. Similarly, and most recently, it is evidenced by the Central Club and the \"Jiangsu-Zhejiang Consortium\", the largest financial industrial group in China.\n\nThrough familial connections, largely via Chen Qimei, the Central Club brothers Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu have pulled on their regional connections to utilise the innumerable wealth of the financial group to fund Kuomintang Party endeavours. Through their enterprises and the ZRCS, the JZC has largely served as the home to various revolutionary activities, and in the current era of the nation has absorbed the regional Jiangnan Consortium into its conglomerate.\n\nHowever neither the government nor the consortium are monolithic entities, and with the inclusion of local provincial and county governments, the painting is further muddied. Sometimes in outright violation of Provincial or National laws, local counties will parley with the elites rather than enact the Party's proposals such as rent reductions. On the other side of the coin, the Party has commonly extorted the local elites to contribute significantly towards the war effort, and towards financing the party itself, to the point of engaging in revenge campaigns under the guise of eliminating \"local bullies and evil gentry\", or all those weak elites that refuse to contribute.\n\nIn return, various opposition groups have formed against the party, sometimes brewing into violent clashes between local militia and Party soldiers. In this air of violent uncertainty, the CC Clique have put forward a joint party-government conference suggesting a light hand to handle indigenous local elites. Preferring government action as opposed to mass mob action, their proposals have won much support within the party, and they have pressed for Yu Qiaqing to handle such matters."
 YUN.lategame.455.a: "Central Club pulls on their connections to reign the elites in!"
 YUN.lategame.455.b: "How can we be so sure this doesn't play into their interests?"

#Zhang Qun Events (460-469):
 YUN.lategame.460.t: "The Political Science Government"
 YUN.lategame.460.d: "The passing of the Provisional Constitution was met with widespread acclaim within the Legislative Yuan of the Kuomintang. With the dominance of the Political Science Clique within the ranks of the representative government of the people, the cabinet has stabilised the restored government. Fears of an overt military coup have largely subsided as the NRA's rank and file have proven to be loyal. The CC Clique's attempt to shoot down the Zhang government has ultimately failed leading to a rare sense of peace within the Party.\n\nTheir next steps on their agenda are to heal the divisions with the former Beiyang Republic. While the Beiyang Government ended up a corrupted dictatorship under the Zhili Clique, politicians such as Huang Fu, Wu Dingchang, and Wu Tiecheng are willing to pledge loyalty to the new Nationalist Government in China, bringing their wealth of experience with them. Huang specifically toured Germany decades ago, becoming inspired by the economic reforms of Walther Rathenau.\n\nWith the Political Science Government ascendant, technocrats and other political moderates have thrown their support behind Zhang Qun. Weng Wenhao and Ding Wenjiang, noted former Beiyang technocrats, have proposed new technocratic corpuses such as the National Resources Commission and Central Planning Board. Staffed with the most capable experts from all across China, the CPB will manage the central economic planning of the nation, while the NRC will be responsible for industrial development.\n\nThese bodies would thus become the springboards for Chinese industrialisation through an ambitious series of Five-Year Plans and place the economy firmly under the grasp of the Kuomintang. More liberal business elements rallying behind Kong Xiangxi's Clique of financials have criticised such measures as socialist nonsense, but these statist proposals have thus far earned the backing of Yang Yongtai, who has established a number state-run farms in the Southwest."

 YUN.lategame.461.t: "Negotiations with the Southern China Political Council"
 YUN.lategame.461.d: "After his arrest and brief imprisonment, former triumvirate leader of the Kuomintang, Hu Hanmin was finally released. But the esteemed politician and writer refused to acknowledge the new government. Denouncing the new government as nothing more than compradors and warlords in disguise, Hu went south to a self-imposed exile of solitude and reflection in Guangzhou. Angered and stubborn, his visitors are few and his patience thin.\n\nHis following have since dispersed with the Elders Clique having also denounced the new government in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. However, the Western Hills Clique and the Reconstruction Faction are amicable to resolving broken ties and to building a true new constitutional government. Militarists within the South China Political Council are fine with the ongoing crisis, seeing it as an opportunity for them to sideline influence of the national government.\n\nMost in the Political Science Clique are open to the idea of reviving discourse with the southern Republicans. Some have suggested opening up a Political Consultative Council to Sun Fo, Ju Zheng, and other scholars from the Reconstruction Faction and Western Hills Clique to start working on a full constitution. Of course, Sun himself has changed his view on the Provisional Constitutional issue, once having seen it as heretical to thinking that a full constitution is now needed to prevent future military coups.\n\nPoliticians have always been open to taking bribes and so many could certainly be persuaded to join the new national government with strong financial incentives, promises of lucrative stability in an unstable era of Chinese politics. Perhaps it would be best to grant the militarists their own autonomy as a means to watch and curb their influence, lest a coup end this new genuine attempt at creating a government."

 YUN.lategame.462.d: "A late night in Zhang Qun's office in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] saw a meeting held between Zhang Qun, Li Genyuan, Xiong Shihui, and Lai Shihuang. The four men discussed how close the National Revolutionary Army was to staging a military coup during the Hu Hanmin Crisis. With the power and influence of the NRA within the Party, the government most certainly would have collapsed in one fell swoop.\n\nDespite the victory of the Political Science government, the Whampoa Clique continues to dominate the high command of the National Revolutionary Army. It's well known that Chen Cheng's faction barely tolerates the new government, maintaining only a semblance of loyalty.\n\nThe Blueshirt Society overtly hates the new government, due to their own hatred for democracy and their refusal to follow a civilian government. With He Yingqin completely disgraced, his faction has divided into either those who have seen the writing on the wall and have sided with the new government, and those who are aligned with the radical factions in the army.\n\nCertainly to neglect the army for now would only spur on the growth of this radicalism. There are also regionalist officers that can be aligned with the new government. Working with these officers to secure our influence may seek to strengthen our hold over Whampoa and some of them may even be brought to side with us to fully secure our hold of the NRA."

 YUN.lategame.463.d: "Literally translated as the \"Outside [the Party]\", Dangwai is a term that is receiving greater popularity within the Nationalist discourse especially in popular newspapers and editorials such as the Mingguo Ribao. The term refers to political independents who are allowed to take part in the government despite not nominally being part of the Kuomintang.\n\nUnder the Zhang-Yang coalition that now dominates the Party, a lot more of these Republican outsiders who may have achieved political clout in the former Anfu Club or the Beiyang Government, are now given a second chance at political prominence. With the new regime seeking to legitimise itself throughout China, these ambitious politicians are re-entering national politics - often at the expense of seats that would have been reserved for loyalists in the Kuomintang. This has caused considerable tension amongst many in the Party who believe that their presence degrades and dilutes the revolutionary spirit of the Party. A compromise has been suggested by Gu Zhongxiu to instead offer these individuals party membership as a means to legitimise their stay within the new National Government."

A China that is no longer bound by foreign humiliation and the leadership of a monarchy long gone. The Political Science Clique champions these new individuals, the great men who are capable of moving history themselves.\n\nThere is Wang Wenhao, who became an imperial scholar at a young age, and then went to Europe where he studied Geology alongside the \"three Wens\" (Hu Wenyao and Sun Wenyao). After his studies, he worked in the Agriculture and Commerce Ministry of Beiyang, became a lecturer at the Institute of Geology and has been recently appointed to the position of Minister of Economic Affairs. A passionate geologist, he has implored the Ministry of the Interior to expand mining activities to help cultivate a true Chinese oil industry.\n\nWu Dingchang was a member of the Tongmenghui but withdrew from the revolutionary party, and instead took the imperial examination. After the revolution, he joined the Progressive Party and became the deputy Minister of Finance for the Anfu Club. After having fallen out of relevance from Anfu's own fall, he lived in relative political obscurity while becoming a successful businessman. With the party's sponsorship, he has become the Ministry of Industry and is also the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government - close to the New Right's home territory.\n\nAnd finally, there is the politician Wu Tiecheng. A close friend of Li Sen, the revolutionary Wu served in the Xinhai Revolution and then worked for Dr. Sun afterwards, participating in the Chinese Revolutionary Party. After a brief stint overseas in Honolulu, he would work alongside Xu Chongzhi in fighting Chen Jiongming and helped suppress the Merchant Corps.

 YUN.lategame.470.d: "\"The key to managing this unprecedented national crisis was to train and guide women to take on professional lives\"\n -the weekly women's supplement in the Mingguo Ribao.\n\nConsistent with the Kuomintang's dual revolutionary and conservative nature, there is a prevailing desire to see women reformed along new, \"patriotic\" gender norms. Unlike in Europe, where many far right movements seek to encourage women to stay at home, reduce employment rates amid Black Monday and become mothers, the Kuomintang believe that an industrialising China needs greater female participation in the workplace and moreover that it is no so much birth rates that are a problem so much as high infant mortality.\n\nIndeed, as part of the New Life Movement, extravagant fashions for women have been banned. Gowns are to be ankle length, the distance between collar and cheek should not be less than an inch and a half, sleeves ought to reach at least the elbow, slits on the side of skirts should be no higher than the knee, women must avoid tight clothes and comb their hair backwards, not letting it fall below their necks. Curled hair was banned. Women at government offices were to take the lead, wearing short blue jackets, black skirts, black stockings and black shoes. Woollen coats without buttons were banned.\n\nThere appears to be little conflict with the conservative revolutionary vision of the party. Women are still expected to \"cultivate peaceful, kindly, and wholesome maternal instinct\" and raise children. Mixed gender bathing has been banned, as well as walking arm in arm in the street. Girls were to be separated from boys in school to put an end to shared life between the two sexes that encouraged \"selfish dilettantism, inflamed sensual pleasure, and jeopardised the race\".\n\nNevertheless, traditional marriages and funerals are to be replaced with simple ones, and the Kuomintang have echoed New Culture calls for nuclear families, seen as more modern and secular compared to the traditional Chinese structure."
 YUN.lategame.470.a: "We strive for a true modern society for our revolutionary sisters!"
 YUN.lategame.470.b: "Women ought to follow the leadership of their revolutionary brothers!"
 YUN.lategame.470.c: "Tell those hoes to STAY HOME."

 YUN.lategame.471.t: "Nationalist Women at War"
 YUN.lategame.471.d: "With China in a desperate struggle for survival, the country has called upon not just its sons but also its daughters to the battlefield. Girls from around the nation are trained to administer first aid, expected to perform tasks around the home, and in some cases, even to learn how to handle machine guns and ammunition, lest the situation grow ever so dire.\n\nAmong the women in China who support the Kuomintang government, there is none other than Song Meiling, the wife of the former Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. A minor party celeberity, given her brief connection with the former headmaster of Whampoa, Song has urged women to mobilise into the factories in a manner similar to the British, French, and German women who had done so during the First World War. This mobilisation will help advance the status of women in society, helping women be seen as an equal to man especially in a society dominated by patriarchial norms like China. In an act of philanthropy and utilisng her familial connections, Song has also organised sophisticated and modern orphanages, complete with recreational facilities like pools and playgrounds, and with modern classrooms to fit China's growing orphans.\n\nShe and other prominent women, including He Yingqin's wife, have also called for women to participate in military units. Whether or not they will be deployed on the frontlines as actual combatants is yet to be observed, but thousands have answered the call to serve as medics and nurses in the ongoing struggle for national salvation."
 YUN.lategame.471.a: "The children must be our priority!"
 YUN.lategame.471.b: "Mobilising the women will ensure their liberation!"
 YUN.lategame.471.c: "Women must be prepared to fight for their survival as well!"

 YUN.lategame.472.t: "Cultivation and hygiene in Nationalist China"
 YUN.lategame.472.d: "As part of the National Government's efforts to revive and strengthen the Chinese nation, the battle for the Chinese soul not only lies with the spirit of revolution but also for the battle to revive the Chinese man and women; their bodies long devastated by years of famine, war, and disease. Sun had spoken gravely of his concept of survival of the fittest, that the revolution should produce a new individual - and that if the people of China were not healed, they would, as a species, be wiped out. The New Life Movement is intended to revise the old New Culture Movement, and to balance both Chinese moralist philosophy and Western spirit. [ROOT.GetLeader] portrayed in propaganda as dutiful to his wife, uncorrupt, and pious to contrast himself with the warlords.\n\nThe Party has been at serious work in an attempt to \"deradicalise\" the mass movement and to ensure that the mass movement remain obedient to the goals of the New Life Movement. After all, individuals who are left to their alone, are merely subjugated to life's pleasures and sensualities - neglecting their own affairs and becoming reactionary degenerates.\n\nSpiritual strength, after all, is derived from adopting healthier and moral guidelines to live one's life. Vaccines are greatly encouraged at rural health stations and individuals are taught to adopt healthier living standards. Cleanliness and bathing are highly encouraged, and even the killing of mosquitoes is shown in propaganda as the first step towards developing a truly ascetic and hygienic new Chinese - one that would no longer be looked down upon by the West.\n\nIn addition, Chen Guofu has suggested that prostitutes ought to be nationalised by the state. He reasoned that closing brothels would simply move to places where brothels remained legal. Brothels would be limited in areas and all prostitutes would have access to Compound 606, an arsphenamine/anti-biotic drug used to treat dangerous veneral diseases. While it is painful and still dangerous, it is certainly more effective than traditional mercury based treatments and can sometimes be regarded as an effective ailment for an otherwise lethal disease."
 YUN.lategame.472.a: "We seek to cultivate a new Chinese man."
 YUN.lategame.472.b: "Winning the war in their minds is the key to the revolution."
 YUN.lategame.472.c: "We ought to be practical about this."

 YUN.lategame.473.t: "The New Life Movement"
 YUN.lategame.473.d: "\"The rise and fall of the nation is in direct ratio to the flourishing and decline of the culture. If we do not first establish a new national culture, then the restoration of the nation can hardly succeed.\"\n\nA government by the people and for the people like the Kuomintang, must address the social ills that have long plagued Chinese society. The people must be driven and led by order, taught by the outstretched arm and mind of the Party- to experience a New Life and to end superstitions. A new movement is needed, one inspired by Savinkov's own SZRS rallies and the order and stability from Romania's Iron Guard. Class struggle must be forsaken, the people must come in line and revive the notion of Zhonghua.\n\nIn the same way that the cult of ancestor worship permeates throughout Chinese society, political commentators and philosophers have remarked that a similar trend is being developed now to worship the cult of the party-state. The New Life Movement seeks to reconcile China's growing westernisation with the moral principles that have long guided this nation. Surely foolish concepts like syndicalism and socialism have truly no place in this country, the Kuomintang was defiled by these elements - weakening the party to internal factionalism.\n\nThe people are encouraged to follow a sloganised Confucianism, that encapsulated the four virtues in the form of li, yi, lian, and qi (propriety, justice, honesty, and self-respect/honour). The government has mandated the study of Confucius, observance of Confucian holidays, and the 96 rules - which are to help govern daily behaviour.\n\nOf course, there are philosophical arguments that this extensive movement was not merely to revive the Chinese spirit but also to ensure the survival of the Chinese race. Proponents of the New Life Movement argue that the degeneration of the New Culture movement and excessive consumption of the West - has led to the moral and physical decline of the Chinese people. Many believe that by emulating the Japanese martial culture, the Chinese nation ought to be reorganised in the image of a Japanese military academy - with discipline, obedience, and efficiency. Only under a strict and disciplined revival would the inner man be transformed, resulting ultimately in the creation of a new society and new nation."
 YUN.lategame.473.a: "We must abandon the old ways, strive for a new society!"
 YUN.lategame.473.b: "A virtuous nation will bring true harmony."
 YUN.lategame.473.c: "We strive towards the creation of a new man."

 YUN.lategame.474.t: "Nationalist Local Government Reform"
 YUN.lategame.474.d: "A very common thread among 20th Century Chinese reformers is that they desire to revive the local village and district. The Nationalists are no different, though unlike their Federalist rivals they believe that the Central Government ought to play the leading role in encouraging this grassroot revival, and in turn local administration would help give strength to the central government. Indeed, when pressed, Kuomintang officials insist that they are building a \"Better Federalism\", one where the entire Chinese people work together rather than fight between provinces.\n\nThe new local administration system is to be implemented with new counties (xian) with small towns the new centre of political and economic activity. These counties are to be the second administration level, second only to provincial and municipalities. They are followed by villages (xiang) and towns (zhen) along with other smaller cities. Villages are to be led by town administrators or militia leaders, often handpicked from higher levels of administration to gurantee stability and peace in the rural regions.\n\nTried and tested during the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties - the Baojia System is also utilised by the new Nationalist Government. Generalissmo He Yingqin had spoken on the Baojia's potential for creating a genuine compulsory service military. By organising households in 10s, the Baojia system helps keeps family members accountable, maintain local order, collect taxes, and organise civil projects. The Baojia System is also devised to help the locals be prepared in the events of bandit suppression, so that the local governments will be able to support the government even if they are far off from the capital's influence.\n\nFinally, reforms have been made to the rural countryside in order to increase local provincial revenue. Granaries staffed by government employees are supposed to report and maintain grain tax records, although initial reports indicate that there is a fair amount of corruption and dishonesty within the ranks and such measures have not been successful entirely."
 YUN.lategame.474.a: "Order and security belongs in the heart of the village."
 YUN.lategame.474.b: "Towards true harmony and productivity shall our efforts flow."
 YUN.lategame.474.c: "The people will learn truly through the Baojia system."

 YUN.lategame.475.t: "The Expanding Central Committee"
 YUN.lategame.475.d: "The Kuomintang operates as a party-state, but the actual relationship between the government and the party itself has always been ambiguous. This quandary has been worsened by the fact that the actual governance of the party has grown haphazard and unwieldy. The Central Executive Committee is supposed to rule the party on behalf of the Kuomintang National Congress. Originally 24 members in 1924, it has since grown to 36, then 71, and by this time is at 119. With so many members, it has grown unwieldy and effectively makes the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly redundant, especially since many Central Committee members hold seats in both as well!\n\nReducing membership has attracted too much pushback since CEC membership has been effectively a reward for submission, so an alternative plan to create a standing committee of 3-15 members has been tried. Originally it was supposed to be President He Yingqin, and Premiers Dai Jitao and Hu Hanmin, then it included all five branches, and soon enough it became as rudderless as the CEC.\n\nA third attempt to reform the system is underway, with calls to create a Political Council that includes 9 standing committee members and 6 others elected by a general session of the CEC, with non voting membership drawn from the cabinet. Sun Fo and Hu Hanmin have drafted a description of what it ought to look like: \"the political council is the guiding and directory organ for the task of national tutelage...It is a party affiliated organ for the management of party affairs. It is not a government organ; yet it initiates the government's fundamental policies. In other words, the political council is endowed with power to determine the fundamental goals in the period of political tutelage...the only link between party and government.\"\n\nAlready though, there have been calls to include more regular and alternative members of the CEC and the Central Supervisory Committee, and if all are accepted it would number nearly 200 people!"
 YUN.lategame.475.a: "What a disaster...but we will make it work I suppose."
 YUN.lategame.475.b: "The Political Council will have 200, but only a standing committee of 15."
 YUN.lategame.475.c: "This entire system needs to be overhauled from scratch!"

 YUN.lategame.476.t: "Audits and Inquiry in Nationalist China"
 YUN.lategame.476.d: "The formation of a provisional Examination and Control Yuan was a moment to celebrate, but like most things in China, it has been mired in the same issues of corruption and incompetence that they were designed to stop. The Examination Yuan, based on the pre-existing structure of imperial examination, is designed to weed out incomptent political hopefuls and to encourage a government based on meritocracy and prowess.\n\nThe Examination Yuan is supposed to have supreme power over civil service appointments both nationally and provinically. The Examination Commission is to set the time, place, and forms for examinees - including a temporary board of examinations. The Ministry of Personnel has been keeping records of office holders in accordance with the Kuomintang's ranking system of bureaucrats. However, this elongated bureaucracy favours those at the top, with those at the bottom ranks often unable to create a sustainable income.\n\nThe Control Yuan, designed to vet out corruption, has been overwhelmed with the expansion of the examination Yuan. With such a large government to administer, the COntrol Yuan is the supervisory and auditory branch of the government of the Republic of China. Theortically, it has the power to impeach government officials (not the President and Vice-President), censure officials, corrective measures, and it has the capacity to audit the annual budget. However, with the problem of corruption seemingly endemic in Chinese political society, many are just simply weighing towards moving the annual budget towards other measures while others are voicing for increased funding towards the Control Yuan."
 YUN.lategame.476.a: "More funding for the Examination Yuan."
 YUN.lategame.476.b: "More funding for the Control Yuan."
 YUN.lategame.476.c: "We need that money elsewhere."

 YUN.lategame.477.t: "4 Elements and 9 Principles of Education"
 YUN.lategame.477.d: "Chen Lifu, despite the ups and downs of his career, remains prominent as an educator. He has presented a bold, comprehensive proposal for adapting the educational system to wartime needs before an Extraordinary National Congress of the Kuomintang, offering 4 Elements and 9 Principles for guiding our educational reforms, as well as 17 ways of implementing it.\n\nThese elements are as follows: 1.) Revise education systems and teaching materials and pursue the wartime curricula 2.) Train personnel with different skills and assign them to suit wartime needs 3.) Emphasise the cultivation of national ethics, intensify scientific research, and expand scientific facilities 4.) Train the youth to serve society and further strengthen our capacity to fight the war of resistance\n\nThey are to be supported by nine principles 1.) Advance education by mental, physical and disciplinary means 2.) Combine the civil with the military 3.) Place similar emphasis on agrarian and industrial demands 4.) Have consistency in educational and political objectives 5.) Link education of family to school 6.) Use scientific methods to reorganise and teach literature, history, philosophy, and art to build national character based on Chinese tradition 7.) Increase natural sciences training to meet the pressing needs of national defence and production 8.) Revamp the social sciences to learn, suit our own national conditions, and encourage innovation 9.) Make clear our education goals, work to equalise education and training in different localities, make compulsory education universal for all, implement our social and family education programme.\n\nThe situation is grim, but the silver haired gentleman is undaunted in his efforts to reshape Chinese minds. The future does not wait for the youth to grow up, and if China is to survive these years of troubles, it must teach its youth how to navigate and overcome the challenges ahead."
 YUN.lategame.477.a: "The youth must learn fighting and discipline to survive."
 YUN.lategame.477.b: "Through science and production, students can build our future!"
 YUN.lategame.477.c: "Our future comrades must learn the Principles and public service!"

 YUN.lategame.478.t: "Learning Amid National Upheaval"
 YUN.lategame.478.d: "Chen Lifu, despite the ups and downs of his career, remains prominent as an educator. With the wars in China causing considerable disruption and the Japanese menace triggering an exodus of students and scholars westwards, he certainly has his work cut out for him. In his words, \"whereas a mining engineer's job is to discover and develop underground resources, an education administrator must discover and develop human resources. In America, education work is often referred to as ‘human engineering'.\"\n\nEven before the added hardship of war left the education system in shambles, foreign observers have observed that resource distribution in the Chinese education system is extremely uneven and many instructors are unqualified and utilising ineffective teaching methods like rote memorisation for complex problems. Chen has expressed further dismay that most advanced subjects are taught in foreign languages, reflecting pervasive foreign influence and further making technical education inaccessible to ordinary Chinese students.\n\nIn our brief interlude of relative peace, Chen has assembled hundreds of professors from different Universities in several major conferences to compile dozens of modernised syllabi and textbooks. The education ministry has also attempted to reduce overstaffing and lax standards in higher education facilities, dividing instructors into four ranks (professor, associate professor, lecturer, and teaching assistant) and insisting on certain qualifications for each.\n\nChen has also insisted on reclassifying classes as required or elective, demanding that institutions be established to research fertilisers, hog bristles, tung oil, tea, porcelain, and silk fabric, likely inspired by traditional Chinese economic theory but he maintains that it will help address the gap between Sun's National Economic Reconstruction plan and the education system. Less controversially he has set aside money for research subsidies and fellowships, as well as providing qualified Professors to go on sabbatical."
 YUN.lategame.478.a: "War displaced students must put aside their books and take up a rifle!"
 YUN.lategame.478.b: "To cope with shortages, we must focus on practical and traditional applications of lessons."
 YUN.lategame.478.c: "We must find money for qualified teachers and their projects!"

 YUN.lategame.479.t: "The BIS At Work"
 YUN.lategame.479.d: "The Kuomintang Central Organisation Department's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics has been hard at work under the auspices of Chen Lifu and his ever growing portfolio. In addition to their namesake investigation and clandestine intelligence gathering roles, the BIS also takes their auxiliary communication and counterintelligence functions seriously as well.\n\nThey pride themselves on operating several shortwave radio stations between cities surrounding the capital, pioneered by one American trained engineer named Li Fanyi, who specialises in shortwave electricity. This system of radio signalling is said to enhance government communications and may also have battlefield applications as well for communicating between military headquarters and the Presidential palace.\n\nIn support of their communications role, they have become quite proficient in code-breaking and operation security. Chen Lifu, who keeps a code book on him at all times, has personally developed a 5 stroke indexing system for Chinese characters that he has attempted to popularise both within government offices and the general public.\n\nThe BIS, and the CC Clique by extension, is known to operate various front organisations. The largest of which is the Zhengyuan Industrial Company (roughly translated, means Origin of Basic Industrial Company), a shell corporation that allows the CC Clique to move money around and conduct economic espionage. There are rumours that Chen Lifu's prized Chinese Engineering Association and their headquarters is also a front for CC Clique safehouses.\n\nThe BIS's activities have not gone completely unchecked however. Ding Mocun, head of the General Affairs Section, has recently been accused of corruption - his BSS rivals have demanded an investigation into expenditures related to securing prominent leftist defectors. While Ding maintains the accusations are politically motivated, his status as a former socialist who switched sides during the 1924 reorganisation has added to suspicion as does his reputation as an impulsive man."
 #NOTE: Zheng yuan shiye she (正元實業社) is the company in question, the academic source material uses \"Origin of Basic Industrial Company\"
 YUN.lategame.479.a: "Their work in communications unites the nation."
 YUN.lategame.479.b: "Codes and espionage help protect the party."
 YUN.lategame.479.c: "I think its time we examine their funding records."

 YUN.lategame.480.t: "A Model Police force for a Model China"
 YUN.lategame.480.d: "The Public Security Bureau has been making strides under Zhang Qun and Political Science Clique aligned lawmen. At the forefront of their public activities is the [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Police Academy, praised by [ROOT.GetLeader] as the model for all other Police Academies to follow. Over 350 young cadets of both genders are trained at the facility and receive both free housing and a generous monthly stipend.\n\nParamilitary in nature, their days open with bugle calls and flag ceremonies before a lengthy curriculum that includes swimming, jujitsu, military science, and political education under military officers and political commissars. Second year students are allowed to major in one of four areas: administration, criminal investigation, foreign services, and policewomen training and administration. Cadets are allowed to experience a tour of duty with the local police force during training, and upon graduation they are equipped with guns and modern automobiles.\n\nThough America's star may have waned, its influence can be felt in the Chinese police system. Nationalist police forces are said to be copying principles established by August Vollmer in California, cutting crime rates in half. Leading investigators have sought FBI expertise, imitating their fingerprinting and federal police methods.\n\nPerhaps the most elite police force however is the Chinese Military Police. Established as a separate branch of the National Revolutionary Army, it has achieved a reputation as being a Praetorian Guard for the President. Headed by Gu Zhenglun, dubbed \"the Father of the Gendarmerie\", his motto is \"do not lie, do not cheat, do your duty, and fulfil your responsibilities.\" A thorough expert on military law as well, their primary responsibility is to forestall a military coup."
 YUN.lategame.480.a: "We have nothing but praise for these excellent students and schools."
 YUN.lategame.480.b: "With modern investigators, organised crime should beware!"
 YUN.lategame.480.c: "The military police shall keep the military in line."

 YUN.lategame.481.t: "Power Struggle in the Tewu"
 YUN.lategame.481.d: "The Tewu may have had its start as the Second (Military) Section of the Party's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, but it has since grown far past its mother agency. With the help of foreign trained secret policemen, this secret service has divided their trainees into A, B, C, and Communication sections - each with about two or three dozen cadets undergoing a gruelling six month curriculum before acceptance as \"Basic Personnel\" in the Special Service Department.\n\nThe Section B cadets are police academy graduates slated to become the President's personal bodyguards. Meanwhile, the Section C students, made up of exclusively women, are instructed in haircutting and cooking in preparation to become \"cover personnel\". These agents are meant to arrange \"cover relations\" in Secret Service units.\n\nSection A are considered the \"backbone cadres\", nominally instructed personally by Li Shihzen (albeit with day to day instruction conducted by other officers). They are to learn special operations theory, secret codes and ciphers, chemical techniques for poison and communications, military geography, international espionage, political theory, tracking and tracing, explosives and demolition, stenography and speed writing, intelligence gathering, physiognomy, photography, jiu jitsu, Chinese boxing, automobile driving and horseback riding, and foreign languages - an advanced curriculum for the nation's most elite spies and assassins.\n\nTheir reputation and strength has grown so strong they now aim for total control over party investigative affairs. In addition they demand the abolishment of the Peace Preservation Corps and Gendarmes and for authority over all national policing, while also undermining the Three Principles of the Youth League's Intelligence branch. These moves, which have undermined other wings of the party have resulted in a joint effort to demand [ROOT.GetLeader] to seize the Special Services Department from Li Shizhen and redistribute its authority more evenly among the branches."
 YUN.lategame.481.a: "We ought to expand the Presidential Bodyguard."
 YUN.lategame.481.b: "Send out the Tewu to hunt down enemies of the revolution."
 YUN.lategame.481.c: "I think it is time we cut them down to size."

#Sino-Japanese War Events (490-499):
 YUN.lategame.490.t: "The [YUN_GetDeclarationLocation] Declaration"
 YUN.lategame.490.d: "\"If we give up even an inch of land and sovereignty, we will be the eternal sinners of the Chinese nation! At that time, we can only fight with the lives of the entire nation to seek our final victory. When it comes to the last moment, we can only fight with the lives of the entire nation to save the country. When the last moment comes, we have no choice but to sacrifice to the end and fight to the end. No matter where you are, no matter what age you are, male or female, everyone has the responsibility to defend the land and fight the war!\"\n\nWith a resounding cheer, the [YUN_GetDeclarationLocation] Declaration was read aloud to a crowd of onlookers by [ROOT.GetLeader], with cheers of \"Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!\"(Long live the Republic of China!) echoing. As the invaders now march onto Chinese soil, commiting unspeakable acts of terror amongst our long oppressed peoples - the time has come for every Chinese to join the national struggle and to save the Chinese race from eternal extermination. [ROOT.GetLeader] has already assumed the new war time position of Director General and [ROOT.GetSecondInCommand] has also followed suit by organising the National State Council in order to execute emergency and necessary military orders in an efficient manner without the burden of bureaucracy. By becoming Director General, [ROOT.GetLeader] now has parity with the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but with the situation increasingly desperate - difficult times call for a strong leader to lead China in her struggle.\n\nLet all patriotic Chinese men and women heed the call to defend their motherland, lest they watch their beloved country perish. Gun on shoulder, sabre at wrist - with a blood boiling like a wild tide, all patriotic men and women will serve their country today."
 YUN.lategame.490.a: "Concord between our government and people is the first essential to victory."
 YUN_GetDeclarationLocation_lushan: "Lushan"

 YUN.lategame.491.t: "Social Education"
 YUN.lategame.491.d: "Improving literacy in China is an ongoing battle that has confounded Chinese education reformers. The war has put another wrench in their plans, but despite this [ROOT.GetLeader] is determined to persevere. The party has ordered the construction of new libraries, museums and art galleries within friendly lines as part of their \"Social Education\" programme meant to allow the average civilian to learn about what it means to be Chinese.\n\nMinister of Education Chen Lifu has commissioned the National Institute of Dunhuang to study Buddhist sites and relics in the northwest, displaying their results at the Central Gallery of Arts. Continuing his plans, Chen has founded the National College for Social Education and the National Academy of Music, in order nurture the musical culture that would represent a moral and modern China. The programme will also hire those of backgrounds that would have normally been turned away, such as the destitute, homeless and women to finally be given a chance to be taught and use their new skill across the country to promote Chinese culture.\n\nChen Lifu has also worked and pushed for another programme called \"Education with electrical audiovisual aids\" using the methods popular in the west such as motion pictures and radio broadcasting to be used nationwide. This will also relate to a new set of days of festivals that would include a Drama Festival Day, Art Festival Day, Broadcasting Festival Day, Music Festival day and a Sports Festival Day, to encourage and grow the culture of modern China for days to come.\n\nSome have criticised Chen for creating a form of \"thought control\", to which he has furiously denied. He argues that the Marxists regularly spread their propaganda to the public for their own gain, and protecting a nation's culture is a fundamental task of a modern government."
 YUN.lategame.491.a: "Bright new minds for a bright future!"

 YUN.lategame.492.t: "The Office of Moral Teachings"
 YUN.lategame.492.d: "The outbreak of the war of Resistance has not stopped Chen Lifu and the Ministry of Education's tireless efforts to indoctrinate the youth into loyal party cadres. He has formed the Office of Moral Teachings with the intention of supporting youth learning despite the emergency, designed to mentor and support college students throughout the crisis.\n\nAnd they certainly need it. Even before the war, it was commonly said the \"unemployment awaits graduation\" and that \"when there is one more student in school, society loses a producer; when there is one more graduate from school, society gains another unemployed\". But the outbreak of the war ironically has opened up many jobs, which the office has sought to fill by encouraging recent graduates or those with their education disrupted to take on these patriotic tasks.\n\nFor students continuing school, a student affairs branch has been authorised to aid in overseeing student loans, debt relief, medical care and the military conscription process. All the while, they are charged with monitoring student activity and ensure young men and women are not \"led astray by wrong thinking and end up hindering the war effort\" as Chen Lifu writes.\n\nTo further reduce the burden, Chen Lifu has tried to streamline education as well. Existing Chinese universities tend to prefer the American system of regular and term end exams, with students earning credits for graduation. While perhaps useful in America, with constant disruptions in China most observers have advised swapping to the European method of no exams during the school year and one final graduation exam. The education ministry has elected to do both - giving credits earned by term exams but also having a graduation exam as well."
 YUN.lategame.492.a: "Teaching them the way to victory."

 YUN.lategame.493.t: "The Conscription Debate"
 YUN.lategame.493.d: "China has an enormous population, but the sheer scale of the war and the declining number of volunteers has triggered major debates over conscription. The Military Affairs Commission has presented their case for a widespread draft, first proposed by He Yingqin presciently in 1928. According to his plan, all houses will be surveyed across a year, then the next year a list of all eligible men would be created. Men would be drawn according to the Baojia system, with recruits annually sent to training camps where they serve as militia-men for three years full-time and then six years as \"inactives\", staying in the reserves until age 40.\n\nThis militia system is supposed to be based on He Yingqin's observations in Japan and some systems pioneered by the New Guangxi Clique. The emphasis is on equality, with \"Three Equals of Conscription\" being that conscripts should be selected without consideration for background, with the burden levied on all provinces equally based on population, and fairly by officials. They have sought to implement reforms to attract younger, more qualified Baojia officers from traditionally reluctant gentrymen: reimbursing them for their service, exempting them from other duties, providing free education for children of servicemen, and reducing taxes on those actively serving.\n\nIn practice, conscription has fallen short of the egalitarian principles that have been promised. Stories of forced conscription at gunpoint and violent abductions of conscripts have proliferated. Many Whampoa young guard officers protest the dilution of the army with low quality militia as well.\n\nThe education ministry has argued for draft deferments, stating that China has plenty of manpower but very limited college educated individuals. Chen Lifu has proposed four elemental policies, first that those who want to fight will be released by the ministry, those unfit for military service should continue their education, those already in school should respond to the government's call once their term is complete, and any youth not serving in the army must go to school."
 YUN.lategame.493.a: "We lean towards the Ministry of Education's Plan."
 YUN.lategame.493.b: "The Military Affairs Commission's Plan is best."

##KMT Satellite Narrative Events (500-539)
 YUN.lategame.500.t: "The Malformed Decapitation"
 YUN.lategame.500.d: "A grand wave of merriment and jubiliation has set foot across the nation! For the White Sun has finally eradicated the vile stewards of the failed Beiyang Republic's legacy from the nation's Northern Capital. The bugles have begun to sound even as far as [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. For others within the province it is a time of celebration, for Li Genyuan and Zhu Peide, it is the time for action.\n\nHaving long withstanded the influence of Tang Jiyao's traitorous lieutenant, Hu Ruoyu, in part due to his representation as the forefront of Yunnan's conservative influence and due to the sizeable force under his control, such an agreement has ultimately met its end. Or as was presumed. Attempting to complete their final consolidation of the Southwest, the Provincial Kuomintang duo attempted to oust Hu in the triumph, mobilising Li Mi's forces to rapidly encircle Hu and request his surrender.\n\nHowever, tipped off in advance, Hu managed to circumnavigate Li's advance, causing a minor rebellion in the south from his seat of power in Mengzi. Supported by the gentry and merchants, this rebellion led by the regional elite is but merely the last major obstacle for the White Sun to encompass the whole Southwest, from mountainous peak to unravelling chasm."

 YUN.lategame.501.d: "In the unravelling situation following Hu Ruoyu's Mengzi Rebellion, it would appear that the other plotters situated within the shadows of the White Sun have not sad idly by. General Chen Cheng, amassing influence in light of the fall of He Yingqin within the Whampoa Clique, has finally showcased his steadily building hand.\n\nExploiting the situation and overthrowing fellow Kuomintang comrade and Guizhou Governor Zhang Qun, Chen's gambit has succeeded with little difficulty. Rallying their forces under Xiong Shihui and Zhang Qun, Political Science has begun a rapidly composed evacuation to Yunnan province from Guizhou. Allowing Civil Engineering to briefly consolidate, both Chen and Zhang have arrived at the same conclusion: Whampoa would be unable to survive once General Zhu Peide recovers his position in Yunnan.\n\nIf Hu Ruoyu's Mengzi Rebellion is put down swiftly enough to enable the Third Army to sweep their forces eastward, they would undoubtedly re-assert their de-facto control over Guizhou province. In response to such a manoeuvre, Chen Cheng and Luo Zhuoying have begun to redirect their forces to advance on Kunming from the northeast, attempt to secure the whole Southwest himself. In turn, they begun to pursue Political Science's formations, as to prevent any harrying attacks."

 YUN.lategame.502.d: "With the situation swiftly deteriorating both within the south and northeast, Zhu Peide's personal amassing of loyalists and allies have effectively become boxed-in. Having allocated the majority of the Third Army to forward positions against Hu Ruoyu in the south, there remains very little potential defenders available to blunt Chen Cheng's advance.\n\nUltimately even the defenders that persist are but a paltry shade of the pride of the NRA. Mostly composed of demoralised PSC units under Zhang Qun and Xiong Shihui, many have only freshly retreated from Guizhou. Focused first and foremost on their own force preservation, their hold on Zhaotong is far from assured.\n\nConvening a war council of his senior staff, Zhu Peide has consulted with Li Genyuan, Zhu De, Jin Handing and Fan Shisheng as to the best approach to solve their predicament. Alas they have become loosely split upon three camps:\n\nZhu Peide for his part desires to press against Hu Ruoyu in Mengzi, eliminating the threat in the south before wheeling back to fight Chen Cheng's advance in a rapid campaign, even at the expense of PSC forces. On the opposite end, Li has proposed to redeploy units to Zhaotong from the backlines in Mengzi, blunting the advance of the First Army with enough force to launch a counterattack. Clearly such a move most benefits Li politically as he preserves Zhang Qun's forces, strengthening the PSC.\n\nPlaying spoiler before an argument could brew between Li and Zhu, General Zhu De has courteously proposed to his senior commanders of his own plan. Instead of launching any offensive, the Third Army pulls back all forces, including Li Mi in the south and Zhang Qun in the north, to defensible positions and request the Central Government to demand Chen Cheng to stand down.\n\nWith Jin and Fan remaining on the fence, their opinions would undoubtedly sway the overall outcome of the meeting. With all plans having their merits, faults, and political machinations behind their creation, neither are a surefire way to success. However it has become evidently clear that Jin is in crisis, torn between his friendship, his mentor, and his superior."

 YUN.lategame.503.d: "No matter the plan of attack derived from Zhu Peide's war council, the outcome has been further confounded by the outbreak of a rebellion in Luliang. Heralded by various rural socialist insurgent groups that have remained active in Yunnan since the Northern Expedition, they are a different beast compared to those that persisted within MinGan. Whilst MinGan's insurgents frequently cooperated with bandits in their revolutionary struggle, Yunnan's insurgents have often cooperated with sympathetic district officials and other establishment stalwarts.\n\nLuliang County, just to the east of Kunming and to the south of Qujing, is home to a large ratio of students. In a rather ambitious operation led by Wang Desan, he has managed to recruit Xiong Congzhu and other local magistrates seeking to check the power of gentry militias, many of whom are rebelling in favour of Hu Ruoyu to the south.\n\nUltimately their plan revolves around a coordinated attack on a list of \"despotic gentry\" within Yunnan such as Sun Yushan, a major landowner who had successfully united many Baojia militias under his umbrella, and Yang Daofeng who is said to control everything that happens in districts through a web of unofficial connections. Their efforts to assassinate Sun and Yang immediately failed however, leaving the revolt in a lurch. With the relative isolation of the region resulting in the rallying of popular support to be difficult, the chaos with Hu's rebellion and Chen's advance has allowed their revolt to persevere.\n\nMurmurs amount within the New Yunnan Society of prospective plans to enlist the help of Zhu De and other sympathetic officers in the Third Army for heavier firepower, or even to possibly reach out to Chen Cheng's Civil Engineering, relying on his purported reformist credentials. Coordinating between either option is not an easy task however, in conjunction with the already fraught situation between the rebellion's core. Nonetheless Wang's paltry rebellion has blown a hole in Kunming's lines that is undoubtedly hard to fill."

 YUN.lategame.504.d: "With chaos rapidly surmounting and seizing Yunnan province, unrest has become a matter of daily life within the provincial capital. Considerable anarchy has embroiled the streets of Kunming, particularly in light of Zhu Peide's best divisions' departure from the city. Radical students and urban labour unions alike have risen up in \"defence of the revolution\", and began to clash with the merchant elite in Kunming who they accuse of being a subversive force in league with Hu Ruoyu and his Mengzi commercial clans.\n\nIn response the Yunnan Chamber of Commerce has accused Zhu De and his allies, such as Tang Huaiyuan and Zeng Wanzhong, of seeking a socialist coup through alleged ties to the socialist radicals within the capital. Whilst it is true that Zhu is sympathetic to the radicals, he has repeatedly sworn his loyalty to Zhu Peide as his subordinate, and most importantly, friend.\n\nOther commanders within the Third Army, such as the ambitious Fan Shisheng, and reasonable Jin Handing have reacted as typical of their wildcard status. Sympathetic to socialism and Zhu De's best friend, Jin Handing has been shackled between his loyalty to Zhu Peide as his superior and his own personal morals. On the other hand, Fan Shisheng has remained aloof, awaiting the most beneficial deal for himself, perhaps even the restoration of his 16th Army.\n\nInternally, Zhu Peide has insisted against the Chamber's accusations, believing himself that Zhu De's loyalty is assured despite potential evidence to the contrary. On the opposite end, Li Genyuan has pushed for the leftists to utterly stand down, insinuating that they pose a critical threat to the provincial administrations regime. Simultaneously, he has proposed a conciliatory attitude towards the Chamber of Commerce to maintain fiscal responsiblity. It has become evidently clear to most that old wounds are reopening between Li and Zhu..."

 YUN.lategame.505.d: "In their ever triumphant and steadfast advance from Guizhou onwards towards Kunming, it would appear that Chen Cheng's Whampoa Clique has managed to cross the border successfully, finally reaching Zhaotong. Setting up siege preparations to take the city from the defenders, it would appear that events within Chen Cheng's camp are unfolding rapidly too. Many of the more cautious and apprehensive officers within his coterie, such as Qian Dajun, Jiang Dingwen, and most furiously Guan Linzheng, have proven to be vocal opposition to Chen's determined march. Fearing that the First Army has become overextended, and is losing their direction, the opposition officers have formed a considerable bloc, delaying any advance.\n\nFurthermore Chen's Civil Engineering broad tent has begun to endure a significant amount of strain due to its multi-faceted and almost contradictory nature. Counting both rightists, such as Wei Lihuang, or the remnants of He Yingqin's Whampoa Clique alongside the likes of self-proclaimed \"Socialists at Heart\" such as Chen Cheng, a minor murmur of infighting has begun to develop. Confounding with this is the nature of various Guizhou Cliques that joined up with the General, who have increasingly grown strained with Chen due to not agreeing to what appears to be a desperate gambit to Kunming.\n\nIn terms of policy, the internal factions are even more frayed. For the leftists, they seek to align with the likes of Wang Desan's New Yunnan Society and their Luliang Rebellion, hoping to bring down both Hu Ruoyu and Kunming. To the contrary, the various rightists within Chen's camp sincerely hope to come to an arrangement with Zhu Peide and the Third Army, all while General Chen insists upon maintaining force cohesion."

Loosely brought together by their opposition against the Kuomintang, but otherwise at each other's throats, Hu Ruoyu's southern gentry coalition has begun to expand his operatons. Aiming to influence western Yunnan, a traditionally radical hotbed willing to buck the influence of Kunming, Hu has begun to engage in negotiations with the majority of the more conservative and reactionary gentry that reside there.\n\nWithin Hu's direct staff, many are advising the general to approach the crisis diplomatically, scooping up support of Yunnan's establishment to return the province to the isle of stability it once was. Others have suggested that Hu should pursue an offensive policy of open confrontation with the Kuomintang radicals, aiming to quickly destroy the Kuomintang regime whilst their infighting is at its worst.\n\nTo strengthen Hu's resolve and position further, many if his aides have begun to tap into contacts across Yunnan, such as the Chamber of Commerce, and outside the province to the outside world. Establishing covert ties with potential allies in Siam, Burma and Indochina, Hu's position has in turn been strengthened with material and aid, if only for promises down the road.\n\nNonetheless, Yunnan's civil war remains anyone's game, with Hu Ruoyu, Zhu Peide and Chen Cheng all engaging in nigh self-destructive last-ditch gambits to secure their control over the province.

 YUN.lategame.510.t: "Zhu De's Coup"
 YUN.lategame.510.d: "Truly Kunming is in a precarious situation. Beset by rebellion and offensive alike, it would appear that not even the capital's geography would prevent the onslaught from Hu Ruoyu or Chen Cheng. And yet, hemmed in from all sides, neither opponent could topple Zhu Peide, Zhu De or Li Genyuan's holdouts. With Hu Ruoyu lacking the strength to march on Kunming much akin to his superior Tang Jiyao a decade ago, his advances have proven to be thoroughly blunted. In the North, despite Chen Cheng's successful seizure of Zhaotong from the Third Army loyalists destabilising Zhu Peide's legitimacy, his forces have nonetheless lost their momentum as they swiftly approached the fortified capital. In light of this, and amongst the shadows, radical conspirators within Kunming began to mobilise.\n\nBacked by socialist cadres, labour agitators, and student radicals within the city, the left-wing military officers of the Third Army under Zhu De's auspices swiftly entered the Governor's palace in Kunming. Staging their coup against Zhu Peide and Li Genyuan, their endeavour quickly found the backing of Jin Handing and Fan Shisheng, two \"rightist\" officers in the Yunnan Kuomintang that nevertheless were always open to leftist cooperation.\n\nOstensibly meant to rid Zhu Peide of Li Genyuan's influence, it has rather uncontrollably escalated to Zhu Peide's outright removal from office altogether. In Zhu Peide's place, Zhang Bojun, a representative from the central government, has been \"recommended\" as Governor by the local junta, receiving his formal appointment from the Central Committee shortly afterwards.\n\nChen Cheng has rather curiously elected to stand down, withdrawing to Guizhou to consolidate his Governorship. As for Hu Ruoyu? His days are numbered, as it has become evidently clear that his forces will be annihilated in the coming advance. Similarly, the fate of Political Science is perfidy, as they once more become pariahs. However there remains one question on everyone's mind. What is there to be done with Zhu Peide?"

 YUN.lategame.511.d: "The revolutionaries in the Kuomintang have evidently worn out their welcome in Yunnan as Hu Ruoyu's forces surged from Mengzi to Kunming with little resistance. The overstretched Third Army garrisons were rapidly overrun, a process accelerated by an uprising in the city organised by General Lu han, a staff officer under Long Yun, who avenged his relative and avoided the need for a long siege.\n\nThe vaunted Whampoa Spirit proved to be little more than talk as Chen Cheng's forces were destroyed assaulting Old Dian Clique positions. After regrouping their forces, Hu Ruoyu and Lu Han were able to capture Guizhou after routing their opponents. While the two nominally retain their Kuomintang membership and profess their absolute loyalty to the revolution, the party's true faithful have been driven out of the Southwest.\n\nThe ensuing political situation has been tense. While the central government has been too preoccupied to be concerned with Southwestern Affairs and have refrained from commenting on the situation, ironically the lack of an external threat has destabilised the province. Tang Jiyao is an absolute persona non-grata to the KMT, but Long Yun's is more divisive. The Kunming garrison and provincial elders briefly installed him as Governor, but clashes between him and his long-time rival Hu Ruoyu (who now has the upper hand) caused them to trade accusations of counterrevolutionary behavior.\n\nLong hoped to shore up his failing position by counting on the support of Lu Han, whose forces are slowly trickling back from Guizhou. But General Lu decided to make a fateful decision - coming to an agreement with Hu Ruoyu behind his back and agreeing to accept Hu as Governor to avoid further conflict. Long Yun, invited to participate in the planned junta, has left Kunming for Zhaotong - unwilling to be a figurehead and hoping for more favorable winds in the future."

 YUN.lategame.512.t: "Chen Cheng Seizes Kunming"
 YUN.lategame.512.d: "In a daring manoeuvre Chen Cheng and the First Army have proven the value of their Whampoa training. Ensuring their principal's lessons were not lost or forgotten, their daring descent from Guizhou onwards towards the southwest's capital has been that of legend. Reminiscent of their Long March in light of the Northern Expedition's collapse, General Chen's own escapade was not one driven by fear or sorrow, but that of duty, spirit and honour.\n\nOverthrowing the Political Science Clique's rule in Guizhou through an elegant but expertly enacted coup, the First Army successfully followed Zhang Qun and Xiong Shihui's soldiers to Zhaotong and crushed the PSC armies.\n\nWith momentum on their side, the demoralised garrison in Kunming put only a token defence against Chen's triumphant advance into the fortified city. Spared from a prolonged siege, the majority of Kunming remained in-tact. However during Chen's advance outside the walls, a palace coup occurred led by the leftist contingent within the Third Army, notably Zhu De, Tang Huaiyuan and Zeng Wanzhong. Joined by Zhu De's best friend Jin Handing and General Fan Shisheng, the Third Army dissenters successfully detained the discredited Zhu Peide, Li Genyuan and Zhang Qun.\n\nCaught in the chaos, Hu Ruoyu attempted to launch his own advance from Mengzi to capitalise on the confrontation within Kunming. Notably low on intelligence however, Hu's forces were all but annihilated despite their superior arms due to the combined offensive of the Third Army and First Army.\n\nAs the dust settles, tensions still remain. With the leftists within Yunnan and Guizhou split on policy in the aftermath, numerous issues have arisen. Zhu De and Jin Handing for their part desire Zhu Peide's release from prison, insisting that he simply didn't do anything wrong, and that the counter-revolutionary actions of the old regime were at the behest of Li Genyuan. Chen Cheng himself desires a total reorganisation of Yunnan and Guizhou, ostensibly to consolidate power and thoroughly \"eliminate corruption\", and the New Yunnan Society continues to rally for immediate action."

 YUN.lategame.513.d: "Once again thrust into the nightmare of bloodshed, the city of Zhaotong has recently been the crux of defence for the Kunming administration. Much akin to the previous Yunnan-Guizhou war, and already devastated and in recovery from that conflict, Zhaotong was placed under siege by an invading force descended from Guizhou, aiming for the heart of the southwest. However that is where the events cease to reflect eachother, as this time Yunnan proved valiantly victorious. With the First Army's forces beaten back following a blunder by Jiang Dingwen, Chen Cheng has been pushed to order a retreat, nominally in disgrace.\n\nEmboldened by their successes, Zhu Peide's forces under Li Mi launched a determined, courageous, and somewhat suicidal assault against Hu Ruoyu's mustering gentry forces within the south. Characteristic of Li Mi's harsh, chaotic, and rowdy command of the battlefield, Hu Ruoyu's forces were caught blindsided by Li's rapid assault. Reportedly Li's artillery destroyed Hu's fortifications at almost point blank range, and purposefully led a few of his division to be encircled. Believing that he had won, Hu's forces rushed in to capture or kill Li and his men, and yet they were met with a tenacity unbeknownst to encircled soldiers. Beaten back, they would be encircled themselves by the outer ring of Li's forces, and promptly captured.\n\nHaving kept the castle from being besieged by invaders, Zhu Peide and Li Genyuan remain the masters of China's southwest. Resupplying Zhang Qun and Xiong Shihui's forces, Zhu has dispatched the Political Science stalwarts to Guiyang to negotiate the surrender of Chen Cheng's first army. In a similar vein, Wang Desan's rebellion has all been but crushed in the meantime.\n\nA most curious matter has presented itself however. That is, to decide the fate of the rebellious attempted usurpers. Should Zhu and Li be the better men, attempting to reconcile with Hu Ruoyu and his staff? Should they grant an olive branch to Chen Cheng, in the sake of Party unity? Or should they do away with both rabblerousers, as they have proven their devilish nature."

Most disturbingly are those events that are currently unfolding within Yunnan and Guizhou province. Held together in an awkward power sharing agreement between Governor Zhu Peide of Yunnan and Governor Zhang Qun of Guizhou, both governors had their own respective local power players to manage. For Zhu, it was the New Yunnan Society, the Third Army Leftists, and the establishment under General Hu Ruoyu. For Zhang it was the last vestiges of the First Army of the National Revolutionary Army, led by Chen Cheng in light of He Yingqin's downfall. Attempting to cement their control over the nation, Zhu Peide and Li Genyuan intended to eject Hu Ruoyu from the province, however following his escape to Mengzi, Chen Cheng would launch his own coup in Guizhou to depose Zhang.

 YUN.lategame.530.d: "The Central Government has fallen, throwing Kuomintang loyalists into disarray. The Southwestern Committees have always been fairly autonomous entities, but even they are struggling to stomach the collapse as many others have surrendered to our advancing foes. Most of the old central government's leadership have fled abroad rather than be at the mercy of \"petty warlords\", and [ROOT.GetLeader] for his part has moved to seize control as acting Chairman.\n\nHe faces a difficult challenge turning the tide, as his generals struggle to integrate other NRA units and many demoralised soldiers melt into the countryside, leaving \"ghost\" brigades and divisions. The economy has also been thrown into chaos as well as doubt rises over our ability to pay our debts.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, there is considerable jockeying for power. Though Zhu Peide and his allies currently are in control of the Southwest, Hu Ruoyu has sought the support of the Yunnan gentry for a putsch while leftist generals such as Chen Cheng and Zhu De have manoeuvred to undermine Zhu Peide's leadership.

Greater political power comes with greater expectations and the new government is now on the hook for debt repayments, reconstructing devastated areas, and reorganising the now overstretched military. Furthermore, there is considerable jockeying for power.

 YUN.lategame.540.t: "An All Too Familiar Face"
 YUN.lategame.540.d: "Despite their triumphant successes in the Yunnan Civil War, the actions of both Zhu Peide and Li Genyuan in the crisis have brought to light the increasingly fraught nature of the Zhu-Li diarchy. Naturally, bad blood of the past was sure to arise given their now nigh total dominance as Kings of the Southwest. Earlier, during the times of the Yunnan Army in Guangdong, Li and Zhu were once superior and subordinate. Serving alongside the likes of Li Liejun, Yang Ximin, Liu Zhenhuan, Fan Shisheng, and Zhang Kairu. With Zhu having long been the most loyal to Dr. Sun out of the whole Yunnan Army in Guangdong, he would ultimately side with Li Liejun during the Liejun-Genyuan power struggle. With Genyuan taking an anti-Sun stance, and insisting upon cooperation with Old Guangxi as opposed to Tang Jiyao, he would be driven out by his subordinates.\n\nAnd it would appear once more that such an atmosphere has risen, with Li's continued attempts to increase his power be it directly, and through the utilisation of the gentry and Political Science Clique. With their heroes in the form of Zhang Qun and Hu Ruoyu driven from power, Li has accepted their support with open arms. Certainly not helping matters in any form, considering Li's already despised nature by the mainstream Party.\n\nTheir most recent spat however is that of the duo's different approaches to ruling Yunnan without the need to parley with local power players. Zhu Peide, ever a loyal servant to the Party, insists upon Yunnan being a cog in the National Revolution. A stepping stone and a model for the rest of the Kuomintang's journey. Li himself instead advocates for Yunnan to focus their efforts on local reconstruction, seeing to the provincial people's needs, working with the establishment, and building a stronger province for everyone."
 YUN.lategame.540.a: "Li is right, Yunnan needs its alms."
 YUN.lategame.540.b: "Zhu's spirit carries the day!"

 YUN.lategame.541.t: "A Kuomintang Bastion in the Southwest"
 YUN.lategame.541.d: "Amusingly enough, despite their pitfals, continuous bickering, their political machinations and bad history, Li Genyuan and Zhu Peide have truly constructed their own little empire in the Southwest. Thoroughly integrating Guizhou into the fold of Yunnan, the Revolutionary Diarchy of the Southwest has amassed under their de-facto control a significant portion of the nation. Supporting both substantial financial power, as well as a fairly promising army reminiscent of Yunnan's integral status as the power-broker of the whole South of China.\n\nAlthough their policy is not always concise, or mutually agreed upon, they nonetheless have carried forth a fairly stable administration that has improved the lives of many. With their internal power and borders secure, both men have begun discussions as to where they shall direct Yunnan's recently rediscovered prominence. Perhaps they shall prepare to build the province as a contender for national power in its own right, or focus on defending Yunnan and the National Revolution against those that would see it trampled upon. Either way, the game is theirs to play."

 YUN.lategame.542.d: "Having achieved his coup de grâce, \"Generalissimo\" Chen Cheng's ambitions have only been furthered by his newly expanded domain. Not only King of Guizhou, but that of Yunnan and the whole Southwest, Chen has the backing of Central Committee with all the merits and detriments that entails. Immediately set upon transforming his nation, Chen has begun with the territory under his direct control. Believing that in order to gain popular support to fight radicals such as the syndicalists, or conservatives such as the gentry and warlords, the Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army had to demonstrate its innate concern for the rural masses.\n\nEndeavouring to make revolutionary and sweeping reforms to alleviate the perennial suffering of the common man, Chen has aimed to upend the existing economic and social structure of China. Whilst it would consequently destroy much of the existing wealth of establishment figures, most pertinently the Chamber of Commerce, he has seen it a fit and necessary sacrifice for national salvation.\n\nBy lowering rent from 60-70% of the annual crop harvest to 37% alongside the lowering of interest rates to 20%, Chen hopes to set the initial groundwork for further developments of his economic programme. Through a programme of rationing, bartering, and public distribution of commodities, Chen hopes to stabilise prices and the raging inflation the nation is experiencing.\n\nFurthermore drawing inspiration from his first mentor Deng Yanda, Chen similarly believes that China is in a state of pre-capitalistic semi-feudalism, that the revolution necessitates the masses and national capitalism. Through doctrinal guidance under the Three Principles, implementation of Chen's own programs and similar ones such as Land to the Tiller, whilst maintaining ties with the petty bourgeoisie and military men. Ambitious yet undeterred, Chen's experimental programme hopes to secure the favour of the masses, spur on progress, and prevent the creation of too many enemies within the gentry."

 YUN.lategame.542.b: "Chen's reforms shall foment the National Revolution!"

 YUN.lategame.543.t: "\"Tu-Mu\" Presses On"
 YUN.lategame.543.d: "For too long, at least in Chen Cheng's eyes, has the Kuomintang been infested with corrupt civil servants, bureaucratic sloths, self-serving kleptocrats and all of those inbetween. For where is the revolutionary purity? Where is the devotion to the National Revolution and to the common man? To their needs, to their alms, to the advancement of the Three Principles and a brighter future for all? All of that has been washed down the drain of selfish self-interest without harmony or desire. Producing an antidote and administering it is but merely child's play for the \"Little Generalissimo\" however.\n\nIntent on purifying the party both in ideology and revolutionary practice, Chen has drafted plans for a second, limited, reorganisation of the party. Whilst far from spanning or even reaching the Central Executive Committee, Yunnan and Guizhou would at least be completely revolutionised by his efforts. Cadres would be forced into compliance with the Three Principles, and judged not on connection but true merit. In a similar vein, Chen has constructed plans to implement the \"Three Principles of the People Youth League\", at least some time in the future. Hoping to not only purify the party of the present, but implement his revolutionary ideology into the party of the future, Chen endeavours for the youth to similarly participate in the decision making of national policy.\n\nThat is not all for the ever ambitious General, as behind the curtain various machinations of even greater manoeuvres and flourishes of the sabre at play. Much satisfied with his current position, there's murmurs within Civil Engineering that General Chen is capable of so much more. Of fulfilling the destiny bestowed upon him by his revolutionary mentors. Perhaps he shall march out from Kunming, protecting the revolution forged by his own blood."

 YUN.lategame.543.b: "Chen has a legacy to fulfill..."

 YUN.lategame.544.t: "Socialist Flowers Bloom in the Southwest"
 YUN.lategame.544.d: "Perhaps a most fortuitous but unexpected outcome of the recent Yunnan Civil War, and the hoisting of the Red Banner within Kunming after decades of struggle, is that of the blooming literature scene. Whilst always home to various philosophers of all political creeds, the Southwest has nonetheless been a traditionally conservative area of much hesitancy to the concepts of socialism. Yet with the recent leftist takeover, Yunnan and Guizhou have become something of a socialist writing utopia. Attracting not only philosophers, but artists, musicians, and theorists.\n\nPerhaps most related to the field of politics would be that of Ai Siqi, a Yunnan-Mongol native, and devoted socialist philosopher and theorist. Studying in Japan, teaching himself German, and ultimately working for Shen Bao newspaper, Ai would join the CSP in 1935. A devoted, young, and collected writer, he has already won some repute for his publishing of Popular Philosophy in 1935. Similarly, Ai himself is friends with the likes of Shen Junru, and other CDL figures.\n\nOther notable individuals that have risen to prominence are the likes of Nier Er, a famous musician and composer. Having contributed to many recent films, national music, and considered a pioneer of China's new music movement. There is also Wu Deng, famed local student leader within the Yunnan United Student Organisation. A local feminist and radical socialist leader, she was once the schoolmate of the late Long Yun's wife, Li Peilian, and even managed to maintain some sort of rapport with Tang Jiyao's lieutenant.\n\nFinally, there is Zhang Bojian. A member of the Bai minority, he travelled to France on a Work-Study agreement. Friends with the likes of Zhou Enlai, Zhang endeavoured to spread the word of socialism to Chinese students, attaining a high theoretical and practical understanding of socialism following the French Revolution.\n\nTruly, Yunnan has transformed itself from the black spot of the nation, full of conservatism with scant reflections of reformist attitudes to that of socialism's cornucopia within China, a flourishing intellectual battleground full of debate, and the furthering of the nation. Of course, Yunnan could always be so much more..."
 YUN.lategame.544.a: "Forevermore shall Yunnan harbour Socialism!"
 YUN.lategame.544.b: "We shall fulfill our revolutionary duty!"

 YUN.lategame.545.t: "The Guangming Daily"
 YUN.lategame.545.d: "For as long as anyone can remember, Zhang Bojun has always been a figure much admired and detested. Hated by his own party for being a leftist by the right wing, and for being a rightist by the left wing, Zhang has found limited solace in his own comrades; scant a few strong friendships, such as his personal one with Chen Mingshu, and Zhu De. However a certain sect of the Chinese political sphere has always welcomed Zhang and his efforts with at least admiration, if not support. Personal friends with the likes of Zhang Junmai, Shen Junru and others, Zhang has surprisingly managed to win token support from figures of the new generation of Third Force Democrats.\n\nSimilarly, on Zhang's end, he has recently been noted to have attended multiple meetings with various China Democratic League figures, keen to parley with them for a common goal. Offering a provincial political alliance, Zhang and his CDL friends would appear to be building a broad bloc of democratic reformist socialism within the southwest, at least as espoused by their Guangming Daily articles.\n\nOf course such efforts are not merely homely ones, intended for pure compromise. They serve a dual function, the stabilisation of Zhang's administration, and the fervent display that Zhang is not like his contemporaries within the Kuomintang, treating the Dangwai with suspicion. Instead, Zhang sees it fit to utilise his informal alliance as a weapon and tool, to advance a common progressive cause in the southwest. However some have begun to suggest to the Governor that he should be looking far beyond his idealistic purview of Yunnan-Guizhou, and instead aim for the national level."

 YUN.lategame.550.t: "Advance of the National Protectors"
 YUN.lategame.550.d: "With the nation on the brink of a civil war, [YUN.GetLeader] has rushed to reassert calm and leadership in [YUN.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In a grand ceremony before a crowd of hand-selected supporters and journalists, [YUN.GetAdjective] officials denounced the Central Committee's government as corrupt, tyrannical, and revisionist, brushing off accusations of treason by arguing that it was the Chairman who betrayed the ideals of Dr. Sun. The event concluded with a formal proclamation rejecting the Central Committee and calls for a new one to be established by loyal comrades.\n\nThe festivities could do little to hide the worry creeping into even the highest ranks of the administration. [YUN.GetLeader] has made a bold gamble, rebelling against the Central Government. The recent crisis within the upper party echelons has shaken the Central Committee's political legitimacy, but it is unlikely to fundamentally alter the calculus on the battlefield. Despite [YUN.Leader]'s exhortations, there have been no high level internal defections, even as the Central Committee's Congress cracks down on dissidents from within. The [YUN.GetAdjective] rebels can only hope others on the fringes join in the revolt, but it is no guarantee. As the artillery roars and infantry scramble into position, the fate of China will likely be determined far from Kunming's halls of power."
 YUN.lategame.550.a: "We've done it once before..."

 YUN.lategame.551.t: "Kunming Seizes the Reins"
 YUN.lategame.551.d: "Kunming has long been within the periphery and outside rung of the Kuomintang's revolutionary movement. Whilst never directly controlled by the party itself, the city, and by extension the province, has commonly found itself in similar circles and even in lockstep. Ranging from Cai E and Li Genyuan's Double Ninth Uprising (in which a plethora of future Yunnanese Kuomintang memebrs would participate), or the legendary National Protection War in which Yunnan rallied the cause of numerous neighbouring provinces to vanquish Yuan Shikai's proliferation of a new Hongxian Era. However, Yunnan has also commonly found itself in odds with the Party more often than most. With Cai E's refusal to participate in the Second Revolution of 1913, or Tang Jiyao's consistent machinations over control of the Revolutionary Movement, and of Guangdong and Guangxi.\n\nTherefore it is rather unsurprising to find that the regionalist kingpin of the Southwest managed to subvert the ostenible rule of the mainstream revolutionary hubs, and march ever onwards to vanquishing the Kuomintang's Central Committee, sweeping away the old order in utter triumph. Those within the personal inner circle of [YUN.GetLeader] and the [YUN.GetRulingParty] understood that they never truly had any intention of utterly eradicating their once benevolent benefactors, and yet history has thrust them into the role of National Protector once more.\n\nWith the old government gone, few can feasibly oppose the titanic rise of the Kuomintang's Periphery, but their leadership still remains contested. Not by the Party on the open field, but by the people, by the demobilised, and by the economy. Warlords on the outside nonwithstanding. Whether or not [YUN.GetLeader] has a blissfully quick path to national unification or if there will be further conflicts over the fulfillment of the National Revolution will shape China for years to come."

#UPC Fall of Beijing Event Chain (600-629):
 YUN.lategame.600.t: "Cai E's Crusade Completed"
 YUN.lategame.600.d: "Almost a generation ago, Cai E declared independence from Yuan Shikai's so called \"Empire of China\", leading several southern provinces to oppose his coronation as the Hongxian Emperor and plunging the nation into civil war. The ensuing southern governments failed to complete this mission to free the nation from Beiyang tyranny, until today - when Yunnan's Armies finally seized control of China's ancient capital.\n\nThe consequences of renewed civil war have been dire. Lives and livelihoods have been lost in the fighting. Thousands of families have been displaced by moving armies, and the armies themselves have found themselves lost and disorganised after marching hundreds of miles from home. Regrouping for the next phase of unification will take months, a full national recovery will take another generation more.\n\nVictory on the battlefield has given the Guangzhou Government sufficient leverage to call another major conference in their capital, this time not as a mere regional government but as the heir presumptive to the old Beiyang order. Invitations have gone out around the country, and few dare not to attend."
 YUN.lategame.600.a: "An age comes to a close."

 YUN.lategame.601.t: "The Second Federalist Conference"
 YUN.lategame.601.d: "Beijing has fallen into the hands of Tang Jiyao, and with it the old order has been swept away. Some Beiyang remnants continue to fight on or have fled into the arms of our rivals, but at least for now resistance near the city has subsided. A new order emerges, this time along Guangzhou's designs.\n\nTang Jiyao is the man of the hour. Once merely the governor of an isolated province, repeatedly humiliated in wars outside of Yunnan, and a name people would know at best as a pale imitation of Cai E, he has become the presumptive future President of the united republic. Indeed, it seems that fate has given China into the hands of the southerners - a rarity in Chinese history where most unifications have been north to south.\n\nBut how will he rule? It was one thing to lead as President for a quasi-recognised regional government. It is another to be the central government in China, especially at the helm of a movement ostensibly dedicated to empowering the provinces. The Federalists have always been an odd quantity in Chinese politics - familiar to the old system and often intertwined with it, and yet in other ways proclaiming to be a new, reformist movement.\n\nWith momentum shifting in their favor, the Federalists are at an advantage in the coming proceedings. Many defeated Beiyang assemblymen have sought to retain their seats in the new government, pleading for entry into the victorious Guangzhou government. At least some of them will have to be integrated for the sake of stability, but in these precious moments at the start of a new order Tang Jiyao has so much power to set the tone for the future. Democracy means so many different things to so many different people. Now the republic waits to learn what it means to their new President."
 YUN.lategame.601.a: "Democracy means the end to the endemic corruption of Beiyang."
 YUN.lategame.601.b: "Democracy means abiding by the law, even to our enemies."

 YUN.lategame.602.t: "Which Road Shall We Take?"
 YUN.lategame.602.d: "Tang Jiyao and his allies may be basking in the glory of their triumph, but there are plenty of others hungry for victories of their own. The activists of the Crescent Moon Society have re-published a series of essays first written following Zhili unification, most notably \"Which Road Shall We Take?\", arguably the seminal political statement of the Crescentists.\n\nIn it, they asked two rhetorical questions. The first was what do we want to eliminate? The CMS found five big enemies: poverty, disease, ignorance, political corruption, and social chaos. Notably excluded were capitalism, imperialism, and feudalism - considered by many intellectuals to be their most hated enemies. The writers argued that China was not yet a capitalist country and that feudalism had been eliminated two millennia ago in China. Imperialism would not have taken root if China had not been weakened to begin with by the \"five devils\" within. The CMS believed that blaming external enemies was a distraction from internal problems, reflecting their cosmopolitan and Western education - drawing criticism from across the political spectrum.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the CMS did not openly condemn Cao Kun then or Tang Jiyao now, leaving open the possibility of an alliance. Of course, further articles such as \"What Kind of Political System Do We Want?\", \"On Socialism\", and \"We Want Financial Control Power\" did ultimately attract Zhili attention, but the Crescent Moon Society was always more focused on the second question of what do we want to establish? In this they were vague - calling for a safe, prosperous, civilised, modern, and united country that could pass good laws that maintained peace, social services, infrastructure and a fair and developed economic system.\n\nBut how could they get there? Revolution is destructive and turns violence into a habit. Evolution is too slow and retains too many obsolete elements. The only way forward then, is the third road - conscious, peaceful reform."
 YUN.lategame.602.a: "Tang will surely grant us conscious, peaceful reform."
 YUN.lategame.602.b: "Real reform requires real democracy."

 YUN.lategame.603.t: "Beiyang Reorganises"
 YUN.lategame.603.d: "Beijing has a new master and the old Beiyang parties have scrambled to adapt to a new order where they are no longer dominant. Many of their leaders, sensing the instability of the new regime and wanting to hedge their bets, have decided to sit out of proceedings for now - allowing their underlings to do the dirty work in representing their interests in the Federalist legislature.\n\nThe old Beiyang system was dominated by independents, at least nominally. Organised political parties were viewed with suspicion after the Yuan Shikai's conflict with the Tongmenghui, and many Beiyang politicians prized their independence - banding together in informal cliques and associations. Many of these independents continue to operate, hoping to remain relevant in the new regime by leveraging their personal followings, patronage networks, and/or political machines to hold onto power.\n\nMany of the northern left have joined the budding opposition, particularly those associated with the National Salvation Federation. Hu Shih and other old CMS members have begun intense dialogue with Luo's faction, though have not ruled out working with the President either. Revolutionary socialist parties such as the KMT and CSP have faced heavy suppression and their central committees have prohibited their members from participating in the Federalist government.\n\nIt is the Liangists who have seen the biggest shift. The Chinese Constitutionalist Party, once the largest formal party in the assembly behind the Harmony Association, has disintegrated after its leadership moved to join the GRA. A young guard splinter has worked with former members of Zhang Junmai's DSP to form the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. The Young China Party has sought to benefit from the exodus of CCP members, though at the same time has been cozying up with the Tang Clique."

 YUN.lategame.603.c: "Beijing's independents fiercely protect what is theirs."

 YUN.lategame.604.t: "The China Democratic League"
 YUN.lategame.604.d: "The Conference concluded after producing some general statements declaring their support for President Tang Jiyao and his reconstruction agenda. Tang, thanking the Conference for their faith in him, vowed to continue on with the war for liberation and promised to hold democratic, federal elections after unification. For now, he has promised a national unity cabinet, but has selected only loyalists so far for actually vital positions. He begs for their continued trust as the country navigates difficult waters ahead.\n\nThose wary of relying on the latest strongman promising reforms have not been silent. Many former members of the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties have gathered together a few blocks away from the convention hall. Dropping two characters from their name, they have publicly announced the formation of a China Democratic League, implying one unified party to demand a coalition government.\n\nLuo Longji was elected Chairman and drafted \"The Draft Principles of the Democratic League\", which proposed a democratic federalist republic with a bicameral legislature, separation of powers, universal suffrage, equal educational opportunities, economic democracy, the nationalisation of armed forces, and the gradual move towards a classless, socialist society. Signed by the former leaders of over half a dozen parties that joined to form the CDL, it has been seen as a major independent act by the so-called \"third way\" movement who seek a route to democracy between revolution and gradual evolution.\n\nThe reverberations are being felt across the Chinese political spectrum. If the CDL can truly remain united, they will likely be the bedrock of the democratic political opposition now that the CCP has been subsumed into Tang's political machine. Many look on with excitement, though some fear the President's backlash. Or worse, that their ineffectualness leads to them becoming a token opposition to the powers that be."

Representatives from around the country flooded into the city in hopes of having their voice heard during discussions of national reconstruction and military reorganisation.\n\nHowever, it quickly became apparent that the delegates were beginning to divide among themselves between supporters of the President and the growing opposition. Many of those skeptical of Tang's commitment to democracy, or are otherwise discontented with his rule have coalesced behind scholar Luo Longji. With no national elections to be held until after unification, this may be the only chance for people to express their discontent.\n\nFor us in the particularly autonomous [ROOT.GetName] region, our voice has a special sway. Tang's agents have exhorted us to make a show of unity, while his opponents beg us to make a gesture of support in their favor.

 YUN.lategame.630.t: "The Warlords Chafe"
 YUN.lategame.630.d: "With the advance of the armies of Dian onwards to national unification, the slowly enlarging expansive territory of the government has resulted in the army serving a dual purpose. Administering \"liberated\" territory and fighting on enemy territory, ultimately resulting in a patchwork network of systems across and within provinces. Naturally, this has resulted in tension amongst the warlords as \"new\" warlords arise.\n\nIn areas of genuine sympathy or of our allies, the pre-existing administration was largely kept in-tact, with varying degrees of autonomy. In areas of rebellion, guerrilla activity, or of particular unrest, local governments have practically been reconstructed under martial law, with the Dian Army ensuring amiable collaborators are installed into significant positions of power, albeit this has resulted in spats between local Bandit Suppression chiefs, provincial warlords, and local magistrates.\n\nWith his indubious role as the hard \"mediator\" and \"arbiter\" of the Central Government, Tang has seen it fit to intervene in matters frequently, resulting in a growing resentment towards him and the Dian Army; his preferred candidate to resolve issues in favour of.\n\nIn a similar vein to his army and their conquered territories, Tang himself has also amassed a significant amount of influence not just in intra-state affairs but nation-wide and beyond; in-part due to his national visibility, but more due to the Dian army's unique position within the country. Having basically reconstructed some variety of provinces from the ground up during occupation, they have in-effect substituted the state in some areas for themself, granting Tang and his army unsurmountable power."

 YUN.lategame.630.b: "He would seek to substitute the state with his army!"

 YUN.lategame.631.t: "Democracy in Wartime"
 YUN.lategame.631.d: "With increasingly militaristic attitudes and a tenuous state of nigh continuous war throughout the nation, the attitudes of democracy and waves of freedoms have seen much comparable restrictions and debate throughout the halls of the resilient statesmen and lofty intellectuals. Should rights and freedoms be restricted? Is it practical to maintain democracy during wartime? What of insurgents, spies, or domestic stability?\n\nLuo Longji, writing in Ziyou Juntan (Liberty Forum), believes he has found the solution. In response to suggestions that rights and freedoms be significantly restricted during the war, he retorted by quoting Harold Laski. Positing that liberty should be enjoyed in times of war as well as normal times, otherwise the people would not want to fight the war or make any contributions to it.\n\nCiting evidence for his claims, he procures that of military defeats in the British Revolution, or in the American Civil War; significant restrictions on rights deprive the governments of their own citizen's support directly due to the deprivation of their rights.\n\nInstead of an autocratic or oppressive government, Luo supports the notion of a \"politics of leadership\" that enjoys the support of the assembly. With the President exercising extraordinary powers, he only does so with the consent of the people, Parliament, and all political parties. By placing the national interest above personal, party, or group interests, the people are able to evoke a spirit of great patriotism - without the oppression of the people's rights.\n\nTranscending party lines, the notion of this great patriotism rested upon the respect for the rule of law, and politically, the \"rules of the game\", insofar meaning political ethics maintaining fair competition, liberty, and freedom from military influence. By recognising the freedom of speech, freedom of political participation, and the implementation of political reform, the nation should be able to conjure the force of such a great patriotism without the great harm of military autocracy."
 YUN.lategame.631.a: "Democracy must be cultivated, at all times."
 YUN.lategame.631.b: "Their pretence for democracy would sink the state with it."

 YUN.lategame.632.t: "Beiyang and the PGP"
 YUN.lategame.632.d: "Naturally with the emergence of the People's Government Party from that of the regionalist Southwest onto the national stage, it has received a large influx of new support, and even a record number of inducted members into the ranks. But of this course has been the inclusion of a large number of \"adopted sons\" so-to-speak. Ex-Beiyang aficionados, Anhui, Zhili, Fengtian, and minor cliques in-between, have all found themselves within the PGP fold.\n\nUsed to working for what is basically a dictatorship, at least despite Tang Jiyao's auspices, they have found an organic placement within the party assisting in its administration and the nation's bureaucracy. Tang himself, inspired by, and perhaps even an equal of, Liang Qichao, has also-managed to co-opt a lot of the Chinese Constitutionalists into his fold, occupying their niche within the national political field.\n\nFor his part, Zhang Taiyan has rallied against their inclusion within the party. Insisting that they are merely bureaucrats and centralists hoping to distill the pure dream of Chinese Federalism, he has called not for their inclusion within the party, but their maintenance as \"independents\". Pragmatic cooperation at most. But largely he has been deemed too old to really have a hold on things, an antique relic of a younger age.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean his outlook holds no sway however. His intellectual and political successors, Wang Dong and Wang Rongbao, have approached a middle-ground between Tang and Zhang. The brothers are relative titans in their fields. Wang Dong is one of Taiyan's many protégés, to the point of being considered his successor. Wang Rongbao is a famous diplomat, ambassador, constitutionalist drafter, and former Progressive Party member.\n\nUnderstanding the need for capable bureaucrats, and for that of a more realistic outlook on Federalism, they have reasoned that the Constitutionalists share the same Liangist root that Tang himself does, but argue that the Beiyang establishment are in essence soulless, working for whoever and whomever."
 YUN.lategame.632.a: "As always, Tang is right. We need administrators."

 YUN.lategame.632.c: "Only true believers may distinguish themselves in our government."

 YUN.lategame.633.t: "The CDL Rally Against Corruption"
 YUN.lategame.633.d: "In a government as large as Tang Jiyao's, with so many individual assets floating around and swirling between hands, it is only inevitable that a few things... slide into the murky underworld, discipline and organisation falter, rot develops, and manifests itself. This is not to say Tang has not been vigilant against all signs of corruption, even if he sometimes takes part in it himself. And of course, tied up with the government's corruption is that of its incessant authoritarian measures.\n\nIncreasingly people have begun to clamour for very sought after freedoms. Of speech, of thought. So much so that Luo Longji, ever studious, has become something of a speaker for their cries. Proposing that the democratic parties be allowed to expand their organisation and increase their strength, so that they can be considered equal with the People's Government Party, this would allow all people with their grievances against the government to voice their concerns in a democratic and peaceful manner, as opposed to that of revolutionary diatribes or general apathy.\n\nContinuing on, Luo sought to remind the government the true meaning of a free democracy: \"The scope of free speech is such that there is nothing in the world that cannot be said, nothing in the world that cannot be discussed. To struggle for human rights, we must struggle for rule of law, and this means first struggling for a constitution, because a constitution is the way the people control the government.\"\n\nWith any authoritarian measures teetering on dictatorship, Luo posits that the government would \"imbue the minds of citizens with a sense of fear, passivity, dependence, and servility.\" Hoping to fulfill the cause for an active civic democracy, Luo suggested the restoration of \"all standards of value\" and of \"positive thinking.\"\n\nAiring on the side of caution, he has not advocated for absolute freedom, but freedom with limits. Freedom that does not harm health, either mental or intellectual, and freedom that does not destroy dignity."
 YUN.lategame.633.a: "The pursuit of such freedom is a noble thing."
 YUN.lategame.633.b: "I'm sure his opinion would change if he left the ivory tower."

 YUN.lategame.634.t: "Conflict Between Collectivism and Individualism"
 YUN.lategame.634.d: "Undoubtedly allies, akin to that of a mentor and his student, Tang Jiyao and Zhang Taiyan's vision for the Chinese Federal Republic has evidently begun to diverge as of late. With Anti-Tang protests and dissent beginning to manifest amongst the masses, intellectuals, and even in some parts of the army, they have increasingly butted heads despite similar beliefs. Inspired by Zhang and Liang Qichao, Tang has drifted towards the authoritarian paternalism of Liang Qichao's early politics, as opposed to Zhang's curious individualism.\n\nHaving converted to Buddhism during his imprisonment as a revolutionary in 1903-1906, Zhang viewed his religion as a form of resistance against collectivism. In stark contrast to Liang's constant invoking of the Chinese people as a collective \"whole\" group identity, Zhang tried to use religion as a way of maintaining one's identity within a state, and even how it could be utilised for revolutionary self-sacrifice.\n\nExpanding upon his viewpoint in the later 1900s, Taiyan insisted within Minbao in 1906 - 1908 that Buddhism acts as a force that transcends nationalism, a force of spiritual unification within the nation that can unite all Five Races into one common whole. However, he did not advocate for a state religion, instead opting for a golden rule approach; you should treat people as how you would want to be treated by others. To Zhang, \"real equality is derived from breaking free from opinions of good and evil or right and wrong.\"\n\nZhang's curious individualist spirit has lived on in his elderly years, as he resigns more and more to the proclivities of his age, he still continues to harangue Tang about the maintenance of individual rights and liberty, against the Liangist mindset of collectivist struggle. His ideas have found a revitalised bed of support amongst similar individualists in the political centre, who hope that Zhang can curry a freer Federalist China under Tang's iron grip."
 YUN.lategame.634.a: "Zhang's individualism guarantees freedom!"
 YUN.lategame.634.b: "Liang's legacy is that of collective strength!"

 YUN.lategame.635.t: "The CDL Stumbles"
 YUN.lategame.635.d: "Despite its high moment in the sun only a year earlier, the China Democratic League's sprint has begun to stumble as it struggles to find a coherent goal for itself, to even confirm its identity, let alone agree on praxis. In the dialogues of the Democratic League, there are questions as to whether it's a true party, or a collection of parties. Some leaders have claimed that there are 100,000 participating CDL members within the League, but Zhang Junmai himself admits that no one truly knows its true following.\n\nFor his part, Luo Longji has still continued to strongly advocate for the CDL to take the form as a formal political party, attempting to coerce all the constituent parties to dissolve themselves, and recast as a portion of the CDL. However, Luo's propositions have been shot down by most within the League citing them as absurd, relegating party leaders and influential statesmen to that of suits and rank and file.\n\nIn a similar vein, another attempt was made by leading figures to organise the League better, but ultimately fell apart due to the notion that the \"people join their constituent parties and then can be enrolled as CDL members individually\".\n\nLeague infighting has resulted in a lot of endeavouring members growing distrustful. Chu Anping, editor of the Shanghai Liberal journal The Observer, criticised the League as being \"out of tune with reality\" and \"its natural endowments are weak\". Asserting that all League members were almost all old scholars, without one politician among them, and that they were only held together by their opposition to the Zhili.\n\nEven worse, their position amongst the middle-classes and as a viable opposition has been contested by none other than the Young China Party, whose established role in politics has granted them additional strength. As a result, the CDL has fallen largely to its own lack of foresight, and will undoubtedly need time to recuperate and conduct soul-searching."
 YUN.lategame.635.a: "The CDL must take swift action to rectify its organisation!"

#UPC Phase IV Focus Tree Events (660-689):

 YUN.lategame.660.t: "Governors and Warlords"
 YUN.lategame.660.d: "Amongst the twisting turns, troubling troubadours, and reviled revolutionaries of the Warlord Era, many can forget that the affirmation of a government official and that of a warlord can ultimately merely depend on whether their status is confirmed by some higher power or body. What does it mean to be the \"legitimate\" government official? Sometimes being a warlord is just a matter of one's perspective.\n\nTruly there is no clear delineation between what could perhaps be merely an influential local elite, be they civilian or military, or that of a warlord. Even worse, one must take into consideration the \"pedigree\" of a warlord. Are they merely a \"local bully\"? A petty regionalist warlord hardly greater than that of a bandit. Or are they a grand province-wide warlord, able to assert themselves on a national level?\n\nWith his Southern government launching his grand national unification campaign, Tang's government has vanquished many warlords, but it has also relied upon equally as many to fight in said wars, and even in some cases constructed entirely new warlord political machines. As things stand, it is stable, for now. But when the government inevitably grows stronger, the warlords will inevitably develop further into a great hindrance towards reform efforts, and even Tang's power.\n\nHowever any crackdown on their operations currently could drive them to host various political opposition figures, backing the men of words with their guns. Minor warlords, such as Long Yun, or Liu Zhenhuan, have flagged such intentions should their power be curtailed. And if that were to happen, Tang would undeniably lose their politically pliant apathy to national affairs insofar as it does not concern them, or their power-base.\n\nAlthough the question remains, can Tang sit-by and allow the commodification and abuse of his government, flying flagrantly in defiance of his insistence of separate military and civilian spheres? Flying flagrantly in defiance of democracy itself?"
 YUN.lategame.660.a: "They think themselves greater than pawns?"
 YUN.lategame.660.b: "Best not poke the tiger."

 YUN.lategame.661.t: "Feudalism and Federalism"
 YUN.lategame.661.d: "When one thinks of the term \"Feudalism\", one probably imagines that of lords and ladies presiding over their vassal subjects in some sort of honour-bound, or otherwise, agreement spanning a time long forgotten. Few would consider that term to be in correspondence with Warlords of the Modern Day, or even that of Federalism as a linguistic term itself.\n\nAt least, in the traditional Confucian context, \"feudal\" (fengjian) once served dutifully as a symbol of local autonomy and as a counterweight against imperial authority, yet in the modern day it has now become that of term of scorn, oppression, and retrogression.\n\nIts first use was in that of classic poetry, indicating a sense of harmonious balance between the Earth and Heaven. And yet, only recently did \"fengjian\" adopt a translation to mean \"feudalism\". Yan Fu, interpreting the word through the Western lense, saw it as loosely indicating autonomy. And Zhang Taiyan for his part, advocating a form of \"fengjian\" federalism within this definition.\n\nThrough \"fengjian\", it is believed that the focus would be on the development of local institutions and autonomy as opposed to the \"junxian\" reformists such as Liang Qichao who desired a centralised and unified nation-state. And insofar as Taiyan and Federalists of his train of thought are concerned, Chinese Federalism is inseparable from fengjian. The term \"United Provinces in Self-Governance\", coined by Taiyan in 1920, was in-fact directly influenced by the Ming Confucians Gu Yanwu and Wang Fuzhi's respective advocations for fengjian.\n\nErgo, fengjian's implication of preserving local autonomy in defending against foreign threats must be protected at all costs. The Qing's centralisation cost China her ability to modernise with other great powers, and the Beiyang Republic's failed centralisation only inflamed matters of warlordism. Perhaps if Fengjian had been upheld sooner, then the talented scholars of the lands of Wu and Chu would have concluded the Self-Strengthening Movement, and China would not be in the state that it is now."

 YUN.lategame.662.t: "Wen's Theory of Form"
 YUN.lategame.662.d: "Despite its foray into politics, at its very heart and soul the Crescent Moon Society is a gathering of poets, those men of prose who view the world under the veil of flowery language and the delicate dance of words across a page. This is the essence of the Crescent Moon, it is what Xu Zhimo had originally endeavoured for the Society and Bookstore to be. Not a political organisation, but a cultural organ for a new renaissance in Chinese poetry.\n\nOne of the most famous members of the society, both for his politics and for his poetry, has to be that of Wen Yiduo. Imbued with a sense of civic political participation during his time in America, he became particularly sensitive to the issue of racial inequality in the democratic republic, alongside joining the Awakened Lion Society, the forerunner to the Young China Party.\n\nPoetry-wise, he is most well-known for his theory of \"form\" (gelu). Believing that \"one can no more dispense with rules when playing chess than one can dispense with form when writing poetry\", he is a rather rigid advocate for \"form\". Arguing that poetry can only be composed after a process of editing and selection, he opposes the romantic advocacy of a \"Return to Nature\", because Nature \"exists in an imperfect state, and only Art can remedy Nature's deficiencies\".\n\nAdapted from English prosodic rules, and taking into consideration Chinese linguistic features, Wen's \"form\" is in direct response to his disappointment with poetic trends of \"a hideous confusion of foreign terms, foreign expressions, foreign allusions, foreign themes, and foreign thoughts.\" Much like his politics, Wen sought a solution that synthesises the elements of Chinese and Western concepts.\n\nEver a romantic obsessed with \"death in ecstasy\", with the imaginative realm of art and the real world of suffering and pain, Wen has developed a flair for the dramatic. With the outbreak of war on the horizon, he has vowed to never shave his beard until victory has been achieved."

 YUN.lategame.663.d: "And it could not be so without the founding father. Much as it is for any nation, any government, any party, any ideology, whoever takes the first napkin will forever leave a lasting impression upon their descendents and so forth. They are bound by fate or ideal to follow in their footsteps, and yet with the Crescent Moon it could not be any more different.\n\nXu Zhimo, several years dead of a tragic accident, had always hoped for Crescent Moon to stay clean of politics. He was a Promethean type of personality, an incorrigible individualist who knew only the individual, understood only the individual, and believed only in the individual. That democracy itself is the spirit of universal individualism.\n\nAnd so forthright was he that his Crescent Moon Bookstore transformed into a cell of those with a disdain for violent revolution, to Syndicalism, to that of Marxist Class Theory. With a latent admiration for the \"liberal and yet conservative\" form that British politics took in yesteryear, or that of the belief in individualism and independent thought.\n\nAs a poet too, Xu brimmed with enthusiasm and passion. Invited to attend the meeting at the \"paradise of new poets\" in 1926, his subsequent decision to launch Poetry Supplement in the Morning Post Supplement would develop into the Crescent Moon Poetic School, and the eponymously named society there onwards. To \"correct the previously unbridled liberty\" was the main spirit of poetic reform for which Xu founded his group, to revolt against \"exuberant egotism\" and the unrestrained use of foreign expressions and themes in literary work of the time.\n\nBut Xu's work evolved further. First, the Crescent Moon was purely literary under Xu, Wen Yiduo, and Rao Mengkan. But as time marched ever onwards, and the situation in China developed, writers such as Hu Shih, or Liang Shiqiu, steadily transformed the society into a political literary publication like so many before it. With abject horror he resigned, but his literary essence still remains within China's poetic field."

#UPC Satellite Narrative Events (700-729):
 YUN.lategame.700.t: "Federalism On the March"
 YUN.lategame.700.d: "The North has fallen and the South ruminates as China turns a new page in its history. The Chinese Federalist movement has traditionally taken a more cautious approach towards unification, preferring diplomacy over the pursuit of a northern expedition - either due to a genuine belief in negotiations or a desire to conserve resources and pessimistic outlook. Nevertheless, [UPC.GetNameDef] has emerged victorious in its wars, capturing the internationally recognised capital of Beijing in a brutal fight.\n\nThe costs have been heavy, even on the victors. Yunnan may not be the centre of the Federalist government, but it has been forced to levy heavy taxes on its people and endure the trials of modern warfare. For all the sacrifices the people have made, there is a growing expectation that the Federalists deliver on their promises for democracy and economic reform at home.\n\nFor Tang Jiyao, his debts might be called sooner than he would hope. Unrest has been simmering for some time now, with Tang's attempts at centralising power in the province alienating many of his garrison commanders. The intelligentsia he has allied with have similarly grown discontented with the slow pace of reforms - constitution drafting has stalled and elections have been limited. As Guangzhou considers its next steps, Kunming faces a reckoning of its own."

 YUN.lategame.701.t: "Agitation in Kunming"
 YUN.lategame.701.d: "Tang Jiyao has always adopted a cautious approach towards leftist radicals infiltrating his province. Cognisant of his need to attract intellectuals from prestigious schools in order to build his democratic credentials and staff his government, he has at times looked the other way but his stringent anti-socialism has also led to the formation of the Yunnan Innovation Society by his opponents, which later evolved into the marxist New Yunnan Society.\n\nTang has kept careful track of these dissidents, recruiting informers within student bodies and the faculty. Surveillance and censorship are commonplace in China, but what is not as easy to address is the growing disenchantment of the centre-left, who chafe under the restrictions imposed on them.\n\nWord of a revival of the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties in Beijing has been spreading. This latest iteration, the China Democratic League, is being organised by many leading reform socialists, progressives, and liberals nation-wide. Among its co-founders is Luo Longji and the Crescent Moon Society who have built extensive ties in Yunnan across the last decade or so.\n\nBut in Kunming, it will be up to the natives to build their party. A collection of scholars teaching in the region have formed the so-called \"Nine Elders Association\", including Cun Shusheng, Sun Qimeng, Li Gongpu, Zhang Tianfang, Zhou Ximin, and Chu Tunan. They have been joined by the Qiushi School faction led by Su Honggang who has ties to Li Gongpu, Chu Tunan, Wen Yiduo, Pan Guangdang, and Wu Han. The overlapping groups have also been joined by other Southwestern University intellectuals, including (ex-)socialists like Li Wenyi, Feng Sutao, Yang Yibo, and Chu Tunan.\n\nThe educator Cun Shusheng has emerged as their leader, having achieved prominence as the head of the Yunnan Relief Association and also worked in Kunming Xingwen Bank.

 YUN.lategame.702.d: "Tang Jiyao has worked to sideline his senior military officers after their failed coup in 1927, taking advantage of his alliance with the central government and his success securing Yunnan's flanks to undermine and subjugate them. He has slowly restricted their funding, pitted them against one another, and redistributed their authority and privileges to his own loyalists to great success over the years.\n\nHis schemes have not gone unnoticed by his rivals however. Tang's removal of General Long Yun from Zhaotong permanently altered the balance of power in Yunnan in his favor: Long was the strongest of Tang's deputies, at one point stronger than all of them combined. Long remains in service under careful watch, his power mostly broken, but the real threat to Tang's rule now is General Hu Ruoyu.\n\nIn some ways, Hu was always the man to beat. The more aggressive schemer of the two, he continues to attempt to build a coalition capable of toppling Tang. Despite his mutual animosity with General Zhang Ruji, Hu has tried to peel off General Sun Du from Tang's sphere. Similarly, he has reached out to the ambitious General Lu Han, a cousin of Long Yun, in hopes of swaying him and his relative to his side. Hu has ties to the local CDL and even some of the KMT, on top of commercial interests and even some bandits.

 YUN.lategame.703.d: "While Yunnan's leaders scheme against one another in the cities, the conflict has already broken out into open fighting in the countryside. Tensions have been brewing for some time as bandits, gentry, socialists, and officials all fought for supremacy. For the most part, Yunnan's socialists are the weakest faction - unlike their MinGan peers the fragmented Yunnan rebels have failed to consolidate into an army capable of beating out the much larger gentry militias and instead are forced to rely on local, less ideological bandits for support.\n\nThe sole exception, it seems, is in Liuliang county where the local gentry rose up against local officials trying to disarm the region's tribesmen. Socialists led by Wang Desan attempted to exploit the moment, playing off both sides before making a move with the help of local students, bandits, farmers, and others with a grudge against the local landlords. Though quickly driven back as both the gentry and Tang government officials regrouped, the incident has thrown the province into anarchy.\n\nHu Ruoyu has attempted to march on Kunming, accusing Tang of harbouring socialists and allying with the rebels against the gentry. Tang has ordered the Provincial Assembly to declare martial law in response and arrest socialist leaders in the capital.

Zhang Ruiji led the left flank and quickly captured Dali as local gentry militias joined him along the way. Hu Ruoyu and Li Xuanting meanwhile made a rapid march to the capital.\n\nKunming fell almost without a shot, preventing the need for a long siege. Tang Jiyao's attempt to convince the assembly to denounce the Mengzi Clique fell short as conservatives in the Provincial Assembly and the Chamber of Commerce broke ranks as news of early battlefield defeats spread. Soon retreat became a route as Hu's army reached the gates of the city - amid CDL led protests in the city, General Long Yun staged a palace coup and detained Governor Tang, installing himself as acting Governor.\n\nA restoration attempt by Tang Jiyao's loyalists in the north was quickly quashed. As word of the coup reached Guizhou, the Liu clan arrested Tang Jiyu before he could return to Yunnan. Tang's other loyalists like Tang Jilin, Wang Jiexiu, and Wu Xuexian are simply too scattered and demoralised to resist for long.\n\nThe plotters in Kunming have sent representatives to negotiate to the victorious Mengzi triumvirate, but General Hu has demanded nothing short of a surrender. Realising their precarious situation, Long's own generals - led by his kinsman Lu Han - betrayed him rather than fight. Unwilling to participate in the coming junta as a powerless figurehead, Long has decided to \"sweep his family's tombs\" in Zhaotong, hoping for a better opportunity. In his place, General Lu Han has sought to capitalise on CDL discontent. But for now, Hu Ruoyu is the master of the southwest and has been promptly recognised as Governor by the central government."

A restoration attempt by Tang Jiyao's loyalists in the north was quickly quashed. As word of the coup reached Guizhou, the Liu clan arrested Tang Jiyu before he could return to Yunnan. Tang's other loyalists like Tang Jilin, Wang Jiexiu, and Wu Xuexian are simply too scattered and demoralised to resist for long. With the armed wing of Tang's movement destroyed, most of the fragile PGP's members have either deserted the party or fled to Guangzhou to avoid retribution.\n\nHu Ruoyu's forces proved slow to leave Mengzi, delayed by various internal disputes and sabotage by rural forces. With his window to Kunming closing, he has decided to accept an agreement with Cun Shusheng, Long Yun, Miao Yuntai, and Zhang Taiyan to form a provisional council.

Scattered CDL and socialist protests in the city were quickly put down and wavering forces fell in line.\n\nIn Zhaotong and Dali, loyalists were able to hold off attempts to seize the major towns and cities by local bandits, guerillas, and gentry militias. Fortifying their positions, they were able to secure Tang's western flank before the Mengzi Army's vanguard could link up with sympathetic forces.\n\nHu Ruoyu's main forces took far too long to leave Mengzi, suffering from low morale and poor organisation. When they finally met Tang's army, it was too late - Kunming units were dug in and ready for a fight. General Hu's forces were easily beaten back and Tang's forces gave chase all the way to Mengzi where the triumvirate were forced to capitulate.

 YUN.lategame.720.t: "Telegram From Kunming"
 YUN.lategame.720.d: "The President has received an urgent telegram from Kunming, signed by leading members of the Yunnan CDL. Concerning reports of a sudden spike in political violence in the semi-isolated and heavily autonomous province have been flowing into [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for a few days now, but they have been sporadic and unreliable. The provincial government, led for decades by the Federalist Governor Tang Jiyao, has repeatedly stated that he has the situation under control - that rural bandits (an endemic, but stabilised problem) and socialist insurgents have exploited the uncertainty following the fall of Berlin to stir up trouble.\n\nThe recent telegram paints a different picture. It castigates the Tang government as corrupt, authoritarian, and brutal - arresting dissenters and suppressing civil rights. He has refused to adopt a provincial constitution or hold free elections as he grasps onto power. A civil war apparently is brewing between Tang Jiyao and his lieutenants, with local democratic intellectuals caught in the crossfire. The message pleads with the central government to intervene and order Tang's removal - further charging him with planning treason against [UPC.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nThe writers are clearly being hyperbolic but it does underscore their desperation. The 1920s Federalist concept for central government-provincial relations has generally been favourable towards local autonomy and non-intervention in their electoral affairs. Tang Jiyao especially has been a long-time and prominent member of the Federalist movement, though the message has touched a nerve when it comes to questioning his loyalty, a concern that has persisted throughout his tenure. Given the extreme situation, Presidential intervention to broker a compromise might be the only way to resolve the situation peacefully in a timely manner, but will carry significant political risks. Then again, so does non-intervention."
 YUN.lategame.720.a: "Send a response ordering Tang Jiyao to stand down and begin talks."
 YUN.lategame.720.b: "Send a response recognising Tang's authority and asking for negotiations."

 YUN.lategame.721.t: "[UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Orders Tang to Stand Down"
 YUN.lategame.721.d: "Cun Shusheng's persuasive petition to the President must have worked! Word has quickly spread that [UPC.GetLeader] has publicly ordered Governor Tang to cease his crackdown at once and peacefully resolve the crisis engulfing his province, with unspecified consequences should he refuse. This wades into some questionable constitutional territory, as the Federalist Movement traditionally has espoused the need for the central government to avoid meddling in local affairs, though some have argued there ought to be exceptions for enforcing free elections, civil rights, and/or protecting national sovereignty.\n\nTang Jiyao never got the chance to respond however. Tang's waning popularity and plummeting authority has exposed his weakness, and within a day a group of his generals led by a vengeful Long Yun orchestrated a palace coup - detaining Tang and many of his key loyalists in a decapitation strike. Seeking to legitimise the putsch, he has agreed to a provisional council including Cun, Long, Zhang Taiyan, and Hu Ruoyu - who has reluctantly agreed to terms. Tang Jiyao remains officially governor for now, but he has been rendered effectively a figurehead.\n\nA restoration attempt by Tang Jiyao's loyalists in the north was quickly quashed. As word of the coup reached Guizhou, the Liu clan arrested Tang Jiyu before he could return to Yunnan. Tang's other loyalists like Tang Jilin, Wang Jiexiu, and Wu Xuexian are simply too scattered and demoralised to resist for long. Many of his followers, fearing retribution, have fled to neighbouring provinces as the balance of power has shifted - no doubt coming up with slander against us.\n\nThe central government is not likely to be particularly happy about the outcome, but they are also likely to be eager to wash their hands of the situation, at least for now. A precedent has been irrevocably set now, which may lead to thorny issues down the line."

 YUN.lategame.722.t: "[UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Reaffirms Tang's Authority"
 YUN.lategame.722.d: "Cun Shusheng and the CDL's attempts to enlist the support of the President against Governor Tang has backfired. Rather than come to their rescue, [UPC.GetLeader] has written a public response chastising the CDL for undermining Tang's authority and trying to incite violence, repeating the provincial government's claims that the CDL are in league with socialist revolutionaries and opportunistic bandits. Furthermore, it cited past agreements within the Federalist movement protecting the provinces from undue central government interference in local affairs, and tasked Tang to resolve his differences amicably with his detractors.\n\nOf course, this was all that Tang needed to reassert control over the province. With the central government seemingly behind him, wavering officers in his government fell in line and Kunming was quickly able to complete its crackdown against suspected traitors inside the city. The CDL, having lost its initiative by waiting for a central government response, proved powerless as their opportunity slipped by.\n\nHu Ruoyu's grand march on Kunming similarly never materialised - his gamble that regional powerholders would rally to his side amid Tang Jiyao's weakness failed. Most Yunnan Clique forces remained loyal to Tang and the Mengzi faction's undisciplined forces melted away after a failed assault on loyalist positions. His dominance now assured, there is little left standing in Tang's way now."

 YUN.lategame.725.d: "The Central Government has fallen, throwing Federalist loyalists into disarray. The Southwestern provinces have always been fairly autonomous entities, but even they are struggling to stomach the collapse as many others have surrendered to our advancing foes. Most of the old central government's leadership have fled abroad rather than be at the mercy of \"petty warlords\", and [ROOT.GetLeader] for his part has moved to seize control as acting President.\n\nHe faces a difficult challenge turning the tide, as his generals struggle to integrate other provincial units and many demoralised soldiers melt into the countryside, leaving \"ghost\" brigades and divisions. The economy has also been thrown into chaos as well as doubt rises over our ability to pay our debts.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, there is considerable jockeying for power. Tang Jiyao remains at the helm for now, but the emerging power vacuum has emboldened General Hu Ruoyu to send feelers out to make a play for power. Meanwhile, in Kunming itself the sidelined General Long Yun has been courted by local activists led by the so-called \"Nine Elders Association\" led by Cun Shusheng and Su Honggang and joined by the Crescent Moon Society and local socialists. It seems the imminent danger has only divided rather than united the province."

 YUN.lategame.726.t: "An Unexpected Twist"
 YUN.lategame.726.d: "In a sudden reversal of fortune, it would appear that the southwestern Federalists have managed to form a government in their own right. Most would not have expected this to have happened the way it did, but the demise of the old central government gave them an opening and the once peripheral splinter has managed to carve out a role for themselves.\n\nThis development has not come without consequences however. Greater political power comes with greater expectations and the new government is now on the hook for debt repayments, reconstructing devastated areas, and reorganising the now overstretched military. Furthermore, there is considerable jockeying for power. Tang Jiyao remains at the helm for now, but the emerging power vacuum has emboldened General Hu Ruoyu to send feelers out to make a play for power. Meanwhile, in Kunming itself the sidelined General Long Yun has been courted by local activists led by the so-called \"Nine Elders Association\" led by Cun Shusheng and Su Honggang and joined by the Crescent Moon Society and local socialists.

 YUN.lategame.730.t: "The Four Heavenly Kings"
 YUN.lategame.730.d: "In Chinese Buddhist mythology, the four directions of the world (north, south, east, and west) are governed by the four devas (gods). They are Vaisravana, Virduhaka, Dhrtrarastra, and Virupaksa and they all serve Sakra, the lord of the devas. On the 8th, 14th, and 15th day of each Lunar month; the four kings either send out emissaries or go inspect the state of virtue and morality of men. On the orders of Sakra, the Kings also protect the Traystrama (the mythical celestial realm of the devas) from attacks from the Asuras , demons representing cardinal sins such as gluttony and lust.\n\nWith Tang having consolidated power in the province, a greater focus is on the rise of his so-called \"Four Heavenly Kings\" centered around his bodyguard units. These are Wu Xuexian, Xi Ziqiang, He Shixong, and Tao Shaoqing.\n\nWu Xuxian is a bandit leader born to a wealthy family and who assembled a militia to compete with Yu Ying of Qujingba for water rights and came into conflict with Tang's forces. In 1919, the two men came to a truce where Wu has sworn absolute fealty to Tang and has become one of Tang's most reliable and competent officers.\n\nXi Ziqing is an ethnic Naxi who studied in the Yunnan Military Academy. A devout Buddhist and a keen politician, he has also emerged as one of Tang's most trusted officers.\n\nHe Shixong and Tan Shaoqing are military officers who have long fought with Tang Jiyao. As they are blood brothers of Tang, they are willing to kill and die for the Yunnanese governor.\n\nAs the four trusted advisors within Tang's direct military circles, the Four Heavenly Kings possess a tremendous amount of influence within the military. The Yunnanese forces have long been a mix of both decently trained soldiers from military academies like Kunming as well as militia divisions often staffed by bandit leaders. A potential emphasis could be on the training of elite soldiers, staffed by commissioned military officers from the academies and trained in the arduous conditions of mountain warfare. However, perhaps military preparation could instead be installed to strengthen the provincial forces such as the local bandits into an effective militia for the people."
 YUN.lategame.730.a: "An elite force to carry out the Governor's will."
 YUN.lategame.730.b: "Let us prepare for the storm ahead."

 YUN.lategame.731.t: "The Crescent Moon Rises"
 YUN.lategame.731.d: "After their resistance and unrest against the Tang Jiyao government, the CDL was suppressed with many of their members forced into hiding. Reports have it that CDL members can be found as far as Shanghai and Hong Kong from China's most southwestern province. The moderate members of the CDL have tried to reconcile with the government and have sought to join the Crescent Moon Society (CMS) under Luo Longji, Wen Yiduo, and Liang Shiyi.\n\nThe CMS' ties to the CDL are historic. Luo Longji in his early days was involved in setting up the National Socialist Party and worked as the head of propaganda for the CDL. Identifying early on as a social democrat - Luo turned to liberalism as he admired the concept and framework of a separation of power and rejected that socialism would be a means to the end. As a Professor on Political Science and specialising in human rights, Luo has been teaching in Kunming's Southwest United University since 1932. Given his proximity to the governor and his long standing ties to the democratic movement; Luo holds close ties with Tang Jiyao.\n\nOf course, naturally the Crescent Moon Society poses a threat. Their more left-wing rhetoric leaves little to be desired and they are often at odds with Zhang Taiyan's in their more Marxist and leftist interpretations of democracy. Given their close tendencies towards radicalism, it may serve Tang's purpose better by encouraging Luo to help \"re-orient\" the position of former CDL members into a more moderate camp. In doing so, members would relax the issue of class and focus more on the immediate democratic separation of powers. On the other hand, it's clear that these democratic groups in Yunnan have been nothing but trouble for the past few years. As their presence only continues to exacerbate peasant and workers' relations in the province; perhaps it is best to simply shut them down all together."

 YUN.lategame.732.t: "The Tang Regime Consolidates"
 YUN.lategame.732.d: "Throughout the Warlord period, men driven by passion and zeal have led the charge of revolution but it is often not just them but their circles that define their movement. Sun Yat-sen had his Kumointang with loyal stalwarts like Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hu Hanmin. Chen Jiongming has his ever loyal Ye Ju and Chen Qiyou. Like these great men, Tang also has his core allies.\n\nTang Xiaoying, his son, sits at his right hand. His close advisors are his generals Tang Jiyu and Chen Weigeng, Zhang Weihan (the mayor of Kunming), Xu Zhichen (the minister of foreign affairs and finance), and Wu Kun (manager of Yunnan Tin Company). Together, these men form Tang's most trusted personnel and cabinet.\n\nThe People's Government Party is led by Zhang Taiyan and his followers who form Tang's political base of the government. It is an idealitsic blend of both Federalist principles, conservative democratic ideals, and a constitutional party. While there is no supreme dogma of orthodox ideology, observers remark that in addition to its adherence to democratic principles and anti-imperialism; the party also tends to follow Buddhist and Confucian beliefs and tradition. Furthermore, in its early inception; Tang had also invited representatives from the Awaken Lion Society which have molded the party's core by bringing in members of the Young China Party.\n\nNow as the country is firmly unified under Federalism, is this truly the direction for Tang? Is this truly how Tang's Yunnanese revolution ends - sapped and absorbed into the greater Federalist movement led by [UPC.GetLeader] and his [UPC/GetRulingParty]. As teniosn between Guangzhou and Kunming exacerbate each day, each day Tang meets with his inner circle and select represetnatives frmo the PGP - plotting and awaiting their next move."

 YUN.lategame.740.t: "The Death of Tang Jiyao"
 YUN.lategame.740.d: "The soldiers came at midnight. In the dead of the night, a squad of infantrymen stormed into Tang's home with an offer reading aloud from a warrant that Tang Jiyao was to be placed under close supervision for an undisclosed period of time. The orders came directly from Tang's former subordinates Hu Ruoyu and Long Yun and also Cun Shusheng, leader of Yunnan's CDL. In a sudden palace coup, Tang's decades long aspirations for power came crashing down several months ago.\n\nThere have been disagreements amongst the new triumvirate on the fate of Tang. Cun has vehemently stated that Tang should be sent far away from Yunnan to Guangzhou, while Long Yun has argued that Tang's presence in the province would serve them best given Tang's influence amongst his supporters. Hu Ruoyu on the other hand wants Tang to face trial for his crimes and hopefully sentenced. The discussions however proved to be moot. A telegram from the central government had arrived last week trying to secure Tang passage to Guangzhou under armed guard but he was found dead in his bed this morning. While Tang himself has been in declining health lately, rumours are quickly flying that he was posiioned and neutralised completely.\n\nTang Xiaoying has been in Guangzhou, attempting to lobby the central government authorities on his father's behalf. This has ingratiated him to the prominent figures of the Grand Republican Alliance particularly PIP leaders such as the towering figure of Chen Jiongming, Chen Qiyou, and Ma Yuhang. Following his father's death, many especially within Tang's People's Government Party have seen this as an opportunity to curry favour with the central government and to rally against opponents of the former regime. Believing Tang to have been assassinated, they have urged Xiaoying to take the role of the party's chairman as the natural successor to his father. Xiaoying has also received a powerful endorsement from none other than Zhang Taiyan who has also pledged to support the young Tang in a political career as head of the PGP. The triumverate of Hu Ruoyu, Long Yun, and Cun Shusheng have been viewing Xiaoying's political fortunes with a mix of both scruitny and suspicion but perhaps a compromise can be made with the younger Tang to steer him in acorrect direction."

 YUN.lategame.741.t: "The Democratic Youth"
 YUN.lategame.741.d: "With the CDL effectively in the hands of Cun Shusheng now, the Party is now actively trying to consolidate power within the democratic bloc. CDL members are worried about the loyalties of so-called \"democratic\" warlords such as Long Yun and Hu Ruoyu. In order to foster enthusiasm and vigor within the youth.\n\nThe Democratic Youth is organised in different branches corresponding to respective cities with the most prominent branches being present in Sichuan and Yunnan. The Kunming branch for instance is known for its poetry societies, its dance societies, its education societies, and its women's societies. They are also responsible for the sponsoring of organisations such as the All China Anti-Civil War Association designed to promote peace and defeat warlordism throughotu the country. The Society of Cultural Workers for Democracy (also run by the Democratic Youth) also hold tea drinking gatherings to discuss their work in Sichuan.\n\nWhile traditionally staffed with moderates and liberals, Wu Han, a prominent Yunnanese leftist has emerged as one of the loudest voice within the youth organisation. Wu Han's circle and clique within the Democratic Youth are known for their ties to leftist organisations and worker's unions. They have been actively promoting a united front between these leftist groups such as the New Yunnan Society. Communists and Syndicalists make up the group's most radical members and due to their explicit radicalism - are denied entry into the CDL asfull members but nonetheless still remain closely linked.\n\nAs the political situation across the country grows increasingly uncertain, the Democratic Youth can certainly be molded to our purposes. The youth can be incentivised to stir up enthusiasm and popular support within the provinces to ensure that they propagate our ideology and ideas. Moreover they can be drilled in military studies and arms trianing in preparation for growing conflict. On the other hand, the passion and ferver of these nationalist youth can be used to stir up unrest and instability across the country. Reaching out to anti-central government focus; they can be used to convince others that our cause is truly just and the true revolution will come from Yunnan."

 YUN.lategame.742.t: "The Story of Wu Han"
 YUN.lategame.742.d: "Like many other passionate intellectuals driven by patriotism, Wu Han began his academic career at Peking University. There, he became a student of Hu Shi and later a historian of the Ming Dynasty, reflecting on the rise and fall of the last native Han Chinese dynasty. He married Yuan Zhen, a former syndicalist and an old friend of Li Wenyi, and the two discussed political and historical matters as wife and husband as well as colleagues. Following the trend of democratic exiles fleeing the violent suppression in 1932, Wu Han moved to Yunnan where he became a participant and member of the China Democratic League.\n\nIn Yunnan, Wu Han has set up a think-tank called the \"Southwest Cultural Research Society\". The society secretly met at the Tang family garden or on boats that they rented in Kunming, where they discussed essays before one another. Wu's first essay was \"On Corruption\", which argued that the shackles of the family system was the root cause of corruption; and \"On Scholars\", which focused on the special morality of loyalty from the ancient soldier scholar. To Wu, the patriotism of the intellectual was vital to the spirit and longevity of the country.\n\nWith his unique academic background in the Chinese North and his connections to CDL members across the country, Wu Han essentially is the bridge between Yunnan's native CDL and the CDL across the country. A member of the CDL's Central Committee, Wu Han's prestigious academic background and his enthusiastic zeal has helped recruit like minded members to the league. Under the direction of Luo Longji, traditionally the CDL has kept to themselves but some within the Party like Pan Guangdan and Pan Dakui have offered to work with other groups across the country. However they are still strictly opposed to the entry of socialist and left-wing groups into the CDL. Wu, however, has argued that entry of the left-wing groups will strengthen the collective united front between the democratic factions of the country and help pave an egalitarian democracy. With his prolific influence throughout the party, it's clear that Wu can help play a role in reorienting the political direction of the CDL."

Having initially backed President Yuan in the name of stability, when he turned against the Republic and tried to have himself enthroned as Emperor, Cai E and Tang Jiyao gathered southwestern leaders and became the first to declare independence from the new Empire. This triggered the National Protection War and brought the downfall of Yuan's monarchist scheme.\n\nIn recent days, the Yunnan has sided with [UPC.GetLeader] in the name of the Federalist movement. Our soldiers have fought side by side as we worked to liberate the nation. But alas like Yuan, the President turned towards petty authoritarianism, cronyism, and excessive regionalist favoritism. How can elections be held fairly under these circumstances? Therefore [ROOT.GetLeader] has rebelled, and called upon all other provinces to do the same.\n\nThis of course is a massive gamble. While the rebellion of a province long aligned with the Federalist movement has shaken [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], there have been no significant internal defections so far.

 YUN.lategame.800.d: "The Second Sino-Japanese War has broken out, pitting Japan and their Chinese allies against those seeking to resist Japanese dominance. Across the land, nationalist sentiment has spiked as the normally apathetic people begin to demand that their bickering leaders set aside their petty differences and contribute to the fight between civilisations. Regionalism, at least in its previous form, has become taboo and all provinces are expected to join the war on one side or another.\n\nLong Yun has vowed to commit troops to the conflict but he is also caught in a bind. Either way his position is threatened - if he does send troops to the front lines that means fewer troops inside the province helping protect his rule. If he fails to send his promised troops, then he will be branded as a disloyal and cowardly warlord. With emotions so high, popular anger is not a threat to be ignored.\n\nIn order to pre-emptively diffuse criticisms, Governor Long has ordered a provincial conference between legislators, military officers, and members of the bureaucracy. For Hu Ruoyu, this is his best chance - all know that he will use this moment to strike. Speaking to his officers, he stressed the importance of thought, morality, and belief in patriotic principles, casting himself as a patriotic hero in uncertain times:\n\nThe spirit of the nation leaves a deep impression on the mind of a soldier.

And yet many were blindsided by the degree in which Governor Long has proposed reorganising the military on the eve of war.\n\nLong's daring proposal is to abolish divisions and replace them with smaller, more easily controlled brigades. In addition to targeting Hu Ruoyu, this would sweep away the power of senior generals like Lu Han - replacing them with young guard officers who Long personally promoted and thus feel a sense of obligation towards him. If successfully implemented, this plan would mark the final destruction of Tang Jiyao's military system which divided power among the defence commissioners - bringing the province probably permanently under Long and his bureaucrat's dominion.\n\nThe proposal has angered many in the army high command, including his chief lieutenants like Lu Han, Zhu Xu, Zhang Chong, and Zhang Fengchun. The military still believes they can propose and dictate policy as they will, but power has been shifting for some time now towards Long, who controls the province's civilian administration and retains considerable public and gentry support.\n\nHu Ruoyu and Lu Han have decided to call his bluff, staging a mutiny in the capital. They have sought to legitimise their putsch by denouncing Long for protecting many of the disgraced Tang Jiyao's former loyalists, conspiring with outsiders against the nation, and a host of other charges. Long, caught off guard by Lu Han's betrayal, has left Kunming in the name of returning to Zhaotong to sweep his family's tomb but in actuality he is daring them to depose him like they did Tang.

This perhaps is not a huge shock given the revolving door of coups and power struggles in the region since Cai E's death, but as the National Protection War, even a poor and far-off province like Yunnan can cause a nation-wide calamity.\n\nFrom what we have gathered, the two sides at odds are Governor Long Yun and his rival General Hu Ruoyu. Long Yun has sent his brother-in-law Li Peitian to defend his rule, arguing that Long is attempting to prepare his armies to aid us in the coming war with Japan and that preserving the status quo is essential to maintaining peace in our front lines. He has requested that [ROOT.GetLeader] reaffirm his recognition of Long as governor and order Yunnanese generals to accept his planned redistribution of army commands.\n\nHu has enlisted the help of Zhou Zhongyue, a disgruntled Yunnanese elder statesman who was sidelined by Long. Zhou argues that Long is an unpatriotic warlord more concerned about protecting his own power than serving the nation in our war with Japan. He brings telegrams from various local figures criticising Long for a lack of commitment to the national cause, blocking essential reforms in the provinces, and even embracing socialism and \"trying out its inflammatory tricks.\"\n\nUltimately we will hedge our bets and avoid endorsing either man until they win.

But their decision to emphasise the need for patriotism in this time of national conflict and even hint at the possibility of change has been spuriously interpreted across the province as an endorsement for a coup.

 YUN.lategame.830.t: "The Yunnan Uprising!"
 YUN.lategame.830.d: "Yunnan's \"submission\" to outside powers has always been a nominal affair, with the province being too isolated and stubborn to be truly ruled by outsiders. Though the Yunnan Clique is prone to infighting, they have traditionally been able to band together against external threats even if they from time to time seek outside help in their conflicts. It seems however that their would-be masters tried to push too hard, triggering [YUN.GetLeader] to formally renounce any allegiance to them.\n\nThis is hardly the first time Yunnan has revolted, even against all odds. Cai E and Tang Jiyao of course led the National Protection War against Yuan Shikai's Empire not a generation ago, and Yunnan's proud military has proven more than capable of going toe-to-toe with any others in China. But plenty has changed over the past few decades, and many worry that this revolt may ultimately bring the end of Yunnan's prize independence. If that is the case however, it is clear that Yunnan will not go down quietly."
 YUN.lategame.830.a: "We march forward like our brothers before us!"

 YUN.lategame.840.t: "Yunnan Rises Again"
 YUN.lategame.840.d: "Despite all odds, the Yunnan Clique has successfully driven back its opponents - expanding their territory far beyond the southwest. This has given [YUN.GetLeader] the confidence and legitimacy to what was once considered unthinkable - proclaim a new National Protection Alliance in Guangzhou. For a faction once dismissed as staunch isolationists and failed expansionists, Yunnan's return to its 1910s glory days is remarkable.\n\nFrom here the National Protection Government still has a long way to go in order to reunite China under its banner. Taking on the National Protection Alliance label indicates his desire to liberate the rest of China, though doing so this late presents some unique advantages and challenges as most of their rivals have already made their attempt at seizing control. The ones that have survived this long are likely exhausted but also consolidated. Should they complete their quest, most expect [ROOT.GetLeader] is expected to rule autocratically like Cai E did, bringing the land under a nationalistic, non-partisan and republican dictatorship."
 YUN.lategame.840.a: "They will not stop us this time!"

 YUN.lategame.841.t: "The National Protection Alliance Reforms"
 YUN.lategame.841.d: "Like Cai E before them, this latest generation of the Yunnan Clique has declared a new National Protection Alliance to contend for leadership of China. This is a major reversal from their previous policy of staunch isolation, triggered by multiple failed expeditions. It seems that they have used that time to build up for yet another attempt at liberating China.\n\nLike his predecessors, [YUN.GetLeader] has rallied military men and intellectuals under his loose banner, hoping to rely on Yunnan's military might and southern populism to topple the existing order and eliminate the remaining contenders in China. If successful he vows to bring the nation under an autocratic, nationalistic, non-partisan, and republican dictatorship."

#NPA Long Yun Followup Events (860-889):
 YUN.lategame.860.t: "Long Yun's Ambition"
 YUN.lategame.860.d: "Long Yun is now the effectively uncontested leader of Yunnan, having dispatched of his rivals and brought the military, administration, and economy under his thumb. His family and close friends now sit in powerful positions of government, the gentry-dominated legislature obeys his whims, and there is no one able to question his will. Except for one man.\n\nLong Yun may have started his life as a military commander, but he has proven extremely shrewd and flexible in his political alignments. But this hardly means he is uneducated or unaware of world-wide political developments, having personally encountered and interacted with the revolving door of ideologies that have come and gone in Kunming - the Qing monarchy, Xinhai Republicanism, the Kuomintang's Revolutionary Nationalism, Cai E's Stratocratic Militarism, Tang Jiyao's Conservative Federalism, and many more.\n\nHow he rules now, with no one but himself in his way, will determine his long term legacy. He could be like Cai E, an aloof military strongman who sagely selects ministers without the need to consult legislature and deal with partisan bickering. Or he can model himself after Tang and his attempts at courting local democrats while never letting them too far off their leash. Though his relationships with his mentors were complicated, either way it will be seen as a natural transition from their rules."
 YUN.lategame.860.a: "Long Yun is a wise and traditional Chinese ruler that is above it all."
 YUN.lategame.860.b: "Long Yun is a modern leader and a champion of progress!"

 YUN.lategame.861.t: "The Past and the Future"
 YUN.lategame.861.d: "When Long Yun first tamed his generals a few years ago, he cast it as a wise mentor calming down his reckless subordinates. Unwilling to become a puppet like Tang Jiyao and likely perish shortly afterwards, Long left Kunming to see his family's tombs until the desperate rebels (finding no support among the legislature, bureaucracy, gentry, or lower ranks) were forced to begin him to return.\n\nIt seemed like a fair compromise - Lu Han and his other long-time division commanders argued they had served Long Yun faithfully for years but were being sidelined by the untrustworthy Tang Jiyao bureaucrats and asked Long to remove a list of unreputable agents from the government. In exchange, they would accept Long's continued leadership and his military reforms. The generals went to meet with Long via airplane while Long arrived in a fancy car, and after a drawn-out and over-acted scene Long agreed to come home and returned to a warm welcome in the capital.\n\nIt was not long however before Long had his revenge however. After Long sent his troops to arrest Hu Ruoyu and the Mengzi clique, he began sending telegrams to prying outsiders dismissing the recent crisis as some rogue generals \"not being very clear about politics and carelessly issuing statements of opinion.\" Within a few weeks, Lu Han was dismissed from all military posts and assigned a powerless position in the government and the two other division commanders Zhang Mingchun and Zhu Xu were arrested. Only the youngest of the four, Zhang Chong, was allowed to be demoted to brigade command. Long Yun broke the power of the old military brass.\n\nWith his power secure and recent political development in China, there has been some talk about restoring some of these men to senior positions on the command staff. But doing so may threaten the delicate system Long has built and limit his ability to conduct unilateral actions outside of the province."
 YUN.lategame.861.a: "Long must never allow outsiders to divide Yunnan again..."
 YUN.lategame.861.b: "Long must have competent people he can rely on."

 YUN.lategame.862.t: "Long Yun and the Arts"
 YUN.lategame.862.d: "Long Yun's first wife Li Peilian has long been an influential figure in the Yunnanese cultural sphere. Having been educated in the West, Li Peilian, had taken a personal interest in renovating the Theatre and Cinema sections of Kunming, having funded other art exhibitions in the past. Her untimely death in 1932 was a source of heartache for the Governeur who remarried shortly after with Gu Yingqiu, otherwise known as \"Yunnan's No 1. Beauty\".\n\nHe has carried on his first wife's artistic inclinations by establishing the Nanping Cinema (Southern Peace) Cinema as well as the establishment of a Yunnanese Opera. Lu Chongren has been directed to serve as the head of the Drama Improvement Agency to encourage artistic and cultural developments within the province. The Agency has also been tasked to present patriotic and nationalist plays to help improve citizen morale and to strengthen support and legitimacy for the governor's rule. The Governor for instance has been eager to press the first opening of \"The Drama of Yunnan.\" It is a patriotic play designed to place Yunnan as China's republican vanguard by depicting the events surrounding Yunnan in the National Protection War. While many critics have stated that the play has very clear anti-Zhili undertones, and that it seems to have little value outside of trying to inflate the morale of Yunnanese soldiers and citizens alike, there's no denying that many who have seen it in the theatre end up having enjoyed the play."

 YUN.lategame.863.t: "The Bamboo King"
 YUN.lategame.863.d: "Long ago, before the Three Kingdoms, existed the Great Han whose mighty dynastic expansion pushed the dynasty to expand into modern day Southern China. There they ran into the Yelang, an alliance of agricultural tribes.\n\nThe Yelang have a legend about their first legendary leader - the Bamboo King. According to this legend, a woman was washing silk in a stream when three large bamboo flowed between her feet. When she cut open the bamboo, she found a crying child - whom she took to raise as her own. The boy grew up and excelled in wisdom, talent, and the martial arts. He became a leader amongst his people, leading the Yi and Pu people into glory and styled himself as the Marquis of Yelang. He also took the Chinese word for bamboo, \"zhu\" as his surname, becoming the Bamboo King.\n\nThe histories of early Han China are muddled with both fact and fiction. According to the history of the Later Han Dynasty, the Marquis had surrendered to the Han and had been given a seal and ribbon as a symbol of their vassalage. Regardless, throughout Yunnan especially amongst Yi communities - bamboo is highly venerated as a symbol of their legendary leader. Shrines to the bamboo king are found throughout Yelang County. Southwest minorities like the Yi endow bamboo with rich cultural connotations and form a strong sense of bamboo worship. And to these ethnic minorities, Bamboo King's narrative seems to reflect their own struggle against greater Han feudal rulers."

#NPA Hu Ruoyu Followup Events (890-919):
 YUN.lategame.890.t: "Hu and Lu Square Off"
 YUN.lategame.890.d: "When confronted by Hu Ruoyu's challenge on one side and Lu Han's betrayal on the other, Long Yun left Kunming for Zhaoting gambling that neither men would have the legitimacy to actually rule Yunnan without him nor would they be able to trust one another enough to overthrow him. He was evidently wrong about their willingness to depose him, but he was not wrong about the two men being incompatible.\n\nAs the two men divide the spoils of their victories, conflict between the two factions have escalated. Lu Han, an opportunist, has tried to ride the anti-establishment wave by courting various democrats and even socialists. At the same time however, he has also tried to absorb members of Long Yun's old faction despite their recent falling out, trying to develop a civilian network of his own.\n\nHu Ruoyu has chosen to do the opposite, hoping to assemble a reactionary bloc by courting the various provincial elites. While many have joined them, others clearly preferred Long and are suspicious of Hu - forcing him to reach for control of major institutions like the provincial assembly, the chamber of commerce, and the army.\n\nThe present power vacuum is not likely to last for long and sooner or later one will come out ahead."
 YUN.lategame.890.a: "Lu Han is able to appeal to both friends and enemies of the Long regime."
 YUN.lategame.890.b: "Hu Ruoyu is able to sway major power brokers and institutions."

 YUN.lategame.891.t: "Keeping Yunnan Free"
 YUN.lategame.891.d: "Though the various Yunnan factions have their differences, they are united in their desire to keep foreign invaders out of the province. However, Hu Ruoyu and Lu Han have adopted radically different approaches to this same end as both prepare for the possibility of a hostile central government making a move on Yunnan's borders.\n\nHu Ruoyu is generally counting on cementing Yunnan's stability and reorienting the province around himself. His goal is to make Yunnan prepared for the possibility of an invasion by ensuring that he is able to personally muster its resources for its defence as Yunnan's protector. At the same time, he will use this personal leadership to negotiate with outside forces on equal footing, thus ensuring once Yunnan joins a government it will do so as a willing subject rather than a subjugated people.\n\nLu Han is also concerned about Yunnan's ability to defend itself, but with his forces already notorious for lax discipline and looting, he seeks to rehabilitate some of Yunnan's leading senior officers in hopes of restoring order to the military. Unity thus would be through compromise (and no doubt he hopes to be at the centre of this web), and Lu has gone so far as to consider recruiting the same ex-Tang loyalists he once denounced like Sun Du and Xi Ziqiang.\n\nAs the provincial council meets, they eventually must settle on a strategy."
 YUN.lategame.891.a: "Hu Ruoyu gains the emergency authority he needs to mobilise the province."
 YUN.lategame.891.b: "Lu Han is able to bring back several exiled or sidelined figures."

 YUN.lategame.892.t: "Muhammad Ma Jian"
 YUN.lategame.892.d: "\"Muhammad\"Ma Jian is an ethnic Hui who was born in Shadian village, Geju, Yunnan. When Ma was six years old, he was sent to the provincial capital of Kunming where he would receive his primary and secondary education until the age of 19. Following graduation, Ma returned to his hometown of Shadian to teach at a Sino-Arabic primary school for two years where he studied under Hu Songshan in Ningxia. Ma quickly grew to detest teaching and went to Shanghai to continue in his studies and developed leftist sympathies especially due to being exposed to the city's more prolific socialist environment.\n\nReturning to Yunnan, he has become a prominent and influential figure in the Yunnanese Muslim community. He has requested that the regional government help fund and promote Sino-Arabic schools throughout the countryside which have been met with tacit approval from [ROOT.GetLeader]. In this role as a local leader, he has also achieved some national recognition for his role in drafting the first Arab-Chinese dictionary and a more accurate translation of the Quran. With the Quran long suffering from inconsistencies and inaccuracies due to translation issues between Arabic and Chinese; his dictionary serves as a helpful reference in helping Chinese Muslims understand the true words of the Faithful.\n\nTo strengthen support and legitimacy for [ROOT.GetLeader] as well as to promote a cultural exchange, Ma Jian received funding for a Hajj to Cairo and Mecca. He has stated that this pilgrimage will help encourage a cultural exchange between Chinese and Arab Muslims as well as building up legitimacy and support for the current government among the Hui."

 YUN.lategame.893.t: "Dinosaur Fossils Discovered in Yunnan"
 YUN.lategame.893.d: "Surprising news has come from one of our road works in the area of Kunming. Apparently as dirt was being removed to construct the road, the workers uncovered the fossilised remains of an extinct animal. With some local onlookers believing it to be bones of a dragon or perhaps a qilin, geologist Bien Meinian was quickly contacted and came to the area. After conducting some analysis, he uncovered the fossilised remains of the animal now dubbed \"IVPP V15.\"\n\nA team led by palaeontologist and zoologist Yang Zhongjian (also known as C.C. Young) has arrived to examine the remains of IVPP V15. While only a partial skeleton, many are comparing its sauropod-like appearance to the discovery of the Brachiosaurus altithorax, a massive Late Jurassic sauropod discovered in 1903 in Colorado. However, early measurements from Bien Meinian show that the bones most likely come from the late Triassic, causing even further enthusiasm from experts in the subject as the majority of the sauropods are not believed to have evolved until the early stages of the Jurassic Period. Still, many are skeptical, and point out that the surrounding geology may imply a somewhat later date more in line with previous findings. Another point that has brought interest to the fossils is the fact that the skeleton doesn't seem to belong to any of the known sauropod species categorised in China, and many are excited to see if this new skeleton belongs to a yet undiscovered genus entirely.\n\nOn that end, Yang Zhongjian has also finally concluded that IVPP V15 belongs to a new species of dinosaur that hadn't been found before, and named it Lufengosaurus huenei, with the first name referring to the geological formation where the fossil was found, and the second name as a homage to his tutor, Friedrich von Huene. A related species, dubbed the Yunnanosaurus, has also been discovered by Yang who has quickly won the moniker of \"Father of Chinese Vertebrate Paleontology.\""

 YUN.endgame.000.t: "The Generalissimo and His Broken Nation"
 YUN.endgame.000.d: "Perhaps history truly is an unpredictable beast. For it was not Dr. Sun Yat-sen who led the Kuomintang to victory, nor was it Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Neither was it Wang Jingwei, or Hu Hanmin, or any other revolutionary of the inner circle. Quite stupendously, it was Generalissimo He Yingqin who led the Kuomintang to victory. It was He who finally enacted the dream of so many other revolutionaries before him. For it is He, who has reunited China under one revolutionary republican banner, and it is He who will decide its future for many generations to come.\n\nOf course the battle is not over yet, there are many challenges that lie on the path of the National Revolution. Whilst the nation may be united against external threats and independent warlords, the Party is but merely the opposite. With no united force to hold the disparate factions within the Kuomintang together, the very unity of the party has begun to fray at the seams. Foreign creditors for their part, have scurried back to claim their debts, whilst similarly the government still owes a plethora of its own financial indentures towards domestic pensioners, and the civil servants.\n\nTasked with so many hurdles, the Party needs to press froward with two, seemingly contradictory, tasks simultaneously — enforce demilitarisation to save our finances, and centralise power to make the most of our resources. Perhaps unpalatable, the only way to resolve such a dilemma is to force warlords to demilitarise, whilst maintaining the Central Army. A fact that will no doubt result in rebellions.\n\nWithin our own ranks, He Yingqin continues to engage in his delicate balancing act of power, albeit now strengthened by his now undisputed leadership he has been granted the power to steer the nation in whicher direction he wishes. Dai Jitao for his part is expected to announce his retirement in the near future, and General He's choice of premier will likely reverberate through generations to come."

Neither was it Wang Jingwei, or Hu Hanmin, or any other revolutionary of the inner circle. Quite stupendously, it was in-fact the sons of the Party Army who led the Kuomintang to victory. It was Whampoa, every facet of it, that finally enacted the dream of so many other revolutionaries. It is Whampoa, under the auspices of President He Yingqin, Premier Chen Cheng and Chief of the General Staff Teng Jie that has seen China reunited under one evolutionary republican banner. And it is Whampoa that will decide the fate of the nation for future generations.\n\n\n\nOf course the battle is not over yet, there are many challenges that lie on the path of the National Revolution.

A fact that will no doubt result in rebellions.\n\nPeering inside the Party's internal politics however, nothing is more evident than the fact that President He's days in office are on a ticking clock. Having misplayed his hand, the General is expected to all but announce his quiet and hushed retirement. Already battlelines are being drawn between Chen Cheng and Teng Jie, with many within the Party dreading another round of instability when the young guard inevitably come to blows."

 YUN.endgame.002.t: "A Torrential Storm of Hyper-Inflation"
 YUN.endgame.002.d: "Considering the Party's cruel circumstances, and the history of the nation, it is perhaps inevitable that the economy transformed into the malignant tumour of the present. With the Nationalist Central Government tasked with the prerogative to maintain a large army to stave off Japan's hounds, alongside similarly to bring the hammer down on warlords, and most importantly provide jobs to defeated generals to prevent revolts, the army has become the largest drain on the national treasury. Contributing significantly to the dteriorating quality of life in China, this is not necessarily a new phenomenon, for practically every government before us has suffered a similar fate, and even our own government has had such bouts.\n\nThis latest round of hyperinflation knocks the rest out of the park however, as our unification of the nation has resulted in the absorption of both explicit and implicit debts, many of which are due. Even worse, we have exhausted many options for raising revenue due to years of war and economic devastation, which leaves us with two much detested choices. Raise taxes, or continue printing currency. An attempt to check inflation by offering to exchange currency for our gold and silver reserves has caused a run on the banks, and the worsening crisis has resulted in major knock down effects across the board.\n\nAs the economy ever so gracefully collapses, unrest has risen in tandem. Traditional economisits like Kong Xiangxi have sought to clamp down on inflation by eliminating the deficit through heavy taxation and slashing the budget. Whilst most likely the most effective in the long run, the Kuomintang's long held economic beliefes about National Capitalism have resulted in major apprehension. Chen Cheng has used the hesitancy to push for his own populist measures, including public distributions and rationing of essential goods, price controls and allowing bartering to stabilise the currency. Further radicals have suggested a mass default, working through the crisis by utilising government directed work programs."

 YUN.endgame.003.t: "Unending Dysfunction"
 YUN.endgame.003.d: "With most of the Party's external threats thoroughly extinguished, and cutbacks to funding alongside government positions expected, the intensity of political jockeying and mania has risen. Young protégés scramble to stake their claims on lucrative patronage positions before the political system becomes ossified while political outsiders complain that despite being perfectly qualified for a plethora of available jobs, they are unable to find employment due to a lack of connections. In a similar vein, many of the etrenched party apparatchiks have defended their monopoly on the civil service and other bureaucractic strongholds.\n\nTruthfully, such a situation has only become increasingly depraved as a result of China's terribly declining economic situation, as the people search for jobs that they hope will insulate them from the effects of inflation. In the meantime, many existing government employees have begun to complain of low pay and endemic corruption, with their meagre salaries being chipped away paying bribes to maintain their positions. A horrific choir has begun to echo sentiments for reform in order to break up entrenched interests.\n\nLooking up to the higher levels for answers, the feuding political factions are too busy fighting eachother to provide the political direction the country needs. Comrade has begun fighting comrade, whether they are from the same Whampoa class or not. Not even the Central Executive Committee nor Central Supervisory Committee are free from squabbling dialectical debates about the future of the nation.

 YUN.endgame.004.d: "The miasma of misfortune is not just isolated towards the Party or the Economy either, for the disease has spread to every and all facets of Chinese society. The bourgeoisie and proletariat similarly suffer under the yoke of hyperinflation, party members, insiders, and outsiders alike chafe under extensive corruption. And now, in its culminating blow against the rule of the Kuomintang, the discontent has begun to grow amongst the civilian populace. Rallying against the military dictatorship that has, in their eyes, promised to solve all of these issues by slashing the red tape of previous administrations but has largely failed to deliver.\n\nSpurred on by intellectual circles, a chorus of voices demanding change, government accountability, and democratisation has emerged to strike down the Party before it can even achieve Dr. Sun's revolution. Whilst noble, one could admit, the anti-Party movement has become wrangled and controlled by opportunistic warlords, socialist insurgents, and others discontented by the Kuomintang regime.\n\nDespite the infighting running amok amongst the higher committees, the party has slowly begun to simmer their fiery rhetoric as many have begun to realise what is truly at stake. Certain radicals, such as Chen Cheng or Teng Jie, have even proposed concepts that amount to temporary truces in the political battleground. Of course, once the Party has effectively administered the medication to the people's ills, which will also be hotly debated, the clashes of ideology are sure to reignite."

 YUN.endgame.005.t: "The Blueshirt Land Reform"
 YUN.endgame.005.d: "The Blueshirt takeover of the party-state has not satiated the public's demand for land reform in China, nor has it prevented internal disagreements over not only the proper implementation of such a programme but also the fundamental causes of the decline of the once prosperous Chinese economy.\n\nScholars like Zhou Fang blame the rural decline on government mismanagement, arguing that extortionate special taxes, inconsistent and arbitrary reassessments, and other sudden surtaxes significantly undermine peasant initiatives. Meanwhile, Men like Lu Yiyuan argue that imperialism and capitalism allowed foreign countries to dump their goods into the Chinese market and destroyed both local agriculture and traditional handicraft industries. Imperialist loans and indemnities further forced the Chinese government to overtax the population.\n\nLiu Bingli maintains that the \"Asiatic mode of production\" is the fundamental cause of the agricultural decline, causing stagnation and reactionary attitudes that prevented the creation of agricultural surpluses needed for modern industrialisation. Liang Yuandong similarly wrote that \"warlords and the civil war...are not the causes but the effects of the decay of the countryside. Being only the effects, their eradication would require a fundamental solution for the relief of the villages...in the absence of a fundamental solution...the result can only be repetition and continuation of the same pattern we have had: the rapid succession of corrupt governments and unending battles with warlords.\"\n\nMen like Zhou Fang believe that the original proposals of Dr. Sun, like the land to the tiller, rent caps, and land taxes would be sufficient to end rural poverty. More radical thinkers like Liang and Liu maintain that equalisation of land rights is more important than equal distribution, which would simply make everybody poor and encourage individual \"selfish\" plots. Instead, both argue that \"if agriculture is to be saved, it is necessary to begin with a totally new structure,\" with Liu arguing for collective management and Liang arguing for collective farms."
 YUN.endgame.005.a: "The original land to the tiller plan is sufficient."
 YUN.endgame.005.b: "A total land reform agenda must be set."

 YUN.endgame.006.t: "Land Reform in Whampoa's China"
 YUN.endgame.006.d: "Land reform and the \"Land to the Tiller\" are integral parts of Sun Yat-sen's programme for national reconstruction, but its implementation has always been a contentious subject. Dr. Sun was influenced by the ideas of Henry George, but tended to leave the specifics vague. There is considerable debate over whether or not the programme envisioned by Dr. Sun is compatible with private property, and how to best go about both modernising Chinese agriculture and breaking up the large and often absentee estates of the gentry.\n\nThe more conservative members of the party, led by Chen Lifu, have presented their report, arguing for the creation of a joint land commission under the National Economic Commission, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Finance. This would involve a systematic survey of the land in different provinces and create recommendations, reexamining land contracts and taxation to make things more equal while avoiding needless radicalism. The government, according to this plan, would control rice sales and limit the power of the landlords while also providing subsidies for agricultural modernisation.\n\nChen Cheng has presented his own plan for the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. Inspired by his own successes locally, it is a moderated form of Deng Yanda and other leftists' populist reforms. Chen's plan would include three parts, 1. a rent-cap reform to reduce extortionate rents 2. Mandatory sales of land by large landowners to the government at fair prices and redistribution of purchased land to tenants 3. The creation of supervisory bodies consisting of honest experts to oversee the programme.\n\nSome have baulked at the plan, arguing that it is merely the staging ground for the marxist Provisional Action Committee's needlessly reckless agenda to ultimately nationalise the land. The PAC has historically sought to allow peasants to own the land they till to secure their political rights, seizing land from absentee landowners and other gentry, before eventually seeking the total and gradual nationalisation of the land."

 YUN.endgame.007.t: "Chen Cheng's Land Reform"
 YUN.endgame.007.d: "With land reform in China underway, Chen Cheng and his allies have mandated that all Landowners of a certain size and activity are required to sell their land to the government for a \"fair\" price, paid a modest sum by the government, the rest in stock from government-owned corporations (formed from recently nationalised industries). The land is then sold, with priority to existing tenants, with tenants agreeing to pay back the government in steady intervals, creating a larger number of independent farmers. General Chen has ordered the process to be carried out gradually, peacefully, but also in a decisive, incorrupt way - the sellers and the buyers should have no direct contact with each other.\n\nThe second major component is the 37.5% Rent Cap. In the past, rents could be well over 50% of expected yields, with \"ironclad\" clauses requiring rent in full even in failed harvests. The Kuomintang have decreed that 25% of the harvest belongs to the tiller, and the remaining 75% should be split equally between tenant and landlord. Leases are required to be documented on paper by officials with ironclad clauses banned and contracts cannot be terminated until the sixth year, with mandatory renewals of leases if requested by the tenants unless the owner wishes to personally cultivate the land, diminishing the leverage of landsharks. To ensure fairness for the landlords, they will be represented in Farm Tenancy Committees and the government will ensure rent is not withheld, contracts can also be terminated if the tenant has arrears worth over two years rent.\n\nThe final step is the creation of unified laws and regulations to be managed by a series of supervisory committees headed by the Land Bureau of the Department of Civil Affairs. Chen has invited experts, scholars, government authorities, local representatives, and the press to discuss regulations before their passage, and has closely monitored supervisory bodies for corruption. Already, this plan has proven widely popular among the peasants, and accepted as begrudgingly fair by the gentry."
 YUN.endgame.007.a: "A promising start!"

 YUN.endgame.008.t: "Breaking the Cycle of War and Peace"
 YUN.endgame.008.d: "President Chen was from a rural family, and one that knew the hardships and miseries of the people. As a \"faithful disciple of Dr. Sun Yat-sen,\" his quest was to liberate his countrymen not simply from the imperialists of the recent decades, but the fundamentally unequal economic system that has caused two millennia of civil wars as the balance of population and land oscillated.\n\nFrom the left and from the right, criticisms of Chen's programme came in. The right accused him of seeking the total nationalisation of the land while the left hammered his unwillingness to forcibly seize gentry property. But Chen stood firm, arguing that Dr. Sun's idea of land nationalisation was separate from Marxist nationalisation that tries to expropriate all property. A nation is a collective entity made up of individuals, and there can be no nation without individuals so only through their hands can a nation possess the land. Therefore, Dr. Sun's theory does not rule out the private ownership of land but does place them under the bounds of law.\n\nWhatever the theory may be, the benefits have clearly begun to be realised. The redistribution of land to tenants has reduced social unrest and encouraged this new class of yeomen to be invested in maintaining order in their communities as well as increasing productivity. Likewise, with many gentrymen being compensated with stocks in state industries, they have a vested interest in the survival of the government. With the money they have received, many sold their farms altogether and started fresh in the cities, sending their children to schools and establishing new businesses. For existing small farmers, the influx in capital and attention to rural areas, the end of banditry and conflict, reduction of taxes has improved their livelihoods as well.\n\nThe revival of the villages has also been felt in the cities, with the increase in production and economic development of rural areas feeding industrial and commercial prosperity. Chinese capital, once heavily tied to land, has begun the transition to industrial enterprises."
 YUN.endgame.008.a: "When the people prosper, the party does too."

 YUN.endgame.009.t: "He Yingqin's Retirement"
 YUN.endgame.009.d: "With the age of great wars of Chinese liberation effectively over and General He Yingqin largely shuffled into political irrelevancy, his role in military strategic planning has diminished to nominal roles as a Senior Advisor to the President. With little to do besides collect a paycheck and reminisce of old war stories, the former Generalissimo has found ways to kill time outside of the limelight.\n\nA fan of sports, gardening and bridge as well as the patron of various non-partisan clubs and associations, perhaps his most important project now that he is in exile from politics is the [RKT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Golf Club. Receiving sponsorship from the mayor, senior military officers, and other avid golfers in the administration, they have secured permission to purchase government land previously used by the army to erect a 9-hole golf course.\n\nThere are already plans being made for further expansion of what has become an extremely elegant park, with the Golf Club promoting the sport across the country. Responding to criticism of elitism and exclusivity, they have broadened public access including the creation of \"Golf Days\" across the year.\n\nHe Yingqin may be under constant government surveillance, trapped in an awkward position as a disgraced but still potentially dangerous former head of state, but he is clearly making the best of it!"

 YUN.endgame.010.t: "The Nationalist Government Falters"
 YUN.endgame.010.d.base: "The Chinese nation has been reunited under a Nationalist Government, but if they hope Chinese nationalism alone will be able to hold their new state together they would be mistaken. With foreign powers driven out and rival governments destroyed, there are few external forces keeping the movement together. Meanwhile, the expectations placed on this new government - from the people, from the governors, and from foreign creditors - have begun to outpace the central government's ability to meet them.\n\nThe first major sign of strain is the economic freefall that has occurred following unification. Years of deficit spending, high military expenditures, endemic corruption and inefficiency, devastation of economic enterprises, and continued resistance to taxation have caused the debt to spiral. The takeover by the revolutionary Kuomintang has caused many productive elites and technocrats to flee, while foreign creditors have begun to demand payment immediately. The central government lacks the monetary reserves to stabilise the currency, causing inflation to skyrocket.\n\nThe failing economy has had nation-wide ramifications. Unrest has begun to escalate as the people protest increased taxation in peacetime. The possibility of further unrest has precluded cuts to military spending on the central army. The only solution going forward in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s eyes is for [FROM.GetLeader] to centralise power, slashing provincial subsidies and disbanding warlord armies. All of this has created a unique moment of vulnerability, one that other players may seek to exploit."
 YUN.endgame.010.d.kmt: "$YUN.endgame.010.d.base$\n\nFor a regional (and some may say rival) branch of the Kuomintang, a great deal of attention has fallen onto us here in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our words about the direction of the party has particular weight, and many are watching to see if [ROOT.GetLeader] will take the lead in obeying the central committee's directives or if we will denounce the government, triggering an intra-party revolt. A decision has to be made soon however, as the party-state consolidates its hold a loyalist bastion like us will be the first slated to be integrated into the regime."
 YUN.endgame.010.d.shxyan: "$YUN.endgame.010.d.base$\n\nFor Governor Yan, the wily head of a surprisingly industrialised base, this might be the chance he is looking for to establish his credentials as a leader on a national scale and oppose the party-state's tyranny. Beiyang has fallen to the seemingly unstoppable advance of the Kuomintang, but now they seem to trip on their own successes.

## He Yingqin Exclusive (040-059) ##

 YUN.endgame.040.t: "Changing Attitudes in a Changing China"
 YUN.endgame.040.d: "China has been reunited, and the nation faces the question of \"now what?\" This question has been weighing on President He Yingqin's mind, who has spent the past few months catching up on party theory, listening to a wide range of advisors (including outsiders), and reflecting on what the next steps should be. After all the sacrifices that have been made, how could the party possibly build a future worth those losses?\n\nUnder the advice of many leading republicans (who generally received Anglo-American, rather than a Japanese or Chinese education like himself), he has grown more open to their calls to embrace constitutionalism. They have advised him to open up the government to the Dangwai and possibly even legalise smaller parties, adding new avenues for allied outsiders to participate in government as we prepare for the eventual end of the political tutelage. Of course, most posts and government organs will likely remain Kuomintang dominated for the near future but surely, they say, it will not be forever?\n\nLand reform is another pressing issue that He Yingqin's opinions have begun to sway on. An integral part of Sun Yat-sen's Georgist inspired plan for economic reconstruction, prior efforts largely failed to scale up beyond a provincial scope, stymied by corruption and resistance from the gentry. Many Kuomintang officials, including He Yingqin himself, came from the landed elite or retained large landholdings. But with the military phase of the revolution complete, there is a growing sense of a need for change, something that President He has softened his stance for amid a growing populism among the young guard.\n\nChange is needed, many hardliners say, but to them this means completing the revolution in its entirety. Thousands of good comrades died to see our revolution through, and millions more bear the scars of war and destruction. For there to be a lasting peace, the party-state must wield its full powers to rebuild China from the ground up in accordance with Dr. Sun's principles."

 YUN.endgame.041.t: "The Neo-Confucian Society"
 YUN.endgame.041.d: "With the unification of China under the Whampoa Clique, the military \"New Right\" has achieved a lasting victory for the party and validated its right-ward ideological drift. Chiang Kai-shek, their fallen leader, was ahead of the curve when he recognised the value in learning from our Tongzhi Restoration predecessors. Though those late Qing dynasty reformers ultimately failed to stop the Manchu decline, their embrace of Confucian ideas to promote internal stability and security are worthwhile. In his words, \"we must inherit our five thousand year old culture and make it a guide in human progress.\"\n\nConfucianism is deeply embedded into the Chinese political tradition. Even for those who oppose He Yingqin and the Whampoa Clique have found common ground in this regard, with Li Zongren once stating that socialists seek to \"deprive the people of their soul\", while Chen Jitang notes that \"in building production, we may use foreign machines, foreign sciences, even foreign engineers. But for building men we must have roots; and these roots must be sought within China's ancient culture.\"\n\nStill, the modern Neo-Confucian is far less philosophical than their predecessors - military men who seek practical applications of philosophy. The chief emphasis is on Li (Social Usage), Yi (Righteousness), Lian (Honesty), Chi (Shame), classic Confucian virtues, relating them directly to maintaining social order while keeping their specific definitions generally vague despite their prevalence in party literature. This culture war has begun to supersede the actual war now that the revolution is winding down, with a \"Read the Classics\" movement put into place while discouraging western humanities and social sciences. \"Only science and technology need to be borrowed from the West,\" as one writer put it.\n\nThis movement however has caused an internal identity crisis, with the party becoming an instrument of order rather than the spearhead of revolution. If the Kuomintang were hoping that this movement would restore morale, its effects have been mixed at best."

 YUN.endgame.042.t: "Return of the Baojia System"
 YUN.endgame.042.d: "The Kuomintang might have a revolutionary heritage, but their shift towards a more conservative, status-quo defending force has been palpable. Many Whampoa officers, including senior Generals have identified themselves with men like Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi, provincial Governors who worked under the dying Great Qing to fight off the Taiping Rebellion.\n\nAccording to the new party line, Zeng and Hu embodied the military professionalism and discipline of a proper officer, while retaining the scholar-gentlemen background expected of the proper Chinese elite (a military career traditionally is looked down upon in Chinese culture, esteemed commanders are expected to be scholar-bureaucrats first and soldiers second). The reverence of Kuomintang officials for these figures is an ironic, if perhaps understandable, turn for a party that at one point identified with the southern originating Taiping rebellion.\n\nIndeed, in their quest to restore order in a local area and revive party morale while fighting socialist insurgents and warlord rebels, the Kuomintang have officially embraced the principles supposedly set forth by Zeng and Hu over a century ago. Identified by some scholars as \"Neo-Restorationist\", these include 1.) strict law enforcement in areas being secured 2.) the revival of the Baojia militia system 3.) the organisation of the loyalist gentry.\n\nFor a party that once railed against the Baojia system and gentry as revolutionaries, this is a major turn. The gentry are expected to load most of these Baojia militias, one of many old privileges being restored or added as they resume their old roles of maintaining local order. This change does however come with a new twist - these supposedly educated gentrymen are expected to be at the forefront of indoctrinating the peasants in party ideology."

 YUN.endgame.042.b: "We should retain a little more dynamicism."

 YUN.endgame.043.t: "Catholicism and the Republic of China"
 YUN.endgame.043.d: "In the 1930s, during the nadir of the Kuomintang's existence, He Yingqin converted to Catholicism. The General had grown up in a changing Guizhou, where the French influenced southwest saw many Catholic missionaries convert prominent local families, including Wang Wenxiang (his wife) and her family. In such a troubling time, he found comfort in the faith (albeit reluctant to share any specific details about his motivations), including its emphasis on familiar concepts such as self-discipline, social justice, and personal cultivation, and continues to practise as President.\n\nBeing head of state as a religious minority is a balancing act for President He. A private, stoic man by nature he is able to carry on with dignity in public though is careful not to appear to show excessive favouritism for a religion many Chinese nationalists view as foreign imposed and foreign controlled.\n\nHe, and many other Chinese Catholics, retains an affinity for Chinese tradition. Fortunately for the nation's most visible practitioner, recent religious and political developments have helped smoothen some of the old divides between the two worlds. The Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith has declared Chinese customs related to honouring their ancestors not necessarily superstitious in nature and permitted (with certain caveats), thus resolving the so-called \"Rites Controversy\" that had caused Catholic missionaries to be expelled in the past.\n\nInternationally, the Catholic Church and the Republic of China have established diplomatic relations, and the Archbishop of Peking (Beijing) Thomas Tien Ken-sin (Tian Gengxin) has been named a Cardinal.\n\nHe Yingqin, willing to speak a little more about his faith in public, has also expressed his endorsement of the Moral Rearmament Movement, established by American Lutheran minister Frank Buchman with the hope of reviving Christian morality and promoting international peace and economic recovery."

 YUN.endgame.045.d: "Wuwangzaiju is an idiom that roughly translates to \"forget not what happened in Ju\". The ancient city of Ju was besieged during the Warring States period by forces from the state of Yan, becoming the last stand of the failing State of Qi. But despite the impossible odds, the soldiers of Qi were able to hold out and launch a counterattack, recovering their homeland.\n\nThis is a story that mirrors not only the troubles and ultimate triumph of the Kuomintang, but President He Yingqin himself. Forced out of Guizhou by the death of his brother-in-law and hiding in Kunming, in December 1921 He Yingqin was shot several times in the chest and legs after an exchange of gunfire with assassins at the Fenghua Teahouse. That, and several other examples of personal fortune, won him the moniker \"the Lucky General\".\n\nHe does not fight impossible odds alone. In addition to the numerous mentors, comrades, and subordinates that have come and gone over the years, He Yingqin has found solace in the company of his wife Wang Wenxing. She became his soulmate in his eyes after helping him convalesce after the 1921 shooting - a partner ever since who helped him turn down prospective job seekers to avoid harming his own reputation and who stood by him across multiple crises. He Yingqin is said to have two personal rules - that no matter how tired or how late the hour he returns, he will always spend time with his wife and that he will always have at least one meal with her each day as well.\n\nThe couple, having no biological children of their own, have adopted a daughter named Lizhu. On a spiritual level, the new Republic is his child, the product of a generation of soldiers, revolutionaries, and martyrs. At the help of a reborn China, President He will remember them, those fallen friends and the years of tribulations it took to reclaim the homeland, as he helms the nation into a new age."

They did not just build a loyal, dedicated liberation force for the people, but also united the hearts and souls of patriotic young men together to build bonds that will last a lifetime.\n\nThe circle of men who met as instructors at Whampoa came from around the country. The future President He Yingqin came from Guizhou, then Headmaster Chiang Kai-shek and leading Political and Organisation department officers like Dai Jitao and Chen Qimei came from Zhejiang, and the Eternal Premier of the Party Sun Yat-sen came from Guangdong. But the utter commitment to rebuilding the nation, encapsulated in the Three Principles of Nationalism, Democracy, and Welfare, is something that transcends provincial boundaries.\n\nThe soldiers with their rifles and the commissars with their words worked in tandem, in a way not seen anywhere else in the world. They fought through death and suffered through defeat and exile, but never stopped until their ordained mission was complete. Hand in hand, the army and the party freed their nation from the warlords, the imperialists, and the forces of corruption that plagued their beloved homes.\n\nThis spirit of revolutionary fraternity has lit a torch for all of China to follow and the soul of Whampoa will go down in Asian history as a beacon of hope for all the oppressed people of the East. The partnership between the Whampoa Clique and the CC Clique is expected to continue into the next age of Chinese history, guarding and realising the lofty promises made and restoring the nation's character from within."

Under He Yingqin's grandiose leadership, the Kuomintang has not only repudiated the Beiyang warlords, but freed all of China from the clutches of imperialist oppression. However, with the task of National unification having been completed, the process of building a new China has become the new paramount task of the KMT.\n\nGeneralissimo He Yingqin understands that in order to build up a new China that can reach common prosperity for the people, the Party must adapt to the new responsibility. The old days of ultra nationalist revolutionaries and fiery rhetoric can no longer serve our Party's goals in carving the path for China's future, and the party must now reform itself into a respectable organisation.\n\nWith this goal in mind, He Yingqin has allowed western-educated scholars, elder statesmen, and technocrats who all seek a modern China to take part in his government. While He Yingqin trusts Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai to lead these political independents to chart a democratic and modern future for the nation, the Generalissimo and the Whampoa Clique will ensure that this New China maintains order and stability, and warlords be kept at bay.\n\nIn this, many have compared the new government to that of the Meiji Restoration, where Emperor Meiji surrounded himself with technocrats, modernisers, and intellectuals who helped him build Japan into the first modern nation in Asia. Indeed, Zhang Qun and He Yingqin found much inspiration in the Japanese system due to their years of studying in Japanese academies.\n\nWhile many expect this new democratic China to be dominated by the Kuomintang for decades to come, the people of China are hopeful for a good modern future, where the decades of backwardness and chaos will be a forgotten memory. The era of revolution has passed, and a new age of freedom and modernity has arrived at China's doorstep."

 YUN.endgame.048.d: "For as long as the Kuomintang has persisted as a revolutionary force of the Chinese People's will the Party has always endeavoured to liberate China's lower classes. Naturally such sentiment resulted in quite controversial agreements, and the allure, or infiltration, of socialism within many of the party's membership. Utterly shattered in the late 1920s, the Party practically split itself at the seams. With two rival Central Executive Committees and two rival remnant groups fighting parallel struggles for the National Revolution. Those who bridged the divide were commonly ridiculed by either side, and yet here remains such a fallacy.\n\nStaring out onto the rolling streets and urban maze of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] from his office, Generalissimo He could only breathe sighs of restrained relief. A soldier at heart, He was in his element in the tumultuous period of China's last few decades. Under his fierce leadership, the brave young souls of Whampoa charged forward rallying the Three Principles and the White Sun for National Unification. And yet when unification was achieved, what was peacetime to look like?\n\nInterrupting his musing would be a knock at the door. With a beckoning of the voice, the so-called \"Little Generalissimo\" would make his appearance into He's sanctuary. Despite the animosity between Chiang's beloved right-hand and his heir following the collapse of the Party, it would appear that Chen Cheng's words rang true to He's ears. For the Chinese people necessitate more than emboldened rhetoric and the military jackboot. For they necessitate policy, action, and a formalised plan pressing ever forwards for the National Revolution.\n\nTwo military men, premier and president, two sons of Whampoa, and two revolutionary heroes. Here they sat, not too dissimilar to their meeting at Mianhu, where Whampoa's reputation first emerged. At the final dusking hour, it was He who led the bayonet charge of the Whampoa remnants. Daring to muster one last stand to prevent the failure of the Revolution in its infancy. And it was Chen Cheng, who's cannons had fired day in and out, that rained hellfire upon Lin Hu's troops. Winning final victory through combined methods, perhaps they can once more wrestle a bright victory from the ashes of devastation."

The Nationalist flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, flies triumphantly across the nation, as a brutal repression against \"counter-revolutionaries\" and \"traitors\" rages on with sporadic fighting in urban and rural centers throughout the country.\n\nHe Yingqin, the Generalissmo of the National Revolutionary Army and the National Revolution itself, has found that the only means of success throughout the turbulent period of the revived national revolution was an unduly faith in the Party's military. After all, can few dispute that the revolutionary caliber of the revolutionary army was the only means of which salvation was achieved? Whampoa's ranks have long been held by brothers, sons of a devastated nation united in their intense love for their nation and their willingness to do anything that must be done to save it. It is with this spirit, that the nation has been saved.\n\nNational Populism is a foreign idea, one that may perhaps even seek to usurp itself over the ideological supremacy of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. However, the experiences of the last few years has shown that perhaps the ideas of national populism or narodism can indeed be reconciled with the revolutionary spirit and fire of the Chinese Kuomintang. Indeed, in these urgent times where national order and stability is needed, the forces of the Blueshirts can certainly be utilised to ensure peace reigns throughout the nation.\n\nA new China is to be born from the ashes of the old. And this new China is led by the nation's saint, He Yingqin, a man driven by nothing but revolutionary zeal and passion, the true successor to Whampoa's esteemed headmaster. The model implemented by the late headmaster has in turned been perfected and finetuned by the Generalissmo, as a new way for a new revived Chinese nation."

 YUN.endgame.060.d: "Perhaps in the spirit of 1924, in the spirit of maintaining party coherency in these troubling times, or as many in the opposition allude to, as cementing his iron grip over the Chinese Government, Generalissimo Chen Cheng has undergone what many are calling \"A Second Reorganisation\". In the same vein as his ambitious centralisation efforts, he has deemed it fit to formally conduct such matters under an official government agency. Dubbed \"The Central Reorganisation Committee\", the Generalissimo has instituted its establishment to repalce the old Central Standing Committee and Central Executive Committee.\n\nWith the new Committee being staffed mostly by members aligned to Chen Cheng, the new arena of Kuomintang heavyweights are of an average age of 56, with all carrying a college degree or some equivalent. Notably, the Reorganisation has six broad goals to be achieved. First and foremost, make the Kuomintang a revolutionary-democratic party. Second, broaden the social base of the Party to include peasants, workers, youth, intellectuals and producers. Third, adopt democratic-centralism as the organising principle; fourth, emphasise party cells as the basic units of the party, and fifth, have all decisions made by Party Committees, personnel and other policy matters handled by formal procedure. Finally, insist that Party members obey the Party, uphold its policies, and have a proper work style.\n\nAlready the Generalissimo's critics, most vigorously the Blue Shirts Society are hounding him as centralising power all around himself. Believing that they are being cordoned off from any avenues of power, many of them are making great displays of defiance in Party circles. They would at least, be half right. Insisting that he is reasserting party authority over all auspices of government and military, Generalissimo Chen has the fate of the detested Blueshirts in the very palms of his hands."

Intended to indoctrinate a new generation of young men with the Party's philosophy, and rejuvenate the ailing, aging and corrupt Party, the Youth League hopes to produce a new era for the Kuomintang in the future. One that will willingly allow the Old Guard Party membership to pass on the torch to a more vigorous and spartan body. Inspired by the victory parades, jubilees and bugles following the nigh civlisation ending conflict with the Rising Sun, the League has taken on a passionate patriotic spin. With many of the educated youth willingly joining the League, a series of youth halls and guest houses have been established all across the country to promote further enlistment.\n\nHosting summer camps, sports games and other recreational activities, the League has also aided in creating battlefield service and propaganda teams to be utilised by the party in future endeavours. With its influence reaching into even the education system, the League has also taken upon itself another annal of political consolidation. Promoting Chen Cheng's achievements both in the field and in administration, the Youth League has reached a breaking point of expansion.\n\nLimited without outside assistance, some members within the Central Reorganisation Committee are suggesting that the Generalissimo tap into the shattered Central Club's networks within the nation, utilisng the Chen brothers and their extensive ties to civilian bureaucracy to see a rapid expansion of the League. Of course, they would no doubt sink their teeth into the League itself."

Some allude that his ties to his mentor Deng Yanda never truly died, that he is but a mere secret member of the Provisional Action Committee, seeing as he is a blood brother of Zhou Zhirou. Others claim that he is merely the orthodox successor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, implementing the \"Red General's\" policies to the utmost. Truthfully, whilst those close to him may claim he has socialist sympathies, Generalissimo Chen is thoroughly a member of the growing New Right.\n\nCoinciding with this, Generalissimo Chen recently instituted a cadre system to enforce the party's influence amongst membership. With each cadre provided thorough training on Sun's Three Principles, and tested for loyalty to the Party and their capability, Party work has also received a change of direction. Targetting both the Party membership and general society, Chen hopes that popular sentiment towards the KMT can be cultivated, and that investigations into local situations can provide information, and root out illegal activity.\n\nFurthermore, party recruitment has been transformed to accommodate for more of the lower classes, the farmers, workers and intellectuals have all been prioritised. Whilst they will most likely not participate in education, propaganda, public service or other Party Work, it has been deemed a stride towards equalisation of the peasantry with the masses by the remnant Provisional Action Committee within the nation.\n\nSuch good rapport and acclamation by the PAC's Deng Yanda has seen the leftist organisation offer a sort of olive branch towards the Little Generalissimo. Following with recent exchanges with other leftists such as Zhou Enlai, Deng has offered the PAC's assistance in enlightening the peasantry, in exchange for amnesties and a continued prioritisation of the Chinese lower classes."

Cut short by the former's death at the hands of disgruntled soldiers, or perhaps citizens, during the Northern Expedition, Chen's tenure as the Generalissimo's protégé never truly developed into its true potential. Nonetheless, some semblance of his second mentor's philosophy and actions still remain within the Little Generalissimo's life. The tenets of Whampoa, or perhaps Chen's spartan lifestyle. Most vividly however, is his arranged marriage to one Tan Xiang, daughter of the eponymous Tan Yankai.\n\nBeginning originally with Dr. Sun's attempt to arrange the marriage between Song Meiling and Tan, that attempt ultimately fell short as Tan was forever married to his first wife, even in passing. Instead, Tan opted to become Song's godfather, and Sun himself instead endeavoured to arrange the marriage of Chiang to Song. With Sun's death and all other family members except Song Ailing opposing Chiang's marriage, it would only be saved by Tan's intervention. Following the Northern Expedition, Tan would find himself as a weaker faction within the remnant Guizhou, hoping to strengthen his position, Tan would conspire with Meiling to see Chen Cheng and Tan Xiang marry in 1931.\n\nHaving been previously married, many considered it a mere political move on Chen Cheng's end. And yet no matter how much influence Song, Tan or Chiang had on their marriage, Chen and Tan Xiang have proven themselves to be a very harmonious couple. Despite their wedding being held in Kuomintang Guizhou, and despite all the trials and tribulations the two have endured since then, they have endured in their love for eachother. Taking up a position next to her husband, Tan Xiang has skyrocketed from merely trying her best to provide relief for the wounded during the Second Sino-Japanese War to the First Lady of China. Similarly a devout feminist in her political work, Tan Xiang has become vice-president of the Chinese Nurses Association, Girl Scouts, and various other institutions."

Termed as \"Dangwai\", or party outsiders, these few brave political independents are some of the few individuals who continue to run and champion their respective causes in light of the Kuomintang's dominance within the Chinese Government. So pervasive is the Kuomintang, that under Chen Cheng the Dangwai and other political parties have seen a somewhat indirect squashing of any and all influence they could possibly assert on the nation.\n\nEstablishing formal semi-constitutional governance within the nation, Chen and his clique have overseen the further institution of a network of Party Cells throughout every facet of the government, military and society of which every Party member had to belong. With Democratic Centralism as the guiding ideology in polic matters, the network has seen hierarchical authority and Party authority thoroughly reinstituted within the nation.\n\nSplit between an urban shade of the organisation, and a rural one, each Party Cell has meetings to engange in mutual criticism and self-criticism of the membership, and to learn the needs of society alongside the popular opinion of party policy. All in all, these efforts are aimed to develop a political line most supported by the masses. With every Kuomintang member forced into membership, and attendance, a certain level of concrete loyalty, activity and worthiness of each member has been all but assured.\n\nHowever certain voices within the government are insisting for the opposition to be allowed to flourish. Positing that to develop a line most approved by the popular masses, one must acquire such information from voices unbiased to the Party, a procedure has been tabled to the Central Reorganisation Committee that would see a limited amount of pluralisation, allowing Dangwai participation in Party Cell meetings."

It must be observed, however, that while there has not been much change in the total area of land since ancient times, the increase of population, if unchecked, may have not limit at all. In primitive ages, when there was plenty of land with few inhabitants, every person could have as much land as they wanted. Hence, there was no land problem. But in later times, as land became scarce in proportion to increased population, the supply was insufficient to meet the demand.\"\n\nA prolific writer, perhaps better a politician and administrator than a general, Chen Cheng has been sent into a flurry producing statement after statement explaining, with a merit of scientific accuracy, the course and reasoning for his ambitious land reform efforts. Stating that, slowly and rather cruelly, land became not an object by which the people lived upon. But merely an object over whose possession individual fought individual and nation fought nation. Such has the situation of the land deteriorated throughout Chinese history, that whilst it was an agricultural nation, relying upon Heaven's guidance for bread and butter, it still had many starving in the countryside.\n\nAligning with his leftist contemporaries and allies, the \"Little Generalissimo\" has sought a far more radical course than his erstwhile rivals in the New Right. To position land reform in China and its relationship with the peasantry as the very breaking point of the nation, some would decry it dramatic, an overstatement. Yet Chen Cheng is fully convicted in his crusade.

Many sources can be attributed to such periods, at least in their individual contexts, but perhaps the one shared quality, is that of the dynasty and thereby the nation's inability to maintain a proper balance between land and population for any length of time. Shadowing a period of resounding progress and advancement, the population and wealth of the nation would undoubtedly increase with it.\n\nReaching a critical conflict point where land was insufficient, violence would be the immediate answer to the people's qualms. Uprisings, civil conflict, as if it was the scientific application of misery to correct China's balance. With the resulting reduction of population and restoration of the land-population equilibrium, another period of social and political stability would begin; and hereby thrusting the people oncemore into their perennial cycle of bloodshed.\n\nAt least, that is what the \"Little Generalissimo\" posits in his writings, publicised to the masses. To say that remedying a system that has brought down whole civilisations is a tall order would surely be an understatement. Yet there is no man more ambitious, more convinced of his task, than that of Chen Cheng. Conducting a press conference on his recent land reform and economy centralisation efforts, the \"Little Generalissimo\" vigorously proclaimed:\n\n\"With the final implementation of land reform within China, we can break the nation's vicious circle of cyclical war and peace, and also fully develop her industry and trade so as to modernise the national economy and the people's livelihood, and to guarantee and develop political democracy through economic freedom. We may even say that the reforms born today will mark an important change in the course of Chinese history!\"\n\nReceived by resounding proclamations, embellishments of Chen and his statesmanship, they do little to dissuade fears of failure for the ambitious man.

Destruction, a loss of firebrand spirit, the pervasiveness of warlords and corruption of bureaucrats. What was once a National Revolutionary Party is now nothing more than a shuffling corpse.\n\nWhat can be witnissed now between the leadership and Party membership is simply mutual utilisation and indifference. The Leaders do not differentiate between those who are loyal, true party members, and those who are not. The membership for their part simply use the leaders in order to attain personal goals. Even if they do harm to society, as long as they verbally support the leaders' slogans, they are regarded as true comrades. Even amongst party members themselves, they do not love eachother.

And to their benefit, the Brotherhood of Man, or Datong, from Confucianism has made the weak intellectuals of the nation too attached to such concepts. Even worse, the Chinese have borrowed materialism and individualism from the West.

 YUN.endgame.101.d: "Despite the eternal premier's instance on a tutelage-led period of revolutionary reform, even since the early days of the Xinhai Revolution before pessimism pervaded the political thought of the Kuomintang; Dai Jitao himself believed that republicanism lied within the rule of law. As the Kuomintang organisation grew and grew and with it more and more degenerative elements entered the party, Dai continued to insist on maintaining the party's nominal separation of powers even if he is able to forsake individual liberties being sacrificed on behalf of public order.\n\nSince the take over of the New Right, the Party has once more found itself in a convoluted mess as reactionary elements have entered the government with a lack of qualified personnel within the former Kuomintang elements within Yunnan. Liberal opportunists, members of the budding opposition within the China Democratic League, and criticism from the Old Right, warlord generals, and the Left continue to voice their concerns and opposition towards President Dai's regime.\n\nTo his close confidents, one of his preliminary steps towards solidifying the new regime will be to purge party factionalism, which Dai sees has an ever growing tree of disunity, watered by corruption and national weakness. With the secure support of the Central Committee, an executive order has been passed forcing party members who had either drifted or distanced themselves from the KMT in 1911, to re-register with strict examinations on their character, party policy, and Sun's theories. New members are henceforth to be placed under similar scrutiny with only provisional membership being granted in the meantime."

 YUN.endgame.102.d: "During the Right's long exile in Yunnan, party leaders Dai Jitao and Chen Guofu have always managed to play an amicable role in the complex relationship between the military and the civilian wings of the Kuomintang. The Chinese Revolution after all, is one that was determined by military successes, but in accordance with the principles laid out by Dr. Sun - the time for military rule was to come to an end with a period of political led tutelage. Having long been allies with Whampoa's top brass, the leaders of the New Right are now experiencing a strained relationship over the military.\n\nHe Yingqin's resignation from politics has prompted unrest and anger among military personnel who are finding it hard to accept civilian dominance over military affairs. Dai's ambitious plans for reforms are rumored to cut down on military spending, disband large portions of the military (especially mercenaries), and prepare spending for large economic projects.\n\nFurthermore, there are also those within the Whampoa Clique who are outright uneasy with the Generalissmo's retirement from politics, finding themselves increasingly sidelined in the face of political oppurtunism from those within the CC Clique. In their vacuum, the Civil Engineering Clique and the Blue Shirts Society have seemingly taken over the influence of the military, a cautionary warning to the civilian administration of the KMT to not neglect the interests of the National Revolutionary Army."

 YUN.endgame.103.d: "Chen Lifu, Zhang Daopan, and Duan Xipeng are the CC Clique's muscles in the National Reconstruction Commission and have been hard at work bringing major corporations and labour unions under Nationalist control. Chen Lifu has been quoted as saying that \"merely copying Western capitalist or socialist ways of doing things while negating the value of Chinese cultural tradition cannot make China strong!\"\n\nA former mining engineer in Scranton, his education in the United States exposed him to the brutal realities of exploitation and he joined a union led by John L. Lewis in a strike before being recalled home. At the same time, he also was impressed by the American management system with its emphasis on practicality and efficiency. Every phase of the work process was meticulously studied and miners could offer suggestions that companies would adopt and sometimes even reward them for.\n\nThings however are very different in China. In the Kuomintang's drive to assert Chinese control over the economy, there has been significant capital flight from foreign investors and experts leaving major factories and infrastructure. Supply chains have been disrupted in the chaos and corruption has crept in as underqualified or underhanded officials take control. Even Chinese citizens have proven reluctant to invest in these conditions, especially given the stringent requirements placed upon them by the new administration.\n\nChen has bemoaned that while Americans practised individual responsibility at every level, this type of efficiency was not yet possible in his country. Whereas in the US each level reported to the one above and each person performed his part of the work process while emphasising practical results, in China he claims anything that could be done in a day would take two or three days, as though to prove a busy person could not finish his work on time. \"This time-wasting, work-neglecting mentality was a common disease in all government agencies in China,\" something he vows to change."

 YUN.endgame.104.t: "The Land Reform Proposal"
 YUN.endgame.104.d: "As part of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction from the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, land reform remains one of the Kuomintang's most populist measures—a platform from which the Party derives its national legitimacy as a true revolutionary party to liberate the oppressed masses towards the glories of national salvation. It's no secret that the land reform issue remains contentious, as both the Left and Right wings of the Party have splintered along ideological lines regarding its implementation.\n\nWith the New Right's hold over the party line secured, the Party now draws its ears to its two main idealogues Dai Jitao and Chen Lifu in regards to land reform. A National Land Reform Department has been created by the Executive Committee of the Reconstruction Commission of the National Government, spearheaded by the politicians Zhang Lisheng and Zhang Daopan, who have pledged to the people that the Party will fulfill the tedious task of national land reform.\n\nBelieving that the country's future lies in its rapid industrialisation, Dai Jitao has opined that the Party should instead focus on investments to the industrialisation of the country's coastal developed areas which would spur economic development in the countryside. His policies, which have been applauded by members of the gentry and the landowning class, insist on maintaining provinical land autonomy rather than government intervention.\n\nAs Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the Reconstruction Commission, Chen Lifu has voiced for the need for extensive land reform under careful government supervision. Unlike Dai's lassiez-faire approach, Chen has argued that the government ought to take the initiative and to undertake the arduous task through the careful lenses of government bureaucracy in order to minimise corruption and to improve government efficacy in domestic affairs."
 YUN.endgame.104.a: "Dai is right, we must focus on industrialising the country first."
 YUN.endgame.104.b: "Chen Lifu's proposals for expansion are correct."

 YUN.endgame.105.t: "New Culture"
 YUN.endgame.105.d: "In the years following the success of the Xinhai Revolution, a vibrant wave of new thoughts, philosophies, and ideas arrived from the nations of the West into China. Philosophers and intellectuals like Chen Duxiu and Hu Shih hailed the New Culture Movement as an escapade from the brutal world of warlordism. Western culture was hailed as a corrective source for Chinese culture's now established passivity and irrationalism. Conservative thinkers like Liang Shuming disagreed, declaring that western philosophies were incompatible with Chinese culture, a view supported by Zhang Junmai.\n\nWhile he initially agreed with the attempts to revolutionise national culture, Dr. Sun Yat-sen ultimately found the movement to be unpatriotic. He proclaimed that the Kuomintang was the keeper of Chinese morality and the nation, and his followers like Dai Jitao soon followed suit. This became the foundation of the New Life Movement, a Neo-Confucian counter-attack. Preaching that a new age was coming, New Life thinkers invoked Confucian ideas of collective life (gongsheng) and the utopian vision of world unity (datong). A revitalised moral community and human performativity would produce this coming epoch of human civilisation.\n\nChen Lifu is a late comer to the discussion, trained to be a flexible propagandist for the party. Accusing everything not grounded in Confucian moral teachings as Syndicalist, his lectures at the Central Political Institute combined western vitalist philosophy, traditional Chinese cosmology drawn from Yijing (the Book of Changes), Daxue (Great Learning), and Zhongyong (Doctrine of the Mean), and the teachings of Dr. Sun and Dai Jitao. While many within the Party see the New Culture Movement as ultimately a necessary component of the Chinese National Revolution, there are certainly those such as the followers of Dai Jitao who believe that the country ought to revert to its Confucian path. A growing number of the young guards within the party's intelligentsia offer that Confucianism and the concept of Vitalism should be incorporated to fuse both Western and Chinese philosophies to create a true hybrid revolutionary culture."

 YUN.endgame.105.c: "A hybrid revolutionary culture is what will save China."

 YUN.endgame.106.t: "Black Heart of the White Sun"
 YUN.endgame.106.d: "In 1911, the late Qing philosopher Li Zongwu described the so-called \"Thick Black Theory\" phenomenon. In this treatise, he described a modern interpretation of the traditional philosophical Chinese discourse on colours - describing forces of ruthlessness and the hidden, a metaphorical allusion to those that rule from the shadows but with a complete and authoritative evil. Black as a colour reminds people of the forces underground, of those not necessarily seen, and evokes the image of organised crime and the Triads.\n\nDuring the old revolutionary days, the difference between a gangster and a revolutionary was very thin. Both were fundamentally fraternal, \"organised criminals\" trying to evade authorities and dealing in weapons, human smuggling, and information. Adding to the complication is even notorious gang leaders often were genuinely nationalistic and republican. At times, the line between the black forces that pervaded society and the heroic revolutionary martyrs, seemed increasingly blurred.\n\nThe old Zhejiang Society of Revolutionary Comrades often worked closely with the criminal underworld of Shanghai such as the Green Gangs, even if in the present day as party members and politicians, they insist they were never formal members. In the devastating trauma that was the failed Second Revolution; Dai Jitao, Chen Qimei, and Chiang Kai-shek all did what they had to do to survive during the revolution. With Chinese political culture putting personal trust and connections at a premium, it is no surprise that many people of ill repute have found their way into the CC Clique-dominated government.\n\nRooting corruption will not be an easy task. There are many voices in the government, those out in the parliamentary halls of the Legislative Yuan and those hidden away in the darkness of society. While President Dai has explicitly voiced his desire to see the government fully purged of corrupt elements, younger members of the party, including Chen Lifu, have voiced restraint and tact to avoid the fallouts of a political scandal involving corruption, nepotism, and greed. Furthermore, they have argued that the forces of dark may actually be utilised by the government to suppress and hold dissident and unruly voices."

 YUN.endgame.107.d: "Inspired by the grandiose pictures held in Paris to commemorate the socialist revolutionary cause or the burgeoning Russian film industry that glamorises the spectacular nature of the SZRS, the domineering figureheads of the CC Clique, Chen Lifu and Guofu have mentioned the Kuomintang's necessity to reach the masses through modern media. The culture and the arts argues the elder Chen, ought to showcase the beauty and brilliance of Chinese civilisation, while also upholding the Party's duty to instruct and guide the masses into the Three Principles of the People.\n\nWhile films and the arts of a political nature have traditionally been dominated by the political left, the dominance of the New Right has led to virtually every leftist filmmaker, actor, or actress being censored under new careful party scrutiny. Under the popular playwright Zhang Daopan, the Chairman of the Chinese Artist Association, a new National Drama School has been created in Nanjing to popularise Chinese opera and classical music as a contrast to the degenerative Western music that flourishes in the Legation Cities. As new film makers such as Zhu Shilin are leading the rebirth of Chinese cinema following the mass censure of left-wing artists, the Chen brothers themselves have organised the Association for Film Education to give annual prizes to the three most outstanding films based on their education content and dedication to national patriotism."

 YUN.endgame.108.t: "Decree on Law and the Humanities"
 YUN.endgame.108.d: "As part of National Reconstruction, one of the fundamental goals of the national revolution was to revitalise education in China, to expand education efforts beyond just mere studies of Western modernity, but also to foster a new generation of revolutionary youth. The spirit of educational modernity was one of the first major steps of reform even before the Kuomintang, educators like Cai Yuanpei endeavored to birth a new generation of revolutionary-minded intellectuals dedicated to the revitalisation of China.\n\nPremier Chen Guofu has proposed however, a controversial law to be passed which would reduce funding and close down the law and humanities departments within Chinese universities for the next ten years. During this decade, the government would then set up quotas for the number of graduates needed in agriculture, engineering, and medicine - ultimately arguing that the number of students in the technical fields ought to be greatly expanded over those in the legal fields.\n\nThe move has attracted considerable controversy within the Chinese academic world and even within the CC Clique. Many CC Clique members, such as Zhu Guangqian, have intellectual and educational backgrounds. Deng Xipeng, the first President of the Student Federation of the Republic of China and head of the history department at Sun Yat-sen University, the historian Luo Jialun, and the Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association Zhang Daopan have joined in on this appeal. Zhu Guangqian in particular has even gone as far as to say that the Party ought not to interfere with civil education.\n\nOf course, the irony is that those within the CC Clique do adhere to an idealistic form of Chinese traditional history as well as the legalistic principles that guided the first Qin Empire. And of course, there is the question, that if there are no lawyers to protect and interpret the laws for the citizens; and if there are no historians to protect and teach history to the people - then who really knows the truth in the country?"

 YUN.endgame.120.d: "Over the years, many have claimed to have understood the complicated dialectic work of the late Eternal Premier - yet none of them have been able to reach the genius and understanding of the Three Principles of the People than Dai Jitao. Certainly the ideology of the party has been diluted with the debacle of warlordist military officers and Marxist-oriented counter-revolutionaries. But at last, we may have achieved a true understanding of the National Revolution; for it is only under President Dai who may fitfully call himself the Apostle of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nRecently published to be intended as both party doctrine and his memoirs, the President has recently finished his magnum opus: \"Revolutionary Wisdom and Revolutionary Work.\" According to the Ministry of Education, it is mandatory literature in order to foster the new revolutionary youth to understand and comprehend the principles of the New China.\n\nIn it, Dai implores his readers to look upon the revolutionaries of the past and understand their successes and failures. He writes that \"We have to seek progress and resolve problems with the doctrine as our goal. But we must not forget the historical and cosmopolitan mission that extends from ancient times to the present day, from China to the world.\" Indeed, in his opening and concluding remarks, Dai declares that The Three Principles of the People are the peak crystilisation of revolution, that it rejects Marxism and liberalism, and proclaims a new wholly unique ideology dedicated to the preservation of the Chinese race.\n\nIndeed it must be that, only Dai Jitao can be considered the true apostle of the Late Premier's will for the nation."

 YUN.endgame.121.t: "Religions and the Task of National Salvation"
 YUN.endgame.121.d: "As a great country with a variety of faiths stretching from not just native Chinese folk religions but also Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism (which held foreign origins but have been adopted in various sects and faiths throughout China), the question of religion has inevitably arisen with the dominance of the New Right. While many of the party's original members including Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek were expressed members of the Christian faith, the question of religion has generally been avoided for the sake of national unity.\n\nPresident Dai, a devout Buddhist since an early life-changing conversion, has voiced his support for a nation grounded on virtue, chivalry, and morals. He argues that while religion cannot be accepted uncritically, nor opposed, nor dismissed out of hand, the only course remaining is to work toward reforming it so that it might unify the Chinese people. His personal journey with Buddhism, from his early conversion to his current leadership, connects his beliefs and values with those of the nation, inspiring a new wave of moral leadership.\n\nTo place a greater emphasis on religious observance, the Party has officially commenced Buddhist holidays to be observed with the same rigor as the holidays of October 10th (to commmemorate the Wuchang Uprising), the birth and death date of the eternal premier Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the death of the 72 martyrs in Guangzhou. School assemblies and public gatherings are to be frequented by monks and religious speakers, with the goal of promoting a morally upright education for the future youth of China.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Monoglian and Tibeaten Affairs have officially promoted the Tibeaten faith of Tibeaten Mahayana Buddhism which is observed by those in Tibet, Mongolia, and Bhutan. While Chinese remains of course the official language and script to be used in public, the Ministry has officially stated that Tibeaten can be used in religious practices and that the study of the tantric texts should be promoted and protected under national law."
 YUN.endgame.121.a: "Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, we seek a true moral and honest nation."

 YUN.endgame.122.t: "A Buddhist Nationalism"
 YUN.endgame.122.d: "Since its entry into Chinese popular religions in the Tang Dynasty, the veneration of the Buddha has undergone both renaissance and fall in China. Ever since the anti-Manchu Taiping Rebellion, Buddhism has undergone a steady decline - seen by many Han nationalists as foreign and un-Chinese. Yet the teachings of the Buddha still remain popular amongst Chinese intelligentsia, with some proposing that Buddhism retain its strength and hegemony in cultural circles rather than in the political arena.\n\nFor President Dai who claimed to have been saved by the Buddha during a failed suicide attempt, Buddhism may very well be the key to national salvation in the form of \"Buddhist Nationalism.\" As he fell into the river , he claimed he was uplifted by a torrent of holy Buddhist light which brought him into the hands of a fisherman. This remarkable encounter tied him to the notion of a shared nationalist consciousness between the deities above and the everyday Chinese person, bridging the divide between the divine and the ordinary. Inspired by the Japanese reforms on Buddhism from a popular religion to one that inculcated a spirit of sacrifice in feudal Japan, Dai believes that Buddhism's doctrine of morality, virtues, and asceticism what are needed to revert decades of moral degeneration throughout China.\n\nOpposed to traditional popular religious beliefs such as ancestor worship and local deities to which Dai claims as \"superstitions\", Dai argues that Buddhism will strengthen the will of the people so that sacrifices of all nature can be incentivised. It is only through the reformation of Buddhism, as the spiritual sword and shield of the nation, that Chinese citizens will offer their lives for the glory and sanctity of the nation akin to the Bodhistivas of old; men and women becoming this century's Guanyin and Wenshu."

 YUN.endgame.140.d: "Since his ascension to the presidency of the Republic of China, Chen Lifu has often spent many long hours in his office, dreaming and scheming of the days to come. At long last, the revolution that the two Chen brothers and their mentor had worked for had finally reached a stage of completion.\n\nAs he muses for the future of China, he pens in his journal - his firm conviction that the new Chinese state will supersede any nation that may have come before it. The new state has both the custodial responsibility of all of its citizens and the technological know-how to create a truly modern yet moral society. By combining the moral virtues of the East and the technological ways of the West, it was indeed possible to engineer and facilitate the revival of the Chinese race and civilisation.\n\nHe smiles as he pens his remaining thoughts, that this new China will be what he calls as the Radiant Future. A China organised from province to province, district to district, village to village in the form of moral communities. The people will share together a common duty to serve the state and their families, held together by the comforts of love and sanctuary - with all moral ailments and vices cast away in favor of a new, righteous, evolved class of individuals who will exemplify the revolutionary consciousness.

 YUN.endgame.141.d: "Rumours that Dai Jitao has been preparing to retire has been swirling around [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for several months now, something that was finally confirmed a few weeks ago when President Dai submitted his resignation to the Central Executive Committee.\n\nFurther speculation about his successor abounded as the CEC met behind closed doors. The leading candidates were Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, and some whispered about the possibility of a military candidate. In the end however, the message behind Dai Jitao's choice of successor was unmistakable - his young, fiery protégé Chen Lifu would become President. About a decade younger but already boasting an accomplished resume working with other leading figures such as Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, and Sun Fo, Dai's choice indicates his desire to pass the reins onto the next generation, the one that fought during the Northern Expedition rather than in Xinhai. His choice also solidifies the civilian leadership of the party, ending a long rein of military dominance on the right.\n\nIn support of his brother's candidacy, Chen Guofu has stepped down as Premier to avoid the appearance of nepotism. Chen Bulei (no relation), an intellectual close to Dai, is expected to be appointed in his place as a steady hand behind the Executive Yuan. Chen's ascent is expected to herald in an age of more collective leadership rather than the party strong-man style that has existed since Dr. Sun, but it would be unwise to discount the numerous ideas the young man has of his own.\n\nA grand ceremony has been thrown in Dai and Chen's honour, even as the former joked during his toast that he is not going away anytime soon. Indeed, both are expected to retain their positions on the CEC even as Dai intends to mostly retire from public life, musing either spending more time in religious studies or taking up a teaching position at Sun Yat-sen University."

 YUN.endgame.142.t: "The Chief Task of Human Evolution"
 YUN.endgame.142.d: "In writing his own theories on philosophy, Chen Lifu has created his very own intellectual orientation, his doctrine of vitalism. To introduce the complicated dialectic, Chen first introduces the concept that the goal of humanity, is to dominate the universe and nature - all things natural fall into a natural hierarchy of spiritual and material qualities.\n\nHe rejects Henri Bergson's claim that choice was crticial to progress, arguing that humanity cannot handle freedom- excessive freedom promotes social conflict, and man ought to focus on efficency. Vitalism is the solution to excess consumption and freedom. Vitalism comes from Chen's own study of traditional Chinese medicine and western philosophy, arguing that vitalist elements make up all matter. These elements are the tiniest, most fundamental things in the universe but they constitute parts of everything, in his own pretension to proposing scientific theory - Chen has redefined the atom and matter in a manner akin to Hans Driesch's theory of entelechy. If that is the case, then the party which is made up of people, carries vitalism - vitalism thus must be strengthened within party members in order to improve natural human efficency.\n\nIt is with this idea, that he has even gone as far as to say that it might be beneficial for those who don't contribute to society to die as they merely just consume resources. To Chen, it is those who are worthy, who carry these compoments of strong vitalism - that are the natural predecessors towards the final evolved form of humanity."

 YUN.endgame.143.t: "Revival of Chinese Medicine"
 YUN.endgame.143.d: "Traditional Chinese medicine (zhongyi) is an alternative medicine practice drawn from traditional medicine in China. The practices of traditional Chinese medicine include health and healing practices, Confucian philosophy, diet, exercise, acupuncture, and various schools of thought. These forms of holistic healing have been long practiced by the Chinese, with some of the earliest works on Eastern therapeutic activities dating back to the Shang Dynasty (14th-11th centuries BCE).\n\nTraditional medicine rejects Western practices like injections, surgery, and pharmaceutical drugs; rather, it relies on concepts invoking circulation channels, one's \"qi\", and exploring the relationship between the divine, the cosmos, and the human experience. Since the growth of western knowledge in China, some more liberal-minded reformers have advocated for growing studies on Western medicine rather than Chinese medicine, seeing the latter as a figment of a more archaic time.\n\nHowever, Chen Lifu, is a long-standing supporter of traditional Chinese medicine, owing much of it to the development of his own theories of vitality. As one of the founders of the Chinese Medical Institute (CMI) as a means to combine the best of both the West and the East. A profound reflection of his eclectic ideology, which seeks to syncretise the West and the East, the CMI carries both Western physicians and physicians trained in traditional Chinese medicine to provide a multi-step plan of care, providing both alternative and modern means of healing. While some of the country's leading physicians have voiced doubts on the matter, given the Institute's relatively new lifespan, one can hardly determine whether or not Chen Lifu's plan will indeed succeed in creating a new and unique orthodoxy in Chinese medical studies."

For Tan and Zhang, Provisional Action was a new start for a new revolutionary movement, one independent of the machinations of men like Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nYet with the arrival of Deng Yanda and Song Qingling to Shanghai following their own escape from the encroaching Warlord forces, the movement became co-opted by the dynamic duo. Instead of projection from outside the Kuomintang, the Provisional Action Committee would instead steer towards reforming the KMT from within.\n\nNow with President Zhang at the head of the nation, it is ultimately up to him, and Marshal Zhu, as to the character of their rule. For there is no position for a Red Napoleon to coup their movement no longer. Presently there exists two options for the President and Premier.

 YUN.endgame.205.t: "The New Kuomintang's Land Reform"
 YUN.endgame.205.d: "Land reform is one of the most pressing and most divisive issues in contemporary China, with considerable social, economic, and political implications. The Kuomintang's rural agenda is anchored in Sun Yat-sen's Land-To-The-Tiller proposals, which have become an integral part of the party's National Reconstruction Agenda.\n\nIn this more orthodox approach to the land reform, most Kuomintang theoreticians call primarily for a land rent cap to eliminate extortionate rents by landlords, which often are demanded at full value even in bad harvests. These contracts are often undocumented and enforced by gentry-hired militias, and cause many peasants to fall deeper into debt. The party has advocated for greatest government oversight and regulation for rural contracts. There are also two other major legs to the Kuomintang land reform programme.\n\nThe first is streamlining taxation by the government, which has grown increasingly burdensome and cumbersome thanks to overlapping jurisdictions, wartime needs, and blatant corruption. Conservatives have argued that land redistribution is pointless, and would rather focus on promoting economic development that can facilitate industrialisation, suggesting that we cooperate with business and agricultural leaders to encourage infrastructure construction like shared granaries and water control infrastructure. Along with greater military policing of rural areas and funding land banks, this would raise the fortunes of the countryside as a whole.\n\nThe second is compulsory purchases of large estates, targeting in particular absentee landlords. The government is then supposed to sell the land to the tenant farmers that till the land and/or promote cooperatives. Leftists in the party have advised we take it further, with uncompensated nationalisations and mandatory participation in communes.\n\nAs the unifiers of China, we are now bestowed with the authority to begin this large scale national project that may reshape Chinese society forever."

## Zhang Bojun Exclusive (220-239)
 YUN.endgame.220.t: "The United Front Work Department"
 YUN.endgame.220.d: "Perhaps one of the most controversial moves that is on the campaign platform of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], at least in the eyes of the mainstream Party, is that of the matter co-operation and ties with China's innumerous Dangwai, all of which have loosely coalesced around the newly established China Democratic League. Bringing forth some of China's greatest democratic minds such as Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, Zhou Shizhao, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Li Huang, Xu Qin, Liu Chongyou and numerous others, the party is perhaps the lasting legacy of Liang Qichao's work with the nation. Uniting the Young China Party, the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, the China Vocational Educattion Society, the China National Democratic Construction Association and many other minor democratic parties, they have formalised into a block of likeminded reformers, willing to engage in good faith with the government.\n\nWith President Zhang's daring quest to construct a broad United Front for a brighter future of the Chinese nation, alongside his numerous friendships with many of the CDL's leaders, there has been provisional plans to enter into a United Front not too dissimilar to that of the old United Front between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Syndicalist Party. However such a move has seen a rising simmer of discontent from within [ROOT.GetRulingParty], as the only possiblities for sister parties is that of the CSP, or the CDL.\n\nBoth naturally have their drawbacks, with the CDL distrusted by hardliners of Zhang's own party, they similarly are apprehensive of socialism in practice. On the other hand, the CSP has reached a level of estrangement with President Zhang, following the revolt against the Central Committee. Some within the President's camp however, have even begun to advise against such measures, reasoning that the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] is fully capable of building a democratic socialist future on its own terms."

 YUN.endgame.221.t: "Healing the PAC Rift"
 YUN.endgame.221.d: "The Provisional Action Committee, as it stands now, was not originally intended to be a faction of the Kuomintang. No, it was intended to be a fresh start. A new party, not shackled by the failures of the Party State in its ambitions to unite the nation. Originally promulgated as the brainchild of Zhang Bojun and Tan Pingshan shortly after the Northern Expedition's collapse, the fate of the prototype PAC would ultimately be sealed by the founder's invitation to Song Qingling and Deng Yanda to the founding proceedings. Ultimately supplanting Zhang and Tan as the centre of the movement, the PAC would become the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang, intent on reforming the party from within.\n\nSwiftly becoming disillusioned by Song and Deng's leadership and suspicious towards the Third Internationale, Tan would soon depart from the mainline PAC, intending to host his own regionalist branch where he would be king. Meanwhile Zhang would remain closely tied to the Deng Yanda line, ultimately following the committee until being sent to Yunnan province.\n\nIn a parallel vein of thought another internal Kuomintang opposition faction to have risen in light of Wang Jingwei's Central Committee is that of the National Revolutionary Army's 10th Army, and its leader Chen Mingshu. An amicable man who has a close friendship with President Zhang, he has been left afloat in the new Chinese political order. Generally opposing class warfare, he takes a far more reformist spin on Chinese socialism. Of course, even within Wang's own camp and in-between there were dissenters. Gu Mengyu and his Reorganised Comrades Association-Moderates, or Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction.\n\nAttempting to bridge the political divide to strengthen the nation, Zhang has sought out these varied groups to ascertain their willingness to collaborate. Privy to the third parties, and more democratic than Tan or Deng and Song, Zhang also maintains the traditionally Marxist character of the PAC, at least compared to the likes of Gu, Chen or Sun. And so ultimately whomever the President brings to his side will at least provide a unique perspect for the Party and Government."

 YUN.endgame.222.t: "The Zhang Family Library"
 YUN.endgame.222.d: "A prolific writer from a young age, President Zhang has always been in some way, shape, or form immersed in the world of literature and writing. A studious and diligent student in his youth, Zhang would travel to Wuchang Normal University in 1916, at a mere 20 years old and in practical poverty, yet would nonetheless be admitted to their English Department. Becoming fast friends with the likes of Yun Daiying, Zhang would participate in Yun's Liqun Book Club. Meeting the famous Xiao Chu'nu through Yun, Zhang would ultimately start his own reading club and student union under their guidance.\n\nBringing his love of literature wherever he went, Zhang would briefly serve as principal of Xuancheng Normal University in Anhui before embarking to Germany in 1922 to study at the University of Berlin. Garnering a degree in philosophy, Zhang would be roommates with Zhu De, and would even consider joining the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nUpon his return to the nation, Zhang began to collect a wide variety of books from all walks of life. Including 277 Ming editions with 2,239 volumes, 53 Qing editions with 323 volumes, and numerous other types of literature. A prolific reader and writer, it is reported that in his downtime from governmental office, Zhang appreciates nothing more than resting within his recently constructed family library, surrounded by his tomes. Numbering nearly 10,000 volumes in total, the Zhang Family Library has become a titanic collection, truly displaying his love for the medium.\n\nEarnest, idealistic, adoring, the library is but a singular testament to Zhang's utter dedication to his craft, an energy he brings to the political field. Perhaps even such a discipline shall translate into Zhang's children, only time will tell."

 YUN.endgame.223.d: "Ever rushing forward, ever ambitiously swinging the dial towards progress and utopia. That is the mission upon which President Zhang and Premier Zhu have dedicated their lives towards. Loyal to a fault, and crippingly idealistic, Zhang has had to endure a constant haranguing from all sides of the political battlefield. Despite his heart bleeding for socialism and democracy, he is levied with accusations of being a rightist infiltrator from his compatriots on the Left. On the opposite hand, beguiled as a leftist detractor by his compatriots on the Right. And yet in his heart he cannot fault them for their opinions. Devoted to his cause, he has even gone so far as to hold a speech to address such claims.\n\n\"Everyone does not have to share the same thoughts and political views, and in fact, they cannot share the same views. Forcing people to share the same views, or forcing them to shame the same views, is futile. How can we live in peace and coexistence among differences? The only way is to abide by the spirit of democracy, establishing a democratic system, respecting eachother's differences, accepting criticisms, learning from others' strengths and making up for one's own weaknesses.\"\n\nResigned to his role as the nation's dutiful servant and struggling idealist, the President is not alone, that is true. Backed extensively by the army and its Marshal, alongside all of his friends and allies, Zhang has managed to provide the nation its much necessitated stability. With it the foundations of a new Chinese Republic. Reflecting, he can only hope that his efforts will bring forth the socialist democracy that the Chinese Peasants and Workers so desperately deserve."

## Zhu Peide Exclusive (240-259)
 YUN.endgame.240.t: "The [GetYear] Party Election"
 YUN.endgame.240.d: "United once more as Student and Teacher, the vanguard duo of the legendary Li Genyuan and stalwart Zhu Peide managed to successfully weather all storms that crashed against their walls. Navigating opposition from radicals on the left and right, the Kuomintang regime would aid in the ever relentless stride of the National Revolution. And in the Party's darkest moment, Li and Zhu would march forward like their beloved Cai E had done decades before.\n\nDespite their triumphs it has become swiftly apparent that the Li-Zhu alliance is coming to its conclusion. With his ambitions difficult to sate, and having re-entered the spotlight with the backing of his old allies in the well-funded Political Science Clique, Li Genyuan has utilised the clique's full political machine to stake his own claim for party leadership of the Kuomintang.\n\nFor his part Zhu Peide has been rumoured to be in talks with better established factions within the party, dangling a potential Premiership to entice them to his side. Evidently, Zhu aims to push Li from power and install a more amenable candidate. Amongst his suitors are the three major titans of the old right: Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction, Zou Lu and Western Hills, and even that of Hu Hanmin and the Elders Clique. Enticed by a return to power, they are also suspicious of Li Genyuan and the PSC with their deviation from party orthodoxy.\n\nUnder immense pressure, Zhu has been forced into calling for an election for Chairmanship of the Party, and with it the Presidency of the Republic. Having lost his main pillar of support, Zhu has been forced to scramble for allies and a major agreement with the Old Right would grant him enough votes to consolidate support. On the flipside, Li has begun to parley with his old close friend Gu Zhongxiu, a traditional North KMT-Beiyang candidate. However, Zhang Qun has made his move pressing the young guard of the PSC to sponsor Yang Yongtai as his Premier."

 YUN.endgame.241.t: "The National Defence Fortification Plan"
 YUN.endgame.241.d: "Constantly beset by outsider invaders since time immemorial, the Chinese nation has endured tragedy in a cyclical process of war upsetting the dynastic world order. This is readily apparent in the recent besetting of the Second Sino-Japanese War upon the nation. Wreaking havoc, national trauma and turmoil upon the Chinese People, none know such a travesty better than her nation's soldiers.\n\nIntending to prevent future invasions at all costs, Generalissimo Zhu Peide has drafted a plan with his greatest strategic fellows of the Third Army. Entailing a total fortification effort, the Government would finance an expansion of fort and transportation lines in preparation to both repel an invasion and transport military supplies to potential frontlines of a presumed invasion. Split into three lines of national defence, the first would span from Jinan to Baoding. The second line would run from Yanzhou to Anyang, and the Southeast would have the Xicheng line. In addition, the cities of Nanjing, Wuhan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Hangzhou, Wusong and other critical urban centres would receive additional urban fortifications.\n\nSecretly selecting personnel from various military and political departments alongside the military academies, with additional guidance from foreign experts, Zhu has begun to survey the terrain and draft further plans to build defensive positions in Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Dividing the area into three defence zones, the defence system would be tailor made according to the different terrains of the zones: namely the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the Shanghai-Hangzhou area and the Nanjing area.\n\nHailed as a resounding investment for the future definite safety and protection of the nation by Zhu's allies in the NRA and Government, there have been concerns raised by the Political Science Clique. While they had endorsed heavy industry prioritisation prior to unification, Li Genyuan and his technocratic allies are pushing for a focus on ambitious planning for economic modernisation, rather than militarisation. While they support investments into transportations, especially railroads, they stubbornly refuse further investment into fortifications."

 YUN.endgame.242.t: "The Fate of the Third Army Leftists"
 YUN.endgame.242.d: "A most pertinent feature of the Third Army of the National Revolutionary Army is its dual-faced nature within the broader informal party schism. Owing itself to the brotherhood fostered in the Kunming Military Academy, various leftists have managed to entrench themselves within the Third Army under the ostensible auspices of the renowned Zhu De. Relying upon his foundational friendship with the likes of Jin Handing and Zhu Peide, Zhu De has managed to transform the Third Army into that of a moderate grouping amongst the NRA.\n\nHowever with the unification of the nation, and the thrusting of the Third Army into national prominence, the influence and persisting existence of the more socialistic elements of the Third Army have come into question. Derided by much of the Old Right of the Party, the state of the leftists within its ranks is in limbo. For his part, [ROOT.GetLeader] has remained apprehensive to act in light of such fury, instead waiting to see where the wind blows. With true ejection from the party hardly being considered, many are still clamouring for an official sort of \"pariah\" status for Zhu De and his corterie.\n\nTo make matters worse, most recently the righteous, reckless and rowdy commander Li Mi has begun to inflame tensions further by engaging in active skirmishes with various National Revolutionary formations deemed to be under control of the \"left\". Officially condemned by the majority of the party, Li Mi for his part has simply suggested he is doing what [ROOT.GetLeader] cannot. It is becoming readily apparent that an official statement necessitates publication, with much of the Political Science Clique pressing for the eradication of their influence whilst the general Third Army consensus is that of reconciliation."

 YUN.endgame.243.t: "Rule of the Orthodox Generalissimo"
 YUN.endgame.243.d: "An oddly reflective mist has settled itself within the nation. In stark contrast to the atmosphere of chaos, suffering and bloodshed that had commonly permeated all provinces of China for the last few decades, instead one finds a stern, and cautious, air of what is perhaps considered to be optimism. Reflecting upon his long-spanning and terribly storied career, Generalissimo Zhu Peide is perhaps the epitome of a revolutionary soldier, through and through. Embroiled in the life of a warrior at a young age, Zhu's patriotism — and revolutionary sentiment ushered by Li Genyuan — would see him fight in Xinhai as part of the Double Ninth Uprising. Forming a bond forged by blood with the likes of Zhu De, Fan Shisheng, Jin Handing, Tang Huaiyuan and numerous others from Kunming, Zhu would spill his own blood and risk his own life to transform his nation.\n\nTime and time again he answered the bell of revolution. Be it through the National Protection War, the Constitutional Protection War, the Northern Expedition and every conflict in-between. And so it would once again fall on Zhu's shoulders to rally the National Revolutionary Army in its darkest moments, and continue the Long March as planned out by the late Chiang Kai-shek. Acting as Generalissimo in the Party's most dim hour, Zhu would propel the Party once more to prominence; fulfilling the unification of the nation.\n\nPerhaps even time hasn't slowed him down one bit, as the Generalissimo has whizzed away in this period of national reconstruction attempting to fulfill his duties of statesmanship to their very best. And despite concerns about being upended by the ambitious Li Genyuan, Zhu and his ally [ROOT.GetSecondInCommand] have managed to secure a future accord for the nation. One in which the New Right and Old Right overcome their differences, one where constitutional rule is prioritised — whatever form it takes — and one where the National Revolution is fulfilled to its utmost. The nation can rest well, safeguarded by its most loyal defender."

 YUN.endgame.244.t: "Resurgence of Kunming's True Hero"
 YUN.endgame.244.d: "Possibly one of the more ironic twists of fate, it was not the revolutionary young guard that ushered in the new era of National Revolution. Nor was it the Kuomintang party core, those loyal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the utmost. Instead it was the one of the grandfathers of revolutionary sentiment within the Chinese nation. For it was Li Genyuan; son of the Yunnan gentry, Li Genyuan; father of the Kunming Military Academy, and Li Genyuan; rival to Cai E, that has been thrust to the Presidency of the nation. A founding Tongmenghui member, a revolutionary hero, and a shining statesman. Li's career is evidence that one's hard dedication, grit, and determination can allow anyone to persevere and endure under the most difficult circumstances.\n\nArranging for Cai E to return to Kunming in 1915, Li would participate from the very beginning in leading the charge against Yuan Shikai's maddening despotism. Briefly taking a leading role in the Southern Military Affairs Council and as Governor of Shaanxi, Li would ultimately find himself once again corralling the soldiers of the Yunnan Army. Ultimately scorned by Tang Jiyao and Li Liejun, Li would leave for Beijing to participate in the political scene there. However his influence in the south would remain, albeit short lived. With Yang Yongtai's attempted ousting of Sun Yat-sen from Guangdong alongside his protégé Gu Pinzhen's forsaken rule in Yunnan fizzling out, Li would ultimately retire following Cao Kun's bribery scandal.\n\nYet one can hardly keep an old dog down. Returning to national prominence following the Kuomintang's seizure of Yunnan, Li would immediately set out to ensure that this time his ambitions shall not be fettered. Originally a founding member of the Political Science Society, and European Research Affairs Society, alongside maintaining contact with Northern Political Science Clique members such as Gu Zhongxiu and Huang Fu, Li would find himself at a critical juncture in the life of Political Science. Ousting Zhu Peide in a maverick move of political brilliance, the Old Political Science Clique has managed to finally fulfill their duty ingrained into them as revolutionary soldiers. One thing is for certain, old soldiers never get sick of the wetwork."

 YUN.endgame.260.d: "Eponymous with the Political Science Clique is that of its pseudo-military status, blurring the lines between the world of civilian affairs and the battlefield, many of its higher echelons — albeit the clique itself is egalitarian — have seen some sort of military experience. Be it Li Genyuan's storied career on and off the field, Zhang Qun's role in ordinance armaments and as a staff officer, or Huang Fu's position as Chen Qimei's Chief of Staff. And in the young guard such a tradition remains.\n\nRecently the rising star and prominent Political Science darling Xiong Shihui has made a dashing display upon the Kuomintang's political scene, throwing lavish parties, being an excellent administrator and capable political officer. Alas however, Xiong as of recent has landed him in the core of a recent scandal that has embroiled [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration, ultimately reinforcing the common perception that the PSC is embedded with political corruption.\n\nDubbed the \"Yangtze Opium Ring\" by domestic media in a facsimile of the infamous corruption scandal of the Ulysses S. Grant administration in the United States, a steamer en route from Hankou to Shanghai was recently stopped and searched by local police. Under the authority of the Municipality of Greater Shanghai, the police managed to dredge out that the steamer was in fact carrying a bounty of opium on the orders of Commander Xiong Shihui. Brought forward to the Nationalist Government by Zhang Dinfan, a known rival of Xiong, [ROOT.GetLeader] was forced into setting up the National Opium Suppression Committee with the aims of deliberating the investigation. Ultimately however the Chairman of the Committee is at the whims of the President, and therefore the fate of Xiong is to be determined by [ROOT.GetLeader] himself.\n\nOn one hand, the government could pull the strings behind the committee to ensure Xiong's protection with whatever drawbacks that may entail. It would at the very least ensure a rising star is not smothered before it can soar. On the other hand, perhaps the President would prefer to let things play out, salvaging the Political Science Clique's reputation by making a grand display of punitive justice for opium smuggling."

Implementing a unified leadership system of party, government and army, Xiong has effectively made himself \"Kingpin of Jiangxi\". Reorganising it completely in administration, he has gone as far as to appoint his confidants to the province's recently established nine administrative districts, and implement the \"single tax system\".\n\nIn accordance with his reform efforts however, the media has picked up Xiong's establishment of the National Nanchang University, turning it into a media frenzy. Receiving 1 million yuan from the Ministry of Education, Xiong has managed to ensure the founding of the comprehensive university in order to derive the concepts of \"greatness, centrality, and righteousness\". With the first president being the famous \"Father of Chinese Botany\" Dr. Hu Xianqian, a renowned scholar, scientist, and promoter of traditional Chinese culture, it has embarked on an ambitious project to uplift Jiangxi's populace, turning it into a new haven for scientific research.\n\nAttracting many other famous scholars to the faculty, the university can count amongst its staff: Dean of the College of Engineering Cai Fangyin, Dean of the College of Arts Wang Yi, and Dean of the College of Agriculture Zhou Shilu.

With Political Science's seizure of the facets of government, the Revolutionary party has transformed into that of a truly stable, national one. And the character of its governance is not any more evident than in the oozing personality of its President, [ROOT.GetLeader].\n\nBehind the veil of closed doors, of bureaucracy, and of administration, Zhang himself is the epitome of a charismatic gentleman. A renowned calligrapher and keen art collector, he has been known to frequent the Chinese art scene even before the Presidency. A friend of many famous greats of the 20th century such as the legendary Zhang Daqian — the greatest master at replicating the traditional masters' own calligraphy — or even that of Ran In-ting, famed Taiwanese watercolour extraordinaire, and that of Huang Junbi, a painter of magnificent landscapes.\n\nIn the academic world, the Liberal Maverick has similarly made magnificent strides. Awarded honorary doctorates from several universities, including the University of Illinois, Seoul National University, St. John's University, Sungkyunkwan University and even the university of Soochow. Ranging from Political Science to Law to Literature, Zhang has brought his same sense of refined attitude to governance too.\n\nAdvocating for his colleagues to \"respect the law and be pragmatic\" alongside being \"sincere and honest\", Zhang has tailored the spiritual ethos of his government to building a better China through compromise. Bringing together Dangwai such as Zeng Qi or Zhang Junmai through his personal friendship, Zhang's charisma has even won him the admiration of the outcast Zhang Xueliang, and the Son of the Guofu, Sun Fo.

Focusing primarily on the Executive Yuan and its inefficiencies, Premier Yang Yongtai has begun to draft a proposal plan to streamline the Executive Branch. Resolute in preventing such matters such as the Hu Hanmin Crisis, and the general lackadaisical management of the Executive, Yang's self-promulgated and headed Commission on Administrative Efficiency has advised the government with a 3 step plan to revolutionise and iterate upon the current system.\n\nFirstly, the Executive Yuan's bureaucracy must absolutely improve its current methods for maintaining archives and consequently simplify the procedures for handling important official documents and correspondence. Second, the government must design a new, effective system for classifying and filing public documents, as the committee points out the current structure purports a bureaucratic labyrinth of inefficient malaise. Lastly, the Executive Yuan should abolish superfluous administrative agencies in order to improve efficiency and coordination.\n\nFollowing on, Yang posited that the National Economic Council should be extended to accommodate river conservation, all of the various agencies dealing with agricultural reforms and rural cooperatives should be abolished with their duties relinquished to the Ministry of Industry. Alongside that the Ministry of Communications should be established, and that opium elimination should be shifted from the Opium Prohibition Council to the Military Council. Finally, the Ministry of the Interior should be placed under Kong Xiangxi's supervision, with an economic yearbook produced by the Ministry of Industry annually.\n\nWith Political Science's functional dominance of the government legislature and executive, it is practically a formality for such measures to receive the Presidential greenlight, however the appointment of the controversial Kong Xiangxi and further centralisation of matters in the executive has broadcasted a minor air of disturbance in the political field."

As to what end would their form of governance take? A beckoning to the old Political Science Society, or an emergence of something new from the New China Construction Society?\n\nWith both the Old Political Science Clique formally reunited following the reintegration of Huang Fu's Beiyang sect with that of Li Genyuan and Yang Yongtai's southern sect, the clique has begun to push their younger compatriots to formally end the nation's political tutelage by drafting a constitution. With much of Zhang Qun's New Political Science Clique showing signs of agreement, the Reconstruction Faction under Sun Fo and Western Hills under Ju Zheng, alongside other legal experts in the party, have claimed that in order to do so \"by the book\" all political parties and independents need to be invited into a Political Consultative Conference.\n\nUltimately the authority on such matters remains vested within President [ROOT.GetLeader], and whilst an endeavouring New Style Technocrat, there still remains a plurality of choice as to how orthodox he must be to fulfill his constitutional endeavours. He could simply abide by such matters, following the process to its full conclusion. Another option is to place hand-picked party experts in-charge of the conference as to ensure Political Science sees its ambitions met. Finally, and most controversially, the President could merely posit to maintain the Provisional Constitution with moderate adjustments.\n\nEither way, the fate of the nation remains unclear. Despite democratic strides, it is not entirely certain as to the timetable wherein the Kuomintang, be it Political Science dominated or otherwise, will allow the parties of the Dangwai to break into their own and flourish.

The sun was bright, sure, but an even brighter White Sun flew higher than the former ever could. For it symbolised hope, modernity, and a new era for the Chinese people. Some would decry his clique as betraying the revolution, and yet the dazzling prosperity of the nation is a testament for all to behold.

A ruling oligarchy of egalitarian, moderniser and reformer liberal elites, it is reminiscent of the Japanese system that Zhang witnessed as a young student.\n\nUltimately the story of the Political Science Clique and that of the Kuomintang is a complicated one. That is for certain. Embroiled in a factional split from a young age on their participation within the Chinese Republic, time and time again they have come to blows. And whilst Political Science may not live up to the Kuomintang that Sun envisioned at the end of his life, it perhaps captures the true essence of what the Tongmenghui originally set out to do all those years ago. To bring forward a new Republic for the Chinese nation..."
 YUN.endgame.265.a: "Perhaps the Tongmenghui did succeed, in a way..."

#UPC Endgame Shared (300-329):
 YUN.endgame.300.t: "Triumph of Yunnan Federalism"
 YUN.endgame.300.d: "Kunming is triumphant. The armies of Yunnan, a mighty force during the 1910s before being humbled in the following decade, have returned to their past glory in a decisive campaign across the broken nation. In doing so, they have propagated an ideology also thought defeated in the 1920s: Chinese Federalism.\n\nRallying a band of warlords, regionalists, constitutionalists, democrats, and opportunists, the Federalist Movement fought for a scholar-gentry led republic with a division of power between the traditionally powerful central government and the increasingly autonomous provinces. Dominated by southern leaders but with sympathisers in the north, the movement was able to wrest some nominal autonomy in the 1923 Cao Kun Constitution but nothing as far reaching as they hoped and the concessions they did gain were only sporadically respected.\n\nNow they are in position to implement a system of their own choosing. However, it has come at a great cost. The nation has been devastated by years of war, the military bloated and of dubious loyalty to the civilian government, and the movement itself is heavily divided. [ROOT.GetLeader] and his allies will need to navigate these challenges in the coming months."
 YUN.endgame.300.a: "A victory for democracy and constitutionalism in China!"
 YUN.endgame.300.b: "The provinces have won their freedom from tyranny!"

 YUN.endgame.301.t: "The Central Army and the Warlords"
 YUN.endgame.301.d: "The challenges of military centralisation in warlord China are hard to overstate. Decades of increased political, economic, and military autonomy to the provinces during the late Qing dynasty, combined with another few decades of on-going civil war in the post-Xinhai era have weakened central authority and allowed various local figures to amass powerful independent armies. The provinces grew hyper-militarised as any show of weakness may result in their neighbours or national governments to invade their territory, draining their treasuries and further weakening their hold as local forces find alternative ways to raise funding.\n\nEnding this crisis is no easy feat. The nation cannot afford to maintain this many divisions in peace-time, and many units will need to be demilitarised. But this requires a degree of trust between the provinces and the central government, and failing that the central government must be powerful enough to enforce demilitarisation. In addition to the political ramifications, every unit disbanded means more young men becoming jobless, which has historically led to spikes in banditry. Past efforts at demilitarisation have triggered provincial rebellions as the central government attempts to keep their best forces intact at the expense of their allied warlords.\n\nYunnan's leaders have wrestled with this question for years, maintaining an oversized military to protect themselves from their rivals but also suffering the consequences from it. When Tang Jiyao was governor he wrote of the need for China to have a strong central government capable of fighting imperialism and arbitrating between the provinces. Zhang Taiyan on the other hand has insisted on a diplomatic solution, allowing the various provinces at least two divisions of their own. The CDL has written extensively on the need for nationalising the armies, yet often dependent on the warlords for protection.\n\nEither way, demobilisation is expected to begin in the near future, with the brunt of it being born on the warlords, leading to tensions."
 YUN.endgame.301.a: "The central government must nationalise warlord armies."
 YUN.endgame.301.b: "Demobilisation must be balanced to protect provincial rights."

 YUN.endgame.302.t: "Economic Tailwinds Ahead"
 YUN.endgame.302.d: "Unification is a chance for economic prosperity as the fighting ends and reconstruction begins, but the short-term outlook is very difficult. As China transitions from a war economy, magistrates and citizens alike are forced to take stock of the losses suffered over the years. Farms, businesses, and infrastructure have been destroyed by fighting or looting. Displaced refugees are slowly returning home to find little left of their old lives, while disbanded soldiers struggle to find jobs. Law and order in some parts of the country remain broken as bandits and insurgents continue to plague certain areas. Disputes over land, water, and business rights as the nation reintegrates have emerged amid the chaos.\n\nOn a larger scale, the end of years of civil war has created difficult challenges for the new government. Debts are coming due and can no longer as easily be put off as the new government attempts to assert its legitimacy. Creditors of defeated governments, sometimes backed by foreign powers, have also attempted to force [ROOT.GetLeader] to honor their bonds. The on-going demobilisation crisis has further reduced government coffers and fears of hyperinflation have grown. Raising taxes will create unrest from the war-weary people and on-going issues with corruption have limited its effectiveness.\n\nOne can only wonder how much wealth was lost over the years not only through direct acts of destruction and foreign exploitation, but also the enterprises that never got off the ground because entrepreneurs were too scared to invest during wartime due to instability. There is no way to recover the lost growth China might have seen if the post-Xinhai situation developed differently, but now is the time for our government to chart a better course for the future."
 YUN.endgame.302.a: "Raising taxes and paying off our debts will restore faith in the economy."
 YUN.endgame.302.b: "Defaulting on Beiyang bonds and printing more money will pay our debts."

 YUN.endgame.303.t: "Demands for Democratisation"
 YUN.endgame.303.d: "With unification under a Federalist government complete, demands for new elections can no longer be put off much further. Many of the various provinces have drafted their own constitutions with varying degrees of endorsement by the central government. There have been growing calls from around the nation to draft a new national constitution and hold the long promised democratic vote.\n\nThe China Democratic League has ramped up pressure by publishing a series of statements following the war with Japan. These included the 36 Point \"Proposals for the Final Stage of the War of Resistance\" and \"An Urgent Appeal in the Midst of the Victory in the War of Resistance.\" They have demanded the end of authoritarian rule, the recognition of all political parties and civil liberties, a unified military command and military demobilisation through a national army retrenchment commission, the end of wartime measures such as the secret police and hard labour camps for political prisoners, and relief for wartime refugees. Whether these statements are directed more towards President [ROOT.GetLeader] or the various warlords remains ambiguous.\n\nLess ambiguous is the demands of the provinces, which have sought to check the expansion of central government power. The Federalist government, despite their promises to respect local autonomy, have in practice amassed considerable leverage over the provinces through their control of reconstruction programs, deployment of central army troops, their appointment of local magistrates, and their settlement of local grievances. Zhang Taiyan, who has grown ill with sinus cancer and intends to withdraw from national politics amid growing asthma attacks, has spent his final days on the national stage warning those who would listen to him of the dangers of central government overreach.\n\nCreating a Federalist democracy might be easier said than done however, as people in China have radically different views on what \"democracy\" entails..."
 YUN.endgame.303.a: "Offer an interim coalition government until elections are held."
 YUN.endgame.303.b: "We must begin to leave local affairs to the locals."

 #Endgame Rebellion Event - Keep This Note So Easier for Others to Find.
 YUN.endgame.304.t: "Federalism Realised?"
 YUN.endgame.304.d_intro: "The unification of China under the Yunnan-led Guangzhou Federalist Government has brought one sad chapter of our nation's story to a close but as a new age dawns new questions emerge. In order to win the various wars of unification, the new central government had to build a large, powerful army and a similarly powerful state apparatus - the traditional two arms of central government tyranny. Doing so has bankrupted the nation and left empty coffers as the country needs to pivot towards peacetime.\n\nAs a result, inflation and political tensions have been inflamed. Resolving this cocktail of social, economic, military, and political issues will require a complicated series of negotiations to demilitarise the nation, implement national reconstruction, and resolve lingering political questions over the role of the provinces and the central government. Many, however, doubt [UPC.GetLeader]'s sincerity and fear that the costs will be borne on the outlying provinces."
 YUN.endgame.304.d_generic: "$YUN.endgame.304.d_intro$\n\nThe only way for these crises to be fairly resolved is through fair democratic elections, which many doubt their willingness to grant. The central government is expected to call a new constitutional convention in [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] which will be dominated by Yunnanese and Cantonese political figures. At the same time however, [UPC.GetLeader]'s hold seems as weak as ever. If a challenger were to emerge...and perhaps if [ROOT.GetLeader] was that challenger...could he do it?"
 YUN.endgame.304.d_hnn: "$YUN.endgame.304.d_intro$\n\nFor us to attend this conference would be implicitly to surrender to [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our movement is so fundamentally tied to the Federalist movement that either we make a stand now to attempt to take control over it or we will be absorbed into the broader current. For Hunan's politicians in particular, the insistence of many in the Yunnan movement to nationalise the military (or at best leave only a few divisions in the hands of the locals) is particularly objectionable - likely marking the end of our autonomy.\n\nSimilarly, Yunnanese grand-standing, the Guizhou issue, and intra-personality animosity remain vibrant paintings within the minds of many Hunanese."

Our movement is so fundamentally tied to the Federalist movement that either we make a stand now to attempt to take control over it or we will be absorbed into the broader current. For the Sichuan Federalists, so often oppressed by Yunnan's leaders in the past, being a knee to their dictates feels wrong. But we have done so thus far, are we willing to commit forever?"

 YUN.endgame.305.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Resists Nationalisation"
 YUN.endgame.305.d.base: "While the Federalist movement's had supporters across the country, in the end it was the Yunnanese that ultimately fulfilled the dream of Cai E and reunited the country under one republic. The mighty Yunnan Army were able to defeat their adversaries and bring the nation under one Federalist banner, a goal that has eluded powerful leaders since 1911.\n\nIt would appear however, that victory and peace has not been cherished by all. Citing the government's political favoritism of Yunnan, Yunnanese domination of national politics, corruption, nepotism, warlordism, and heavy handed attempts at government centralisation; [FROM.GetLeader] is rallying his province and other supporters to break from the Central Government."
 YUN.endgame.305.d.closer: "The Central Government, of course, is expected to have a major advantage, controlling China's major cities and commanding international legitimacy (at least for now), which has given them greater access to loans as well as a larger tax and manpower base to draft an army. The centralised Federal Army however still holds many disloyal regionalists within its ranks. Furthermore, [FROM.GetAdjective] regionalists are confident in the abilities of their forces and expect that others will rise up against the tyrannical dictatorship of the Yunnanese-led Central Government. And China is no stranger to upsets. What both sides can agree on, however, is that they will not tolerate another warlord era."
 YUN.endgame.305.d.generic: "$YUN.endgame.305.d.base$\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] have been loosely tied to the Federalist movement as of late, with independent but seemingly compatible roots. Their national ambitions coincided with the Federalist victory in the South, and rode its wave to unification. Now, however, with the Central Government attempt to assert its authority over its former allies, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] is simply unwilling to accept Federal domination.\n\n$YUN.endgame.305.d.closer$"
 YUN.endgame.305.d.hnnfed: "$YUN.endgame.305.d.base$\n\nHunan, having long held a resolute and resilient provincial constitution, holds provincial autonomy to the utmost, priding themselves on the borderline Confederate nature of their federalism. Cantonese domination over constitutional drafting and their open ambitions to nationalise provincial militaries has provked them into open rebellion as they desperately seek to fend off [UPC.GetLeader]'s grip before it is too late.\n\n$YUN.endgame.305.d.closer$"
 YUN.endgame.305.d.szcfed: "$YUN.endgame.305.d.base$\n\nSichuan's Federalist movement has always been dramatically overshadowed by their contemporaries - and even seen as an enemy by some, entering into conflict with Yunnan and Guangdong's Federalists at different points. The nationalisation of provincial forces appear to be the final straw for them, seeking to push them into a merely provincial role. Refusing to bow to the central government's directives, [FROM.GetLeader] has chosen to rebel in a bid to redefine Federalism on his own terms.\n\n$YUN.endgame.305.d.closer$"
 YUN.endgame.305.a: "Warlords will be crushed."
 YUN.endgame.305.b: "The Federalists turn on one another."

 YUN.endgame.310.t: "The Federalist Electoral Order"
 YUN.endgame.310.intro: "A new political order has come to the land, now dominated by the victors of China's wars of unification. The Grand Republican Alliance and the China Democratic League have become the premier political parties in the new republic, battling for control over provincial legislatures across the country. But the greatest prize, and the one that will be hardest fought, will be for control over the Presidency - and with it the valuable patronage and executive positions it controls.\n\nThe Grand Republican Alliance is seen as the older of the two (the technicalities are debatable), tracing its roots to the old Federalist movement of the 1920s with many of their leaders fighting in the original Xinhai Revolution. Though it has a more conservative, establishment support-base with the gentry and merchants, some of its leaders have had more eclectic beliefs. Its emphasis on protecting local self-rule has made it powerful, especially in the south where it was founded, however it also has made the party more dependent on the bickering personalities of its regional leaders."
 YUN.endgame.310.d_default: "$YUN.endgame.310.intro$\n\nTang Jiyao, being the long-time President, has consolidated the GRA under him. With Zhang Taiyan's illness worsening, he has announced his departure from politics. Tang represents the more conservative and authoritarian side of the GRA - ruling in the Liangist, traditional mold rather than his Western, liberal peers. His greatest challenge ahead will be to not only win the coming elections (given the circumstances, he is the favourite), but also convince the people of the elections' legitimacy.\n\nWith the CDL poised to challenge him with a surprisingly extensive election campaign of their own, Tang must thread the needle to protect his legacy. With Chen Jiongming similarly taking a step back from national politics due to poor health, he has nominated Ma Yuhang, a former Chen deputy, to be his running mate."
 YUN.endgame.310.d_satellite: "$YUN.endgame.310.intro$\n\nTang Jiyao's ouster and death was predicted to be the end of his wing of the GRA, but the People's Government Party torch was taken up by his wily son Tang Xiaoying. With Zhang Taiyan's illness worsening, he has announced his departure from politics - leaving the PGP in the young politician's hands. The younger Tang is different from his father - though sharing a Japanese education, he studied economics and played a primarily civilian role in his father's government.\n\nMore liberal and better tuned to contemporary Chinese political developments, he has struck an alliance with his father's former allies and sometimes rivals in the GRA. He has tapped former Chen Jiongming deputy Chen Qiyou as his Vice Presidential candidate to secure the Cantonese vote while promising to appoint a northerner as his Prime Minister. The cunning young man might pose the greatest challenge yet to Cun Shusheng's rule."
 YUN.endgame.310.a: "The GRA emphasises a moderate, constitutionalist message."
 YUN.endgame.310.b: "Tang leans on his connections in the military and bureaucracy."

 YUN.endgame.311.t: "Intrigues of China's Democrats"
 YUN.endgame.311.intro: "The China Democratic League may have been a relatively new development, but it is the product of decades of efforts by Chinese reformers to unite various liberal and progressive intellectuals together to promote democratic reform. Liang Qichao, the mentor and prototype for many of the CDL's leading figures, attempted to form an organised political alliance as early as 1913 when the Progressive Party united all non-Tongmenghui factions together in Beiyang. More immediately however, the formation of the United National Construction League in 1929 was the first iteration of what would ultimately become the CDL.\n\nThe CDL, dominated by middle class intellectual and business circles, is as unwieldy as the scholars, bureaucrats, and bankers that dominate its leadership. The left wing of the CDL include the National Salvation Federation and various smaller regional groups often associated with socialist splinters. The liberal wing of the party includes the Crescent Moon Society, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy. Many Liangists have gathered around the Democratic Socialist Party, which combines a reform socialist economic programme with a nationalistic, somewhat traditionalist social outlook."
 YUN.endgame.311.d_default: "$YUN.endgame.311.intro$\n\nThe CDL does benefit from a support base that is less regionally defined than the GRA, with branches in the north, east, and south where China's largest population centers are located. Opposition to Tang Jiyao's rule has coalesced around Luo Longji, who has sought to build on this momentum to win the coming elections. Attempting to shed his reputation as \"instantly disagreeable\" and overly Westernised, he has reluctantly offered his rival Zhang Junmai a spot on the ticket in hopes of tapping into both his reputation as a stubborn social democrat, a staunch defender of Chinese culture, and also his family's deep financial backing from the Shanghai commercial elite. Still, tacking left or right is bound to alienate at least one wing of the party."
 YUN.endgame.311.d_satellite: "$YUN.endgame.311.intro$\n\nCun Shusheng may be the President, but in some ways he's also a dark horse. A regional intellectual leader not particularly affiliated with any of the major parties in the CDL, his national prominence mainly stems from some of his recent writings about village reform and his unexpected leadership of Yunnanese forces to unification. He has sought to broaden his base by naming Luo Longji as his running mate, adding a Jiangxi born but Northern educated celebrity to his ticket. Still, Cun's alliances with various socialist and warlord figures are bound to be scrutinised as he fights to be more than just a lucky politician from China's periphery."
 YUN.endgame.311.a: "The CDL takes a leftward turn."
 YUN.endgame.311.b: "The CDL develops around its liberal wing."
 YUN.endgame.311.c: "The CDL courts the Liangists."

 YUN.endgame.312.t: "The Other Parties Assemble"
 YUN.endgame.312.d: "The GRA and CDL have effectively conspired to monopolise the post-unification political system, but the other parties of the republic have resolved not to go down without a fight. Gearing up for elections, political agents from parties legal and illegal have organised as they battle to retain their existing niches and try to expand to other constituencies - exploiting weaknesses in the GRA and CDL's ground games.\n\nThe [UPC_GetDCPPartyName_nocolour_long] and the Young China Party both have Liangist roots and cater to a non-liberal political tradition. Liang Qichao, the father of China's reformist tradition, bounced around the political spectrum throughout his life. His guiding principles of constitutionalism, civic nationalism, modernisation, and a balanced approach towards Western Science and Chinese traditions continue to be popular especially in Northern China. With many northerners feeling marginalised by the South's new found dominance under the Federalist system, both parties have gained momentum.\n\nBeiyang politics has traditionally eschewed Western style political parties, especially after the Yuan Shikai-Tongmenghui conflict made parties effectively synonymous with revolutionary sedition. But with the southerners demonstrating its potency, many northerners have begun experimenting with party politics. Still, the stigma remains and nostalgia for the old gentlemanly politics endures. Regional political machines continue to run politicians stubbornly holding onto their independence and catering to local interests.\n\nThe far left, shunned if not alright oppressed by authorities, continue to operate. Always the best at mass mobilisation of voters, particularly the disaffected and impoverished, they remain a force to be reckoned with. The KMT and CSP endure but splinters have emerged. Some embrace the new republic, others have vowed to fight on in vain hope for their revolution."
 YUN.endgame.312.a: "Without political parties, we will be swallowed up in the new order."
 YUN.endgame.312.b: "The north remains as stubbornly independent as always."

 YUN.endgame.313.t: "The Death of Zhang Taiyan"
 YUN.endgame.313.d: "Zhang Taiyan has passed away in his home, with conflicting reports of a severe asthma attack and fever or sinus cancer. What is undisputed however is the outpouring of grief around the nation. Newspapers across China have reported his death and politicians from all over the political spectrum have expressed their condolences.\n\nPresident [UPC.GetLeader] has granted his family's request for a state funeral, though there was some initial disagreement over where he ought to be buried, delaying the process. Zhang's will instructed his children to defend the republic and avoid taking any positions in foreign-installed governments (reflecting his continued fear of foreign imperialism), but had no clear instructions of where he wanted to be buried. Some of his associates however dug up a will he wrote all the way back in 1915 while imprisoned wishing to be buried in Hangzhou next to Liu Ji, the great scholar who aided in the foundation of the Ming Dynasty. Apparently he had even purchased a nearby lot after he was released from Liu's descendants, and it is not too far away from other Chinese heroes like Zhang Huangyan and Yue Fei.\n\nZhang's 1915 will lamented that his contributions will not be remembered as fondly as Liu Ji's due to his support of Yuan Shikai. It would appear that he was wrong. His heroics during the Xinhai Revolution aside, his contributions to Chinese literature and study of classics along with the development of the Federalist republic have fundamentally shaped this new era in China. Still, it will be up to the living to manipulate how he will be remembered in the public's collective memory."
 YUN.endgame.313.a: "Zhang Taiyan was a great patriot and revolutionary."
 YUN.endgame.313.b: "Zhang Taiyan is a founding father in our federalist democracy."
 YUN.endgame.313.c: "Zhang Taiyan's contributions to academia shall not be forgotten."

 YUN.endgame.314.t: "The State and Instability"
 YUN.endgame.314.d: "The [GetYear] Elections have been inching steadily towards its conclusion but tensions endure. While many places are expected to hold their votes in an orderly manner, conservatives are afraid of radical agitators manipulating the masses while progressives have expressed concern about the integrity of the vote.\n\nThese issues are to be expected in a young democracy. Chinese elections historically have been relatively muted affairs, generally decided by the local gentry and power-holders. To have elections this dynamic has upended decades of entrenched politics, with some incumbents genuinely at risk of being unseated by a new generation. This uncertainty however has created both an atmosphere of hope and one of fear.\n\nThe old Beiyang Republic has always revolved around strongmen and their (usually provincial) allies. The Federalists claim to be different, but many have noted that Yunnanese and other southern figures continue to hold major levers of power in the army and bureaucracy and even non-governmental institutions such as party offices and businesses. Even in the northern and eastern dominated academia and the press, those with ties to Kunming and Guangzhou have seen their careers elevated. With their influence having gone national in scope, the petty differences between Yunnan factions have been rendered irrelevant to most outsiders. Critics decry the emergence of a so-called \"Dian Clique\" (Dian being the abbreviation of Yunnan) monopolising coveted positions of influence.\n\nWith the nation facing uncertainty and this reconsolidation of power in the hands of the few, democratic backsliding will likely be a pressing concern for at least a generation. It could come at any moment and seize a number of potential justifications - the state beginning to unravel from within, the nation being under threat from the outside, a contested vote. Many wonder if our democracy will remain vibrant for long."
 YUN.endgame.314.a: "The republic was better when voting was a restrained, modest affair."
 YUN.endgame.314.b: "Free expression of the people's will is what democracy is about."

 YUN.endgame.320.t: "Widely Contested Elections"
 YUN.endgame.320.d: "China's democrats have long waited for free and fair national elections and had clung onto hope that the Federalist Movement would be able to provide them. Unfortunately however, as more and more races are called it would appear that they will have to wait for many years more.\n\nWhile many districts did hold legitimate (or reasonably legitimate) votes, many others were marred with numerous irregularities and accusations of fraud. Narrow races in many core provinces were called in favor of conservative candidates and challenges dismissed by unsympathetic election commissions. In many outlying provinces, there have been reports of voter suppression or sometimes even outright vote rigging by Central Army officers. The flagrant biases of most provincial establishments towards the status quo have overwhelmingly favoured one side: the Grand Republican Alliance.\n\nDespite objections from opposition groups, [UPC_GetSTAPartyLeader] was named President and hurriedly sworn in. Attempts to challenge the results in court have begun, but most realise the futility of the situation. The Army has clearly chosen their favourite after months of chaotic campaigning and their commanders are unlikely to budge now. Faith in democratic procedures have fallen by the wayside, and as more and more legislators take their seats in [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it has become clear that there will be no institutional resistance to his rule.\n\nDesperate, CDL leaders have called on their followers to take to the streets to protest the results but it seems they are only delaying the inevitable."
 YUN.endgame.320.a: "Democracy at work I suppose."

 YUN.endgame.321.t: "A Presidential Self-Coup"
 YUN.endgame.321.d: "The President of China has almost always held considerable power, far more than what the constitution grants. And when it is not the President it is often another strongman behind the scenes. Maybe the drafters of the Federalist Constitution were hoping the legislature or the provinces or plain democratic norms would be enough to stop the same from happening in their new republic. Or maybe they accepted this reality long before ratification.\n\nEither way, President Tang has been accumulating more and more power, consolidating control over the executive behind himself and his cronies. His agents have begun a systematic campaign of harassment against dissident figures and the opposition have found fewer and fewer legal avenues to oppose his rule. Even some members of his own People's Government Party have found themselves sidelined as Tang moves to consolidate power around himself and a small clique of Yunnanese officials dubbed the Dian Clique. Prime Minister [GetSecondInCommand] himself is said to be in the hot seat. Slowly but surely the democratic safeguards put in place by the constitution have been dismantled.\n\n[UPC_GetCDLPartyLeader] and other CDL leaders have made one last ditch attempt to protest Tang's power grab, circling legislation around the National Assembly calling for significant restrictions to Presidential decrees and a national unity government involving all parties. But it has achieved little traction from other parties, most electing to adopt a wait and see approach if not outright submitting to Tang's rule.\n\nCDL intellectuals have also begun airing their complaints in editorials around the nation, hoping for widespread resistance but finding mostly apathy from the war weary people. Most of the provinces are similarly firmly under Tang's grip, either due to loyalty, fear of repression, or their Governors' disdain for radical action. Government aligned press outlets have accused the CDL of being subversive as the young republic's democracy erodes."
 YUN.endgame.321.a: "The people chose Tang to lead, not them."

 YUN.endgame.322.t: "Fall of the CDL Government"
 YUN.endgame.322.d: "The [GetSecondInCommand] government has been teetering for some time, weakened by controversial decisions, a discontented military high command, and poor handling of China's various post-unification crises. Public support for the government has plummeted, banditry is said to be on the rise, and the elites have begun to clamour for stronger leadership to take control. Most damningly however, it seems that [UPC.GetLeader] has lost the faith of the magistrates and military officers that his government depends on to function.\n\nA small riot in the capitol finally gave them the pretext they needed to act. Several student activists in [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] were arrested by the police, accused of being part of a seditious socialist cell. It drew considerable condemnation from the student body and after protests turned violent local authorities ordered dozens rounded up including several of their professors - worsening the unrest and feeding into the perception that the CDL harbors socialist agitators in their ranks. Many of the scholars detained are CDL members, who have pleaded with the President to intervene on their behalf.\n\nHe hardly got the chance to. As word of the incident reverberated around the capital, rumors of his intention to order the release of the suspects began to swirl. [UPC_GetSTAPartyLeader] exploited the moment, calling for a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister [GetSecondInCommand]'s cabinet. The motion was carried with astounding speed - many legislators were not even present to vote. Later that night, President [UPC.GetLeader] disappeared, believed to have been arrested himself in a palace coup. The former Prime Minister and many other CDL members have fled, hoping to rally sympathetic allies in the provinces."
 YUN.endgame.322.a: "We can expect [UPC.GetLeader]'s resignation soon..."

 YUN.endgame.323.t: "Democracy's Martyrs"
 YUN.endgame.323.d: "The protests got off to a slow start, but began to grow as the CDL worked to rally their followers to oppose [UPC_GetSTAPartyLeader]'s power play. The Yunnan Army struck hard and struck fast - crippling the budding opposition. Army cadets have organised throngs of loyalists to assault CDL protesters while the police raided the homes of their leaders.\n\nEven more chilling were the assassinations in broad daylight. Li Furen and Wang Ren were shot in Xi'an. Li Gongpu, one of the \"Seven Gentlemen\" and a prominent NSF organiser, suffered a severe head injury at the hands of a pro-government mob. Recuperating in Kunming, he was shot and stabbed by officers from the local garrison while taking a walk.\n\nAn enraged Wen Yiduo gave an impromptu speech at Li's funeral three days later, delivering scathing remarks at the heart of the Dian Clique's power. He defiantly addressed the secret agents embedded in the crowd, declaring that \"we are not afraid of death. We are ready to follow in Li's footsteps! The moment we step out the door, we do not think of stepping back in.\" Later that afternoon, he was riddled by gunfire while leaving his office building.\n\nHis martyrdom has triggered an outpouring of grief. In many of Wen's poems, he had described his hope for a \"death in ecstasy\", dying in perfect beauty in the pursuit of one's ideals. A heroic act of sacrifice and fulfillment. The charismatic teacher and a politician once dramatically stretched out his hands to an audience holding chalk powder, insisting that as scholars the CDL have no blood on their hands. He asked the crowd not to belittle his pure, clean hands for they can \"change history and create miracles.\"\n\nThe backlash has been great, but it is too late for the Dian Clique to back down now. CDL leaders continue to be hunted down and assaulted. Another, Sun Zhongyuan, was killed in Beijing while Dao Xingzhi died of a stroke in Shanghai. Curfews have been imposed, publications shuttered, and many have fled the country."

 YUN.endgame.330.t: "Brave Poets in a Wounded Nation"
 YUN.endgame.330.d: "The Second-Sino Japanese War has wrought untold horrors onto the nation, and especially onto the individuals that compose it. Mothers lost sons, children lost fathers, brothers lost sisters. It was a conflict against complete imperial domination and cultural annihilation, the last stand of all Chinese against those who would seek their demise. Captured with extraordinary use of photography, and even filmed footage, nonetheless the age-old tradition of prose and poetry has captured such brutal events in perfect stasis.\n\nAmongst the Yunnanese-led China Democratic League is a plethora of individuals tutored by those of the Crescent Moon Society in constructing poetry, and one particular individual#s popular patriotic platitudes have found a resurgence amongst the nation#s people now that he himself has risen to prominence.\n\nYang Ming, an ethnic Bai born in Dali Yunnan in 1919 is particularly young for his age, born in a generation that did not know anything but the Warlord Era. At the age of 9, he was an apprentice at a store in Xiaguan, and then at 16 in 1936 he travelled to Kunming to study at a Sino-German University, and during the Sino-Japanese War had roared into action drafting and producing a plethora of both propaganda and poetry.\n\nIntroduced by Wen Yiduo to the United New Poetry Society, Yang Ming's most popular piece has to be that of \"Chinese Soldiers Died Outside the Battlefield\". Even to the point that it has been recited by Wen himself, and adapted into a drama, receiving further acclaim in its new medium. In the political world, Yang himself is a fierce and ferocious member of the China Democratic League, leaning on its left-moderate wing. Resolute in both patriotic and democratic inclinations, he is seen as a rising star amongst CDL circles."

 YUN.endgame.331.t: "Revolutionaries Amongst Reformists"
 YUN.endgame.331.d: "Ever since the introduction of Socialism into the dynamic, young, and fluid Chinese political battleground of the Warlord Era, there has been a divide between those that seek class struggle as the method for the proclamation of their socialist ideals, or that of participation in bourgeois democracy to advance people#s liberation.\n\nInfamous for their propagation of revolutionary struggle, the most fervent and ferocious, and adamant, advocates of the former within China have to be that of the Left-Kuomintang, and the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Interpreting the Three Principles as a prescription for society#s woes, and a manual for the implementation of socialism within China, organisations such as the Provisional Action Committee had long riled up the masses, imploring the masses to pick up arms and depose their oppressors.\n\nPerhaps the greatest mass political organisation espousing the latter is that of the Left-Wing of the China Democratic League. Ranging from the National Salvation Federation to the Democratic Socialist Party, the CDL-Left has, perhaps wittingly, welcomed a large portion of socialist revolutionary defectors. Ex-Kuomintang aficionados, or even home-grown socialists, have joined the China Democratic League in droves as the Kuomintang diminishes in stature, relevance, and is constantly harangued by the state apparatus; largely for wanting to overthrow said state apparatus.\n\nBut this enlarging of the CDL with new, radical, blood has seen a divide within its own leadership emerge. To work with the radicals would undoubtedly damage the movement#s perception amongst certain interest groups, and even the opposition. However, not working with the radicals within the CDL would openly admit to further factionalism within the CDL, hurting the influence and strength of the CDL as a whole."

 YUN.endgame.332.t: "Nationalising Spartan Education"
 YUN.endgame.332.d: "Lauded to be an excellent educator, perhaps even greater than that of his skills as a politician, the Japanese educated economist turned democratic-revolutionary pioneer#s service during the Sino-Japanese War is nothing short of remarkable. Having found a job in Beijing University in 1932 following his return to China, he would ultimately be driven back to his home province following leftist repression by the Zhili.\n\nUndeterred, he thrust himself onto the path that would soon become his trademark. Travelling to Tengchong, Cun founded the first Overseas Chinese school in Yunnan, Yiqun Middle School, and served as its principal. Locally raising his own funds, Cun was quoted as comparing the establishment of the school to \"building a wise orchard\", and proposed the concept of rural schools finally integrating with society.\n\nCarefully training and cultivating the futures of his students, Cun advocated a particularly unique form of \"spartan\" education. Advocating for them to develop a pragmatic spirit, he justified his self-sufficient training style by insisting that \"\"Spartan strict training is necessary and beneficial for Chinese youth who are burdened with thousands of years of tradition.\n\nAdvocating similarly that the teachers and students grow their own crops, and repair their own campus by themselves, his lessons went insofar as to enable the students to clear the roads of their township, organise a fire brigade, create a sports team, build water conservation projects, develop fishery and poultry industries, and even to help farmers with winter ploughing.\n\nInviting a group of teachers from Kunming to improve the schooling in Yiqun, Cun further went onwards to implement his methods in Hesush, serving as Principal of the Primary School, director of the library, and director of the Cultural Section of the Township office. With his experience he managed to induct 90% of school-age children into the education system, and every adult under the age of 30 could read and write."

#CMS Endgame Events (360-389):

 YUN.endgame.360.t: "The Crescent Moon Attitude"
 YUN.endgame.360.d: "With their full foray into politics, the Crescent Moon Society's mixture of the arts and statesmanship has brought with them their eponymous \"Crescent Moon Attitudes\". Simultaneously a literary, artistic, scholarly, and political manifesto, it is believed to have been drafted by Xu Zhimo before his passing, with its ideas and values drawing from the New Humanist style of political thought espoused by Liang Shiqiu. Ultimately, it acts a sort of representation of the new liberal cultural attitude espoused by the Crescent Moon Society.\n\nThe piece begins with a general criticism of the entire literary scene, depicting it as in a state of \"anarchical chaos\" because the \"market of thinking\" was lost in an \"absolute freedom\". Twisting on its toes, it then follows such criticisms with a \"new position\" as taken by the Crescent Moon aficionados, representing their ideals of literature with two slogans, \"Health\" (Jiankang), and \"Dignity\" (Zunyan).\n\nDignity, for its voice can call back the life that is wandering at the crossroad; health, for its power can eradicate all bacteria that are eroding our life and thought. Seeing life as a \"whole\", as opposed to being fragmented, or only seeing the extremes, the manifesto announces their desire to seek moderation, rather than the extreme or bizarre.\n\nInsofar as the manifesto is concerned, the principle and premise of \"restraint\" is an indispensable component of the New Humanist vision, with Dignity and Health both exercising a restraining power to life and literature. Stressing the advocacy of such restraint, it combines that notion with order, and moderation, as opposed to extremism, bizarreness, and spur-of-the-moment feelings.\n\nRounding off, Crescent Moon indicates thirteen \"intolerable\" literary forces: Sentimentalists, Decadents, Aestheticists, Utilitarians, Moralists, Aggressors, Extremists, Refinement, Pornographers, Fanatics, Charlatans, Motto-ists, and Ism-ists. Linking these forces to their nascent anti-leftist approach, they instead offer the \"familiar Anglo-American notion of the autonomy of literature\", with its individualist, elitist, and non-utilitarian approach."
 YUN.endgame.360.a: "A moral society is a polite society."
 YUN.endgame.360.b: "Substituting authoritarianism for elitism?"

 YUN.endgame.361.t: "To Be A President"
 YUN.endgame.361.d: "What does it mean to be President of China? Is it an avenue of power? Is it the endowment of all-encompassing rights to shape the future of China? Nigh total power? Subservience to the legislature, to the executive? If you were to ask any plethora of individuals, from the most diligent peasant to the most unscrupulous warlord, you would receive an equal plethora of answers. But if you asked the incumbent, Luo Longji, what it means to be President? His answer would be simple: to defend human liberty.\n\nAt a recent press conference, the President is quoted as stating: \"If freedom of speech is proscribed, not just speech but thought is proscribed; and not just thought but the development of personality and character as well. TO proscribe the development of personality and character is to terminate life for the individual man and to destroy life for the mass of men.\"\n\nIt is the individual, not the state, that is the most important facet of life to Luo. To him, and many others in the Crescent Moon Society, man is a Thinking Being, one that naturally seeks happiness. Such happiness can only be obtained when individual personality and character can grow. To Luo, freedom is absolute, an intrinsic right bestowed upon all humans.\n\nDictatorships ultimately cannot fulfill the threefold function of the state as designed by Luo: protecting the rights of the people, nurturing and developing the people, and furnishing the people with an environment of peace, tranquility, order, and justice. By denying freedom, they thwart the nurturing and development of personality and character, fostering instead the development of passive, dependent personalities. Or as Luo regards them, \"unthinking mechanical devices\".\n\nFor Luo, being President means that he can finally enact his desire for the intellectuals to build a political system emphasising freedom of expression, government protection of freedom, and the correct application of talent. Revolutions happen first and foremost because the powerless overthrow the powerful, and so one must merely approach the powerless, and uplift them to greater heights."

 YUN.endgame.361.b: "But surely we can do more than just political reform?"

 YUN.endgame.362.t: "Crescent Moon's Firebrand"
 YUN.endgame.362.d: "Whilst the Crescent Moon Society, Democratic Socialist Party, and various other China Democratic League constituent parties are hardly staffed by those of white beards and barren heads, being mostly led by the comparatively young, each party still carries with itself a nascent \"Young Guard\" of far more ambitious, and sometimes radical, party constituents. And of particular note amongst all of the rising stars in the Crescent Moon Society is one Chu Anping.\n\nBorn in 1909 into a prominent family in Guangxi, the Chu family has long been heralded for its achievements in the imperial examinations. A classmate of Huang Yanpei, Chu would truly shine with his admission to Guanghua University, ostensibly choosing the recently founded institution due to his nascent left-wing attitudes. Fond of the literary arts, he joined the CSM as a rising star, having a fond teacher-student relationship with Xu Zhimo.\n\nMeeting and learning under the likes of Xu, Hu Shih, Zhang Dongsun, Luo Longji and others, Chu met many of his close friends at Guanghua, and even met his future wife, Duanmu Lucy, during his tenure there. Actively participating in the National Salvation Federation, Chu remained in Shanghai for a time. Publishing a few pieces in articles such as Zhang Dongsun's Regeneration, Chu would gradually give up prose over the years, turning further towards literary criticism.\n\nTravelling to Britain to study in 1936, he would take note of the situation in the Syndicalist world. With the onset of the War of Resistance, he returned to China to help wage the War in his own way: through writing. Operating various bookstores and literary publications as an editor, Chu would assist his friends in the CSM, DSP and NSF, in organising the China Democratic League. A staunch democrat, and liberal, Chu frequently releases fiery retorts of the China Democratic League's political opponents, lambasting them for their opposition to democracy, their corruption, or their authoritarianism, and has even begun to make overtures to the Democracy and Science Forum in order to integrate them into the CDL."

#PGP Endgame Events (390-419):

 YUN.endgame.390.t: "Like Father, Like Son"
 YUN.endgame.390.d: "As the son of the esteemed Tang Jiyao, Tang Xiaoying's political career is seeminly on the rise with the recent unification of the country. An economics student from Tokyog Imperial University, the younger Tang has grown up in a China much different than that of his father. Yet still the elder Tang attempted to install virtue and morality into his successor. When Xiaoying was younger, his father had taken him out to the slums of Kunming where he saw the lower classes squandered together in filth and poverty. The elder Tang sternly reminded his son to remember to give back to his community and to use his victories for good.\n\nNow with Chinese unification present, the younger Tang has risen through the ranks as a member of the PGP. With Tang seeking to ensure his bloodline continues to have some sway and influence in national politics, his adivsors have proposed that perhaps Tang Xiaoying could seek a career post as a commissioned officer within the Young China Party (YCP) dominated military. Doing so could rein in the YCP's influence in the greater Chinese political environment while ensuring a friendly voice exists within the military ranks.\n\nAlternatively, another proposal seeks to utilise Xiaoying's existing political networks and experience to be involved in the actual political apparatus. In doing so, he would play a pivotal role of mediator and politician while keeping the interests of Tang Jiyao alive well after Tang's death.\n\nAnother idea is for Xiaoying to simply join the growing national bureaucracy of the Dian Clique as a bureaucrat. Using his background in economics, Xiaoying can be a perfect fit for the Transportation Department or the Treasurey, ensuring the cogs of the national machine continue to function smoothly and without corruption."

 YUN.endgame.391.t: "Buddhism in the Federalist Republic"
 YUN.endgame.391.d: "Tang like many other Chinese, is a devout Buddhist. Offiically, Tang has sought reconcile the democratic Federalist movement with the principles and beliefs championed in Mahayana Buddhism, Tang has also created a circle of Buddhist leaders and devoutees that have found increasingly powerful positions in the new national government. Prominent of which is of course Zhang Taiyan's whose esoteric Buddhism of \"karmic seeds\" rejects outright theism and veneration of the Buddha but rather on teachings of monks like Asvaghosa.\n\nXi Ziqiang is an ethnic Naxi (minority from the Himalayas) who also studied in Yunnan Military Academy. A devout Buddhist and member of the Yunnan Buddhist Association, he is a close member of Tang's circle and frequently consulted for both military and political matters.\n\nXu Yun is a Fujianese Chan Buddhist follower who has devoted his life and his studies towards discovering the true dharma and seeking enlightenment under Guanyin. A prolific monk revered for his poetry and his ascetic lifestyle; his lectures are some of Tang's most favourite. After being exposed to the Buddhist sutras at the funeral of his grandmother, Xu Yun rejected the Taoism of his father in favor of Buddhism. At the early age of 14, he claimed to have rejected all material things and sought the life of an ascetic monk.\n\nDuring his travels, Xu Yun traveled from his native Fujian to far away Sichuan and Tibet where he visited the seat of the Dalai Lama and the Panchan Lama. His travels took him to even far away India, Ceylon, and Burma before returning to China in his midage. A tirleess boddhistiava with a cult following that extends to followers in Thailand, Malaya. Vietnam, and Burma - Xu has also held an assembly called \"Protect the Nation, Quell the Disaster, Mahākaruṇā Dharma Assembly\" in order to increase support for the Federalist movement."

#TXY Endgame Events (420-459):

 YUN.endgame.420.t: "The Donglu Gardens and the Yunnan Convention"
 YUN.endgame.420.d: "Born a scholar, Tang Jiyao loved garden art and culture. During his tenure in Yunnan, he had even invited Chinese and French architects to carefully plan out and build the Tang Family Garden, becoming an outstanding architectural masterpiece in the southwest. The largest private garden in Kunming and one of the most famous, it contains a two-story corner building with a Chinese-Western wooden structure, called the \"Red Building\", a lotus pond, arched bridge, carved stone railings, a fountain rockery, both a Western and Chinese pavilion each, and a stage. Not to mention that behind the garden are thousands of plum trees.\n\nFull of lush flowers, Tang infrequently used it to set up banquets to entertain guests, but otherwise retained it purely for its grandeur and to host his personal collection of classics, antiques, gold, calligraphy, and paintings. However, deeming it a pity that few people could actually appreciate the garden and the arts within it, he constructed the Donglu Library within the garden in 1923, which has remained open to the public without charge, but only on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\nLocated within the same mountain range as Yunnan University, various members of the student body and faculty frequently visited, with it becoming a sort of cultural centre for the Southwest. Whilst Tang Jiyao often found himself outside of Kunming in recent times, his son, Tang Xiaoying, tended to host guests and political discussions within the garden. Figures such as Shen Congwen, Luo Longji, Wen Yiduo, Liang Shiqiu, Cun Shusheng, Zhou Xinmin, Pan Dakui, Jiang liangfu and many others had all explored the garden with Xiaoying's invitation.\n\nNow that he is president, Xiaoying still often finds himself retreating to the Donglu Library and Tang Family Garden in the few moments of idle peace he is offered. For some, it might just as well be a garden, but for Xiaoying, perhaps in a way the garden is a reminder of his father; his mixed legacy, what he fought for, and his willingness to give to the people."
 YUN.endgame.420.a: "I think, in a way, he would be proud."
 YUN.endgame.420.b: "See, he betrays his father's ideals!"

 YUN.endgame.421.t: "The Constitutional Research Association"
 YUN.endgame.421.d: "As Yunnan swiftly developed into a democratic stronghold due to the reforms of the Federalists, it has welcomed all sorts of intellectual browbeating and discussions ranging from the mundane to the political to the literary. And at the centre of a particular local movement would have to be none other than that of Tang Jiyao's only son, Tang Xiaoying.\n\nFounding the Constitutional Research Society with people such as Zhou Xinmin, Pan Dakui, Jiang Liangfu, and Zeng Zhaolun, the Society focused on the production of reports and seminars discussing the domestic constitutional movement, the situation of constitutionalism in countries abroad, and various calls for the strengthening of democracy and expanding the influence of the Chinese democratic movement.\n\nPerhaps bridging the gap between the People's Government Party and China Democratic League, the CRS' hallmark publication was that of \"Our Requirements Before Implementing Constitutional government\", blending the policies of the PGP with that of the CDL It proposed that before the implementation of constitutionalism, the people must first be granted freedom of speech and personal freedom, all opposition should be legalised and that a coalition government should be established.\n\nExpanding its influence, Tang Xiaoying used the Society to arrange contact with the likes of Li Gongpu, Zhang Tianfang, Yang Chunzhou, and Chu Tunan, effectively linking himself to various members of the CDL's operations. Combined with his biological ties to his father, and by extension his sort of \"princely\" demeanour to that of his father's allies such as Chen Jiongming, Tang Xiaoying has transformed into something of a popular hero.\n\nUniting all the constituents of the Grand Republican Alliance, alongside being on positive terms with all constituents of the China Democratic League, Xiaoying simultaneously maintained a strong connection to the Young China Party, and the Chinese Constitutionalists. Achieving perhaps the impossible, he has bound every democratic force in the nation to his image."

 YUN.endgame.421.b: "He'd hand the keys of the castle to the PRS and PIP!"

 YUN.endgame.422.t: "Atop the House of Cards"
 YUN.endgame.422.d: "Chinese politics has always been a rather precarious house of cards. Carefully constructed through backroom deals and slick handshakes, even Beiyang's best and most Machiavellian statesmen could easily be sundered by one wrong move, or one wrong tip of the hat. Just ask Duan Qirui, Zhang Zuolin, or Cao Kun how their ambitions played out.\n\nYet nonetheless, this is not the Beiyang Republic. There is no inherent corruption, inherent patronage, cutthroat deals, or decades of political baggage. This is a new, fresh, and rejuvenated republic. Built upon the blood of martyrs, and the ideals of provincial freedoms, and national democracy. But, with a new republic, there remains a large amount of old faces. Those old acolytes of the Zhili, Fengtian, the Chinese Constitutionalists, Political Science, Young China, various other groups continue to persist in the new political battleground amongst the upstarts of the Grand Republican Alliance and China Democratic League.\n\nBut this is certainly no large hurdle for Tang Jiyao's firstborn. Conniving and sincere, in his own way, Xiaoying himself has made great strides in building genuine connections amongst the whole political battleground. From his own cliques within the Grand Republican Alliance, be they People's Government Party, Dian Clique, People's Renewal Society, or the Public Interest Party. Or those from his personal connections with the likes of Luo Longji, Wen Yiduo, or Li Gongpu, bringing him sway with the Crescent Moon Society and National Salvation Federation of the China Democratic League.\n\nOr even perhaps the political independents? The Endeavour Society, Political Science, or even the merchants. And what about the Liangists? The Young China Party, and Chinese Constitutionalists, both groups of which Tang retains close ties to.\n\nWith his rule stabilised, there remains the opportunity for Xiaoying to pull on his ties, to play a balancing role amongst the interest groups of the republic, favouring some assortment of individuals to aid in building a new future for China."

#YUN UPC Epilogues (460-479):
 YUN.endgame.460.t: "Science, Spirit, and the Talented Minority"
 YUN.endgame.460.d: "The Crescent Moon Society began as a circle of friends, sharing poetry and politics over dinner. Even then, they were exceptional people. In an age where many turned to desperately to modernisation, they retained this unfailing belief in the human spirit. Industrialisation was inevitable, but it breaks the bond between livelihood and nature. The mechanical demands for efficiency and competition undermined the \"True Sympathy\" that builds human friendships. Restoring the natural \"joy of life\" requires the elimination of \"the superstition about success and efficiency\" being promoted by the YMCA and Marxists alike. Like the Confucians, the Crescent Moon Society sees human responsibility as a moral problem, and beckons the \"Talented Minority\" to rise.\n\nThis \"Talented Minority\" sought by the Crescentists is not a distinct class or party but many individuals seeking pure knowledge. These individuals ought to be on the forefront of a global movement that recognises each man their own moral being - a radical turnabout from the traditional Confucian concept of man. As Xu Zhimo surmised after reading of Friedrich Nietzsche and Romain Roland, \"on spiritual matters, I am for aristocracy; on material things, I advocate democracy.\"\n\nIt has fallen upon Luo Longji to build this democracy, one that combines representative government with an expert bureaucracy. The people cannot trust the government without free elections and an open, uncorrupt civil service system. Luo once bemoaned China's lack of available talent as the nation's elites went abroad to study but often refused to return, and those that did suffered in a system rank with nepotism. Through the Crescent Moon's \"expertocracy\", the public can participate in politics through political parties and local organisations while the experts in vocational bodies and professional societies are empowered to utilise their expertise to administer the state."
 YUN.endgame.460.a: "Saving China from \"national suicide\" of tyranny and brain drain."

 YUN.endgame.461.t: "Education and Society"
 YUN.endgame.461.d: "Whilst ostensibly President of the whole Chinese Republic, Cun Shusheng often finds himself away from the capital, returning to his hometown. An educator at heart, he frequently makes a habit of attending the various schools in the region as an educator, and most particularly, in that of Yiqun Middle School. Perhaps better suited to the role of Professor, or Dean, rather than that of a politician, let alone one of the whole nation beyond Yunnan, Cun has nonetheless found no issue in adopting the mold of a true statesman.\n\nImbued with a patriotic fervour, and an understanding that education, not political reform, not revolution, not grand-standing foreign ambitions or the blight of total societial rejuvenation, but education, and education alone is the wellspring of China's issues. If the people cannot read, if they cannot write, how are they to be expected to participate in a civic democracy? To formulate their own ideas, their own concepts. To advance the nation onto new heights?\n\nWhen Cun took the incumbent position as president, the nation's best and brightest could not even compare to the average set of alumni of an American University. But similarly, when Cun took the incumbency of Heshun Central Primary School, the majority of children were outside schooling, and most adults under 30 illiterate. And yet look at Heshun Township now! The majority of children are enrolled in education, and the majority of adults able to read and write.\n\nAnd so it is to this example that Cun aims to rectify China's greatest blight restraining it from true prosperity. To usher in a new era, the people must but merely devote themselves towards the development of the country's economic construction, and its cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings. Working ever diligently, ever relentlessly, Cun assumed the presidency of a wounded and hurt nation. But by the time his term ends, there is no doubt in his mind that he will leave the people a fresh utopia."

 YUN.endgame.462.t: "Heirs of the Future"
 YUN.endgame.462.d: "There is much to do, and much to do about the President of the Republic. Born with only scant memories of what came before the Warlord Era, Tang Xiaoying is but one of many of the new generation tasked with stewardship from the old. Whilst his father was perhaps one of the most important individuals in the whole era, what does that make of him? Was his lot in life much better? Did he benefit from it? Perhaps he did, perhaps he didn't.\n\nNonetheless, his father died pursuing the dream of a free, democratic, and federalist Chinese republic. A scholar at heart but a warrior in reality, that is all of which Tang Jiyao had fought for his whole life, and it had cost him such. But his mission didn't die with him, keeping the dream alive are all of his allies, all of his friends, and most importantly, his son. His flesh and blood. And it is to this testament that the nation has been brought together to finalise the dream that Jiyao, and so many others, died fighting for.\n\nKeeping the dream alive, that is what this is for. But that isn't to say that Xiaoying isn't genuine, no. In a world as harsh as our's, with so much lust for wealth, for power, few genuine statesmen exist that scant but many are cast down as nothing but brokers of their own benefit. Yet, Xiaoying carries genuine conviction in spades, a grassroots organiser, an impromptu soldier.\n\nHis father bestowed upon him the torch of a whole era of Xinhai revolutionaries, all those that died, their dreams of a Chinese democracy did not die with them. As long as Xiaoying, or any of those for which the old generation of reformers and revolutionaries impacted, remain alive, then their debt will be repaid. It may not be certain, it may not be guaranteed, it may be the flaunting of idealists even, but we must try."
 YUN.endgame.462.a: "We are all lights shining in the darkness."

 YUN.endgame.463.t: "People's Government and Fengjian Federalism"
 YUN.endgame.463.d: "Zhang Taiyan had spent much of his life confronting the fundamental question at the heart of democracy: how to protect the freedom of the individual whilst granting the state sufficient power to provide public services to its citizens. This had long been what tore Taiyan apart, and drove him in his endeavours, and in his philosophy. The Buddhist concept of Emptiness enabled Taiyan to see the creation of the nation-state as merely a pragmatic service.\n\nIn fact, not only the nation-state, but liberalism, was a means to an end, everything served to reach a balance between the freedom of the individual, the authority of the leader, and the power of the state. All Federalism did, in the end, was maximise the accountability of the individual, their leaders, and the state.\n\nTaiyan is gone, but perhaps his greatest follower lives on. In President Tang, the unfettered and unrelentless autonomy, Fengjian, sought by Taiyan had been tempered by the cold, harsh reality. A revolutionary hero, a warrior-scholar, a statesman, and a crafter of a new republic, Tang Jiyao is a man of many achievements. But they are all done in service of the people, and to his country. His Federalism serves a dual purpose in his eyes, that of a statebuilding project, and that of a Buddhist rite.\n\nImproving the lives of the people, pursuing a constitutional, stable, and anti-Militarist republic, Tang has always walked the narrow road. Perhaps seeking the long-term vision, he naturally straddled between autocracy and revolution. A nationalist, but with an abject fear of populism, he had made many enemies, but in the end, what do they have to stand for?\n\nDemocracy has been stewarded unto the masses, in all of its beauty, in all of its ugliness. Setting the example, Tang has not brought unto the masses a new era of Beiyang despotism, but the genuine democratic dream he and Zhang Taiyan had long sought. At the end of the day, there is but one deciding factor in Tang's mind. \"How can the poor masses be made happy?\""
 YUN.endgame.463.a: "\"I am not myself, but my country's. I love what benefits my country, and hate what harms it.\""

 YUN.endgame.464.t: "Sins of the Father"
 YUN.endgame.464.d: "It is the unforgivable weight of our genetic bloodlines for which our descendents must bear the cross of their forefathers. Tang Xiaoying understands this greatly; his father, beguiled, admired, everywhere he travels they make comparisons between him and his father. But it is the democratic cause, the Federalist cause, for which his father fought and died for. And it is for this that Xiaoying has been thrust into his position.\n\nNaturally, the long and unsteady road of the Chinese revolution onto the long sought after ideal has not been a straight one. Bounding idealism burst into the chaotic flames of Xinhai, engulfing the Qing Dynasty in the heat of its own apathy, and from the ashes building the Beiyang Republic. Yet even the utterance of such a name invokes feelings of malaise or disgust. And it is a pity. A pity that so many died for a failure. That so many died before being comforted by the conclusion of their dream.\n\nBut there is one fuel that stokes the fire of idealists and revolutionaries all around the world: hope. Hope for a better future, for a better life, not just for them, but their descendants too. Xiaoying may honour his father by bearing his banner, but so too does the lowly peasant, the worker, the politician, the soldier.\n\nXinhai took over a generation to complete, and even then, there is still work to be done. And so, one cannot lament those who gave their lives, or the sins of their past, or of their betters. There is always the next generation, the next era, to bear the torches of the revolution, of democracy, of idealism. And so, as Xiaoying works in the Presidential Palace, as the politician works in the assembly, as the worker in the factory, as the peasant in the field, as the soldier in the trench, all of China works towards a better future. No matter the cost, or the cross to bear."
 YUN.endgame.464.a: "The past is gone, we have to look forward."

 YUN.endgame.465.t: "A Republic of the Victors"
 YUN.endgame.465.d: "\"It is the sage who appears when the world follows the Way and retires when it does not. It is the hero who retires when the world follows the Way and appears when it does not\". Pouring over his diary from the days of his youth, in the hush of a calm night, those words, those fabled words Tang Jiyao had written nigh four decades ago during his time as a student, they still ring true, don't they? Was he not the Confucian military hero?\n\nReinvigoration of domestic affairs had always been China's most important task, but ordinary men were utterly incapable of it. The numb insensibility of the Chinese in the face of disaster at foreign hands had only evolved into inept and incapable flailing co-opted by revolutionary demagogues, hoping to abuse the masses into their own form of \"salvation\". Or otherwise, apathy. The all-encompassing nothingness that enabled warlords to rule for so long. Brother had fought brother for power and profit and for so long that few even knew the meaning of brotherhood in the first place.\n\nThe creation of a shared nation-state, where every individual assumes the responsibility for the well-being of the nation-state, Cai E had mused about this in his writings, he had chastised Yuan Shikai for pursuing the exact opposite. But what would he think of Tang, of \"Mr. Ming\", as he derisively referred to him. He had neither pursued the course set out by Cai, nor that of his other mentor, Zhang Taiyan. Instead, he had charted his own independent course.\n\nAnd whilst it is true, Tang had not brought forward liberal democracy or Federalism as others desired; it was apparent that the masses simply weren't ready. But he had not bestowed upon the Chinese people a new autocracy. The nation was strong and united. With idle musings in the Presidential Palace and an aging body, seemingly Tang Jiyao \"the hero\" had retired, allowing Tang Jiyao \"the sage\" to emerge, to guide the nation in its reinvigoration."

#NPA Endgame Shared (600-629):

 YUN.endgame.600.t: "Finishing the Mission"
 YUN.endgame.600.d: "Finally, after what seemed like decades with sparing interruptions, the nation has once again been united, and seemingly, for good. And again it would appear history has repeated itself, as a warlord clique, eponymously named after its province of origin, has fulfilled such promises of national unification.\n\nConstantly a pivotal player in national politics, Yunnan had seemingly had its true ambitions consistently blunted, either by a contingent of provinces united against them, or buckling under the sheer weight of responsibility due to their posturing.\n\nNonetheless, their present efforts cannot help but harken towards the days of Cai E, Li Liejun, and Tang Jiyao in 1915. And though so unlikely at the time, given Cai's death and the collapse of their movement, it could perhaps be considered the natural course of events that Yunnan would eventually finish its mission started decades ago, affirming itself as the true Master of the Eastern Continent.\n\nYet Yunnan's Thermidor attitudes have not been welcomed too kindly by the established Beiyang National Order, who have seen a group of rowdy upstarts uproot their own entrenched positions, and supplant themselves in their place. Similarly, the democrats and revolutionaries alike find few friends in the incumbent government once more, as whilst a softer hand is at the wheel, the government itself remains cautious and conservative.\n\nStuck between a rock and a hard place, the Yunnan-led government has sought to position itself as bearers of the Five Races, and of the Southern revolutionary-style populism, to little avail, as the people seek real, genuine change. Not a revival of the old order."
 YUN.endgame.600.a: "We must build a nation from scraps."

 YUN.endgame.601.t: "Consequences of Economic Mismanagement"
 YUN.endgame.601.d: "Suffice to say, China's economic standing both internally and internationally leaves much to be desired. Years of civil war, followed by a war of national reunification, and then of national survival, has sufficiently depleted both any and all financial reserves nationwide, whilst similarly damaging infrastructure, factories, homes, and other facets of the nation-state.\n\nInvestors have fled, or otherwise are in the process of doing so, with debts accumulated during the Warlord Era or in the wartime conditions finally being cashed in, not least to mention the years of lost economic growth from the collapse of relative peace and stability brought forward by the Zhili's tentative unification bid.\n\nFurthermore, looming uncertainties about future prospects, and lack of optimism in any measurable progress emerging from the new government has coincided with an increase in corruption, property disputes, abuses by the military, and a general anathema to good conduct.\n\nAlbeit by the far the largest economic issue to be addressed is the size of the massive Chinese military at present, as conscription and mobilisation has ballooned the armed forces. Similarly, with a juvenile and inefficient bureaucracy at the helm of the governmental organs, common sources of government revenue such as tax collection has failed to meet expected national standards."

 YUN.endgame.602.t: "Infants in the Lion's Den"
 YUN.endgame.602.d: "Perhaps utterly out of their depth, the isolationist minded Dian Clique has been thrust into a position quite unbeknownst to them. Having been willing, at least in restrained manner, to aid Tang Jiyao's ambitions for national unification, few expected that they themselves would be the men within the Capital, delegating and deriving solutions to all myriad of national political issues.\n\nAnd yet, their unification has thrown the established order into chaos; originally divided by North and South, various political conventions were entrenched within the regional politicians from those areas, evident enough in attitudes during the various North-South Peace Talks of the Warlord Era. Even on an individual provincial level, politics and statesmanship was enacted with its own unique provincial qualities.\n\nBut the same actors that occupy positions in the cabinet remained relatively unknown, at least outside their pocket of the Southwest. Thrust into a complicated world where brute strength and coup d'états hardly win men any favours, they are left without any trump cards to push through their policies, instead having to rely on raw political skill; of which they are lacking.\n\nWith experiences navigating provincial politics and its assembly, the sheer scale of their new responsibilities calls upon them to handle not only the national assembly and attitudes, but various forces that they had once crushed. Revolutionaries and radicals, aiming their guns at the President's Chair, democrats harnessing calls for democracy, provincial warlords demanding autonomy, and the old order aiming to protect its established interests.\n\nWith a lack of cohesive vision, a corrupt bureaucracy, and a general state of disorder harming any efforts of true statesmanship, the new Chinese Republic may very well be sowing its own seeds of further civil war, should it waste any more time cutting to the root of the Chinese society's issues."

 YUN.endgame.603.t: "China's Own Sword of Damocles"
 YUN.endgame.603.d: "Placed into a uniquely vulnerable situation, China's suffering of the 20th century has perhaps reached its greatest low yet. All too aware of such a fact, the national military has engaged in various abuses both of their power, and as a cautioning manouevre aimed at the President-Marshal to maintain his loyalties to the army, and assurances of their rights, autonomy, and protections.\n\nOf course, such a situation is untenable and equally as exploitable. With the economy in shambles, politics quickly dissipating into chaos, and the Dian Clique bearings its teeth against its own reflection, the increasing sense of weakness and vulnerability within the new republic has become an open secret.\n\nWithin the countryside resistance continues to form, propagate, and expand as bandits and revolutionaries seem to conduct parallel campaigns of enacting \"justice\" against the government and all perceived tyrants. In return, the military has clearly begun to abuse their jurisdiction in areas with martial law active, holding up gentry, merchant, or peasant alike and extracting fines or other miscellaneous levies. In a similar vein, many reports float into the Capital that a plethora of petty warlords have emerged, effectively ignoring government directives.\n\nOne of the root causes of the so-called Sword of Damocles for the nascent republic is that of the military's abundant over-inflation, and its myriad of inefficiencies. Having grown complacent over its successes and accumulated wealth, the warlords have fought back intensely against any notion of demobilisation or reintroduction of military discipline. And for the common soldiery, they fear demobilisation not for its deprivation of power for their bosses, but because it will reduce them to unemployment without any technical skills or knowhow in a less than ideal economy."
 YUN.endgame.603.a: "The military should learn to retain its distance."

#LYC Endgame Events (630-659):
 YUN.endgame.630.t: "The National Protection Cabinet"
 YUN.endgame.630.d: "Long Yun has come a long way in such a short period of time. Once a subordinate officer for an outlying warlord, he became Governor and then a pretender and now suddenly he has become the undisputed President of all of China. But this newfound power comes with weighty responsibilities and he cannot rule alone.\n\nBuilding the government needed to see China's post-war reconstruction starts with appointing a sympathetic Prime Minister to head the government. While both the old Beiyang and Guangzhou governments have been forced into submission, maintaining legitimacy as a regional faction turned national government requires diplomatic tact and inside connections.\n\nThe Li brothers, Long's relatives by his former marriage and essential to helping maintain power. Li Peitian is the elder brother and was Long's chief ambassador to various governments in addition to his various experiences in administration. Though apparently not well liked, he nevertheless was a major negotiator with the Beijing and Guangzhou political establishments and has overseen talks with democratic figures in Yunnan. Elevating Li to the Prime Ministership (and his brother Li Peiyan to a senior role in the Cabinet) would formalise the system as it stands, but would also confirm people's suspicions that Long Yun plans to rule as a Cai E-style autocrat.\n\nThe alternative is to appoint a Beiyang insider, ideally one already under Yunnanese influence. Tang Jiyao had worked to cultivate some as part of his People's Government Party, and another set of brothers stood out. Wang Dong was a protégé of Zhang Taiyan while in Zhejiang, a descendant of the prestigious Wang family. His brother Wang Rongbao was a legislator, ambassador, and constitution drafter for the Beiyang government. Selecting him would at least show some limited deference to the old political system and a limited commitment to constitutional rule."

 YUN.endgame.631.t: "Xiong Qinglai, the Mathematician"
 YUN.endgame.631.d: "Xiong Qinglai was born in Yunnan in 1893 to a government official. Despite the upswing of anti-foreign sentiment in the province, he began studying English and French while attending the Yunnan Provincial Institute of Higher Learning in 1911. This allowed him to win a provincial government scholarship to study mining in Belgium in 1913 but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War.\n\nAs a result he went to Paris and completed his undergraduate studies at the Lycee St. Louis before pursuing advanced education at the University of Grenoble where he studied mathematics, analytic mechanics, physics, and astronomy. In 1920, he was awarded a Master of Science degree but was rushed home when the revolution overtook France.\n\nAfter returning to China, he relocated to Nanjing to establish a Department of Mathematics at the National Southeastern University where he wrote textbooks on mathematical subjects ranging from geometry to differential equations, a pioneer in introducing modern mathematics to China. After a brief stint at Northwestern University in Shaanxi (disrupted by warlord conflicts), he joined the faculty at Tsinghua University where he oversaw the establishment of the Department of Mathematics.\n\nIn the 1930s he returned to Europe where he earned international acclaim for his paper \"On Infinite Integer Functions and Metapure Functions.\" He also attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich on behalf of China, serving as the only Chinese representative. Upon his return to China, he became President of Yunnan University in Kunming, expanding the school and continuing to represent China abroad - the face of China's ever growing academic prowess on the world stage."

 YUN.endgame.632.t: "The Family Business"
 YUN.endgame.632.d: "Ever since Long Yun's marriage to Li Peilian in 1915, the Li family has always had Long Yun's ear. Li Peilian was a descendant of Li Canting, a famous doctor, and was known for her artistic talents and beauty. The exact story of how they met has become a fixture of local propaganda and folklore, but what is clear is that she was an extremely close confidant and effective in mobilising women in support of her husband as a \"modern\" Chinese woman - well educated, \"Westernised\" and well-connected with local intellectuals. She died of illness at only 33 in 1933.\n\nThe most significant of the couple's children was Long Jomon, their fourth son, who is currently a minor military staff officer. Long also has several other children from other marriages, most of which are either in the military, government, or business - most notably Long Xianzeng who was a senior staff officer overseeing military construction and a major patron of the arts.\n\nDespite Li Peilian's death, her brothers Li Peitian and Li Peiyan remain extremely influential in Long Yun's administration. Li Peitian is the elder brother, generally used as a plenipotentiary for Long Yun to various outside governments and negotiations with local powerholders but also having been charged with overseeing the training of government magistrates, the Grain Policy Bureau, and the Finance Department. Li Peiyan is a year younger and was an educator turned provincial senator before being dismissed due to allegations of corruption. He was released thanks to his sister's marriage and has since been described as Long's political frontman, organising his patronage networks, provincial banking, and several other senior economic and political roles including in water management, infrastructure development, and even sugar factory construction. Though his competence in those matters have been questionable, his loyalty is not."

 YUN.endgame.660.t: "Lu Han's Uprising"
 YUN.endgame.660.d: "A final confrontation between Hu Ruoyu and Lu Han inches ever closer, and in some ways this will be the final showdown between north and south. The two men have been at odds for some time, and fighting the wars of unification only provided a brief respite. The fact that both men are seen as lucky outsiders to national politics has only fueled further uncertainty as they compete for control over the army and bureaucracy.\n\nFar away from home, Hu Ruoyu has tried to get the old Beiyang establishment in his corner. As the new President, he has a greater national profile and is able to count on foreign backing to maintain his rule, but he also shoulders a greater degree of culpability (fairly or not) for the challenges of national reconstruction. Similarly, by trying to ingrain himself as a successor to the old Zhili Clique, he draws on a divisive legacy.\n\nMarshal Lu Han, his rival, has mainly worked to absorb his relative Long Yun's former allies into his camp. He has also tried to cast a wide net, courting former supporters of the Guangzhou government, regionalist sentiment, republican nationalism, and even Kuomintang style populism. At an institutional disadvantage, he decided to strike first, tapping into anger at Hu's alleged dark dealings with foreign powers, corruption, and autocratic leadership to try staging a coup.\n\nTaking advantage of Hu Ruoyu entertaining foreign dignitaries, Lu Han ordered his men to surround key positions in the Capital, hoping to arrest Hu Ruoyu and his chief lieutenants. But Hu, well familiar with Tang Jiyao and Long Yun's downfalls, was wise enough to escape and gathered his own forces for a counterattack. By nightfall..."

 YUN.endgame.661.t: "Yunnanese Cuisine"
 YUN.endgame.661.d: "In many noodle shops in Yunnan, it is not uncommon to see \"meixin\" (rice noodles) served with ingredients including meat that is rare/raw, vegetables, and other ingredients on the side often in boxes. This delicacy are cross-bridge rice noodles which originate from Mengzi in Southern Yunnan.\n\nThere are several legends but the most popularly cited legend describes a scholar studying on an isolated island and whose wife would deliver him meals daily. To keep the broth hot during her journey across a bridge, she devised a method of insulating it with a layer of chicken fat while keeping raw ingredients separate to cook in the broth upon arrival. The dish also has some similarities with the Vietnamese “pho” which should be no surprise given that Yunnan and Indochina share a border.\n\nThe legend is so popular that it is alleged to be one of the reasons why local warlords in Mengzi dredged the South Lake to imitate the story. It is one of the Yunnaneses' most treasured cultural heritages and is popular throughout the country.\n\nPu'er tea is also another locally cultivated speciality. It has been cultivated and produced by the Bulang and Dai people who live in the Jingmai Mountain since at least the 10th century. Traditionally tea trees would be planted in the forest understory after larger trees were removed. Partitioned forests would be planted to protect against the spread of pests and diseases, with cultivated land for crops and vegetables at lower altitudes."

 YUN.endgame.662.t: "The New Prime Minister"
 YUN.endgame.662.d: "While Hu Ruoyu and Lu Han clashed, working quietly in the background was the newly appointed Prime Minister Zhou Zhongyue. Zhou is a Yunnan elder statesman, an ethnic Bai politician who studied in Waseda University in Japan before returning to China to work as an educator in 1907. He helped to lead protests against the Unequal Treaties signed by the Qing dynasty which granted British and French exploitative mining rights in Yunnan province, and in 1910 after the Pianma incident he was sent by the provincial government to Beijing as part of a delegation protesting foreign interference.\n\nHe was made secretary general of the Governor's Office by Cai E after the Xinhai Revolution and in the coming years served in educational, economic, and political roles in the Beiyang government. But when Cai E rebelled against Yuan Shikai, he stayed behind to cover Cai's escape and later was forced to flee to Japan, thus missing the National Protection War.\n\nAfter Cai E died in 1916, Luo was retained by Tang Jiyao and played senior roles - even briefly serving as Governor of Yunnan. He helped mediate between Tang, Long, and Hu during the various coups and also aided in the establishment of the Yunnan Tongzhi Museum.\n\nHe largely retired in the early 1930s, but amid the chaos in the province he was sent as an emissary to Beijing as a representative. The connections he made there and his relative neutrality made him one of the few worthy candidates worth appointing Prime Minister."
 YUN.endgame.662.a: "Zhou is an excellent conduit between [ROOT.GetLeader] and the legislature."
 YUN.endgame.662.b: "He is a reliable, silent servant of state - and more importantly the President."

#YUN NPA Epilogues (700-729):

 YUN.endgame.700.t: "Peering within the Dragon's Den"
 YUN.endgame.700.d: "To bridge the gap between revolution and reformism is no easy task, especially within China's storied history. But within the Dian Clique, Long Yun has always been eccentric in this essence. With many of his close friends and allies having either joined the Kuomintang, or otherwise participated in the Tongmenghui, Long in-essence has been surrounded by agents of revolution throughout his career. Albeit, the President-Marshal's inference is far more similar to that of Political Science, than the lackeys of Hu Hanmin or Wang Jingwei.\n\nWhilst not entirely incompatible, President Long has sought the \"revolutionary\" path not out of conviction for the ideals of Sun Yat-sen, but for its measurable and actionable progress. Whilst the President is far out of his comfort zone, such a notion remains true in his heart; there is no man better suited for the capacity that the Presidency requires than that of the man who can control all aspects of government with conviction and zeal akin to that of the most relentless revolutionaries.\n\nIn essence a government \"of the experts\" as advised by his friends like Luo Longji and Liu Zhenhuan, in-reality a government dominated by the same men that controlled provincial matters in Yunnan. Entirely entrenched, the Dian Clique are but the puppet masters of a national bureaucracy, filling out every governmental organ. The Army's upper echelons are staffed by men close to the President-Marshal. The bureaucracy is controlled under Li Peiyan, Li Peitian, and Zhou Zhongyue. The gentry corralled under Lu Chongren, the bankers and industrialists under Miao Yuntai.\n\nAll working at the behest of Long, the Dian Dragon has but merely supplanted Northern dominance of the Central Government, with that of his own Southerners. Valuing efficiency and loyalty, Long's heavy-handed \"revolutionary\" leadership has become provident in progress, albeit some within the opposition make not of a regime contingent upon the capacities of one man to ensure its survival."
 YUN.endgame.700.a: "Thus roars the Dian Dragon."

 YUN.endgame.701.t: "A President and His Republic"
 YUN.endgame.701.d: "How would history view the Chinese Republican experiment? A success? A failure? Or something in-between? Having sundered China's millennia of dynastic history, the Xinhai Revolution unleashed a true whirlwind of ideas out into the open. But the whirlwind was all consuming, and with the counter-offensive of Yuan Shikai, China would once again be cast into decades of misery, poverty, and civil war.\n\nYet there alone stood men of defiance: the Dian Clique. But there can be no folly or mistake, their defiance in the face of Yuan's personalist power plays resulted in the fracturing of the nation and the ensuing Warlord Era. But alas that has all come to pass, and once again the Dian Clique has transformed the nation, this time perhaps on the path to unity, not struggle.\n\nA Yi soldier of the Yunnan Army since his early days, Long Yun's career has been nothing if not remarkable. Constantly and consistently distinguishing himself in campaigns in multiple armies, the \"Yunnan Dragon\" entrusted it upon himself to seize the initiative and preserve his province's integrity in 1927, and again, having aided in the ousting of Tang Jiyao, sallied forward with his sabre in-hand to deliver timely justice to those tyrants who would seek to mistreat the people. Or at least, that is what the President-Marshal would portray himself as; a common man's hero.\n\nWhilst the President's personal politics remain ever pragmatic and aloof, Long's cabinet and courtiers would at least portray a notion of commitment to democracy. Like the Zhili before him, Long's daily endeavours in the Presidential Palace, Assembly, and Senate have him surrounded by a personal camarilla of various liberals, conservatives, and other democrats.\n\nPerhaps most close to the President however, is that of Luo Longji and his Crescent Moon Society. Advising the President on matters relating from national policy to mere mutual discussions about the arts, the Lonesome Warrior and Dian Dragon are in some ways two kindred spirits, striking out and walking the same path."
 YUN.endgame.701.a: "Every King needs his Scholar."

 YUN.endgame.702.t: "A New Order..."
 YUN.endgame.702.d: "For the first time since Cai E in the 1910s, Yunnan has a voice in the central government. And this time, Yunnan is on top. Few believed he would try it, even fewer believed he could, but Hu Ruoyu was able to unite all of China under him and his provisional government. Little more than a regional footnote in Chinese politics a decade ago, Hu Ruoyu has become the President of the Republic.\n\nHu Ruoyu reflects the modern evolution of Cai E's ideology - with a belief in a powerful, border-line absolute military executive ruling \"A Militaristic State-People.\" This military man is to be patriotic, honorable, disciplined, and dutiful towards the nation-state - animated by a \"martial spirit\" that allows him to discern national interests and sacrifice everything for it.\n\nWhile in Beijing, Cai E was never truly opposed to parties on principle, but believed that the nation's unity and the preservation of the constitution were of the utmost importance. The Zhili, the eventual victors of the High Warlord Era power struggles in Beiyang, eventually realised the importance of incorporating civilian bureaucrats and intellectuals into their governing apparatus and proved generally effective in this regard with the establishment of the Harmony Association and tolerance (if not always cooperation) with various parties in legislature.\n\nHu Ruoyu and his allied generals have settled into a similar dynamic, appointing a non-partisan Prime Minister in Zhou Zhongyu while their junta rules in the background. Their efforts to absorb the old Zhili clique, Harmony Association, and other networks have been awkward and spotty but will slowly take shape across the next decade or so. Hu Ruoyu has tried to cast himself as the \"Great Commandant\", elevating himself to the same level as Cao Kun's King of Baoding and Wu Peifu's Jade Marshal cults of personality. Whether he will be able to live up to those shows is another matter."
 YUN.endgame.702.a: "...and a continuation of the old."

 YUN.endgame.703.t: "From Militarist to President"
 YUN.endgame.703.d: "The post-Xinhai environment has rewarded bold, ambitious men - allowing them to rise far above their station with the right amount of determination, military prowess, charisma, ruthlessness and good fortune. Lu Han, an ethnic minority from a distant province, was an unexpected victor but perhaps embodies the shifting fortunes of the era.\n\nHaving fought, befriended, schemed, rabbleroused, and betrayed his way to the top, Lu Han commands a united China as its new President. He remains an enigma to many even now - a childhood friend and later betrayer of his former patron, a populist who has always been connected to the establishment, and a regionalist who managed to unite the nation.\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand Lu Han would be to trace the line of Yunnan leaders before him. Cai E's tenure in Beijing as a wary lieutenant of Yuan Shikai saw him court Liang Qichao and his various parties and emphasise constitutionalism but also support borderline autocratic, militaristic Presidential authority at the expense of parliament and regional autonomy.\n\nCai died shortly after beginning a stalemated war to defend the republic against Yuan Shikai's coronation. Tang Jiyao succeeded him after a brief power struggle and emphasised Federalism, constitutionalism, and even a move towards civilian albeit authoritarian rule. The generation after that retained Cai and Tang's authoritarianism and moved towards an isolationist brand of regionalism but also maintained at least some of the civilian-focused rule Tang developed.\n\nSo what will Lu Han, arguably the fourth leader of the Yunnan Clique, do now that he rules all of China? Nationalism and centralisation seems inevitable, favoritism towards Yunnanese and other southerners as well. Beyond that is a mystery - but idiosyncratic, pragmatic leadership is nothing new in China. There will likely be appeals to \"democracy\", progress, and constitutionalism with varying degrees of sincerity and followthrough - but the nation above all."

They are the basis of the Crescent Moon's struggle, and dare they be the basis of the whole struggle of the whole China Democratic League.\n\nThe Chinese Constitution must be the first in the world that backs up its democratic embellishments with true citizen's democracy. For a free and truly democratic system must place human rights before even the paper they are demarcated upon.

Forced to kneel at the foot of the Beijing Government, Governor Tang Jiyao finds his government deadlocked in a struggle against the remnants of the Kuomintang forces in Guizhou. Styling himself the leader of the Federalist Movement, Tang seeks to not only crush the KMT rebels, but carry out unification on his terms.

 YUN_country_intro_header: "§lMaster of the Eastern Continent§!"
 YUN_country_intro_content: "Long a hotbed of Anti-Qing sentiment, §YYunnan§! would be resolutely up in arms following the proclamation of the §lXinhai Revolution§! in 1911. Under the leadership of §mLi Genyuan§!, the Kunming Military Academy had become the centrepiece of the revolutionaries' chessboard in the region with its alumni and faculty all having ties to the §lTongmenghui§! in some form. Under the auspices of §mLi Genyuan§!, §PCai E§!, §aLuo Peijin§!, §PLiu Cunhou§!, §mGu Pinzhen§!, §aTang Jiyao§! and others, the §YYunnan§! §lTongmenghui§! launched their own solidarity uprising with §lXinhai§! on October 30th, 1911 (The Ninth Day of the Ninth Month of the Lunar Calendar), dubbed the \"Double Ninth\" Uprising. Becoming one of the first provinces to achieve total victory in the §lXinhai Revolution§!, §YYunnan§! would set forth to invade §YSichuan§! and §YGuizhou§!, inspiring local forces there to revolt, whilst doing so similarly in §YGuangxi§!, and §YGuangdong§!. Becoming paramount to a national hero, §PCai E§! would become Governor of §YYunnan§!, and §aTang Jiyao§! the Governor of §YGuizhou§!.\n\nWith the unstable political diarchy between North and South being shattered through §PYuan Shikai's§! machinations, §lXinhai§! hero and devout revolutionary §cLi Leijun§! would launch his §cSecond Revolution§! under the auspices of §aSun Yat-sen§!, an ultimately doomed endeavour after a large number of the provinces, including §YYunnan§! and §YGuizhou§!, refused to obey the call for revolution. Still remaining in an uneasy power balance, §PCai E§! would be \"promoted\" to a position in §YBeijing§!, practically being forced to acquiesce, and therefore would nominate §aTang Jiyao§! to replace him in §YYunnan§!; with §PLiu Xianshi§! replacing §aTang§! in §YGuizhou§!.\n\nPlanning to restore the monarchy, §PYuan Shikai§! would foment §mLi Genyuan§!, §aTang Jiyao§!, §cLi Liejun§!, §PCai E§!, and other revolutionaries within and outside the country to begin planning yet another revolt against his rule. publicly demanding that §PYuan Shikai§! execute all his accomplices in his imperial ambitions, and receiving no response, §PCai E§!, §cLi§!, and §aTang§! would all announce the formation of the §lNational Protection Army§!, and their independence from the §cCentral Government§!. A lone province against the rest of China, the decisive and brilliant victories won in the early campaign against the §eBeiyang§! Army resulted in §YYunnan§! being joined by §YGuizhou§!, §YGuangxi§!, §YGuangdong§!, and eventually the majority of the South (even if some were reluctant).\n\nWinning and forming their own government for a brief period, both §PCai E§! and §PYuan Shikai§! would die not long after, having left the foundations for warlordism in their wake. With a political struggle unfolding between §PFeng Guozhang§! and §PDuan Qirui§!, §PYuan's§! de-facto successors, the Northern Assembly would be dissolved, and in response §aSun Yat-sen§!, §cZhang Taiyan§!, and others would launch the §lConstitutional Protection Movement§! in §YGuangdong§!, albeit it would eventually be hijacked by leaders such as §PLu Rongting§! and §aCen Chunxuan§! who attempt to negotiate with §eBeiyang§!. Roped into the Movement as Deputy Generalissimo (Albeit resigning immediately), §aTang§! would continue his ambitions to control the Southwest.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the §YFederalist§! movement would pick up intellectual steam, seeing key promoters amongst the warlords such as §PLu Yongxiang§!, §aCao Kun§!, §cZhao Hengti§!, §aTang Jiyao§!, §lChen Jiongming§!, §SXiong Kewu§!, and others. With §aSun's§! death in 1925, §aTang§! would attempt to stake his claim as Generalissimo, but would be decisively beaten back by the §PNew Guangxi Clique§!, retreating in contempt and failure to §YYunnan§! and §YGuizhou§!."

 YUN_country_intro_header_1: "§gKing of the Southwest§!"
 YUN_country_intro_content_1: "Effectively sidelined in his own government, and with paramount fears of an imminent Kuomintang invasion mounting, §aTang Jiyao§! scapegoated the failure of the Guangxi invasion on §PZhang Ruji§! (One of the four Garrison Commanders of Yunnan), having him shuffled out of §YMengzi§!, with §gLong Yun§! receiving §YKunming§!, §PHu Ruoyu§! receiving §PZhang's§! old territory, and §PLi Xuanting§! remaining in §YDali§!. In July of 1926 §aTang§! formed his own political party, claiming to have an ideology independent of foreign influence and compatible with the \"Chinese Essence\". Known as the §cMinzhidang§!, or §cPeople's Government Party§!, it is resolutely §YFederalist§! yet has an ambiguous relationship with the §lZhigongdang§!, or §lPublic Interest Party§! founded by §lChen Jiongming§!, of which §aTang Jiyao§! accepted deputy leadership of a year before.\n\nWith the faltering of the Northern Expedition in early 1927, §aTang§! attempted to invade the §kKuomintang§! again, but with all of his subordinates resolutely disobeying him, a coup was launched instead. Initiated by §PHu Ruoyu§!, the §YFebruary 6th Coup§! resulted in §gLong Yun§! emerging as the most powerful warlord in §YYunnan§!. Insisting that §aTang§! remain as a puppet governor for the maintenance of a balance of power, §gLong§! would ultimately be trumped by §aTang's§! power play on April 6th, orchestrating a revolt in §YMengzi§! and forcing §PHu Ruoyu§! out of §YKunming§!, then ordering §PMeng Youwen§! to drive out §gLong Yun§!.\n\nWith the §kKuomintang§! ordering a Long March into §YGuizhou§! in early 1927, §PChiang Kai-shek§! would be assassinated in February, and §cZhu Peide§! would assume control as §PGeneralissimo§!, negotiating with the infighting §YYunnan§! warlords to force their settlement in §YGuizhou§! province.\n\nWith Tang's success and the threat of the §RKuomintang§! diminishing, the King of the Southwest successfully reclaimed §YKunming§!, and forced a negotiated settlement between all parties: §aTang§! receives §YKunming§!, §gLong§! receives §YZhaotong§!, §PHu§!, §PLi Xuanting§! and §PZhang Ruji§! receive §YMengzi§!. §aSun Du§!, a former §PHu§! subordinate and §aTang§! supporter, receives §YDali§!. Reopening negotiations with §YBeijing§! during the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928, §aTang§! would secure concessions for §YFederalism§! in addition to Central Government funding with the stipulation that he move against the §RKuomintang§! in §aGuizhou§!.\n\nHowever, much akin to the Northern Expedition, §gLong Yun§! refused to sacrifice his soldiers, and so little action materialised. During the 1930s, the §gYunnan Clique§! turned inwards due to disillusionment with the §zZhili Government§!, and ceased their raids on the §kKuomintang§!. At the same time, the §kKuomintang§! §gJunta§! in §YGuizhou§! established a 5-man ruling council, under §PHe Yingqin§!, §cTan Yankai§!, §cZhu Peide§!, §aCheng Qian§!, and §PLi Zongren§!. Reorganising the remnant NRA, they would consolidate their forces into the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 7th National Revolutionary Armies, pushing out §cTan Yankai§!."

 YUN_country_intro_header_2: "The Stacked House of Cards"
 YUN_country_intro_content_2: "§MThe Yunnan Clique§!\nSurrounding the delicate balance struck within §YYunnan§! are the various disparate political factions of the province.

Loyal directly to §PCai E's§! successor, §aTang Jiyao§!, the §aTang Clique's§! past is as marred as its leader's. Espousing both authoritarian and progressive policies with the ultimate goal of promoting §YFederalism§!, the §aTang Clique§! endeavours to secure the support of reformist intellectuals whilst still maintaining the loyalty of the gentry and officers. Similarly related is the §cPeople's Government Party (Minzhidang)§!, the successor to §aTang's§! earlier §cDemocratic Party (Minzhudang)§!, representing the Governor's more reformist, democratic and conservative approach inspired by §cLiang Qichao§!, §cZhang Shizhao§!, and §cZhang Taiyan§!.\n\nRunning in tandem in the pursuit of democracy is the noble §lCrescent Moon Society§!, formed as a collection of Anglo-American educated intellectuals who wrote for §lCrescent Moon Magazine§!. Often coming into conflict with left wing writers due to their adoption of a more moderate and modern conservative outlook of Chinese Culture, the §lCrescent Moon Acolytes§! would begin to promote a humanistic form of constitutionalism, with a focus on human rights and education.\n\nIn conjunction there remains the §PHu Ruoyu§! and §gLong Yun§! Cliques, centred around their eponymous figures. Adopting various forms of semi-progressive governmental outlooks, the warlordist cliques truly desire only to rule at the top, strengthen Yunnan, and persist within the province, at least on the surface. Counted among them are various minor interest groups, such as the §mYunnan Chamber of Commerce§!, the §nYoung China Party§!, and others.\n\n§MThe Kuomintang§!\nWithin the §kKuomintang's§! remnant regime that has consolidated itself in §YGuizhou§!, there remain many factions of disparate ideological interpretations of the Three Principles of the People, and the §aGuofu§!'s will. With loyalists of the Old Right, the Guizhou §kKMT§! feature the heartbed of the New Right sect of the party, under its chief ideological theorist §aDai Jitao§!. However the true reigns of power rest with the descendants of §PChiang Kai-shek§!, in the form of the §PWhampoa Clique§! led by §PHe Yingqin§!. Through the promotion of §aDai's§! palingenetic ultranationalism claimed to be sourced from traditional Chinese beliefs, §PHe Yingqin§! seeks to revitalise China in pursuit of the National Revolution.\n\nDue to §aDai's§! efforts, the Zhejiang Society of Revolutionary Comrades, currently headed by the §aChen brothers§!, has aspirations to coalesce into the informal entity of the §aCentral Club Clique§!, technocratics with their own \"vitalist\" doctrine and similar paternal revolutionary nationalism as the §PWhampoa Clique§!. In their opposition is that of the §mNew Political Science Clique§!, with their niche in administration and banking interests, they are inherently technocratic and elitist, yet privy to the trappings of \"liberal\" democracy - managed through bureaucracy.\n\nThe radicals of the Party have found their flocks on the left and right within the camps of the §SCivil Engineering Clique§! and the §nBlue Shirt Society§!. With the latter believing that the §RNational Revolution§! has lost its revolutionary way, they are inspired by both Savinkov and Codreanu. §SCivil Engineering§! occupies a peculiar niche as leftists highly linked to the §rProvisional Action Committee§!, straddling the §Sleft§! and §aright§! of the Party.\n\nRemaining in primacy however is §cZhu Peide's 3rd Army§!, representing the §aOld Right of the Kuomintang§!. Inspired by orthodox Sanminism and with a strong adherence to §aHu Hanmin's§! integrity as leader of the §YCentral Committee§!, §cZhu Peide§! is inherently regionalist in nature, seeking to aid the Central Committee in their return to §YLiangguang§!. On his flank is §RZhu De's§! sect of leftists within the §cThird Army§!, greatly influenced by §RZhang Bojun§! from the §RProvisional Action Committee§!."
