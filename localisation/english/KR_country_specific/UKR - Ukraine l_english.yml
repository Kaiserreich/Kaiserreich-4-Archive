 UKR_totalist_party_long: "Ukrainska Komunistychna Partiia (Ukrainian Communist Party)\n§LPicking up the pieces in the aftermath of the destruction of Bolsheviks active in Ukraine, the UKP really had its work cut out for them. Forming at an emigre conference in Paris, the delegates at the Ukrainian Communist Party's Constituent Assembly were primarily former Bolsheviks who operated in Ukraine, as well as a few Radical Ukrainian Communists who, for one reason or another, decided to forgo activities within either the Borotbyst Movement or the Council-Revolutionary Bloc. In spite of taking much from the old Bolshevik political platform, there was a key difference nonetheless: A reassessment of the importance of the Ukrainian National Question. Although the UKP agreed to solidify this \"nationally-minded\" course through a comfortable majority, there was still the question of the UKP's overall goal. Should it seek to join Ukrainian Revolutionary Structures and forgo any ties to the possible Revolution in Russia or continue to try and fraternise with the Russian Revolutionary Movement, naturally weakening the ties to the Ukrainian one? As such, multiple fractions emerged. In the end, the overall leadership of the party went to Vlas Chubar, who represented a tenuous internal compromise and was seen as a leader capable of starting a new chapter in the history of the revolutionary movement. Nevertheless, so far, any and all attempts by the UKP to establish a political foothold have mostly failed.§!\n"

Founded in 1918, the Ukrainian Democratic Agrarian Party (originally the Ukrainian Democratic Party) sought to portray itself as the prime Ukrainian (as opposed to \"Greater-Russian in Ukraine\") conservative political force. Their politics combine notable economic interventionism with law and order policies, all wrapped up in a package with a strong executive and an influential parliament. The party's leadership was also instrumental in helping bring the Hetman to power. The Union of Agrarian Statists would split off on the eve of the 1924 elections, but was forced into a coalition with the Agrarian Democrats to preserve a conservative majority.

 ### Relief Bill ###
 UKR_Relief_Bill: "Relief Bill Negotiations"
 UKR_Relief_Bill_desc: "The so-called Hetman Coalition - a parliamentary alliance between the §cUDkhP§!, §aUSKhD§!, representatives of §mVSZV§! and §mProtofis§! and certain §CIndependent Deputies§! - has struggled to maintain a veneer of political stability and unity since its inception in 1924. Botched land reform and stalled industrialisation are just part of its legacy of factionalism and petty politics. Now, however, there seems to be little room for error: with the economic crisis and internal instability reaching heights unseen since 1918, the Hetman is growing more tired of the Coalition's inefficiency by the day.\n\nThe opposition, as it has been the case since the creation of the Soim, is represented by §lURDP§!. For years it has advocated for democratisation, devolution and progressive economic policies, while remaining cautious enough not to incur the wrath of the ruling regime. Their right wing, centred mainly around Serhii Shelukhyn, is relatively amicable towards the Coalition and may be negotiated with, especially in these trying times.\n\nFinally, there is the §PSHD§!. This semi-secret clique of military officers, civil servants and politicians is closely following developments in the Soim. Resenting parliamentarism and party politics of any kind they will certainly try to influence Hetman's decision-making if they feel threatened or emboldened enough. Such a scenario will pose a serious threat to the future of Ukrainian democracy.\n\nCertain events and national focuses will present opportunities for the player to influence support for the Relief Bill among the five main parliamentary factions. §CTo pass the Bill and give Ukrainian parliamentarism another chance, you must secure the support of four out of five factions.§! §RFailure to do so will most likely push the Ukrainian State in a more authoritarian direction.§!\n\n§lURDP§!: [UKR_get_urdp_support]\n§mVSZV§!/§mProtofis§!: [UKR_get_protofis_support]\n§cUDKhP§!: [UKR_get_udkhp_support]\n§gUSKhD§!: [UKR_get_uskhd_support]\n§CIndependent Deputies§!: [UKR_get_independent_support]\n\n[UKR_relief_bill_status]"

 UKR_stavka: "Reformed Stavka"
 UKR_unfinished_revolution: "Unfinished Revolution"
 UKR_unfinished_revolution_desc: "Ukrainian National Identity hasn't ever truly been united around one idea and the period of independence hasn't exactly changed that. On one hand, there is the majoritarian rural population, which is overwhelmingly Ukrainian in language, culture and ethnicity. On the other hand, there is the \"mixed\" population of the cities and urban centres. Ukrainians, both non-Russified and Russified by their nature, ethnic Russians and Jews, in addition to some others all make up the urban National composition of Ukraine. As such, the mixed makeup of the major cities provides a cultural contrast to the overwhelmingly Ukrainophone rural regions. This is further offset by the concentration of Urban centres in the country's Eastern periphery and the fact that there's a noted distance in literacy between the nation's Urban and Rural dwellers."

 UKR_halted_industrialisation_plans_desc: "As the Skoropadskyi government began to settle in post-civil war, the leading members expressed their desire to draw up a mass Industrialisation plan, which could be completed for a reasonable price and with a reasonable pace. To that effect, they went ahead and enlisted the help of the Industrialist Lobbyist Assembly, Protofis. Yet as the ministership became occupied with the land reform almost full-time, so were the industrialisation plans halted for an indeterminate amount of time. As 1936 dawns, the plans are still mostly in their infancy."
 UKR_land_reform_debacle: "Land Reform Debacle"
 UKR_land_reform_debacle_desc: "The state of land reform in our nation truly leaves something to be desired. Devised just before the 1928 Elections, the plan was intended to be a compromise between the parliamentary forces of the Conservative government, the Democratic Agrarians and Agrarians-Statists, and the lobbyist Union of Landowners, which is dominated by Great Landowners, in contrast to small and mid-sized Landowners supportive of the parliamentarians. Yet the compromise appears to have ended in a failure with the parliamentary government declaring the plan to not be extensive enough, in contrast to the lobbyist association stating that the plan is too radical instead. The arisen friction has given a rise in local corruption across the land committees, all of which resulted in the land reform grinding to a halt, which was followed by the loss of the Soim majority in the 1932 Elections and a minority government coming to power."

 UKR_country_intro_header: "The Ukrainian State"
 UKR_country_intro_content: "In the political chaos of Russia's Civil War, a new nation was founded. A nation built upon centuries of dreamers and philosophers: the nation of Ukraine.\n\nFirst declared independent in January 1918, the self-declared Ukrainian People's Republic signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and became a virtual protectorate of the German Empire. At the time, this was seen as a small price to pay for German and Austro-Hungarian troops driving the Bolsheviks out of [202.GetName] and back to Russia. Ukraine became the breadbasket of the Central Powers, shipping grain back to Germany and Austria to feed their starving populations. However, German fears of impending defeat on the Western Front and promises of sweeping land reform from the People's Republic persuaded German command to change their policy.\n\nOn the 29th of April, 1918, a German backed coup overthrew the Ukrainian People's Republic, and in its place established the Ukrainian State under the leadership of Ukrainian General Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Proclaimed Hetman, Skoropadskyi transformed Ukraine into a military dictatorship. Reforms under the People's Republic were reversed, land confiscated during the UNR's tenure was returned to the upper class of landowners, and the Hetman became the undisputed leader of Ukraine.\n\nAfter a turbulent and conflict filled 20s, the Ukrainian State has moved into the 30s as many things. The breadbasket of Mitteleuropa and the protector of the Ukrainian people, Ukraine has not yet perished and under stable leadership will march into the new world as the vanguard of the East."

### Events ###
 ukraine.2.t: "Epistles to the Brothers-Agrarians"
 ukraine.2.d: "Sitting at the crossroads between Ukrainian politics and literature, today's talk is the publication of the late Viacheslav Lypynskyi's magnum opus and political treatise \"Epistles to the Brothers-Agrarians\". A fixture of the political scene for many years, Lypynskyi could not find the time between his activism and later battles with tuberculosis to complete the book within his lifetime - something he predicts himself in its foreword.\n\nIn his life, Lypynskyi was seen by many as a man of contradictions: a Polish noble embracing the Ukrainian national struggle, a devout Catholic advocating for the exclusive spiritual role of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and a UDKhP founder who came to reject the party he helped create. \"Epistles\" serves as an exploration of Lypynskyi's values: a vision of a classocratic society, where the most enlightened can guide Ukraine to its future without fear of the corrupting influences of liberal democracy and petty sectarianism.\n\nBut while his heirs in the USKhD might cling to his words, they are unlikely to reverse the Union's political fortunes on their own. Despite Lypynskyi being a personal advisor to the Hetman, the USKhD never gained much traction, and was driven largely by the zeal of Lypynskyi and his closest associates. As such, the organisation suffered greatly from his death. Still a junior partner in Conservative politics with the new leadership struggling to fill their founder's shoes, the USKhD's future is highly uncertain."
 ukraine.2.a: "A vision without a visionary..."
 ukraine.2.b: "Tell me more about the USKhD."

 ukraine.3.t: "The Union of Agrarians-Statists"
 ukraine.3.d: "The USKhD began on the eve of the 1924 elections, when Viacheslav Lypynskyi - then, still a UDKhP leader - proposed a radical revision of the party programme along neo-monarchist and corporatist lines. In his proposal, Lypynskyi fundamentally rejected partisan politics and parliamentarianism, favouring instead the reorganisation of politics along class lines. An idea counterintuitive to many, Lypynskyi believed that a society run in this manner would allow a \"class aristocracy\" of Ukraine's best and brightest a chance to change the country for the better, without regard for faith or language. His ideas were viewed as inconsolably radical, and the UDKhP would ultimately remove him as party leader.\n\nIn response, Lypynskyi gathered his followers and founded a new party - the Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists. The USKhD would go on to contest the 1924 elections on a platform that incorporated monarchism, corporatism, and decentralism, promoting a devolved but anti-democratic political order contrasting with the UDKhP's parliamentarian centralism. It would split the Conservative vote, but ultimately was consigned to a junior role in the resulting Hetman's Coalition while Lypynskyi remained a member of the Hetman's circle, a position that he continued to occupy up to and after his death.\n\nInheriting from its founder a classocratic, plurinational, and anti-liberal vision of politics, the USKhD was forced to find new leaders after Lypynskyi's death. The party was taken over by two people: Serhii Shemet and Mykola Kochubei. Both hail from noble landowning families, and were involved in the original founding of the UDKhP alongside Lypynskyi. Both followed him in his departure, albeit for different reasons: Kochubei joined him out of a genuine belief in his views, whereas Shemet felt that a party led by a close advisor to the Hetman would offer better prospects than the increasingly big-tent UDKhP.\n\nHowever, Lypynskyi has proven a difficult act to follow, and neither of his successors have truly been up to the task. The USKhD now risks falling into total irrelevance, and it may take a major shake-up in Ukrainian politics to save them."
 ukraine.3.a: "Interesting..."

 ukraine.4.t: "Independence Day"
 ukraine.4.d: "Officially, the Ukrainian State recognises January 22 as the anniversary of Ukraine's independence from Russia. The formal celebration is much more modest than one might expect of the occasion: the Hetman and the government each make statements applauding the spirit of the Ukrainian nation and vowing to defend it for decades to come. Aside from these nods, there is little fanfare from the government, which prefers to get along with its business as much as it can get away with.\n\nTheir aim is to avoid having to discuss what actually happened on January 22, 1918. As they all know, Ukraine's independence was not declared by the Ukrainian State, and Pavlo Skoropadskyi had little to do with the act. Rather, it was the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic, led by progressive and socialist forces, that asserted Ukraine as a \"separate, independent, free, sovereign state of the Ukrainian people\" in its Fourth Universal. While there is a degree of continuity between the People's Republic and the State - Otaman-Minister Dmytro Doroshenko was a member of the Central Rada - the fact remains that the Ukrainian State was later founded in opposition to the People's Republic, allowing an ideological enemy to claim responsibility for Ukrainian independence.\n\nAccordingly, Independence Day often carries much greater significance for the Hetmanate's opponents than its supporters. Republican organisations sometimes choose the date for anti-government agitation, and celebrations in both Ukraine and neighbouring Galicia have been known to take political dimensions, with the notorious Republican Symon Petliura taking the opportunity to offer his own Independence Day message. Authorities often struggle to crack down on these Republican events: after all, who would arrest a man for celebrating their people's independence?"
 ukraine.4.a: "Can one nation exist with two histories?"
 ukraine.4.b: "Tell me more about the Republicans."

 ukraine.5.t: "The Legacy of the People's Republic"
 ukraine.5.d: "If the Ukrainian State is a symbol for Ukraine's conservatives, then the People's Republic has become one for its progressives: Republican movements present the main opposition to the State and its government, seeking the re-establishment of the Republic and full democracy. They are led by the Socialist Bloc, an alliance of three parties gathered to form a stronger anti-Hetmanate front. The Social Democratic Workers' Party serves as the Bloc's largest contingent, representing democratic socialism in the Marxist tradition and combining a proletarian outlook on social issues with a heavy emphasis on evolutionism. The USDRP is sometimes considered the informal leader of both the Bloc and the Republican tendency in general, as it is led in part by former Secretary General of Military Affairs Symon Petliura, who is believed to have ties to elements of the military.\n\nThe two other components of the Socialist Bloc are the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Council-Revolutionary Bloc. The UPS-R is the Ukrainian counterpart to the Russian Social-Revolutionaries, most of whom remained committed to both revolutionary socialism and Ukrainian statehood. Bearing a radical and agrarian programme, the UPS-R briefly surpassed the popularity of their USDRP rivals in 1917 before suffering multiple splits. Today, they form an alliance with Volodymyr Vynnychenko's R-RB, itself a consolidation of former Social Democrats who opposed the party's reformist direction. The People's Republic's first prime minister, Vynnychenko's name lends stature to the revolutionary left and ensures that it is not a junior partner within the Bloc.\n\nThe Republican cause also holds a critical faction of non-socialists, concentrated within the Radical Democratic Party. The URDP serves as the legal opposition to the Hetman's government and claims strong support from the middle class. Advocates for parliamentarianism, devolution, and \"progressive capitalism\", they have acted as voices for reform in the State, but their status as opposition means that Republican sympathisers have gravitated towards the party since the beginning and continue to do so."
 ukraine.5.a: "A motley crew, to be sure."

 ukraine.6.t: "Remembering Kruty"
 ukraine.6.d: "Every nation has its myths: collective memories, built to foster a shared sense of history and identity. Such myths have been crafted at least since the advent of modern nationalism, and Ukraine is no exception to this. For Ukrainians, one of their most significant myths concerns the events of January 29, 1918. On this date, some 500 cadets defended the Kruty railway station, 150 kilometres northwest of [202.GetName], against a vastly superior Bolshevik force. Around a hundred defenders fell before the survivors were forced to withdraw, but their sacrifice delayed the Bolshevik advance on [202.GetName] and allowed the People's Republic to conclude the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk before evacuating the city.\n\nThe Battle of Kruty received little notice at the time, for [202.GetName] was in chaos due to a simultaneous revolt at the city arsenal - but when the Republic returned to the city in March, the battle's myth began to be built. The remains of the [202.GetName]'s defenders were ceremoniously reburied to eulogies from high-ranking politicians, and Skoropadskyi established a commemorative tradition early into his reign, supposedly approving the monument to Kruty's fallen that was later erected at the site. However, remembrances of the battle has also been politicised to a degree. Hetmanist figures, including Otaman-Minister Doroshenko, sometimes view the battle as evidence of the Republic's incompetence: their (factually dubious) view is of young, inexperienced, and under-equipped students being abandoned by their drunk commanding officers and sent to certain death. Republican commemorations of Kruty are less accusatory.\n\nThe battle is also a focal point of the fringe League of Ukrainian Nationalists, for whom the event perfectly encapsulates their preferred narratives: veneration of martyrdom and the heroic sacrifice of the youth for the nation. OVDV has noted a circulation of LUN pamphlets in the [193.GetName] garrison to mark the occasion, connecting the battle to their brand of military ultranationalism."
 ukraine.6.a: "We may disagree on specifics, but we all remember what they did."
 ukraine.6.b: "Tell me about the League."

 ukraine.7.t: "The League of Ukrainian Nationalists"
 ukraine.7.d: "Throughout 1928 and 1929, a little-known civil servant and publicist named Dmytro Dontsov published a series of articles on the condition of the Ukrainian State. In his eyes, events since 1925 foretold a coming age of great catastrophes and exposed parliamentarianism's inherent inability to ward them off. Dontsov assessed that only the will and dedication of a prominent \"caste\" under a supreme ruler could save Ukraine from its coming destruction. His articles went unnoticed by most - except by a certain Yevhen Onatskyi. A regular contributor to a magazine associated with the UDKhP's right wing, Onatskyi wrote his own articles in agreement with Dontsov's diagnosis, but prescribing a different cure.\n\nOnatskyi believed that a mass, populist, and nationalist organisation should take full control of the state, permeating all aspects of life to forge a New Order of national revolution - with no need for an outdated Hetmanate. This seditious talk cost Onatskyi his job, but brought him into contact with the like-minded colonel Mykola Stsiborskyi and publicist Dmytro Andriievskyi. Joined by young author Yurii Lypa, they founded the League of Ukrainian Nationalists, a far-right society aiming to bring about this New Order. The LUN occupies the right-wing populist niche, promoting totalitarian corporatism as well as ethnic Ukrainian nationalism (as opposed to Hetmanist and Republican multiethnic nationalism). Their tactics mirror those of Romania's Legion and, ironically, Savinkovist National Populism: LUN activists tour the countryside, aiding peasants and teaching ad-hoc literacy classes to garner support.\n\nThough modestly successful, the LUN has struggled to challenge Republican dominance over the disaffected peasantry. More potent are their military ties. Beyond Stsiborskyi, the LUN has rumoured sympathisers as high up as General Yevhen Konovalets. But even so, many doubt that they can be a truly viable force in the current climate: the LUN simply cannot be a popular movement when the Republicans still command peasant support."
 ukraine.7.a: "How many agrarian populists can you even fit in this country?"

 ukraine.8.t: "Day of the Hetmanate"
 ukraine.8.d: "The Ukrainian State is inexorably tied to the institution of the Hetmanate. In many ways, Pavlo Skoropadskyi has been the driving force behind the State since its inception: although the Otaman-Ministers have led the State's governments since the end of the Great War, the Hetman alone has the right to nominate them, and thus determine the government's character. By design, the Hetman is seen by his supporters as the guarantor of the state and society, and a bulwark against radical politics. After all, the State was founded with the support of landowning interests and the German military, and wasted no time in reverting Republican social reforms.\n\nAs Ukraine's independence day has Republican connotations, the government and its supporters instead prefer April 29, the anniversary of Skoropadskyi's election as Hetman, as the primary national holiday. A military parade is traditionally held in [202.GetName] to celebrate, followed by a public address by the Hetman praising the State's achievements within the last year. The Great Cossack Rada and local Cossack councils will often organise their own events, even including their own militia parades. Many formal April 29 functions have been noted to have a strong military or paramilitary character to them - perhaps a reflection of where the State's support comes from.\n\nBeyond these jingoistic displays, conservative politicians often make other gestures. Otaman-Minister Doroshenko opted to make a statement, applauding the work his government has done and expressing hope that the Hetman will be seen as a symbol for all Ukrainians. The Democratic Agrarians have also hosted their own April 29 celebrations, heavily attended by both the party's leaders and their aspirants. The Protofis industrial lobby and the Union of Landowners have each also offered the Hetman their congratulations, with the latter even inviting him to their own event. The Hetman, perhaps tactfully, refused."

 ukraine.9.d: "Politically, Hetmanism has been represented by several conservative organisations since elections were reinstated in 1920. Chief among them is the Democratic Agrarian Party. Traditionally the largest Hetmanist party, the UDKhP is the champion of the post-independence status quo, holding an agrarian, law-and-order platform that favours a strong government combined with interventionist economic policies. However, they also view the status quo as a balance between the Hetman's role and the initiative of his ministers. As such, they support the continued influence of the Soim, with a minority even favouring a fully ceremonial Hetmanate. While the UDKhP has never led one, they have acted as the bedrock of government for the last 16 years.\n\nAlso notable are the Union of Industry, Trade, Finance, and Agriculture and the All-Ukrainian Union of Landowners. The respective lobbying bodies for industrial and landowning interests, \"Protofis\" and the VSZV have wielded their large political weight to shape policy in a pro-business and pro-landowner direction. The VSZV is especially powerful: the Hetmanate was arguably their creation, and they have continuously frustrated land reform efforts since 1920. Their partners in Protofis have also grown in importance as the economy has, something both bodies credit to their semi-permanent role in the government.\n\nHowever, the unrest of the mid-1920s suggested to devoted Hetmanists that the Soim was not capable of preserving national stability, and that a stronger hand is needed. To this end, a loyalist colonel named Borys Homzyn partnered with the Great Cossack Rada's head, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, to form the Union of Hetmanists-State Builders. The SHD is a semi-secret society that seeks the \"rationalisation\" of the State along autocratic lines, at least until it can be secured more thoroughly. Their secrecy gives them a bad reputation, and the Hetman has accordingly kept them distant. Yet, some Soimists fear that another wave of unrest could play to their advantage."
 ukraine.9.a: "For people notionally behind one man, they don't seem to like each other very much."

 ukraine.11.t: "Dissent in the West"
 ukraine.11.d: "The Ukrainian State boasts the third largest economy in Germany's sphere, centred around its massive agricultural sector, rooted in Ukraine's fertile plains. Known far and wide as the breadbasket of the Reichspakt, they produce more grain than any of their allies. This has been a double-edged sword, as industrialisation has been slow due to disinterest by landowning elites and the relatively small urban middle class. Most of the Ukrainians work in agriculture - and those unlucky enough not to own land work on the land of others, often the rich landowners who are a central part of the Hetman's support base.\n\nThis inequality is especially pronounced in western Ukraine, the poorest part of the country. There has once again been campaigns there that agitate against the Hetman's regime and demand borderline socialist changes. The police will keep the rabble-rousers in sight, but it is probable that nothing serious will come of it."
 ukraine.11.a: "Do they ever stop complaining?"

 ukraine.12.t: "Tractor Factory Opened by Hanomag AG"
 ukraine.12.d: "Today the German construction and automobile company Hanomag has opened a new tractor factory in the city of [202.GetName], as part of their series of investments in Ukraine. They join the German companies which have opened new manufacturing plants in Ukraine, attracted by poorer workers' protections and wages than in Germany itself.\n\nThe URDP has been a vocal critic of this practice, seeing it as exploitation of the Ukrainian commoners by foreign capital. As far as the Hetman's Coalition is concerned, they justify lucrative deals with German corporations by the economic benefits it brings - job creation, easier access to industrial goods such as tractors - and, unofficially in many cases, generous gifts that state officials have received. Even the less apologetic argue that since Ukraine has limited capital and industrial know-how, foreign investment is the only way to start the long process of industrialisation."
 ukraine.12.a: "More tractors!"

 ukraine.13.t: "Strikes In [192.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 ukraine.13.d: "Today in [192.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], workers at one of the many shipyards have laid down their tools and chained the entrances shut before listing off various demands such as better pay, less hours, and better safety protections. The owners of the shipyards have demanded we send the police in to shut down the strike with force."
 ukraine.13.a: "Make some empty promises to get them back to work."
 ukraine.13.b: "Send in the police, we don't negotiate with such rabble."

 ukraine.14.t: "Rally in [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 ukraine.14.d: "We have received information that Symon Petliura, one of the exiled USDRP leaders in Lviv, will be holding a rally in [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. He has been living abroad ever since his party - and anything left of it - was banned, and only visits the country occasionally, out of the justified fear that our secret police might pay him a visit. It seems that the western countryside has become more and more receiving to Petliura's dangerous promises of land and freedom. His publications have been found widely in circulation, even if the exact amount of his supporters is unknown. Attempts to get the Austrian officials to hinder his actions have proved to be vain, citing that peaceful political activism does not break any laws of the Habsburg Empire.\n\nSeeing that he is becoming more and more of a threat, perhaps we should use this chance to arrest him before he can arrange his rally?"
 ukraine.14.a: "Arrest Petliura before the rally."
 ukraine.14.b: "Don't aggravate his supporters needlessly."
 ukraine.14.a.tt: "Arresting Petliura may make negotiating with the opposition §Rimpossible§! in the future."

 ukraine.15.t: "Petliura Evades Arrest!"
 ukraine.15.d: "The police have failed to capture Symon Petliura. They tried to arrange an arrest in [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but it seems like he was tipped off by someone in the police force, and disappeared from the city.\n\nOn the positive note we managed to cancel his rally... but the news of the arrest attempt quickly spread and seemed to spark both ridicule and hate towards our law enforcement."
 ukraine.15.a: "Drat."

 ukraine.16.t: "Black Monday Arrives in Ukraine!"
 ukraine.16.d: "News has reached Ukraine of the German stock market collapsing into the abyss with global ramifications. Overnight, dozens of German companies either pulled out, announced their intention to do so, or were forced into bankruptcy. Scores of Ukrainian workers are at risk of unemployment in the immediate future. To make matters worse, our mining industries and agriculture are expected to lose much of their customers in Germany.\n\nDue to various trade agreements with Germany, Ukraine has always grown excess levels of grain to feed the alliance and alleviate future food shortages. But as exports are expected to fall rapidly this year, many farmers will be left with massive surpluses of wheat and no one to sell it to. The most pessimistic are telling the peasants to start burning grain, as it will soon be worth less than coal."
 ukraine.16.a: "Quit the pessimism, the Hetman will fix this!"

 ukraine.17.t: "Birth of the All-Ukrainian Democratic Movement"
 ukraine.17.d: "As the already miserable situation of western Ukraine was plunged into total hopelessness by the economic crisis, it didn't take much to set it aflame. Massive protests have been organised across the west, and in many places the police have been confined to their stations by the angry peasants. Exiled republican leaders such as Petliura and Vynnychenko have returned to Ukraine and have started organising rallies and calling for civilian non-obedience.\n\nAs political front for change, the most major democratic and socialist parties have formed the VDR - All-Ukrainian Democratic Movement. Composed of USDRP, UPS-R and R-RB and strongly supported by the Borotbysts and even URDP, this alliance is united behind Petliura and the cause of achieving major change - or even revolution - in Ukraine. The VDR has obviously been declared just as illegal as other Petliura's projects, but in the current situation they are out of our reach."
 ukraine.17.a: "Revolutionaries, a whole bunch of them!"

 ukraine.18.t: "Archduke Wilhelm Speaks Out!"
 ukraine.18.d: "During the Central Powers occupation of Ukraine in 1917, an upstart Ukrainophile, Archduke from Austria, led his Sich Riflemen deep into Ukrainian territory and styled himself as the \"Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, King of Ukraine\". Supported by Emperor Karl I, the boy of 22 was to become the ruler of an Austrian-backed Ukrainian monarchy. Mingling with the peasants, he became very popular for his ability to live much like them and his lenient governorship of territories under his command. Fortunately for us, any Austrian plans for a Ukrainian monarchy collapsed in 1919 with the consolidation of the German-backed Hetmanate. Archduke Wilhelm fled back to Galicia.\n\nBut now, the pretender has shown his face at a rally in [199.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], speaking alongside Symon Petliura, calling for resistance against \"The German Puppet Hetman.\""
 ukraine.18.a: "Tell that Habsburg to go back to Vienna!"

 ukraine.19.t: "Compensation for the Preußische Ostbahn"
 ukraine.19.d: "A number of major businessmen in Ukraine have come together in a state-sponsored plan to buy the majority shares of the Prussian Eastern Railways, a subsidiary of the Prussian state railway company which operates the majority of the railways in Ukraine.\n\nWith this transaction, the ownership of the railway is transferred to the Ukrainian railway corporation, admittedly still with a sizeable portion of German private ownership."
 ukraine.19.a: "Alright."

 ukraine.20.t: "General Strike Called!"
 ukraine.20.d: "The VDR has declared a general strike across the industrial centres of the country. Much of the countryside has already been swayed into civil resistance, but now the unrest has also spread to the cities. Most of [202.GetName] is at standstill, and unions in [192.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], [221.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have also swiftly joined the battle. Most worryingly, the Borotbysts and other hardline socialists have bounced back into national relevancy as vocal leaders of the strikes, spearheading the anti-Hetman rallies in many cities.\n\nThe demands of the VDR are entirely unreasonable, modelled after near-socialist programmes of White Ruthenia. For now the police are keeping watchful peace, and incidents are under control... but the situation seems prone to escalate."
 ukraine.20.a: "Traitors everywhere!"

 ukraine.22.t: "Transport Workers Join The Strike"
 ukraine.22.d: "Railways Workers' and Dockworkers' Unions have joined the general strike, paralysing the transportation system across the country. Trains packed with cars full of early grain and other agricultural products lie in empty stations with their contents slowly rotting. Mines and steel foundries are unable to send their products to the factories. Export goods clutter harbours, as ships are not being loaded.\n\nThe demands of the strikers have grown ever harsher, some even calling for abdication of the Hetman himself, and establishment of free and democratic republic."
 ukraine.22.a: "This is getting a bit out of hand now..."

 ukraine.23.t: "Negotiations with the Strikers"
 ukraine.23.d: "Seeing no other choice, the government opened negotiations with the VDR's General Strike Committee and made some gestures of good will, such as freeing a number of imprisoned strikers. While it seems hopeless to reach real compromise, at least the railways are allowed to work again, if only to maintain the basic demands of the people.\n\nThis \"truce\" for the duration of the negotiations has given both sides time to scheme for the worst, and is by many declared as mere trick to play for time."
 ukraine.23.a: "Let's hope the situation will de-escalate."

 ukraine.25.t: "Severity of Protests Increases"
 ukraine.25.d: "Head socialist politicians, like Symon Petliura, Isaak Mazepa and Panas Fedenko call for the establishment of a parliamentary republic with socialist inclinations on land reform and labour association. Others, like Vynnychenko and Hryhoriiv agitate for the establishment of a Socialist Republic, taking elements from both the parliamentarians and communists-syndicalists. Not to mention the Borotbysts, who seek to enact an immediate Revolution in most spheres of life.\n\nMany feel swayed by these messages and the atmosphere almost seems to reach its boiling point."
 ukraine.25.d1: "Things have only seemed to get worse. $ukraine.25.d$"
 ukraine.25.d2: "As Ukraine enters August, things have only seemed to get worse. $ukraine.25.d$"
 ukraine.25.a: "We must find a way."

 ukraine.26.t: "SHD Approaches the Hetman"
 ukraine.26.d: "Concerned about the dire situation the Hetman faces, Skoropadskyi and his executive office have been approached by some of the highest members in the SHD. General Prisovskyi, along with Borys Homzyn, chief officer in the executive office, as well as Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, head of the Great Cossack Rada and additional civil servants, have all approached the Hetman with a plan.\n\nFearing the prospect of a socialist revolution and the repeated descent of the country into anarchy like in 1918, they have proposed a temporary martial law status, along with the suspension of the State Soim as well as civil liberties. They argue that these measures will be necessary for a time as the Hetman and other newly emboldened executives will figure out how to \"keep the country from breaking down into an unbridled disaster.\""
 ukraine.26.a: "The Hetman approves of the plan."

 ukraine.27.t: "Martial Law Sparks Outrage"
 ukraine.27.d: "After signing off the temporary suspension of the Soim and certain civil liberties, as well as a non-permanent martial law status, the country has become even more outraged with the government. The socialists have decreed Skoropadyski to be a tyrant, hellbent on \"reenacting 1918\" on the peasants and workers of the country, and their words have not fallen on deaf ears. The national elections, scheduled to be in November this year, have been postponed.\n\nChaos has begun to ensue in our government as well, however, as today, Otaman-Minister Doroshenko stated his intent to resign from his position, stating that he would not support a government that went to such authoritarian measures. On the advice of the SHD, Skoropadskyi has opted to appoint Borys Homzyn as the new Otaman-Minister, with General Prisovskyi in charge of the internal situation; many suspect that the Hetman appointed Homzyn believing that he was more loyal and pliable in comparison to the more assertive and ambitious Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. The Hetman has announced that the elections scheduled for November will be delayed until the situation stabilises, though few expect him or Homzyn to live up on this promise..."
 ukraine.27.a: "A point of no return..."

 ukraine.28.t: "Protests Turn Into Riots"
 ukraine.28.d: "With the announcement that the negotiations have collapsed, sporadic protests in the capital quickly turned into violent rioting and soon enough [202.GetName] was in anarchy. Clashes with the police escalated into protestors organising into worker's guards, and even taking control of many factories around the city, using them as makeshift fortresses against the military. The western countryside is even worse, as it has quickly turned into the VDR's base of operations and practically lost to us.\n\nTheir propaganda blames the Hetman for ending the negotiations, and have declared that if Skoropadskyi do not wish to listen to the people, he will listen to their rifles. Any chance at a peaceful outcome seems dead in the water now."
 ukraine.28.a: "This cannot go well."

 ukraine.29.t: "Protests Turn Into Riots"
 ukraine.29.d: "Our recent provocation seems to have backfired greatly, as the VDR has sparked major rioting in [202.GetName] and other major cities. Their demands of representation and social reforms are everywhere, and the government's stance only seems to have worsened the situation.\n\nWith garrisons being deployed to stabilise the situation, it is likely that there will be no peaceful outcome to the situation and even more violence may be the only answer to ending the republican threat once and for all."
 ukraine.29.a: "Perhaps our actions were done in haste..."

 ukraine.30.t: "Massacre in [202.GetName]"
 ukraine.30.d: "When things seemingly couldn't get any worse, today the streets of [202.GetName] ran red with blood.\n\nIn Khreshchatyk Square, long a hub for political rallies, workers and peasants took to strike and demanded release of political prisoners, end to arbitrary arrests and for the Hetman to accept VDR's social-political programme. The police attempted to disperse the protest, but after a shot was fired - it is not sure if the shooter was a policeman or a protestor - chaos broke out. Police were bombarded with stones, and some protestors even had revolvers. Fire was answered, and in the end dozens of protestors lay dead or wounded.\n\nWhile the full situation has yet to become clear, opposing political organisations have declared the Hetman and his government to be murderers, and this has only emboldened the protestors."
 ukraine.30.a: "This is the last thing we needed!"

 ukraine.31.t: "Protests Explode"
 ukraine.31.d1: "News of the so-called \"[202.GetName] Massacre\" did not go unnoticed. The entire country is enraged, demanding justice for those killed and even the resignation of the government.\n\nSomewhat reluctantly, the URDP has gone into opposition to our government, citing our recent actions. Some members, mostly to the right of the URDP, still believe that cooperation with the Hetman's coalition is better than cooperation with the VDR. Regardless, the influence of the SHD has grown. Their repeated attacks on the VDR, decrying them as too unreliable and radical, have been vindicated in the eyes of many in the coalition."
 ukraine.31.d2: "News of the so-called \"[202.GetName] Massacre\" did not go unnoticed. The entire country is enraged, demanding justice for those killed and even the resignation of the government.\n\nIn a rather symbolic measure, the URDP has declared its \"total opposition to the tyranny of the Hetman's government\", and promised to work with the VDR to achieve a free Ukraine. The formerly ruling coalition of the UDKhP and USKhD has not held back in its criticism of the Hetman's government, either, comparing the government's carelessness to its handling of the protests of 1925, when an overly harsh government response to Borotbysts actions led to waves of strikes and protests."
 ukraine.31.a: "We will survive, with or without them!"

 ukraine.32.t: "Revolutionary Mood Sweeps the Country"
 ukraine.32.d: "Before August, the situation was almost calming down. But after martial law, the republicans have only escalated their campaigns. Thousands of people have been arrested already, but it is not helping much; large parts of the west, especially around [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], have been practically outside our jurisdiction for the past months, with local peasant militias acting as law enforcement. The cities have been kept under a tighter leash, but violent clashes between armed protestors and the police have been more and more common.\n\nWorryingly, the revolutionary mood has also infected the military. There have been disappearances, as soldiers have left their stations and went home. In some garrisons, large numbers of rifles have gone missing. One unit in [198.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] refused to follow the orders and disarm the strikers, and instead their captain ordered the men to stand down and stay in the barracks. This kind of insubordination has became more and more common in the west, and rooting it out has been slow. Orders have been given to lay off the most unreliable officers, and move some of the units away from the most unstable regions, but with sporadic railway strikes, moving troops across the country has been slow."
 ukraine.32.a: "Have they gone mad?"

 ukraine.34.t: "Skoropadskyi's Speech"
 ukraine.34.d: "As the nation becomes ever more polarised and awash with political violence, Hetman Skoropadskyi has directly addressed the Soim in a speech. In it he praised the Soim's ability to set aside political differences for the good of the nation, as demonstrated by the recent passing of the Relief Bill. The Hetman then urged the Soim to continue its current course and deal with the ongoing protests swiftly.\n\nWhile the Hetman's trust in the Soim is appreciated, many feel his words contain a veiled threat: if the Soim fails to resolve the current crisis quickly, the Hetman will turn to more direct means without the Soim."
 ukraine.34.a: "We must make sure his trust is reciprocated."

 ukraine.35.t: "Appointment of the Supreme Otaman"
 ukraine.35.d: "In the past, the Hetman has been the supreme-commander of the army. However, in practice one man - regardless of their personal brilliance - cannot manage both the nation and the army. To separate these duties, the position of the Supreme Otaman has been created.\n\nWhile the [UKR_leader_title] will remain commander-in-chief, the practical duties of this role will be delegated to [UKR_leader_title]-appointed Supreme Otaman, who will act as the commander of the military as whole, with the chiefs of army, navy and air force as his subordinates."

 ukraine.35.b2: "Andrii Melynk"
 ukraine.35.c: "Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia"
 ukraine.35.e: "Oleksandr Zahrodskyi"

 ukraine.36.t: "Fighting a Shadow"
 ukraine.36.d: "Although not a formally recognised date like April 29, Hetmanists often attach a special significance to June 24, 1925. This year notoriously saw ripple effects from the British Revolution bring instability across the world, something from which Ukraine was not spared. Encouraged by the successful workers' revolution in Britain, the underground Party of Socialist-Revolutionary-Borotbysts launched a campaign of strikes, sabotage, and public attacks against the government. What was initially hoped to be a fairly short wave ultimately dragged out across much of the year as harsh, indiscriminate crackdowns often instigated increasingly militant unrest.\n\nThe period's climax came that summer, when Otaman-Minister Fedir Lyzohub's life was claimed by an act of revolutionary violence. Lyzohub was the only Otaman-Minister that the State had known since the position was formalised in 1919, whose leadership helped define the character of the post-war Ukrainian State. His assassination brought tensions to a fever pitch, as police forces and Cossack militias engaged with Borotbyst cells in mutual retaliation for many days. The Hetman was eventually forced to intervene by deploying the military and asserting control over the Cossacks, providing clear direction and order to the suppression efforts as well as overwhelming force. While unrest initially flared further, the escalation was eventually successful in driving the Borotbysts back underground. Yet, the episode exposed the State's frailty and won it few supporters.\n\nThe events of 1925 also made the Borotbysts into the most notorious non-Republican revolutionary force, as well as the most hated enemy of Hetmanists. The anniversary of Lyzohub's death is a solemn date for the State's supporters, brining vows each year that his killers will be defeated. But while sustained pressure has weakened them, the Borotbysts persist - the movement has endured years of efforts to eliminate them, and OVDV believes that they still orchestrate revolutionary activity in secret."
 ukraine.36.a: "Fighters, indeed..."
 ukraine.36.b: "Tell me more about the Borotbysts."

 ukraine.37.t: "The Socialist-Revolutionary-Borotbysts"
 ukraine.37.d: "The Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionary-Borotbysts (Communists-Syndicalists), more commonly known as the Borotbysts, has its roots as a pro-Bolshevik splinter faction of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. Borotbyst guerilla forces were one of many operating in Ukraine during 1918 and 1919, fighting against the Ukrainian State and seeking the establishment of a Ukrainian communist government. The party was driven underground in 1920 and absorbed local elements of the Russian Left-SRs, opting to bide its time until 1925, when it waged its notorious campaign of agitation and revolutionary violence against the government.\n\nThe incorporated Left-SRs introduced the Borotbysts to syndicalist thought, something that helped define their later ideological development. Observing successful syndicalist revolutions in France and Britain, the party adopted syndicalism as a successful model, synthesising it with their previous position to develop a programme that was suited to Ukraine's material conditions. As their present name suggests, the result was a mixture of council communist and syndicalist ideas - but unlike many Western syndicalists, the Borotbysts view agricultural workers as critical to a Ukrainian revolution, and seek to give them a leading role in it. The Borotbysts have also held left-nationalist views since their inception, further making them a curiosity among syndicalist groups.\n\nThe party is led by Oleksandr Shumskyi, a veteran revolutionary and former member of the People's Republic's Central Rada with a strong background in agrarian issues. Under his leadership, the Borotbysts have pursued a strategy of confrontation with the State, most exemplified by their 1925 campaign. While this approach keeps them in the minds of the Ukrainian workers, it has also drawn the permanent ire of Hetmanists: as such, the movement faces near-constant pressure that makes it difficult to grow. It is difficult to see the Borotbysts succeeding as long as the State places importance on their destruction."
 ukraine.37.a: "Still, they're nothing if not persistent."

 #Black Monday
 ukraine.40.t: "Dropping The Gold Standard"
 ukraine.40.d: "For some time now, the Hryvnias have been tied to the gold standard as the base of the currency. While in the past this afforded some degree of stability to our financial system, in the wake of Black Monday it has quickly become a detriment, and the gold standard is now being widely abandoned around Europe as too inflexible to react to changing realities of economy.\n\nHowever, there is no consensus if we should trust the markets and let them value the Hryvnia - which is potentially volatile, but also offers great financial independence - or tie it to German Mark, as that is still the most stable currency in Europe despite the crisis."
 ukraine.40.a: "Leave the Hryvnia floating."
 ukraine.40.b: "Tie the Hryvnia to the German Mark."

 ukraine.41.t: "Bailing Out The German Companies"
 ukraine.41.d: "With the onset of Black Monday, the few German industrial outfits in the country have been winding down operations in anticipation of a full-scale exodus and likely collapse. To prevent our economy from crashing even further, the cabinet has agreed to earmark government funds for these companies, letting them stay in the country for now at least.\n\nRegardless the peasantry and workers are incensed and mass demonstrations against the bailout are expected to go ahead."
 ukraine.41.a: "Is this a necessary evil?"

 ukraine.47.t: "The Ukrainian National Rada"
 ukraine.47.d: "Since the end of the revolt and the failure of the VDR's forces to overthrow the Hetman, a sense of relative peace has returned to Ukraine. As the economy continues to recover and the last republican terror cells are rooted out, however, the leadership in [202.GetName] has been expressing their worry and dismay at the birth of a new republican threat in the form of the so-called \"Ukrainian National Rada\".\n\nThough originally operating in Galicia, those in the VDR who had survived the Hetman's counteroffensive fled to the Commune of France, as Galicia was deemed too unsafe to return. Upon their arrival they were welcomed with open arms, and wasted no time in reorganising their efforts. At a conference held in the Palace of Trocadéro in Paris, Petliura, as well as other VDR leaders, took to the podium to highlight the republican struggle, and carefully described the next steps to take in order to ensure that a \"free and democratic Ukraine\" will come to be in the future. He furthermore highlighted the potential special relationship the two countries could have; from the beginning of the Ukrainian Revolution in 1917 the newborn republic had a particular interest in forging ties with France, a major power in Europe which not only had the means to exert influence over Eastern Europe and break the power of German and Russian imperialism, but whose democratic institutions and culture evoked a great admiration among republican leaders.\n\nAt the end of the conference, Petliura announced the official formation of the \"Ukrainian National Rada\", a now Third Internationale backed government in-exile that aims to overthrow the Hetman. Despite the organisation going almost unnoticed among the average Ukrainian, its creation has worried some in our government, who have called for immediate action one way or another to decapitate the movement."
 ukraine.47.a: "These syndicalists won't rest until they see our country destroyed!"

 ukraine.48.t: "Assassination of Symon Petliura"
 ukraine.48.d: "This evening the streets of Andriivskyi's Descent in [202.GetName] ran abuzz with debate. Copies of the newspaper Vidrodzhennia were distributed covering one of the most sudden and shocking deaths of the year: Symon Petliura. Details remain scarce, but it is clear that sometime around the afternoon Petliura was shot five times near Boulevard Saint-Michel in Paris. Several theories have emerged speculating the perpetrator; a popular one is that agents of R.E.D sought to remove Petliura and sideline the social democratic faction of the Ukrainian National Rada.\n\nEarlier that morning, the head of the OVDV informed Skoropadskyi that the operation, spearheaded by an Abteilung IIIb agent, to take out Petliura and put a nail in the coffin of the republican leadership had been successful; the traitor was dead. The public discourse suspecting French or British involvement has especially worked to the government's favour. Though the Hetman was relieved, he afterwards expressed reservations, stating that the most significant threat to Ukrainian freedom has clearly become that of Russia and that they must not concern themselves with \"irrelevant organisations by irrelevant people\".\n\nIn Paris, the news of Petliura's assassination has been met with shock and denunciation by the National Rada, accusing the Hetman's government of murder. But it has also been somewhat of a boon for the Internationale's supporters of the Ukrainian National Rada who now see a much more favourable man to their interests as the organisation's leader: Oleksandr Shumskyi. Some have accused Shumskyi of being a puppet of the Internationale and subverting the council's more moderate members, with some even accusing the Internationale of Petliura's murder, but without the prestige and presence that Petliura previously commanded, it seems unlikely that this will change much."
 ukraine.48.a: "So we can't kill him here, but we can kill him over there?"

 ukraine.49.t: "Petliura Evades Assassination"
 ukraine.49.d: "The birth of the Ukrainian National Rada had created great anxiety among much of the Hetman's government. Determined to seek an end to republican campaigning and organising far from the actual borders of Ukraine, a special operation led by the Abteilung IIIb, with assistance from the OVDV, was set forth with the mission of taking out the nominal head of their leadership, Symon Petliura.\n\nThe operation proved to be a spectacular failure; while waiting for Petliura near Boulevard Saint-Michel, the assassin was arrested by Communard police and taken into questioning. Although his fate remains unknown for now, Abteilung IIIb notified the head of the OVDV to let them know that they would not participate in any future attempts on Petliura's life. The message was, of course, clear; they saw the whole operation as a waste of time."

 ukraine.50.t: "The Russian Union in Ukraine"
 ukraine.50.d: "Better known as simply \"Russian Union\", the Russian Union in Ukraine is one of the longest-active non-governmental organisations in independence-era Ukraine. Officially, it is employed to defend the rights of Russian-speakers and more specifically, of the Russian language in education. The Union's support is generally limited to circles of Russophone intelligentsia that has remained in Ukraine upon the solidification of Ukraine's independent course.\n\nHowever, its attempt to gain a foothold amongst Russian-speaking workers has failed. In spite of its official position, it has often gotten in spats with authorities, who have accused it of acting as a front for Russian state interests and some of its more \"radical\" members of being agents of Russian intelligence. Nevertheless, the Union has remained active and continued its relationship with Ukrainian State structures."

 ukraine.51.t: "Agitation around the Russian Union"
 ukraine.51.d.intro: "The ascension and consolidation of the notably more revanchist and radical Savinkov government in Moscow has started to agitate many within Ukraine. The Russian Union's Central Board has changed considerably over the years, primarily due to the fact that some of its members simply immigrated to Russia for one reason or another. Others simply found the lack of necessity for the Union's further activities and receded from active lobbying. Nevertheless, it has consistently been led and represented by one person, a certain Dmitri Odinyets. A former minister, Mr. Odinyets has been involved in work with the education ministry - and that would have been the end of it."

Coinciding with the rise of Savinkov has been a notably rare challenge to Odinyets' leadership of the Union by a former Army General associated with the organisation, a certain Mr. Vasily Biskupski. Mr. Biskupski is most famous for leading a semi-Pro Russian fringe in another infamous organisation, the SHD. Although the attempt clearly failed and Mr. Odinyets retained his comfortable \"majority\", the attempt has made many people uncomfortable.

 ukraine.52.t: "The Looming Russian Threat"
 ukraine.52.d: "In the midst of the Russian Civil War in 1919, two conferences convened in Ufa by White Movement leader Aleksander Kolchak attempted to decide the future of the anti-Bolshevik movement. The Ukrainian state requested a presence at the conferences, in part to stand in for the German Empire. At the end of the conference, the Ukrainian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Dmytro Doroshenko, came to an agreement with the leaders of the White Movement, which included an informal recognition of the independence of Germany's eastern allies, as well as continued material support from the German Empire through Ukraine and the Baltics to the Southern and Northwestern armies, respectively. A year later, the Russian government formally recognised a Ukrainian state for the first time as it signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. With German hegemony in Europe secured and Russia severely weakened, many thought it would be an everlasting peace. Ukrainians on the left and right saw a possible new era in Russian-Ukrainian relations; not a relationship based on imperial state to subject, but on mutual cooperation between equal states.\n\nThe recent formation of the Moscow Accord only seems to prove the world has become more tense after Black Monday, and that this once hoped for potential cooperation is becoming more and more of a fantasy. Some expressed surprise, given the period of economic stagnation and foreign policy failures that the Russian state experienced in the recent decades; others have pointed out that since its independence, Ukraine's defence capabilities have stagnated, relying on its alliance with Germany to deter any potential aggressors, an act no longer feasible as the German order seemingly continues to crumble."

 ukraine.53.t: "What is a Hetmanate?"
 ukraine.53.d: "Twenty years ago, on April 29, 1918, an All-Ukrainian Agrarian Congress was assembled of more than 6,000 delegates, and claiming to represent millions of Ukrainians. The Congress's chief demand was an end to the deficiencies of the republican government and a restoration of the Hetmanate, the traditional government of Ukraine, under the leadership of Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Skoropadskyi would arrive by car upon learning that the republic was vulnerable, and was greeted warmly as someone who could bring the country together. Throughout the night, supporters of the Hetman took over the state bank and the ministry of the interior with little resistance, and with the backing of Hermann von Eichhorn, the general leading the German military administration in Ukraine.\n\nThough the Hetmanate and its institutions have become well-known among those in the country, the same cannot be said for those outside of it, who have often expressed confusion as to what a Hetmanate is. Fundamentally, the Hetmanate of today is a monarchy, and Skoropadskyi retains powers comparable to those of other European monarchs. The primary difference from more conventional monarchies - aside from its elective nature, something with historical precedent, but essentially unheard of today - is a matter of culture. The title of Hetman calls back to the Zaporizhian Host, connecting Ukrainian statehood to the Host's independence from Poland and conferring the office with a military significance. Especially when it was being pitted against the progressive, Western-inspired People's Republic, the Hetmanate represents a more conservative vision even compared to other monarchies, deliberately harkening back to a time centuries ago.\n\nThe State's cultural ministry has often tried to exploit this image abroad. The Ukrainian image often sold to foreigners is that of a country removed from the woes of modern society, where people are closer to their roots and yearn to be free - especially from certain eastern powers."
 ukraine.53.a: "Fascinating."

 ukraine.54.t: "The Doctrine of Ukrainian Imperialism"
 ukraine.54.d: "During the early years of the Ukrainian State's existence, there were some voices within the government and military who advocated for territorial expansion, whether it was into Galicia, Belarus or Russia; however, the Hetman and other senior officials were wary of such ambitions, recognising that the new state was largely dependent on Germany for military and economic support, and as such an independent foreign policy was unfeasible.\n\nThis has not discouraged some from continuing to advocate designs on territories seen as rightfully Ukrainian, such as the Kuban. Formulating the doctrine of what he calls \"Ukrainian Imperialism\", young writer Osyp Hubchak's Ukrainian nationalism differs greatly from those in the LUN. According to Hubchak, Ukraine will only be able to preserve its independence when it is self-sufficient and able to ward off aggressors on its own; otherwise, it will perish. Though an ardent supporter of the Hetman and having ties to the Agrarians-Statists, Hubchak lambastes Ukraine's alliance with Germany, stating that Ukraine is seen as nothing more than a buffer state to Germany, and that if in the future Russo-German relations were to improve, then Ukraine would be divided between the two empires.\n\nHubchak's ideas for territorial expansion are also peculiar. He sees the eastern borders of Ukraine running along the Caucasus and the coast of the Caspian Sea, the west running along the Sian and Buh rivers, and in the north, access to the Baltic Sea through a union between Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania. Most interestingly, he emphasises acquiring the Kuban from Russia not by means of military confrontation and conquest but of cultural hegemony. According to Hubchak, Ukrainians should make all possible efforts to increase the state's population to one hundred million over the span of two and a half decades - this way, expansion will occur naturally. Hubchak's publications can be found in the popular, pro-Hetman magazine \"Nation on the March\", though among its readers it is unlikely if any see his ideas as any more than depraved ramblings."

 ukraine.55.t: "A Zeppelin Station In [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]?"
 ukraine.55.d: "With work on the resorts in [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] well underway, the planning committee in charge of overseeing the works has recently began to debate a rather interesting idea: the establishment of a zeppelin station as part of the resort's new infrastructure. The zeppelin is perhaps one of history's more unique methods of transportation and during the inter-war period commercial zeppelin usage underwent something of a golden age.\n\nWith [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] being transformed into a model resort city, it seems an interesting idea to construct a state of the art zeppelin station to ferry in even more passengers and ease the burden on the rail lines. However, naysayers among the committee see it as a costly vanity project and instead have urged the money to be used on improving the city's public transport networks."
 ukraine.55.a: "Use the money to fund public transport instead!"
 ukraine.55.b: "Sounds like an interesting endeavour!"

 ukraine.56.t: "Zeppelin Explosion In [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"
 ukraine.56.d: "In shocking news from Crimea it has emerged that a zeppelin that had just left port has exploded with all passengers and crew confirmed dead. Whole search teams have been dispatched to scour the waters for the remains of the deceased. Witnesses to the incident have described the explosion as erupting suddenly and \"painting the sky orange and red\" with the wreckage shortly falling into the sea. An official estimate as to how many were wounded by the wreckage has not been calculated yet but fortunately the number is expected to be low.\n\nWith the city on lockdown, the cause of the incident and whether or not foul play was involved is still a mystery. Regardless the government has declared that all zeppelins are to be grounded until further notice and it is expected a full-scale ban on the transport will follow shortly assuming this really was an accident."
 ukraine.56.a: "Good heavens!"

 ukraine.57.t: "Memoirs of Pavlo Skoropadskyi"
 ukraine.57.d: "Despite the military alliance and nearly two decades of friendship between the two countries, many Germans remain unaware of Ukrainian affairs. Today - a year since the uprising concluded - a new, comprehensive account of Ukrainian politics and the uprising has been published in Berlin by none other than the Skoropadskyi himself.\n\nIn its preface, Skoropadskyi notes that he lacks the desire or ability to create interesting memoirs, something exacerbated by his old age and nearly twenty years of rule. However he covers the most crucial points of the uprising, recounting it as one of the most stressful points in his life. He pins the failure of the government to suppress the republican forces on the incoherence and ignorance of both the coalition and the SHD, both of whom, according to Skoropadskyi, had a \"narrow and one-sided view of things\".\n\nFurthermore, Skoropadskyi blames the failure of the government to carry out land reform efforts, as well as the lack of actions to mitigate the Black Monday crisis, on the presence of VSZV and Protofis officials, adding that he would have dismissed them from the government as soon as the situation stabilised.\n\nAlthough Skoropadskyi's memoirs have become popular across bookshops in Berlin they have for the most part gone unnoticed in Ukraine itself - without the backing of German forces the Hetmanist movement has burst like a bubble, and it seems unlikely that it will regain prominence anytime soon."

 ukraine.58.t: "The Worst Case Scenario"
 ukraine.58.d1: "The Hetman has called for national unity, and for every Ukrainian to lay down their political disagreements as the entire nation is needed to fight the invaders. But these widely-broadcasted calls have not received the universal approval it was hoped they would. Russian propaganda - \"Free Ukraine in Free Russia\" - has been distributed widely especially in the eastern parts of the country.\n\nEven the greatest Ukrainian patriot has to face the question - is it better to serve the increasingly more authoritarian Hetman and his corrupt regime, which has zero respect for democracy... or perhaps to listen what the Russian Republic is offering, as genuine, free democracy? How paradoxical is it that the invader might bring more freedom to Ukraine? However, older people remember well the Tsarist times, and have little faith in Russian democracy. The spectre of Russification and the secret police looms over the promises made by [RUS.GetLeader]. Still, the majority of Ukrainians are supportive of the war - if not for their love of the Hetman, but for their love for their country." #Hetman dictatorship Ukraine vs democratic republican Russia
 ukraine.58.d2: "There were great hopes that a democratic Russia would be less hell-bent on imperialist conquests than their Tsarist or Bolshevik predecessors, but that hope has been crushed with the invasion. All our attempts to foster peaceful cooperation between Russian and Ukrainian peoples were in vain. Some point fingers at the URDP and other liberals for having naive hopes of peaceful co-existence. Some blame the socialists, while others see the cause in Germany's imperialistic policy. But despite this disappointment, most of the country agrees on one thing: the invasion must be stopped, if the Ukrainian nation is to survive. It is a tragedy that close neighbours should wage war and slay millions, but such is the nature of history." #democratic Ukraine incl. Danylo vs democratic, nonmonarchist Russia
 ukraine.58.d3: "Already in 1917 the Hetman saved Ukraine from Bolshevik oppression. History repeats itself, as once again the Russian Red Army has invaded our dear country, and is threatening to take everything from us. The bombastic, anti-socialist rhetoric has won over much of the country, and even many liberals admit that rallying behind the Hetman is the wiser course of action. The socialists, already forced to the underground, have been targeted by mass arrests for treason and \"cooperating with the enemy\" - which is in many cases true.\n\nAfter the failed rebellion, what's left of the republicans has drifted hard to the left, and are now collaborating with the Ukrainian National Rada in Paris, actively opposing the war and supporting the Russian forces where they can, \"in the name of Free Ukraine.\" But true Ukrainians know these words false, and would rather support the Hetman, the only man with truly interest of Ukraine in his heart." #Hetman dictatorship Ukraine vs socialist Russia
 ukraine.58.d4: "The Russian invasion has been hovering over our country like a spectre ever since we achieved our independence, but most people didn't believe it would ever become reality. Surely Russia could not challenge the German supremacy of Europe? Surely they would understand that cooperation benefits us both?\n\nBut no. The Russians clearly intend to swallow our hard-won independence. Whatever were greatly divisive topics in Ukraine before, it all seems irrelevant now. People have rallied behind [ROOT.GetLeader]'s defiant assurances of resistance, and even the Russophone community seems hesitant to support the Russian invasion, save for some small groups. Despite protests by the fringe, the vast majority of people have resigned to accept the reality: Ukraine needs to fight, if it is to decide its own future." #fallback

 ukraine.59.t: "Mikhail Bulgakov Visits Ukraine"
 ukraine.59.d: "This past week, famed Russian writer and playwright Mikhail Bulgakov paid a visit to his place of birth - [202.GetName]. Bulgakov reportedly visited our capital to see how the landscape has changed ever since he moved to Moscow, after the Great War had ended. He greeted new associates and former comrades at [202.GetName] University - and if there was nothing else to note of his vacation, that would have been the end of it.\n\nHowever, although his works are quite popular across Russia, they have stirred up controversy in parts of Ukraine, especially in the west. One of his plays, \"The Days of the Turbins\", tells the story of a Russian family, the Turbins, in [202.GetName] living through the Ukrainian War of Independence as opposing forces on all sides struggle to take control of the city. Though the play chiefly concerns the difficulty of living in a war-torn city, it is also a commentary on Ukrainian nationalism; the Turbins are ethnic Russians, monarchists and adherents of the old order, and Bulgakov's writing is quite sympathetic to the family. Pavlo Skoropadskyi, though he returns stability to the city, is portrayed negatively for his role in securing Ukrainian independence.\n\nBulgakov's views on the Tsarist era and Ukrainian statehood have by no means remained a secret - during his visit to [202.GetName] he wrote that although he has respect for \"this new Ukrainian state\" and its accomplishments, he wishes that \"Little Russian people\" would \"choose to live in unity with their Great Russian brothers once again\". Though this view is not uncommon among Moscow's political elites, his endorsement of it has put one question forth: if Russia ever decides to strike at Ukraine's independence, who among the Russians would oppose it?"

 ukraine.61.d: "The final tome of Mykhailo Hrushevskyi's \"History of Ukraine-Rus\", covering the events from 1657 to 1658, has been published today. Hrushevskyi's ten-volume treatise has become his magnum opus and a comprehensive history of Ukraine.\n\nHrushevskyi's work has been crucial for the conceptualisation of the Ukrainian historical process as continuous and independent from the all-Russian historical narrative. Some analysts have tended to assign Hrushevskyi's to a \"populist\" tendency of Ukrainian historiography, which emphasises the critical role of the masses in the conceptual representation of the past. This school of thought is usually contrasted with the \"statist\" tendency, most notably represented by Viacheslav Lypynskyi, Stepan Tomashivskyi and Dmytro Doroshenko and focused on the role of national elites in the statebuilding process.\n\nThe claim that Hrushevskyi's analysis lies in any particular school of thought is perhaps rather misleading, given that his works are based on a quite broad intellectual foundation. But they have also found a special place among the Ukrainian republican movement (rather unsurprisingly, given the critical role Hrushevskyi had played in the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917), with many subscribing to the historical narrative Hrushevskyi has put forth. The coming of the final volume has especially been celebrated by the pro-republican \"Austro-Ukrainian Friendship Association\", which has sought to finance a print of the entire ten volume edition in order to celebrate the occasion."

 ukraine.62.t: "The Hetman Denounces Russian Chauvinism"
 ukraine.62.d: "In an era where Russian revanchism is rising and a large-scale conflict between Ukraine and Russia seems not only possible, but likely, groups that have been seen as a front for Russian political alignment have come under great scrutiny, the most notable of which being the Russian Union in Ukraine.\n\nBut out of all the accusations and finger pointing among who is pro-Russian and who isn't, perhaps the most heinous one comes mostly from the League of Ukrainian Nationalists, who have slandered the Hetman himself. It is clear the League is getting desperate to hold onto its sway it once had on the countryside, but our successful efforts to distribute land to our peasants have made it clear to the average Ukrainian that there is no point to get involved in radical politics. Nonetheless, they have accused Skoropadskyi of Russophilia owing to his earlier associations with Tsarists during the early days of the Hetmanate and his moderate ethnic-linguistic policies.\n\nThe increased number of accusations directed at the Hetman as well as the current geopolitical situation compelled the Hetman to give a speech at Khreschatyk Square, where he denounced the chauvinism of the Russian leadership. He denounced the Russian claim that the Ukrainian nation and Ukrainianism are a German and Austrian invention that sought to weaken Russia, stating that a common Ukrainian spirit among the people had existed, one that flourished ever since independence was secured. Furthermore, Skoropadskyi addressed the accusations that he was pro-Russian directly, stating that his government's track record in promoting the Ukrainian language and cultural institutions are something that even his opponents recognise. He ended the speech proclaiming that just as time cannot flow backwards, the people cannot be forced to abandon their ideas - and that whatever the case may be, Ukraine shall always exist in one form or another."

 ukraine.63.d: "Descending from the Greek settlers who established a colony on Berezan Island in the 7th century BC, the small Greek minority in Ukraine has existed now for centuries. They have gathered some attention in the suburbs of [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6420], where the number of Greek speakers in fact outnumbers the number of Russian speakers and where the Greek minority is most prominent.\n\nFew Greeks were fluent in their mother tongue up until recently; most Greeks attended Russian schools, with only a small percentage attending Ukrainian ones. But a decade ago, as Ukrainian language and cultural institutions were beginning to be promoted, a Greek language pedagogical school and agricultural school was opened in [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6420]. Coinciding with the government's ongoing land reform programme, the agricultural school has been greatly expanded.\n\nAs for the pedagogical school, included are the readings from perhaps the most famous Ukrainian Greek writer of his time: Georgis Kostoprav. Kostoprav's works, mostly written in [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6420] Greek, include translations of famous Russian and Ukrainian writers like Alexander Pushkin and Taras Shevchenko. The school has allowed the Greeks of [227.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_6420] to become familiar with native Ukrainian and Russian culture while not forgetting their own."

 ukraine.64.t: "The Finnish Otaman"
 ukraine.64.d: "Retired Finnish general Kaarlo Kivekäs, or here better known as Edvard Karlovych, arrived in person to Ukraine, wishing to congratulate the new regime. As a private person this was quite odd, but he was received by Petliura nonetheless. The jovial old man had fought under Petliura after Ukrainisation of his 113. Rifle Division in 1917, and had been well liked by his men. Some of the former officers of the 113. Division organised tour for the old Otaman, visiting Dubno and other locations across [792.GetName] where Kivekäs had fought successfully against the Bolsheviks and the Germans before being imprisoned by the Skoropadskyi regime.\n\nKivekäs was a quite figure. Unlike Mannerheim and other Finnish Tsarist generals, he was not Finnish Swedish but from humble peasant family, and had kept that demeanour ever since. He had served decades in Central Asia, teaching himself to use sword like a Cossack and learning Tajik, Kyrgyz and Uzbek. The general continued to insist that there Turkic languages must be related to Finnish. He even took Tajik orphan Gul-Begim as his adoptive daughter Olga, as she would have been otherwise married against her will. Olga was accompanying her father in Ukraine, having lived in [192.GetName] much of her youth. The old man's visit stretched to entire week, as he wished to know every detail of the victorious struggle of the People's Army, and seemed to take great pride in success of the cause he had helped decades before. After petition by his former comrades in military, Kivekäs was awarded Cross of the Order of Liberation 2nd Class for his service for Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917-1918."

 ukraine.65.t: "King August's State Visit"
 ukraine.65.d: "King of Poland, August IV, has met with Hetman Skoropadskyi today. Officially, it is intended as a purely courteous visit meant to strengthen the relations between Ukraine and Poland. The King and the Hetman received the march of the Serdiuk Guard Division in [202.GetName], met with members of the Ukrainian cabinet and went to inspect the modernised Kyiv Arsenal. The public was very interested in the royal visit, and Crown Prince Alexander Ferdinand in particular drew much focus from the media in his dashing Polish Air Force uniform.\n\nHowever the true meaning of the visit is far more serious; behind closed doors, the leaders discussed earlier republican unrest and the ever-growing Russian threat. August spoke plainly - he seemed pessimistic about a potential war with Russia, fearing that it would only make voices against him louder in Poland. Skoropadskyi promised that Ukraine's military will be in shape by 1940 or 1941, as the great industrialisation programme finally will give the nation the tools to build a powerful army with. Prince Alexander seemed the most optimistic out of the three, deeply convinced of the ability of the German army and ultimately the self-preservation of Poles and Ukrainians.\n\nThe visit concluded with an evening at the Kyiv Ballet, and the royal family boarded a train back to Warsaw the following morning."

 ukraine.66.d: "An unforeseen consequence has came from King August's state visit a year ago. Prince Alexander and the Hetman's youngest daughter, Olena Skoropadska, met back then and have been in frequent contact since. The prince's visits to \"learn about Ukraine's air force\" have had the secondary goal of meeting with her for some time now, and the pair has finally announced their intention to marry. While it's not exactly a typical royal match, it is not medieval times either.\n\nThere has been a furious debate in Polish media about whether or not the daughter of the Hetman counts as a princess, but in general, the potential union is seen positively, even symbolically, as a strengthened union between Poland and Ukraine. \"A Ukrainian queen is better than a German one\" seems to be the prevailing attitude.\nWhile official plans have been kept tightly out of the public, it is known that the couple is planning to have a low-profile wedding in the coming months."

All across the nation, the people mourn for the loss of their beloved Hetman who led them through the tumultuous times: the first civil war, the interwar years, a second civil war and a battle for survival against the Russians. A controversial figure from the beginning, Skoropadskyi's government was not appreciated by all. But it was under his rule that Ukraine became free, and it will be his legacy of defending the state until the last.\n\nFor better or for worse, it is undeniable that the years leading up to the World War will be spoken of most in the history books, characterised by the ascension of the SHD and the Hetman's role in allowing them to take power. Should the years of oppression be justified as necessary by future generations or condemned, only time will tell.\n\nIn accordance with the law enshrining the heir, Danylo Skoropadskyi has assumed the position of Hetman. The political position that Danylo finds himself in is uncertain. A noted constitutionalist who has previously spoken of liberalising reforms, he has entered an arena where the SHD have already laid the groundwork to keep the authoritarian and conservative party in power for decades. Above all, Danylo's relative apathy with regards to ruling over Ukraine as decisively as his father did will likely mean that despite his personal convictions, the rule of the SHD is here to stay."

Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's clique in the SHD may have purged those disloyal to the new Otaman-Minister, but the regime maintains not even a facade of democracy. The people's calls for reform have been suppressed with brute force, but brute force can only silence the call for freedom so long. Perhaps if the opportunity presents itself, Danylo's apathy to ruling decisively like his father did may become undone - the only question is if he will heed the call."

But it was under his rule that Ukraine became free, and it will be his legacy of defending the state until the last.\n\nThe Hetman's legacy will no doubt be intertwined with that of the USKhD, a once fringe movement with radical ideas proposing ideas of governance unheard of in the world. The ideals it espoused were brought into practice, and as evidenced by the Ukrainian victory in the east, it seems as though they have had at least some success.\n\nIn accordance with the law enshrining the heir, Danylo Skoropadskyi has assumed the position of Hetman. For a constitutionalist like Danylo, who previously spoke of liberalising reforms, the rule of an anti-democratic organisation is difficult to reconcile with. Yet over time, the powers of the Hetman gradually receded as the USKhD sought to mold the monarchy into a symbolic position. Given Danylo's apathy to ruling directly as his father did, this seems to have brought him into a compromise with the organisation. It is impossible to tell what the future will hold; if the USKhD collapses one day, as many have already foretold, who - or what - will be the one to cause it?"

But even as things change the more they seemed to stay the same; it was the Hetman's executive authority that put a stop to any ambitious reforms, as he increasingly turned to his trusted advisors on the matters of state. As his son Danylo now is tasked with the ruling of the Hetmanate, some in the party have thought him to be a potential gateway into passing many of the reforms they had proposed previously. But Danylo's apathy to ruling may be what dims the spark for the reformists in the UDKhP - in the end, Ukraine is safe and secure, and years of prosperity are sure to come, so why change what works?"
 ukraine.68.d5: "Today, on [GetDate], Pavlo Skoropadskyi, Hetman of all Ukraine, has passed away in his personal residence. All across the nation, the people mourn for the loss of their beloved Hetman who led them through the tumultuous times: the first civil war, the interwar years, a second civil war and a battle for survival against the Russians. A controversial figure from the beginning, Skoropadskyi's government was not appreciated by all. But it was under his rule that Ukraine became free, and it will be his legacy of defending the state until the last.\n\nThe last few interwar years culminated in a rather predictable result, as the UDKhP that had been familiar to the Hetman since the first days of his ascension to power finally became unrestricted by the meddling of the coalition. The story is a tale old as time - Skoropadskyi, the old man at the top, perhaps had grown tired of ruling decisively as he did before. Many of the ambitious reforms the UDKhP pursued limited the Hetman's power, slowly creating a truly constitutional state in the process. Now that Danylo is Hetman, the young man can rest easy. Perhaps the loosening of his executive power was Pavlo's last gift to his son - and regardless of whether that's true or not, it's the thought that counts."

 ukraine.69.t: "Captured Russian Plans"
 ukraine.69.d: "An emergency cabinet meeting was called today after [UKR.GetLeader] was informed by his intelligence officers of dangerous new findings. Present in the room was only the inner circle: the most important ministers, the chief of army with a number of important generals, the director of the [UKR_intel_agency] and a representative of the German Abteilung IIIb. Everyone understood that such a meeting could only mean the worst.\n\nCaptain Anatolii Hurevych, an intelligence officer who had been stationed in Tsaritsyn, gave a briefing to the room. He had been able to steal documents from the headquarters of the Russian 2nd Ukrainian Front and smuggle them out of the country, though his actions had been revealed during his daring escape through the Don Steppe together with a small contingent of Cossacks assisting the [UKR_intel_agency] in intelligence gathering. The Russians had already sent a demand to the Ukrainian government to extradite Hurevych for military espionage, showing that they were well aware of his actions.\n\nHowever, it is the documents themselves which have raised alarm. They contain detailed plans of the so-called \"Operation Yekaterina\", the Russian invasion of Ukraine set to happen this summer. The plans show concentration of our forces and details of our defensive structures in remarkable accuracy, proving that the Russians have had intelligence sources in our armed forces for quite some time. However, these plans also give us detailed information of Russian advancement plans, air bases and artillery positions. With a quick reshuffling of our forces, we can hopefully rob the Russian advantage, and by relaying the plans to Berlin perhaps persuade Germany to send us reinforcements before it is too late."

 ukraine.70.rus.d: "Thanks to the incompetence of the [217.GetName] staff headquarters, Ukrainian agent Anatolii Hurevych has been able to steal part of the plans concerning our future offensive against Ukrainian forces. Our security police failed to stop the agent's escape and it is probable that he has relayed the copy of our plans to the Ukrainian and German armies by now, making many of our preparations in the Donbass Front wasted. However, this is only a minor setback. The army command is arguing that by starting the offensive as fast as possible, the Ukrainians would not have time to properly analyse the stolen plans, and adapt their defences accordingly.\n\nMen responsible for the internal security of the [217.GetName] command have been put to court-martial for their failures to fulfil their duties. Amateurs such as them are not needed in our military intelligence."
 ukraine.70.ger.d: "The Ukrainian foreign ministry has just informed us that Captain Anatolii Hurevych of the [UKR_intel_agency] - the Ukrainian intelligence service - has managed to steal documents detailing the Russian plan to launch a major military offensive in Ukraine during this year. The plans are remarkably detailed on both sides. It is worrying how well they are aware of the Ukrainian troops' concentrations - this must be because of amateurish internal security of the [UKR_intel_agency] and political unreliability of Ukrainian Russian population - but this information is a double-edged sword, as now we are aware of in-depth information regarding Russian troop concentrations, air bases, supply depots and artillery positions. The Ukrainian government has also requested reinforcements to the border to potentially deter Russians from attacking - though if the plans have advanced to this point, it does not seem probable that few additional divisions in Donbas would dissuade [RUS.GetLeader]'s regime from their offensive plans."

 ukraine.71.t: "Ukraines of Many Colours"
 ukraine.71.d: "As tensions continue to mount over the border with Russia, a strange development took place in [221.GetName]. An activist appeared before a crowd, agitating the onlookers with wild proclamations about vast support that he has been able to secure during the past few years among... the Ukrainians of Zakytaishchyna, also known as \"Green Ukraine\", in the Russian Far East.\n\nRambling about the constant failures of the Russian state in providing even the most meagre living standards for its citizens, he finished his speech with a promise: local Ukrainians, languishing in despair, are ready to revolt and cast away the Russian yoke. The only thing required is additional funds, which he is so desperately needing all around Ukraine. Some among the crowd were listening with curiosity, others with mild interest; some would even compare this charade to that of Hetman Mazepa giving wild promises to the Swedish King. Still, the string of these performances would be cut short with the man vanishing without a trace, only a series of warrants for fraud reminding of him. Similar \"guests\" have already appeared on numerous occasions, claiming to represent the interests of downtrodden Ukrainians of Belgorod, Kursk or Kuban, spreading the idea of Ukrainian expansion towards these regions.\n\nBut the Far East, a region so disconnected from the Ukrainian heartland? Some remained confused, unaware that modern Russia harbours various Ukrainian minorities within its borders.\n\nIndeed, from the Black Sea coast of the Kuban to the far eastern region of Zakytaishchyna, one could find communities of Ukrainians living both around the Volga river (so called \"Yellow Ukraine\") and beyond the Ural Mountains (\"Grey Ukraine\"). While the populations of the first two regions entertained the idea of unification with Ukraine proper during the Russian revolution, inhabitants of the two latter ones were focused on securing more autonomy from the Russian state."

 ukraine.74.t: "A Renaming Campaign"
 ukraine.74.d: "Since the proclamation of independence there has been a strong push aimed at the restoration of our cultural distinctiveness, meant to cast away the legacy of Russification and cultural suppression. As part of this push, suggestions to change certain toponyms, the most prominent among them being a proposal to rename [226.GetName] to Sicheslav (to commemorate the famous Zaporizhian Sich), were seriously discussed. Not much has come from these discussions however, since the prospects of bureaucratic hurdles, opposition from more conservatively minded circles and general inertia of the Hetmanate administration had ensured that this question would always be left for \"more appropriate times\".\n\nIt seems that current times are more than appropriate. After all the trials that Ukraine has endured recently, it makes perfect sense to make this symbolic gesture and yet again reaffirm our distinct cultural and historical identity."

 ukraine.75.t: "The Isenbek Tablets"
 ukraine.75.d: "An amateur Slavic folklorist Yurii Myroliubov has petitioned the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences to fund his restoration of \"Book of Veles\" out of birchen tablets found by Ali Isenbek. These tablets are claimed to detail the teachings of the Slavic Native Religion. The obsessive Myroliubov has been restoring and translating the secret tablets, and his published translations have sparked great controversy among the academia. Many see Myroliubov as a total fraud, as he has refused to show the original book to anyone but his close associates.\n\nMyroliubov's unfinished translation has been partially published in the Lviv-based magazine \"Dazhboh\", which has become the vanguard of the Native Slavic movement in Galicia and Ukraine. Its most prominent writer, Sanskritologist Volodymyr Shaian, experienced a spiritual awakening in the Ukrainian Carpathians and started to envision a Ukrainian-Aryan renaissance in both the arts and religion. The Isenbek Tablets have become major part of this new theology, which outlines a new history of the Rus. Ukraine, the purest of the Slavs, is the direct ancestor of the original Aryan peoples, and Christianity has only tried to shackle the Ukrainian people ever since.\n\nShaian's passionate followers have formed the Knights of the Sun God to organise their new religious movement, and have called for the creation of true Ukrainian spirituality and great national awakening. They have raised more money to allow Myroliubov to finish his translation of the Book of Veles. While this is obviously a fringe movement with little basis in sane thinking, it's technically in the right direction, to further separate the Ukrainian identity from that of Russia. Granting Myroliubov funding is a small matter, but could give us a minor propaganda tool."

 ukraine.76.d.intro: "Under the administration of the early People's Republic and the Hetmanate as well, Belgorod was claimed - and indeed occupied - by Ukraine. The city was claimed on an ethnolinguistic basis; the southeastern and southwestern parts of the region indeed had a majority Ukrainian population.\n\nHistorically, these parts of Belgorod belonged to the Slobidska Ukraine regiments, a group of Cossacks that controlled the area during the 17th and 18th century. Though these regiments were abolished by Catherine II in 1765 and the Slobidska Ukraine governorate was divided into the Kharkiv, Kursk and Voronezh governorates, the legacy of Ukrainian migration (and later colonisation) into the region some hundreds of years ago still continues.\n\nThe region in its entirety continues to have a Russian plurality, but this has not been an issue for the [UKR.GetRulingParty]."

It was determined that Ukraine should once again be a monarchy, but the question of legitimacy loomed large, as the greatest claimant to the position are naturally the Skoropadskyis.\n\nNonetheless, we have decided on a better idea. Skoropadskyi may have a legacy of German collaboration and being a rather unloved autocrat, but Wilhelm von Habsburg, rather liked by the Ukrainian people, has offered to take up the position of Hetman should he be elected. After a session of the newly convened Soim, this has been made a reality. The \"Red Prince\", as he is often called, has been elected the new Hetman of all Ukraine!"
 ukraine.77.a: "Congratulations!"

 ukraine.78.t: "History of Ukraine"
 ukraine.78.d: "Today, a comprehensive history of Ukraine, authored by none other than Dmytro Doroshenko, has been published, much to the delight of bookshops in [202.GetName]. As the Hetman's foreign minister and later Otaman-Minister, Doroshenko could not find the time to complete his historical works. However, his retirement shortly after the conclusion of the Anti-Hetman Revolt gave him the opportunity to focus solely on building an account on Ukrainian history, covering events as early as the Greek colonisation of the coast and as late as the Anti-Hetman Revolt.\n\nOf particular note of Doroshenko's \"History of Ukraine\" are the chapters on the foundation of the modern Ukrainian state, both in 1917 when the People's Republic was declared and in 1918 when Skoropadskyi assumed power. According to Doroshenko, the fully socialist nature of the People's Republic upon its birth was what led to its downfall. Representatives of the Central Rada who either did not belong to the socialist parties or were of minority parts soon left the Rada, and the lack of diverse representation in the Rada meant that the new government cared little for wealthier peasants or landowners.\n\nThis was the reason, he continues, that Skoropadskyi's coup succeeded with relative ease, though Doroshenko does not dismiss the importance of the German occupation of the country. With regards to Skoropadskyi's government itself, Doroshenko notes that the Hetman maintained little popularity among the peasants. The administration suffered from various problems, Doroshenko notes, but made critical accomplishments in the fields of foreign affairs, industry and trade, finance, and other matters.\n\nIn more ways than one, Doroshenko's work now occupies an important space in Ukrainian literature, presenting a centre-right perspective on the historiography of the nation."

However, his retirement shortly after the conclusion of the Anti-Hetman Revolt gave him the opportunity to focus solely on building an account on Ukrainian history, covering events as early as the Greek colonisation of the coast and as late as the Anti-Hetman Revolt.\n\nThe reappearance of Doroshenko's name in public life has sparked a debate particularly among members of the URDP. Doroshenko was formerly a URDP member, after all, and his appointment to the Otaman-Ministership was seen as a positive sign for much of the party. For the URDP's left wing, though the late Otaman-Minister meant well, he was naïve to believe that he could have reformed the Hetmananate from within; the system was simply too rigid for such great changes to be pivoted by someone seen as too liberal for the right and too conservative for the left. Predictably, his efforts were a failure.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum is a more charitable view held by the party centre: that Doroshenko held Ukraine's best interests at heart and was willing to work with the URDP to create a better future. Though he failed to reform the system, one could hardly blame him; after all, 1936 was a year of great political and economic upheaval due to the Black Monday crisis. Few would have succeeded where he failed."

However, his retirement shortly after the conclusion of the Anti-Hetman Revolt gave him the opportunity to focus solely on building an account on Ukrainian history, covering events as early as the Greek colonisation of the coast and as late as the Anti-Hetman Revolt.\n\nDoroshenko's work presents an even-handed approach to the late Hetman's rule, acknowledging both his achievements in the fields of foreign affairs, industry, and trade, but at the same time condemning his unwillingness to accept democratic reforms and his heavy-handed methods of suppressing dissent. The former Otaman-Minister carefully tip-toes around the still-unresolved issue of Pavlo's death, which has served to inflame the most conservative elements of Ukrainian society, who still hold radical leftists guility. \n\nDoroshenko's heavy involvement in the significant reforms undergone by the Ukrainian state in recent history has served to greatly increase interest in his book, which is quickly becoming a best seller."

 ukraine.79.t: "Opening of the Government Dacha"
 ukraine.79.d: "The issue of personal residences and government buildings for the leadership of Ukraine has long been a concern in our young nation. After taking power in 1918, Hetman Skoropadskyi was quick to make his home in the Palace of the Governor-General of Ukraine, evicting the Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic which had made it into their base of operations. Skoropadskyi set about transforming the palace back into a personal residence, eventually renaming it the \"Palace of the Hetman\".\n\nYet for most of the Hetmanate's early years, its ruler hardly spent a night here, instead serving on the frontlines of the civil war until 1920. The various Ukrainian governments were just as itinerant, meeting at various universities, theatres and clubs until the Troitske People's House and the Museum of Pedagogy were respectively designated as the temporary sites of the Hetman's government and of the Soim. Official, grandiose Government and Soim Buildings were constructed in [202.GetName] a few years later, but one problem was left unresolved, the housing situation for the Otaman-Minister, our Head of Government.\n\nUntil recently, all Otaman-Ministers have lived in private residences, which naturally pale in glamour to the Palace of the Hetman. It was decided a few years back that in order to recognise the importance of the Otaman-Minister and to expedite issues of communication that an official Government Dacha would be built. A perfect locale was found at the dacha which once housed the 19th century Russian governor Illarion Vasilchikov before being donated to a local monastery after his death. Through the expert work of the architect Serhii Hryhoriev, we've managed to reconstruct it into a modern building equipped with all the necessities one might require. [GetSecondInCommand] has attended the ribbon cutting ceremony and already made plans to move in, holding the privilege of being the first man to occupy the Government Dacha."

 ukraine.80.t: "The Esperantist Movement in Ukraine"
 ukraine.80.d: "Esperantism came into vogue in Ukraine around the turn of the 20th century, when it was picked up by idealists who believed that a \"universal language\" could solve the conflicts between the Russian and Ukrainian speakers. Early adopters included men such as Mykola Borovko, Volodymyr Harnet and Mykhailo Yurkiv, who translated nationalist poetry into the language and distributed the first Esperanto materials in Ukraine. The Galician educators Pavlo Bozhemskyi and Orest Kuzma then inherited the movement, creating the Esperanto Society \"Progreso\" (Progress) in 1910 and the newspaper \"Ukraina Stelo\" (Ukrainian Star) three years later.\n\nTheir dreams of utopian peace and coexistence in Ukraine were shattered by the advent of the Weltkrieg, during which they went underground. They resurfaced in 1921 and made inroads into central and eastern Ukraine, leading to the creation of the \"Tutukrainia komitato de Esperanto\" (All-Ukrainian Esperanto Committee) to coordinate their activities. In recent years, Esperanto language journals are appearing at Ukrainian universities and a bust of L. L. Zamenhof, the founder of Esperanto, was even commissioned and put up on display in [192.GetName].\n\nThe Committee, still headquartered in the Galician town of Kolomyia, professes to be nonpartisan and stays out of the internal politics of the Hetmanate, but radical offshoots of it are not so cautious. Socialist Esperantists support the Communard \"Internacia Asocio de Revoluciaj Esperantaj Verkistoj\" (International Association of Revolutionary Esperanto Writers) and are led by the poet Yevhen Mykhalskyi, or \"Eŭgeno Miĥalski\" as he is known in Esperanto, who has long been agitating from his exile in Paris. Anatolii Koch, or \"Anatolo Koĥ\", leads the right-wing of the Committee, finding a sympathetic albeit somewhat befuddled audience among intellectuals aligned with the Hetman's Coalition and LUN. All in all, this has led to headache for Kuzma, who has struggled to rein in the radical members."

 ukraine.81.t: "Paradise Lost and Found"
 ukraine.81.d: "After almost two years of work, the perennial Ukrainian filmmaker Oleksandr Dovzhenko has released his latest film, \"Zahublenyi i Vidnaydenyi Ray\" (Paradise Lost and Found), inspired by his deep love for the Ukrainian nation and his long exile in the Commune of France. It is the first among his many works of art to have actually been filmed on location in Ukraine, to much celebration. It follows the story of a utopian settlement in the Ukrainian wilderness, as it slowly transforms into a modern metropolis while enduring attacks from enemies opposed to its unique way of life; a mixture of communal living and technocratic rational planning.\n\nThis has been interpreted by critics as being either a positive allegory for the renaissance of left-wing Ukrainian Republicanism or, according to Dovzhenko's more hard-line detractors, a way of romanticising the old Hetmanate's ideas of Classocracy. Dovzhenko's supporters have praised the film as an ode to the potential of the Ukrainian nation, attempting to reconcile the forces of nature with the forces of modernity. Unlike Dovzhenko's prior works which were grounded in the Communard school of \"Proletarian Realism\", the film is quite intensively symbolic, \"romantic to the point of exhaustion\" as one of Dovzhenko's collaborators noted with sly wit. References to specific nationalities, cultures and political movements, even those of Ukraine, are hidden behind layers of allegory.\n\nThough the wider public has scratched their heads, there has been celebration from Dovzhenko's preferred audience, the avant garde left, with screenings of the film being held not just in Ukraine but also by his old peers in Paris and London. The mixed response has not intimidated Dovzhenko and the man renowned as the \"First Poet of the Cinema\" has immediately returned to work on his next project."
 ukraine.81.a: "Wait, I don't get it, was it about the Hetmanate or Republic?"
 ukraine.81.b: "What a strange man... tell me more about this amateur!"

 ukraine.82.t: "The First Poet of the Cinema"
 ukraine.82.d: "Dovzhenko is a curious fixture of Ukrainian cinema; he descended from poor Cossacks, but grew up to become a teacher and one of the founders of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in [202.GetName]. While initially a supporter of the Hetmanate in 1918, Dovzhenko confessed that he had entered the Ukrainian national revolution \"through the wrong door\", becoming an outspoken opponent of Skoropadskyi after the Hetman introduced conscription among the students of [202.GetName]. He later drifted between Symon Petliura's Ukrainian People's Republic and the Borotbyst faction of the Communist Movement during the Civil War, until the victory of the Hetman forced Dovzhenko to flee his homeland and seek refuge in France.\n\nIn 1925 he took up work as an intern in the French film industry. There he learned the tools of the trade, beginning to write his own scripts that were often comedies parodying and referencing other popular films. Dovzhenko eventually began to produce his own political films, putting together a motley crew of fellow Ukrainian exiles to help him write and direct his esteemed \"Ukrainian Trilogy\", consisting of \"Zvenyhora\", \"Arsenal\" and \"Zemlia\" (Earth), which he described as \"Cinematic Poetry\" and as an attempt to create a \"Ukrainian Iliad\" that covered the entire history of his homeland. Though all three of these pictures were filmed in France, Dovzhenko was adamant about wanting to try to recreate an authentic Ukrainian culture on his sets.\n\nAlongside his nationalist sentiments, Dovzhenko's socialist politics were also obvious in these works, such as how in \"Zvenyhora\" and \"Zemlia\" he highlighted the aspirations of the Ukrainian peasantry for land reform and economic liberty, while in \"Zvenyhora\" and \"Arsenal\" his depictions of the Ukrainian Civil War carried with them a sense of melancholy over the failures of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Borotbysts, a sombre dream of what could have been had they defeated the Hetman back then. Nevertheless, these early films were still highly grounded and carried a strict appeal to land, liberty and national tradition, a far cry from his recent, more esoteric works like \"Zahublenyi i Vidnaydenyi Ray\" (Paradise Lost and Found)."
 ukraine.82.a: "Perhaps \"romantic to the point of exhaustion\" was right..."

 ukraine.83.t: "Production on Taras Bulba Halted"
 ukraine.83.d: "For the last ten years, the esteemed Ukrainian director Oleksandr Dovzhenko has been working on an adaptation of the 19th century Cossack novel \"Taras Bulba\", penned by Nikolai Gogol. The director had recently entered into collaboration with the renowned Cossack historian Dmytro Yavornytskyi to guarantee the film's authenticity. The two men promised that the script was near completion, with Dovzhenko even recently returning from scouting out filming locations in Crimea, but many of his peers expressed their scepticism whether this decade-long project would actually bear fruition anytime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears the worst has come to pass and production will be halted on Dovzhenko's magnum opus for the indefinite future, as the declaration of war with Russia has made it too dangerous to film in Crimea. Additionally, several of the leading actors in the film, such as the young Mykola Dupak who was set to play the Cossack hero Taras Bulba's erudite son Andrii, have announced that they wish to volunteer in the Ukrainian armed forces rather than spend the war on film sets or the theatre stage. Dovzhenko has seconded this opinion and presented himself at the service of our government, who has requested his aid in shooting propaganda films in support of the war effort.\n\nThis has come with some ambivalence; whilst Dovzhenko is disappointed that his masterpiece has to be delayed further, it is clear that he is outraged at the Russian enemy and has already begin to pen fiery rhetoric against them, such as a short journalistic essay entitled \"Ukraine on Fire\" which has already found praise amongst both common soldiers, officers and government officials."

 ukraine.84.t: "Taras Bulba Released"
 ukraine.84.d: "In spite of the fire and bloodshed that Ukraine has endured, we have survived, and so have the dreams of the great director Oleksandr Dovzhenko. His decades-long project, adapting the 19th century novel \"Taras Bulba\" into film, has finally been completed and is now showing on the silver screen. The history of Taras Bulba is complicated, penned in the 19th century by the Ukrainian born writer Nikolai Gogol, the work itself as well as its author have always been disputed between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. Though Gogol was born to a long line of Ukrainian Cossacks, he primarily moved in Russian literary circles. As a man of two worlds, he famously remarked that he did not give preference to neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian nationalist cause, leading both sides to often claim him as their own.\n\nWhile Dovzhenko may favour the Ukrainian position in this cultural conflict, he has tried to avoid reopening old wounds left behind by the Second Weltkrieg. \"Taras Bulba\", set in the early 17th century, tells the story of how a brave Ukrainian Cossack hero and his sons rise up to rebel against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. While the original novel's narrative portrays the Poles as being supported by Jews, Crimeans and other collaborators, Dovzhenko has tried to depict a more nuanced narrative, presenting the foreign hegemons as enticing both the Christian, Jewish and Muslim populations of Ukraine to follow their will. Other notable changes include the omission of Gogol's reverence for the Russian Tsar when the rebel Ukrainians cry out for a liberator to save them, choosing to use a more ambiguous description of a leader or father figure who will deliver them from oppression.\n\nLastly, the film features several allegories for the Ukrainian People's Republic, depicting this piece of 17th century Ukrainian resistance as part of a broader struggle against foreign domination of all kinds, particularly the one of foreign capital from Berlin, Austria and Moscow."
 ukraine.84.a: "Congratulations to Dovzhenko!"

 ukraine.85.t: "Lily"
 ukraine.85.d: "A new artistic endeavour has been sweeping the Ukrainian theatre scene, as both the patrons of the arts and creatives dedicate their efforts towards supporting the war against Russia. \"Lileia\" (Lily) is a dramatic and nationalistic ballet, with a libretto written by Vsevolod Chagovets who has also organised the staging and a riveting score composed by Kostiantyn Dankevych. The origin of the story is derived from poems and ballads by the august 19th century Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, particularly his collection Kobzar (The Minstrel). Rather than a direct adaptation of any single work, the play is a compilation of many different parts of Kobzar, meant to create a unified narrative.\n\nThe opening performance was held at the National Opera of Ukraine in [202.GetName], telling the story of a young Ukrainian peasant girl named Lileia, living in a 1820s Ukraine that is viciously oppressed by the Romanov dynasty, or the \"Muscovites\" as the play calls them. She falls in love with a fellow peasant, named Stepan, but after petitioning the cruel Muscovite Prince who administers their village for permission to marry, she finds herself the object of his perverse desires. When the Prince attempts to kidnap Lileia, she and Stepan are spirited away by their fellow villagers but end up separated along the way. Stepan is eventually captured by the Prince's men and blinded, but remains undeterred by this mutilation, He takes up the life of an errant minstrel, travelling rallying the people of Ukraine to his side through music.\n\nAfter reuniting with Lileia, the two are once again set upon by the Muscovite Prince. Lileia takes a mortal blow meant for her lover, with her death inspiring Stepan and the Ukrainian peasants to rise up in rebellion and execute the Prince, whereafter they promise to create a new nation of equal men, free of tyranny. The striking tale of oppression, martyrdom and rebellion has been heralded as an allegory for Ukraine's long struggle against Russian hegemony."
 ukraine.85.a: "Most interesting."

 ukraine.86.t: "Animated Innovations in [192.GetName]"
 ukraine.86.d: "A little known facet of Ukrainian culture is our home grown animation industry, which has recently been receiving wider international attention. It originated at Odesa Film Studio, a company formed when native Ukrainian film studios merged after struggling to stay afloat after the civil war, under the auspices of a man named Viacheslav Levandovskyi who is praised as the father of Ukrainian animation. A student of ballet and a graduate of the [202.GetName] Academy of Arts, Levandovskyi was drawn to the [192.GetName] film industry where he initially worked with puppets, stop-motion animation and rotoscoping, creating the first Ukrainian animated film \"Solomianyi Bychok\" (Straw Bull) in 1927.\n\nHe soon grew interested in \"celluloid animations\" developed by Walt Disney Productions and Fleischer Studios, as well as the use of sound synchronised with animation. Levandovskyi and other Ukrainian animators were mainly introduced to these concepts through the cultural magazine Dilo (The Deed), published in Galicia but which was shared among intellectual circles in Ukraine. In time Levandovskyi moved away from puppets and started using cel animation, beginning work on his most well-known cartoon, \"Tuk-Tuk ta yoho pryiatel Zhuk\" (Tuk-Tuk and his friend Zhuk) in 1928.\n\nThis was an attempt to create a pair of serial mascots for Ukrainian animation, characters akin to Mickey Mouse or Betty Boop, who could appear in many different cartoons. The miniature boy Tuk-Tuk and his canine companion Zhuk have starred in three stories so far, all made by Levandovskyi alongside his colleagues Ipolit Lazarchuk, Serhii Kononchuk, Semen Huietskyi and Yevhen Horbach over the course of the last decade. They've found immense popularity among Ukrainian children and helped elevate animation as a reputable new art form. Just as Levandovsky was himself inspired by foreign ideas, Ukrainian cartoons have spread throughout the Reichspakt and in Galicia, where they might in turn help inspire other animators."
 ukraine.86.a: "What a charming collection of sights and sounds!"

 ukraine.87.t: "Restoration of the Jewish National Council"
 ukraine.87.d: "With the recent advent of the Republican Revolution, Ukrainian minority populations have also begun asserting their place in the new political realities. For Ukraine's Jews, this means restoration of the Jewish National Council, as a representative-advisory body for any Jewish political activity in the Ukrainian People's Republic. While the Jewish National Council was dispersed in the early days of the Hetmanate, the Skoropadskyi Regime did not abolish all said advisory institutions and Jewish National Council was de-facto replaced by the Jewish National Assembly. Still, the centralised nature of the Hetmanist State, as well as the ban on all Socialistic forces, meant that the Jewish National Assembly was quite limited in its reach, mostly dominated by liberal forces of the Jewish People's Party, as well as those who found their place in the Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party (chiefly, one of the nation's top diplomats, Arnold Margolin).\n\nNow, the Council has begun its work once more. Filled with representatives of various political forces, including the Poale Zion, the Bund, United Jewish Socialist Workers Party, the aforementioned Jewish People's Party and general Zionists, the Council passed a set of resolutions welcoming the recent restoration of National Personal Autonomy Law and declaring an intention to assist in its implementation. A partial controversy ensued over distribution of seats within the Council, as well as the participation of explicitly revolutionary socialist forces, but was quickly diffused. After some deliberation, Solomon Goldelman of Poale Zion was elected its head, with Vulf Latskyi as his vice. The [UKR_leader_title] met Goldelman to congratulate him on his victory."
 ukraine.87.a: "Congratulations, Mr. Goldelman."

 ukraine.88.t: "Political Upheavals in the Jewish National Council"
 ukraine.88.d: "It would have been naive to believe that the recent Borotbyst Syndicalist Revolution would have skirted by the Jewish National Council and its internal political developments. Taking into account the national political circumstances, Revolutionary Socialist forces within the Council have sent out a vote of no confidence against the Council's leadership, a clear attempt to replace it with a more leftist makeup. The attempt succeeded and a new leadership race is abound. Due to Goldelman's long-lasting tenure in the Jewish Political Circles, it was decided that he'll occupy a lower-ranking "Secretary" post, instead of fully resigning from all leading positions.\n\nInterestingly enough, one of the candidates for the new leadership has been Isaak Babel, a famous Jewish Author from [192.GetName]. Gaining notable fame for his short stories and novels during the interwar, the revelation that Babel had ties to the Bolsheviks during the Civil War has left more questions than answers. Regardless, Babel has quietly rejected his own candidacy and instead sent out a statement congratulating the Leftist Circles in both the National Council, as well as Ukraine at large on a successful revolution."
 ukraine.88.a: "The revolution is truly a social one."

 ukraine.89.t1: "Jewish National Council in Support of the War Effort"
 ukraine.89.t2: "Jewish National Assembly in Support of the War Effort"
 ukraine.89.d.unr: "The Jewish National Council has recently-passed a near-unanimous resolution supporting our war effort.\n\nThe resolution has noted the necessity of struggle against Russian Imperialism and welcomed the participation of Ukraine's Jews in every level of the war effort, and have encouraged Ukrainian Jews to volunteer for service. The Council Head Goldelman has also submitted the Council's candidacy for new Chief Rabbi of the Army. [ROOT.GetLeader] has thanked the Council officially for their support."
 ukraine.89.d.soc: "The Jewish National Council has recently-passed a near-unanimous resolution supporting our revolutionary war.\n\nThe resolution has noted the necessity of struggle against International Imperialism and welcomed the participation of Ukraine's Jews in every level of the revolutionary struggle, calling them to volunteer for military service to their best ability. The Council's leadership, along with Secretary Goldelman have also submitted the Council's candidacy for new Chief Rabbi of the Army. Comrade Shumskyi has called the Council's leadership and thanked them for the support."
 ukraine.89.d.hetman: "The Jewish National Assembly, a proportional non-government organisation has recently-passed a near-unanimous resolution supporting our war effort.\n\nThe resolution has noted the necessity of struggle against Russian Expansionism and welcomed the participation of Ukraine's Jews in every level of the war effort, and have encouraged Ukrainian Jews to volunteer for service. The Assembly Head Latskyi has also submitted the Assembly's candidacy for new Chief Rabbi of the Army. [GetSecondInCommand] has called the Assembly's leadership and thanked them for the support."
 ukraine.89.a: "Their help is appreciated!"

 ukraine.90.t: "Absorption of the Minority Organisations"
 ukraine.90.d: "Just recently, the SHD's spokesmen have announced an absorption of 'minority interest groups' into the organisation. The largest socio-political organisations integrated into the SHD are Jewish, Russian and Polish communities, but there are numerous others that are affected.\n\nIn a radio address, Otaman-Minister Borys Homzyn and Head of the Great Cossack Rada Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia declared the implementation of this policy of 'social unification.' They stressed that no 'specific discriminatory legislation' would be enacted at any point. Homzyn and Poltavets-Ostrianytsia vaguely argued that such a move is necessary to safeguard against 'both internal and external threats' and that 'all residents of Ukraine are equal.'\n\nCertain absorbed organisations, like the Russian Union in Ukraine, found itself with slightly looser strings attached, purportedly due to ties some of its leadership had to the SHD - while organisations such as the Jewish National Assembly all but lost their autonomy after 'socialist-friendly' leadership was removed and 'socialist programmes' of the assembly were cut.\n\nIn any case, such a move has provoked multiple protests all across the country, which were quickly dispersed by the Derzhavna Varta."
 ukraine.90.a: "Another victory for the Hetman!"

 ukraine.91.t: "Minority Organisations Dispersed"
 ukraine.91.d: "Just recently, the Provid of the League has announced a dispersion of all minority interest groups in Ukraine. The largest ones to be disbanded are the Jewish, Russian and Polish social organisations.\n\nIn a radio address, Provid Members Andrii Melnyk, Yevhen Onatskyi and Rostyslav Bereziuk-Voloshyn declared the implementation of the policy of 'social unification' but stressed that no 'specific discriminatory legislation' would be enacted at any point. The three argued that the move is simply necessary to safeguard Ukraine against 'both internal and external threats' in a quest for 'ideological homogeneity', and that without cracking down on these anti-Ukrainian organisations, 'Ukraine could never be reborn and rise as a proud and unified nation.'\n\nA little bizarrely, in semi-private comments, Head of the League Mykola Stsiborskyi, supported the policy but questioned the 'overly forceful' tactics of its implementation, particularly in regards to Ukraine's Jews. His comments found little support within the League itself, and only drew more questions than answers.\n\nIn any case, such a move has provoked multiple protests all across the country, which were quickly dispersed by the police and Legionaries."
 ukraine.91.a: "Another victory for Ukraine!"

 ukraine.92.t: "The Strange Man in the Snow"
 ukraine.92.d: "Stories of the miraculous and holy abound across the Ukrainian steppe. In the province of Luhanske, one can find a woods preacher in every town, extolling the virtues of natural living. These men usually retire in the winter, leaving streets quiet on the Holy Week. But this holy week is different.\n\nOn a bitter night, in -45c weather, a group of men and women are outside Luhansk. Reports from the police are called out to arrest them. What they find when they are pulled indoors is a shock. Men and women, mostly topless, without shoes. Their leader, a squat man with a long white beard.\n\nThe first report, that the police had captured Father Christmas, was dismissed as a holiday prank. However, the local authorities are asking us how to pay for their holding after the new year. These are real people, and they claim to be followers of Porfiry Ivanov. They are not Christians nor are they Old Believers. Their leader has a history of registry with the Communist Party of Russia, and yet he is a preacher. These members apparently believe, erroneously, that the subzero weather outside will cure them of all ailments.\n\nObviously mad, but maybe there is an alternative theory? These madmen, by their continued existence, actually help the finances of the Ukrainian government. They refuse all welfare, refuse medical care, refuse meat and all charity. If this group is allowed to propagate in our country, they could save the government thousands in welfare. Obviously this would result in the deaths of many followers, for their healthcare is a fiction and their heterodoxy is barely tolerated by the city of Luhanske."
 ukraine.92.a: "Release these wonderful frugal people."
 ukraine.92.b: "I'm not going to wait until someone freezes to death, break it up."

 ukraine.93.t: "We Enter a New Era"
 ukraine.93.d: "One thing that will surely be debated by historians is whether the great counteroffensive after the fall of Germany will be included as part of the Second Weltkrieg, or something more magnificent: the Third Weltkrieg. The latter opinion gives credit where credit is due, as Ukraine and her allies have pulled off a momentous feat.\n\nBut there is no time for such discussions: Europe must rebuild. We will never forget the losses that we have incurred in the war, but we will never forget the reason the war happened, either. While most would credit rising Franco-Russian aggression in the late 1930s to the main cause of conflict, there is some truth to the theory that the German desire for European supremacy and potentially even world domination only inflamed tensions further.\n\nWe ourselves know the consequences of such desires. From 1918 until the victorious Anti-Hetman Revolt, the Germans backed the authoritarian Hetmanist government, forcing us to sell grain at low prices and to subject ourselves to the rather oppressive Mitteleuropean system. Even after the restoration of the People's Republic, such measures were kept - we still yet yearned for true freedom.\n\nNow it is not just us who will get a taste of that true freedom. It is so that Europe shall never come to blows again, so that economic hegemony and military supremacy do not shape the continent anymore, so that Europe shall be safe for democracy, that a grand congress is taking place in Berlin. Based on the earlier Treaty of Cooperation between People's States, new legislation is being drafted to secure all of these noble ideas across Europe. From this day henceforth, we enter a new era - an era of peace, cooperation, brotherhood and democracy."

And if Germany will not accept that they are at least partially to blame, then we need to take initiative ourselves.\n\nThat is why the Hetmanist diplomat and, perhaps, the most Russia-friendly state functionary, Oleksandr Sakhno-Ustymovych, was sent on a mission to Moscow for a last ditch effort.

Was it not in both countries' interests to avoid another, potentially even more catastrophic war that will pit neighbour against neighbour?\n\nWhile [RUS.GetLeader] seemed sympathetic at first, and reaffirmed Russia's recognition of Ukrainian statehood, he became sceptical.

It would be a shame for the two states to end up at war, sure, but such is reality if Ukraine was going to be an accomplice in German aggression.\n\nIn the end, they both left the negotiating table.

#Relief Bill
 ukraine_relief.1.t: "Drafting the Relief Bill"
 ukraine_relief.1.d: "With the economic situation growing worse by the hour and with no positive developments in sight it falls to the Soim and the government to draft a comprehensive piece of legislation which will allow major increase in government debt to stabilise prices, purchase up excess products, and to organise great amount of emergency work to ease the financial plight of the people, thus restoring confidence of people in the ruling regime. No doubt, such an endeavour will require considerable effort from our divided legislature."
 ukraine_relief.1.a: "Surely the Soim will be able to reach a consensus?"

 ukraine_relief.2.t: "URDP Proposes Temporary Nationalisation Of Banking Centres"
 ukraine_relief.2.d: "Representatives of the URDP have suggested temporary nationalisation of banking centres in [202.GetName], [192.GetName], [221.GetName] and [226.GetName] to allow the Central Government to liquidate unprofitable ventures and stop any economic \"freefalls\".\n\nObviously this proposal has met fierce resistance from the representatives of VSZV and Protofis who are weary of government intervention in financial affairs of their benefactors. Surprisingly enough, behind closed doors members of SHD voiced their support for the initiative citing \"excesses of unbridled capitalism\" and \"lack of economic centralisation\" as main reasons for the current crisis."
 ukraine_relief.2.a: "The government will safeguard the banking system from sudden shocks."
 ukraine_relief.2.b: "Our financial system can weather the storm without direct intervention."
 UKR_banking_curves_nationalisation_tt: "§RWe will be lucky if the banks do not crash.§!"
 UKR_SHD_meddling_tt: "§PThe SHD's influence may have consequences.§!"

 ukraine_relief.3.t: "Bankruptcy Of [221.GetName] Bank"
 ukraine_relief.3.d: "The bank runs all over Mitteleuropa have finally reached our country. Prompted by panic, investors and the general population alike began withdrawing their deposits from various banks. One of them, [221.GetName] Bank, wasn't ready for such a development and soon enough crumbled under the weight of its own debts, with numerous loans expected to never return to the bank. This is a grim sign for our supposedly stable financial system."
 ukraine_relief.3.a: "Preposterous, ridding of unstable enterprises will only strengthen our financial system."

 ukraine_relief.4.t: "Rural Credit Programme Suffers Due To Instability In Banking Sector"
 ukraine_relief.4.d: "Another day, another trouble for our finances. This time, several banks have stopped their participation in the state-run Rural Credit Programme, which has been offering cheap loans to farmers for modernisation of their agricultural equipment. As part of the troubled Land Reform, this programme was a joint project of UDKhP and USKhD, and this regretful development will surely cost us their votes in the Soim."
 ukraine_relief.4.a: "We were supposed to have a strong agrarian economy..."

 ukraine_relief.5.t: "USKhD Suggests Creation Of Temporary Class Council In The Soim"
 ukraine_relief.5.d: "Experiments with direct class representation in politics always were part of the USKhD's agenda. Arguing that only representatives of the producing classes have the necessary skills, experience and dedication to guide political and economic development of the nation, a group of USKhD deputies headed by Mykola Kochubei have suggested to create a special council comprised from delegates chosen by state unions, farmer cooperatives, employers and landowners organisations. Such an assembly should participate in solving the current economic crisis alongside the Soim.\n\nThe proposal was met with fierce criticism from the URDP, which claims that this institution, supposedly designed to alleviate class conflicts, will only exacerbate them, with representatives of big landowners and industrialists poised to completely dominate it. Other groups within the Soim are sceptical too, fearing that the creation of such a body will destroy the already fragile balance of powers in the parliament."
 ukraine_relief.5.a: "USKhD is a part of the Coalition, we cannot leave their suggestion without attention."
 ukraine_relief.5.b: "\"Classocratic\" approach? That sounds ridiculous."
 ukraine_relief.5.c: "Perhaps we can convince others."

 ukraine_relief.6.t: "Troubles With The Class Council"
 ukraine_relief.6.d: "As was predicted by many, the practical implementation of the recent USKhD proposal has met several obstacles. Questions of quotas for representation, lack of engagement between local class organisations and centralised bureaucracy, general chaos on all levels of government due to the ongoing crisis - all that turned the process of formation of the Council into a bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nLists of candidates are being redrafted almost every day, as different organisations, political and economic, vie for representation. The date of the first session has already been rescheduled several times. Obviously, URDP deputies cannot pass the opportunity to point out these developments in their speeches and all difficulties with the Council are carefully covered in the party press."
 ukraine_relief.6.a: "Well, that was worth a shot..."

 ukraine_relief.7.t: "Divisions In The Hetman Coalition"
 ukraine_relief.7.d: "The USKhD was a junior partner in the Hetman Coalition since its inception in 1924. Essentially forced into union with UDKhP by the Hetman's direct intervention, they nonetheless remained true to their radical Neo-Monarchist beliefs. After the passing of the movement's founder, political philosopher and advisor to the Hetman, Viacheslav Lypynskyi, relations between USKhD and other conservative forces have become even more strained. Seen as too preoccupied with radical and impractical \"Classocratic\" ideas by others, the movement still remained committed to their role in the Coalition, in the name of national unity and for the glory of the Hetman's Ukraine.\n\nRecent disagreements, though, may prove to be the last straw. Rejection of the Class Council project infuriated the USKhD and spurred numerous rumours of its possible departure from the Coalition, with the Agrarians-Statists being fed with the constant role of lesser partners. Only time will tell if these rumours bear the semblance of truth."
 ukraine_relief.7.a: "They surely will come to their senses very soon."

 ukraine_relief.8.t: "Opposition Feels Emboldened"
 ukraine_relief.8.d: "With the recent troubles in the Hetman Coalition over the formation of the Class Council, the URDP seems poised to take advantage of these developments.\n\nIn a scathing speech delivered today on the floor of the Soim, Andrii Nikovskyi, leader of the URDP parliamentary faction, has fiercely attacked the Hetman Coalition, highlighting its recent failures, infighting and increasing factionalism. \"How long will this political abomination be able to maintain a false veneer of unity, with Protofis lobbyists caring only about profits of their benefactors and USKhD and UDKhP growing more distant by the day?\" This is a good question, and certainly one preoccupying the minds of many Independent deputies."
 ukraine_relief.8.a: "Just a usual rabble rousing."

 ukraine_relief.9.t: "Question Of Stockpiled Grain"
 ukraine_relief.9.d: "With the prices for agricultural goods lowering almost by the day, we have accumulated significant amounts of unsold grain in our stockpiles. Representatives of VSZV and Protofis suggest to keep selling the grain, even at these unfavourable prices. Each source of revenue counts, they argue, and besides, gained funds may be directed to bailing out various businesses (mostly associated with their benefactors, of course), thus keeping people employed and out of the streets. The URDP was quick to denounce this proposal, stating that money raised this way should be used to directly help the ailing agricultural sector."
 ukraine_relief.9.a: "We must support business owners in times like these"
 ukraine_relief.9.b: "This decision may backfire on us, considering the current political climate..."
 ukraine_relief.9.c: "Perhaps convincing other factions may help to prevent undesirable consequences."

 ukraine_relief.10.t: "New Wave of Protests"
 ukraine_relief.10.d: "The URDP press was quick to portray the recent decision to use additional funds to bail out various businesses instead of using them for agricultural subsidies as yet another sign of collusion between large capital and uncaring government. While newspapers containing the most egregious articles were quickly removed from sales by authorities, the damage was already done.\n\nIn the polarised political climate, an agitated populace responded with outrage and a new wave of protests swept through [202.GetName] and other cities. Privately, several members of SHD expressed their concerns to the Hetman about the ability of the Soim to alleviate the current crisis before it gets completely out of hand."
 ukraine_relief.10.a: "Everything is under control."

 ukraine_relief.11.t: "On The Question Of Delegation Of Powers"
 ukraine_relief.11.d: "It is true that the highly centralised bureaucracy of Ukrainian State is sluggish in its response to the economic crisis. To alleviate this issue, deputies from several factions of the Soim have suggested empowering local authorities in the most hard hit regions. Additionally, they plan to create special offices for every major Ukrainian region tasked with coordinating immediate responses to the crisis with local business, professional and political organisations.\n\nWhile this initiative has significant support in the Soim, especially among Independents associated with Crimean deputy Asan Sabri Aivazov, there are rumours of several high-ranking members of the SHD reaching out to the Hetman and his close circle over the matter. Apparently, this secretive clique fears that delegating too much powers to the regions suffering from unrest will only embolden local insurgents and provocateurs; and, besides, only strong central authority is able to curtail the worst excesses of the crisis within acceptable time frame."
 ukraine_relief.11.a: "It's just rumours."
 ukraine_relief.11.b: "We need to tread carefully."
 UKR_doubt_independent_tt: "§RDecentralisation is a key issue and not taking a stance may end negotiations prematurely...§!"

 ukraine_relief.12.t: "Behind Closed Doors"
 ukraine_relief.12.d: "It turns out that rumours of SHD meddling weren't entirely unfounded. General Poltavets-Ostrianytsia was seen visiting the Hetman's private residence several times in the span of just a few days. Colonel Homzyn was reported meeting with high-ranking bureaucrats from the ministries of Interior and Finance. While it is unknown if those meetings have borne any fruit, it's nonetheless a very worrying sign and many members of the Soim are alarmed about possible developments."
 ukraine_relief.12.a: "We can only wait."
 UKR_SHD_influence_tt: "§RProceed with caution.§!"

 ukraine_relief.13.t: "Meeting At The Residence"
 ukraine_relief.13.d: "It is not known what in particular had spurred this invitation, but leaders of all Soim parliamentary factions were invited to Hetman's private residence several days ago. The details of the meeting are kept secret, but judging by the reaction in the URDP headquarters, one can assume that Skoropadskyi has tried to influence ongoing negotiations regarding the Relief Bill in a more direct manner.\n\nAs of now, this intervention has seemed to produce an effect opposite to desirable; URDP deputies are furious, and even some Independents and more democratically inclined members of UDKhP have withdrawn their support for the Bill in protest. The future of negotiations is looking extremely grim now."
 ukraine_relief.13.a: "Maybe this was a mistake..."

 ukraine_relief.14.t: "Budget Reserves"
 ukraine_relief.14.d: "With most revenue sources for the state drying up and with no signs of improvement in the near future, Soim deputies are pondering their possible options. The URDP suggests implementing an emergency tax-hike on the upper classes, arguing that in the conditions of severe economic inequality existing in Ukraine, the poorest social groups have been hit the hardest, and thus it's the responsibility of the wealthy to support the state during the crisis. Representatives of VSZV and Protofis oppose the proposal, saying that increasing the financial burden on the entrepreneurial class right now will only worsen the business climate in the country.\n\nThe possible alternative solution is an emergency loan from Berlin, which will help us to weather the worst part of the crisis. It's worth noting that several Protofis representatives have hinted that this question is of utmost importance to their benefactors, and our choice here may define relationships with the organisation for the foreseeable future."
 ukraine_relief.14.a: "More wealthy ones pay more - it's only fair."
 ukraine_relief.14.b: "Our German allies will surely understand."

 ukraine_relief.15.t: "Unions and Cooperatives"
 ukraine_relief.15.d: "State supported professional unions and farmer cooperatives are one of our main instruments in controlling labour relations. With the severity of the current crisis, it is clear that they are struggling to maintain proper order among workers and peasants. A possible solution may lie in the empowering of these organisations, granting them more freedoms in labour negotiations and support from the state.\n\nNaturally, the question is how far we are ready to go with this idea. The URDP, as usual, suggests granting state unions almost free hand in bargaining with employers and minimising punishments for strikes. Representatives of Protofis, accusing the URDP of \"cryptobolshevism\", argue for only token amount of support. Other factions expressed their preference for compromise solution."
 ukraine_relief.15.a: "Stop with this syndicalist nonsense."
 ukraine_relief.15.b: "Compromise it is."
 ukraine_relief.15.c: "Current crisis requires radical solutions."

 ukraine_relief.16.t: "Doubts Among Independents"
 ukraine_relief.16.d: "Rejection of the decentralisation initiative by the government caused a wave of criticism not only from the opposition - the URDP - but also from many Independent deputies, despite many of them participating in the Hetman Coalition. Some of them have been cautiously advocating for decentralisation for a long time by now, some have seen this undertaking as an opportunity to strengthen their own position in their constituencies.\n\nNo matter the reason, with the rumours about SHD having a hand in rejection of the proposal spreading like wildfire, some Independents have started considering possible defection to the opposition, threatening Relief Bill negotiations."
 ukraine_relief.16.a: "They won't dare."

 ukraine_relief.99.t: "Relief Bill Negotiations Are Stopped"
 ukraine_relief.99.d1: "With the Hetman Coalition rife with disagreements, constant SHD meddling in negotiations and an emboldened URDP, it is not surprising that several Independent deputies have decided to throw their lot with the opposition. Truly, why should one remain on a clearly sinking ship, especially with the elections approaching?\nThe balance of power in the Soim is irrevocably changed, and, as such, negotiations are essentially stalled. It seems the Soim has failed its test, not able to find compromise among petty squabbles and political infighting. How this will affect the future of democracy in Ukraine remains to be seen."
 ukraine_relief.99.d2: "Some days ago representatives of VSZV and Protofis announced their withdrawal from the Relief Bill negotiations. It seems that recent government decisions were deemed by the VSZV and Protofis as going against initial agreements and promises. Several informal meetings between government officials and organisations' spokespersons didn't change the situation.\nCiting government unreliability and lack of constructive cooperation in the Soim as main reasons for the departure from negotiations, Protofis representatives expressed hope that a future post-election government will be more capable and open to partnership. Their votes were crucial for the Hetman Coalition, so now negotiations are essentially dead in the water."
 ukraine_relief.99.a: "The Soim had its chance. It is time for a more direct approach."

 ukraine_relief.100.t: "Vote On The Relief Bill"
 ukraine_relief.100.d: "The time has come! After months of horse-trading, pleas, threats and compromises we are finally here. The Soim financial committee has approved the Bill, and it is ready to be presented for voting. It is entirely possible that this day may decide the course of the entire crisis plaguing our nation. Now we can only wait for the results of the vote. And the Bill is..."
 ukraine_relief.100.a: "Voted down!"
 ukraine_relief.100.b: "Passed!"

 ukraine_relief.101.t: "Letter from VSZV and Protofis"
 ukraine_relief.101.d: "Though the Soim is jubilant from the recent passing of the relief bill, the same cannot be said for representatives of VSZV and Protofis. In a letter directed to the Otaman-Minister, Vasyl Kochubei, principal figure of the VSZV, expressed his great dismay with the direction of the government. After levying great criticism towards the Radical Democrats and certain Agrarian Democrats, he stated that the relief bill would only weaken the nation in the long term and that the protests will not be dealt with at the \"stroke of a pen, contrary to the crypto-syndicalist nonsense much of the Soim has peddled\".\n\nKochubei further warned that if the coalition continues on its current path, then political cooperation between the two will be out of the question. He emphasised that future collaboration will not be impossible, though it will be contingent upon the government revisiting its position."

 ukraine_revolt.1.d: "The discontent and misery has finally reached the breaking point. The Hetman's response that of brutality and indifference - it is clear that he must be overthrown for the situation to improve. In a night of violence and chaos, armed VDR militias attacked government buildings and military barracks, killing local politicians and freeing their imprisoned comrades.\n\nThe Directorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic has been declared by Symon Petliura and other VDR leaders in [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and they have demanded the Hetman to abdicate, allow free and democratic elections and redistribute land to the farmers. To support these demands, the VDR has started to organise the \"Ukrainian People's Army\", which has rapidly taken control over the western countryside as local peasant militias have joined it. Spreading like wildfire, the revolution is rapidly gathering support all across the country."

 ukraine_revolt.1.a: "We will crush this revolution."
 ukraine_revolt.1.b: "We will overthrow the Hetman!"

 ukraine_revolt.2.t: "Military in Chaos"
 ukraine_revolt.2.d: "Despite the conservative mentality of the Ukrainian armed forces, fostered by twenty years of political promotions, many soldiers have at least sympathies for the VDR. Mutinies are widespread, and anti-Hetman leaflets have been distributed in some units. Upper class officers have been arrested or lynched by the soldiers after receiving orders to fight the VDR's peasant militias. In the western countryside, some military units have disbanded entirely - either through mutiny or full-scale defection.\n\nThe bulk of the Ukrainian Army has been stationed in the east at the Russian border, far away from the centres of agitation. They are now being transferred to the west to bolster the government forces as Skoropadskyi's trump card. However, the road is long, and much of the railways are under militia control. If these reinforcements manage to arrive in the west, it will change the balance considerably."
 ukraine_revolt.2.a: "Prisovskyi's Eastern Army will save us."
 ukraine_revolt.2.b: "Ukrainian, shoot your slavemasters and join the revolution!"

 ukraine_revolt.3.t: "The Railway War"
 ukraine_revolt.3.d: "To move troops across the plains of Ukraine, a high-quality rail system has been built in the interwar years. However it has not been designed against a civil war. Large sections of the primary east-west railroad have been taken over by the rebels in regions where the closest garrisons are far away. In these places, the rails have been blocked or destroyed to stop the military from effectively deploying army units from the east to the west. Our cavalry formations and armoured trains can clear these obstacles, though it will delay reinforcements by weeks. It would help if we prioritised the railways over other targets."
 ukraine_revolt.3.a: "Clear the partisans, do not take risks."
 ukraine_revolt.3.b: "Dispatch the reinforcements."

 ukraine_revolt.4.t: "Rebels Cut Off [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]" # Brest
 ukraine_revolt.4.d: "The city of [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] became the first city to fall in rebel hands. There was little resistance, as most of the garrison had mutinied or even joined the VDR's peasant militias. The city's Jewish-Polish majority welcomed the republican forces with cheers. With the stronghold established, the main railway from [202.GetName] to [93.GetName] was cut. Not wasting any time, the People's Army started to advance to every direction.\n\nThe most critical situation is in [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as the city cannot be reinforced, and the countryside around it is quickly declaring its allegiance to the republican government. The commander is requesting permission to ask help from the Polish army right across the border, arguing that it is the only way to hold the city. It is true that the rebels would most likely avoid attacking foreign soldiers, in fear that it would give the Polish Army justification to support the Hetman. However, relying on foreign forces would be also a sign of weakness for the Hetman. The alternative option is to forbid them from such desperate pleads, and vaguely promise support as long as they hold the city."
 ukraine_revolt.4.a: "Message the Poles."
 ukraine_revolt.4.b: "We can deal with couple of peasants."

 ukraine_revolt.5.t: "Poles Save [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]" # Brest
 ukraine_revolt.5.d: "The clash between Ukrainian republican rebels and the garrison at [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] could have easily ended in a catastrophe for the Hetman's forces. However their request for support was answered by Poland's 5th Infantry Division stationed at [1088.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Based on the military alliance between the two countries, Polish forces entered the city and bolstered its defences to the point that rebels didn't dare to continue their assault, and instead retreated to rural [997.GetName], continuing to wage the partisan war from there."
 ukraine_revolt.5.a: "Unexpected, but welcome."

 ukraine_revolt.6.t: "[93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Surrendered!" # Brest
 ukraine_revolt.6.d: "[93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s orders were clear - to resist the rebels to the last bullet. It didn't take much to break the commander's spirit, though. Some of the garrison mutinied, saying that they would not shoot their countrymen. Combined with heavy public pressure from the population, he decided to order surrender, and lay down the weapons, as relief from [202.GetName] was obviously not arriving any time soon."
 ukraine_revolt.6.a: "Sad!"

 ukraine_revolt.7.t: "Disunity in the VDR"
 ukraine_revolt.7.d: "The liberal URDP are an outlier in the VDR by siding with the largely socialist parties, and in the past they have often allied with the Hetmanate. It is clear that they have been driven into this radical position by constant failures and authoritarianism of the Hetman's regime - but it's also a relationship that could be fixed.\n\nThey have accepted to take part in secret negotiations with us, being promised important government positions and increased electoral freedoms after the unrest has died down. There were additional agreements on not persecuting URDP members or other moderates for taking part in the rebellion. After these concessions the URDP has started to urge their supporters to work for more \"peaceful solutions\", and refrain from further violence except for defence. If we can sever even more support from the VDR, perhaps the movement will start to crumble."
 ukraine_revolt.7.a: "It's a start."

 ukraine_revolt.8.t: "Divide et Impera"
 ukraine_revolt.8.d: "The VDR is a big-tent organisation united only in their desire to overthrow the Hetman. It is possible to appeal to the more moderate wing, and try to sow disunity among our enemies. In particular, the social-democratic USDRP has never been fond of violence, always preferring a more legalistic route over violent revolution. By offering them an olive branch publicly, we might get them back in the negotiation table, or the very least hurt the VDR's unity.\n\nDoroshenko's radio address made sure to downplay Skoropadskyi and gave a clear message that he was really in control of the Hetman's government, and was willing to continue negotiations. He assured that all summary executions and gross mistreatment of VDR prisoners will be punishable by the court-martial. The VDR fighters who stand down would not be persecuted from merely taking part in the rebellion, and grand promises of liberalisation were also made. He also expected the VDR to avoid \"over-reactions\" if it truly is committed to civilised values. While such demands only met ridicule in the more revolutionary parts of the VDR, they have swayed many supporters of the USDRP, and caused them to call for restraint, which has calmed down the situation in some regions."
 ukraine_revolt.8.a: "Good to see them listen to reason."

 ukraine_revolt.9.t: "Splintering of the VDR"
 ukraine_revolt.9.d: "After their recent military setbacks, guilt-passing has started in the VDR's central committee. The socialists are blaming the URDP and USDRP for having a passive and defensive mindset, but these accusations have only broadened the gap between the moderates and the radicals. Much of the VDR's power base comes from the popularity of these two parties, and their contacts within Galicia, which has helped to fund the movement. They argued that the past events have proved the futility of revolution, and that the VDR needs to negotiate before they are crushed entirely.\n\nThis \"defeatism\" enraged the Borotbysts and other far-left members, who vowed to fight to the end, even if the class collaborators betrayed their cause. The communist forces even started to disarm units loyal to the USDRP in some of their strongholds, and adopted hostile rhetoric towards their former revolutionary comrades. After a few days, the VDR has practically split into two factions, and much of its military strength is paralysed because of the lack of leadership. The URDP and USDRP have already sent peace probes to [202.GetName]."
 ukraine_revolt.9.a: "Is this the beginning of the end?"

 ukraine_revolt.10.t: "Prisovskyi's Decree"
 ukraine_revolt.10.d: "Across various cities, agents of the military police have began arresting suspected VDR sympathisers, their fates yet unknown. General Prisovskyi has given a proclamation via radio and declared that all \"socialist traitors\" will be destroyed with any means necessary and those wishing to avert death should turn themselves in. It is clear that the Hetman has chosen brute force, and brute force only. While it has empowered the military greatly, politically it has backfired. More moderate politicians from the Hetman's coalition have voiced loud disagreements with this course of action - and outside many more are flocking to the VDR banner."
 ukraine_revolt.10.a: "Drastic but necessary."

 ukraine_revolt.11.t: "Traitors in the Ranks?"
 ukraine_revolt.11.d: "We have been informed that some of our more moderate allies from the URDP and even USDRP have been conducting secret talks with the Doroshenko government. It seems that he is trying to sow disunity to our front by seducing our less revolutionary-minded allies to return to the negotiation table. While them actually turning tables on us is improbable, if they are persuaded to passivity it could hinder our revolution greatly.\n\nCurrently, only a small circle knows of these negotiations, so the cards still remain in our hands. We could either publicly reveal what has happened, and thoroughly discredit these traitors - which might be very dangerous to them, but serve as an example to anyone else - or we could keep this under the table and privately reassure these would-be traitors, and do out best to win them over."
 ukraine_revolt.11.a: "Out these traitors."
 ukraine_revolt.11.b: "Keep the matter secret."

 ukraine_revolt.12.t: "Berlin Demands Answers"
 ukraine_revolt.12.d: "The German ambassador in [202.GetName] met with the Hetman today and demanded a clear answer to be relayed to Berlin: are Ukraine's police and army able to handle the situation? There have already been calls for intervention from the German military and the right wing, and now they demand assurances - or official request for aid. As the situation on the ground is still very confusing, it's hard to say if what's going on is only sporadic peasant revolts or the beginning of a proper civil war."
 ukraine_revolt.12.a: "We'll call you if we need you!"
 ukraine_revolt.12.b: "I assure you that everything is under control!"
 UKR_very_important_tt: "§CThis is fine.§!"

 ukraine_revolt.13.t: "Bombing of Sarny"
 ukraine_revolt.13.d: "The so-called \"rebellion\" has seen its most terrifying day today, as 127 people perished in a bombing raid ordered by the Hetman's government. In two waves, German-built Dornier Do 123's dropped multiple tons of ordnance in the southern part of the city, which reportedly hosted the regional headquarters of the People's Army. In addition, the town lies along the important east-west railway used by the rebels, which was used to justify the train station of Sarny as a military target. As the news spread, the rift between Ukrainians grow ever larger, and even among the SHD the bombing raid has been criticised for poor planning and accuracy."
 ukraine_revolt.13.a: "That'll make them rethink their pointless revolution."
 ukraine_revolt.13.b: "A sad day for Ukraine..."

 ukraine_revolt.15.t: "The All-Ukrainian Democratic Movement"
 ukraine_revolt.15.d: "Like the Kingdom of Poland, the Hetmanate of Ukraine is a reminder of our geopolitical designs Germany robbed from us. The Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen fought valiantly as part of our armies in the Weltkrieg, but their democratic republic was quickly cast away by the German military and their lackey, Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Ever since, remnants of Ukrainian republicans, directed by ex-Secretary General of Military Affairs Symon Petliura, have been based in Lviv. Despite demands of extradition, we have given the republicans safe harbour - after all, they are citizens of the Dual Monarchy and are allowed to organise whatever associations they want to. The Austro-Ukrainian Friendship Association, chaired by Archduke Vasyl von Habsburg, has been a vocal supporter of a more democratic Ukraine.\n\nIn the aftermath of the economic crisis and worsening Hetmanite oppression, democratic forces in Ukraine have banded together and formed the All-Ukrainian Democratic Movement, the VDR. They are currently engaged in mass protests and even armed resistance to the Hetman's forces, and officially we cannot support them... but we also do not need to hinder them. The Crownland of Lodomeria has become their power base and through there, they have been smuggling equipment, men and directing funds to the VDR-held countryside on the Ukrainian side of the border. As the local administration in Lodomeria is more or less sympathetic towards their aims, nothing is done to stop it."
 ukraine_revolt.15.a: "Ensure that the Ukrainians are not hindered."
 ukraine_revolt.15.b: "We cannot be seen tolerating this kind of revolutionary activities."
 UKR_VDR_future_tt: "If the republicans manage to overthrow the Hetman, they will be grateful to us."

 ukraine_revolt.16.t: "The Brody Road"
 ukraine_revolt.16.d: "Our intelligence services have identified a major republican supply route, running from Lviv and Brody on the Galicia-Lodomerian side to Dubno and Rivne on our side. Through this route, men and equipment have been transported to the Ukrainian side by rebel-friendly organisations in the Austrian side, apparently thanks to friendly or incompetent border guards. Our own border controls have caught some amount of these smugglers, but without cooperation of the Austrian side it is very hard to put a stop to this. Who needs enemies when we have friends like these?"
 ukraine_revolt.16.a: "Issue diplomatic protest and station more forces on the border."
 ukraine_revolt.16.b: "Just protest, we cannot spare forces there."

 ukraine_revolt.17.t: "The Army Closes Galician Border"
 ukraine_revolt.17.d: "The Hetmanite forces in the border with Austria have been greatly reinforced by men from the remaining western garrisons, dedicated to stop the flow of the VDR volunteers from the Galician side of the border. Our friends in the Lviv side have started to search for alternative routes, such as through Poland or Romania, but until those are organised properly, we must survive without external aid. Some in the VDR's military leadership even welcomed this development as potentially beneficial to us, as the transfer of forces means less opposition in Inner Ukraine."
 ukraine_revolt.17.a: "Damn."

 ukraine_revolt.18.t: "Ukraine Issues Diplomatic Protest"
 ukraine_revolt.18.d: "The Ukrainian foreign ministry has sent us a strongly-worded note, demanding us to explain the \"border irregularities\" especially around border towns of Brody and Radekhiv. According to Ukrainian intelligence reports, our border guards have failed to stop widespread criminal smuggling operations supporting terrorism in Ukrainian State. The note is demanding us to immediately take action to alleviate the issues and issue condemnation of the illegalities of the All-Ukrainian Democratic Movement."
 ukraine_revolt.18.a: "Make vague promises, but do nothing."
 ukraine_revolt.18.b: "Fine, we'll start the investigation."

 ukraine_revolt.20.t: "The [192.GetName] Commune" #Odesa
 ukraine_revolt.20.d: "[192.GetName], the second largest city in Ukraine, had already been paralysed by dockworkers' strikes for weeks. The strikers had erected barricades to central roads and the Borotbyst-organised guards had essentially fortified the port of [192.GetName], and were in tense negotiations with the city officials loyal to [202.GetName].\n\nWhen the news of open rebellion in the north arrived to the city, all hell broke loose. The Borotbysts wanted immediate revolution and total seizure of the city; their more moderate allies still believed that the Hetman would give up to the pressure. This changed when a mutiny broke out onboard of the destroyer Berestia, which promptly opened fire on army checkpoints erected around the harbour. Only hours later the Borotbysts had seized control of much of the city's infrastructure, such as the radio station and the northern routes into the city. The Workers' Commune of [192.GetName] was declared by the local leader of the uprising, Oleksandr Khmelnytskyi, in a grey area between not being officially aligned to VDR, but fighting against the Hetman's forces regardless."

 ukraine_revolt.21.d: "Encouraged by the uprising in [192.GetName], the workers' councils of Mykolaiv have demanded that city's police stands down and hand the city to the revolutionaries, or a violent uprising will start. There is an infantry brigade stationed in the city, which has kept order until now. They have requested reinforcements after the ultimatum, fearing that the Borotbyst Guards of [192.GetName] will advance to Mykolaiv and help the locals to take the city.\n\nOur politically reliable forces are stretched thin, though the best force we could send there would be the 1st Naval Infantry Regiment from [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They are the only reserve in the region before additional forces arrive from the east. It might be better to evacuate the city for now, and save our forces for the counter-attack."

 ukraine_revolt.22.t: "Siege of Mykolaiv" #Mykolaiv
 ukraine_revolt.22.d: "Reinforced by the naval infantry, the city of Mykolaiv has been fortified well against the rebels. Rebel sympathisers in the city have been attacking our troops infrequently, but they have not dared to start an open uprising. The VDR units from [192.GetName] and the north have arrived to block routes out of the city, but their incursions have been fought back successfully.\n\nThis is thanks to the superior quality of our troops, and most of all, the heavy guns of our naval ships, which have been anchored some miles away from the port to act as mobile artillery platforms, kept away from the rebels. The city has been cut off from every direction except the sea, but it should stand as the rebel forces have focused their attention to other directions."
 ukraine_revolt.22.a: "The city will survive!"

 ukraine_revolt.29.t: "End of [192.GetName] Commune" #Odesa
 ukraine_revolt.29.d: "The rout of the People's Army in the north left the republicans with only one significant stronghold, [192.GetName]. De facto controlled by the Borotbyst-dominated Worker's Committee, the massive city has been fortified to withstand any assault. Spirits are kept up by broadcasts promising that the Internationale in the west will come to aid of the Ukrainians. As the Hetman's and Kaiser's forces advance south, crushing smaller rebel-held positions, that spirit is slowly fading.\n\nIn the final, bloody chapter of the rebellion, the \"Pearl by the Sea\" was assaulted from all directions. The defenders, bolstered by fighters who had retreated from the north, fought street by street, knowing that their fallen comrades in the north had not received mercy from the Hetman either. After the first assaults were repelled, artillery bombardment began. Massive 305 mm shells of the battleship Volia rained on the defenders, destroying much of the northern districts. The famous neo-baroque opera house, turned into an emergency hospital, caught fire. Finally, after days of fighting, the resistance collapsed. Some of the Borotbyst fighters fled to the city's catacombs. Those who tried to escape by sea were sunk. As the red flag was lowered from the Pototskyi Palace, the final stronghold of the Ukrainian revolutionaries was lost."

 ukraine_revolt.30.d: "Our scouts in the eastern side of the Dnipro located a large concentration of loyalist forces, marching towards [203.GetName]. Taken from the eastern border, these divisions form the main part of Skoropadskyi's loyalists, and have finally managed to start their counter-attack even though our guerilla campaigns slowed them down. In pamphlets dropped to the region, this so-called \"Prisovskyi's Counter-Offensive\" is promised to crush the rebel forces and return stability and order to the country.\n\nWe have some units in the area, especially around [203.GetName], but our local commanders are unsure what to do. They are greatly outnumbered and outgunned. Many are suggesting to retreat, and focus on waging a guerilla war rather than risking our inferior forces in open battle. However another plan was proposed by certain young captain, who argued that concentrating our forces in the town of Kaniv - one of the best bridges over the Dnipro - would both force the Hetman's forces to attack us over the river, but also threaten their flank if they decide to cross the river from somewhere else. With such an imbalance in numbers, this wouldn't win the battle, but it could cause great casualties."

 ukraine_revolt.31.d: "General Prisovskyi took the bait. When his troops detected the buildup at Kaniv, they decided to move in, seeking to defeat the rebels on the battlefield, even from a disadvantageous position. The town has been fortified, and our meagre artillery is stationed on the other side of Dnipro, with forwards observers controlling the battlefield from the Chernecha Hora.\n\nWith such well-planned defences, the first assaults by Prisovskyi's forces failed. The riverside became a bloody graveyard; only when our artillery ran out of shells did our defence started to crumble. We could try to retreat, hopefully having bought time for our forces westward to organise defences - or we could take our last stand and fight there until there's no fight left in us."

We still do not have reliable numbers to fight fairly, but we cannot retreat endlessly.\n\nNorthern forces under General Oleksandr Udovychenko have been bolstered and are ready to act, but their chances in open combat are risky. In the south there are sizeable forces under Yurii Tiutiunnyk, but they have been planning to instead advance towards [226.GetName] as the Hetman's forces are busy north. There's even rumours that they hope for Udovychenko's defeat to decisively shift internal balance in the VDR to favour the radicals. Convincing them to join would require some diplomacy, but would make victory much more certain. Alternatively, we could try an indirect approach, and just aim to encircle Prisovskyi's forces and cause death by a thousand cuts - but this kind of complex guerilla operation requires flawless coordination and directing all of our veteran troops to [198.GetName] front."

With their better training and equipment, our militias were pinned down and destroyed with artillery barrages and aggressive offensives by Cossack troops. General Udovychenko managed to save part of our forces, but the battle remains a decisive defeat."

 ukraine_revolt.34.d: "The main loyalist force was headquartered in Zhashkiv when we started our advance, defeating their rearguard protecting the supply lines. Avoiding direct engagement, Prisovskyi's units were worn down with small attacks until demoralisation started to take hold. Though some larger battles happened, particularly on the northern flank, the Hetman's forces quickly lost cohesion as they realised they were stuck.\n\nSome units resisted for days more, while others started surrendering quickly. In the final battles the leftovers tried to break out back to the east, but most of them were unable to escape. This victory proved that we are able to go toe-to-toe against the Hetman's forces, and news of it have greatly demoralised our enemy."

 ukraine_revolt.40.d: "The People's Army is at the gates of the capital. [202.GetName] has been under martial law for weeks now, and strikes there have been suppressed bloodily. Many of the rebels early in the uprising fled the city, but they have now linked up with the First Corps of the People's Army, commanded by Oleksandr Udovychenko, with a bold plan to seize the capital and capture the Hetman, ending the revolution before foreign reactionary powers can act.\n\n[202.GetName] is a formidable target. Its barricaded streets will make advance slow and bloody, and the sheer size of the city will give the defenders room to play for time. Thanks to many supporters within the city, we have good intel on our enemy. General Leonid Stupnytskyi, commander of the [202.GetName] garrison, is politically reliable but a rather underwhelming military mind. His forces are stretched out, weakened by defections and mutinies; not to mention there is great hostility from the population. They have plenty of heavy weaponry, and have fortified the city centre and the bridges over Dnipro heavily.\n\nIt could be possible to take the garrison by surprise, and trust that the overstretched pro-Hetman forces will collapse with a sufficiently bold strike straight into the heart of the city. However, if the thrust fails and gets bogged down, Stupnytskyi's men will gain the upper hand. A more ambitious plan would be a flanking manoeuvre, where we advance through the city suburbs to the Dnipro, and advance on the city centre from three directions. Pulling off such a sophisticated manoeuvre with our largely improvised organisation and lacking radio equipment will be dangerous - but if we succeed, that might be the end of the Skoropadskyi's regime."

Our forces managed to penetrate deep in the city with the cover of darkness, and with superior local numbers, break through Beresteiska Avenue's barricades. The defenders were too thinly spread, and when they tried to reinforce the southern districts our forces were almost at the city centre. General Stupnytskyi managed to escape with sheer luck and moved his headquarters to the other side of Dnipro.\n\nSkoropadskyi and his ministers had fled earlier, heading north. The city's artillery was captured, and soon the disorganised pro-government forces were surrendering en masse, with contact to the commander cut. The capture of [202.GetName] effectively means victory of the rebellion - it is both the lynchpin of the army's logistics and communications, and has tremendous propaganda value."
 ukraine_revolt.41.d.failure: "The bold plan was a good attempt. Our forces managed to penetrate deep in the city with the cover of darkness, and with superior local numbers break through Beresteiska Avenue's barricades.\n\nYet the enemy reserves were faster and more numerous than we expected, and the assault got bogged down on most fronts. Faced with the choice between engaging in a battle of attrition without proper artillery support, and retreating, the general of our forces Oleksandr Udovychenko chose to preserve our mobility and pulled out from the city. Catastrophe was averted, but our losses had been significant."
 ukraine_revolt.41.a: "Long live the republic!"
 ukraine_revolt.41.b: "Merely a setback."

 ukraine_revolt.42.t: "Counterattack at Myshalovka"
 ukraine_revolt.42.d: "The Dnipro was reached in the north in Vyshhorod, which was only lightly defended. In the south, our forces attempted to take the undermanned fortress of Lysa Hora by surprise - the artillery positions on the hill control the approach to the city from the south. The plan failed as a strong cavalry unit hit our southern flank through the woods south of the Myshalovka residential district. The southern pincer never reached the river, and panicked calls for aid were sent to our main forces west of the city."
 ukraine_revolt.42.a: "Stick to the plan, and reinforce them."
 ukraine_revolt.42.b: "Their sacrifice will be remembered. Attack the city now!"

 ukraine_revolt.43.t: "Battle of [202.GetName]"
 ukraine_revolt.43.d.success: "The improvised plan worked. Many of the defenders were too focused on the battle in the south around Lysa Hora. The sheer strength and speed of our northern and western attacks surprised thinly-spread defenders, who were cut off and forced to surrender in many places. When the pro-Hetman troops south of the city reacted, it was already too late. General Stupnytskyi managed to escape with sheer luck, and moved his headquarters to the other side of Dnipro.\n\nSkoropadskyi and his ministers had fled earlier, heading north. The city's artillery was captured, and the southern counterattack was driven away at great cost. The capture of [202.GetName] effectively means victory of the rebellion - it is both the lynchpin of the army's logistics and communications, and has tremendous propaganda value."
 ukraine_revolt.43.d.failure: "The improvised plan did not work. Much of the defenders were focused on the battle in the south, around Lysa Hora, but we were too thinly spread. Despite initial advance deep into the city, we never managed to create a complete breakthrough. Our southern group was annihilated under the attack by pro-Hetman Cossack units, which then quickly hit our flank. A quick retreat saved us from total collapse, but the cost in lives was significant."
 ukraine_revolt.43.a: "Long live the republic!"
 ukraine_revolt.43.b: "Merely a setback."

 ukraine_revolt.44.t: "Southern Pincer Collapses"
 ukraine_revolt.44.d: "Two battalions were hastily sent to aid our southern pincer between Myshalovka and Lysa Hora. They could barely stabilise the situation, as more and more reinforcements arrived from the south. Completely unable to push towards the river, as the plan had been, the southern group requested the operation to be stopped.\n\nThe response was irrelevant - the next attack of the Hetman's forces completely routed the southern group, and hit our main force with such strength it almost caused widespread panic. A fighting retreat was called to spare the best units of the People's Army from annihilation."
 ukraine_revolt.44.a: "Catastrophic!"

 ukraine_revolt.45.t: "Encircled [202.GetName]"
 ukraine_revolt.45.d: "The republican forces have cut off all roads to [202.GetName]. The city garrison still stands strong, with respectable amount of artillery, but it is hopelessly thinly spread over the massive city. Skoropadskyi has left the city; General Leonid Stupnytskyi has been tasked with defending \"fortress [202.GetName]\" until pro-Hetman and German forces would arrive to relieve the defenders. This hope is in vain, though. Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's Cossack units have been trying to advance towards [202.GetName], but they have been bogged down by constant guerilla attacks in the southeastern side of the city.\n\nWhen the general [202.GetName] offensive of the People's Army began, it was clear that the city would not hold. Resistance was brave, and in places pro-Hetman units kept positions against overwhelming numbers, but they were simply too few, and could not hold everything. By dusk, guns were mostly silent. Capture of the city effectively means victory of the rebellion - it is both the lynchpin of the army's logistics and communications, and has tremendous propaganda value."

 ukraine_revolt.46.d.success: "The rebel army, commanded by Oleksandr Udovychenko, is at the gates of the capital. The rebels have a bold plan to seize the capital and capture the Hetman, ending the revolution before foreign powers can act. Our positions in [202.GetName] are strong - its barricaded streets will make advance slow and bloody, and the sheer size of the city will give the defenders room to play for time. General Leonid Stupnytskyi, commander of the [202.GetName] garrison, is politically reliable and popular among his men.\n\nThere were some dangerous moments, but our forces managed to keep the rebels at bay. With our superior equipment and training, the rebels could not hope to break through in a fair fight, and were forced to retreat after suffering significant casualties."

The rebel plan was sophisticated - they focused on surrounding the city, and before we could rearrange our forces, they struck. The advance was stalled in the south, but after brave resistance in the north our forces collapsed and were outmanoeuvred and cut off by the rebels. It was already too late when Stupnytskyi ordered retreat to the city centre. The brave defenders were encircled and slaughtered, and the city fell to the rebels. And with it, Skoropadskyi's reign came to an end."

 ukraine_revolt.50.t: "Panzers Cross the Border"
 ukraine_revolt.50.d: "On [GetDateText], the first units of the German army crossed our western border, accompanied by a Polish division and small contingents of Lithuanian and Belarusian forces. The Hetman has legitimised this invasion of Ukraine by formally requesting aid against the revolutionaries. Skoropadskyi's gamble to play for time has paid off, as he still holds [202.GetName] and his army has not disintegrated as the rebels hoped.\n\nUnits of the People's Army in West Ukraine were quickly smashed through by numerically and materially superior German-led units. Most of them dispersed to the countryside, having lost much of the heavy equipment they had captured from the army supply depots. Several battalions managed to stop the advance to the River Styr for a day, but had to retreat after running out of artillery shells. Simultaneously, forces loyal to Skoropadskyi, many freshly transferred from the Russian border, began their own offensive. The People's Army disintegrated between the hammer and anvil, and was left only with control of some southern regions, and a large amount of the more distant countryside.\n\nDespite Skoropadskyi downplaying the importance of the German troops, it's clear to both his allies and enemies that he has never seemed more like the Kaiser's puppet, as victorious German forces march through the capital."
 ukraine_revolt.50.a: "Another Ukrainian revolution has been extinguished by the Prussian boot."

 ukraine_revolt.51.t: "The Guns Fall Silent"
 ukraine_revolt.51.d: "In the waning hours of the evening representatives of the government, still barricaded in pockets of Eastern [202.GetName], met Symon Petliura on the historic Mykolaivskyi Bridge to sign a ceasefire bringing the revolt to an end.\n\nDuring the chaos, Hetman Skoropadskyi evacuated himself and his family to a small airfield just outside the city protected by the men from Serdiuk Guard Division. Declaring his abdication to the cabinet, he then made a brief, historic address on the radio to the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"I, the Hetman of all Ukraine, for eighteen and a half years put all my strength into bringing the country out of the difficult state it was in. God did not give me the strength to cope with this task. Now, in view of the conditions that have developed, guided exclusively by the good of Ukraine, I am resigning from power.\"\n\nThe Otaman-Minister has assumed the reins of government but made clear his intentions to immediately start negotiations with the victorious VDR after being informed by the high command that any further fighting would be futile.\n\nAs the dust settled, the rebels and the soldiers laid down their arms. What was once a fantasy of dreamers and dissidents had become reality; Ukraine would bask in liberty once more."
 ukraine_revolt.51.a: "Shche ne vmerla Ukraina, I slava, i volia!"

 ukraine_revolt.52.t: "The Guns Fall Silent"
 ukraine_revolt.52.d: "The revolutionary army has been shattered and driven to the underground. Much of the leadership has been arrested and shot, though the main part of the VDR leadership escaped successfully. Their whereabouts are unknown, but the Hetman assured that they will be found and brought to justice for \"plotting with foreign powers to destroy the Ukrainian nation.\" However, pardons would be available for any former rebels, as long as they helped the law enforcement to identify those who have not yet surrendered.\n\nWhat's left of the rebels have retreated to remote parts in western and northern Ukraine, where villages still friendly to the republican cause have hidden and supplied them. The army will be tasked with pacifying these regions, and rooting out the remaining guerillas as fast as possible."
 ukraine_revolt.52.d2: "The revolutionary army had retreated all the way to [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] where the most dedicated republican fighters barricaded the city in a hopeless last attempt to continue the uprising. Their efforts were futile, however, as they were outmanned and outgunned, and their positions did not last long as pro-Hetman forces entered the city. In the waning hours of the evening representatives of the Hetman's government, led by Otaman-Minister Dmytro Doroshenko, met republican leader Maksym Slavynskyi near the monument of Taras Shevchenko. There, Slavynskyi signed a ceasefire, officially bringing the fighting to an end. The rest of the republican leadership have fled across the border to unknown locations, but most of the people's army have laid down their arms as the dust settled. The army will be tasked with pacifying the remaining holdouts while the peace is finalised."
 ukraine_revolt.52.a: "Stability at last."

 ukraine_revolt.53.t: "Increasing SHD Influence"
 ukraine_revolt.53.d: "The past few weeks of the revolt have seen great empowerment of the military. While the Soim and the Otaman-Minister have offered various opinions to the Hetman on how to deal with the republican traitors, they have often been ignored or sidelined in favour of figures from the military and the SHD.\nThe executive office has seen increased visits from the latter's most prominent men such as Borys Homzyn and Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, while the Soim increasingly seems to become weaker and weaker. There is little doubt that these actions will have grave consequences for democracy in the long term..."
 ukraine_revolt.53.a: "I see..."

 ukraine_revolt.54.t: "Volunteers from [BLR.GetNameDef]"
 ukraine_revolt.54.d: "So far, our forces have had few foreign backers. While the German Empire officially retains a military alliance with Ukraine it has been acknowledged in Berlin that, should the republican cause claim victory over Skoropadskyi, the new government would be recognised in favour of the Hetman's. Nonetheless, this has not stopped other countries aligned to Germany - especially Poland, whose republican movement has gained significant traction, from sending small amounts of volunteers and equipment to the Hetman. Furthermore, though Austria seems sympathetic to our cause, they have for the most part refrained from sending any direct aid as to keep decent relations with Germany and not alienate the Hetman should he prove victorious.\n\nBut in a landscape of doubt and scepticism, one country to our north has been a bastion of light: the Belarusian People's Republic. Though their leadership has not made any comments or attempted to directly support our cause, small numbers of Belarusian volunteers, committed to the same democratic and republican ideals that we champion, have crossed the border to join our side. The government in Minsk has seemingly let these volunteers cross almost unnoticed, while forces from other Reichspakt countries have been monitored and restricted due to the military alliance with the Hetman's government. Though their ranks are small and will likely not make a significant difference on the battlefield, their addition has been a great morale boost to our army, showing that we are not alone in fighting the forces of tyranny and oppression."

 ukraine_revolt.99.t: "Remains of the Rebels"
 ukraine_revolt.99.d: "After the surrender of majority of VDR forces, the remaining radicals have splintered into various cells with no proper central organisation. There are still peasant rebels loyal to Petliura's cause, but the more left-wing groups have separated and adopted means of revolutionary terrorism.\n\nThe police and the army have been combing through the countryside to fry out the remaining rebels, but the work is slow and casualties are common. Especially hated are the bombings - good old Social-Revolutionary tradition already from the Tsarist times - of military officials, which often result in other casualties too. Sentences are harsh, too, as most rebels at this point will face execution - sometimes even without a trial, allegedly having \"died in a shootout while resisting arrest.\""
 ukraine_revolt.99.a: "What a tragedy."

 ukraine_revolt.103.t: "An Officer Like No Other"
 ukraine_revolt.103.d: "With our military forces quickly mopping up what remains of the VDR in [199.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] our troops have made an unlikely discovery. Besieging a small country house, long abandoned by its owners, and being used as a command centre for the rebels in the region, our troops were met with fierce resistance and after a long battle were finally able to force a surrender.\n\nWhen the guns fell silent, a familiar looking figure emerged from the house proclaiming himself to be the commanding officer present and asking for his men to be given amnesty while taking responsibility for the incident. Despite initial shock at first it became apparent that the officer was none other than self-proclaimed King of Ukraine, Archduke Wilhelm, better known as Vasyl Vyshyvanyi.\n\nAfter being arrested and sent to the nearest camp for questioning Wilhelm was put through interrogation and demanded to confess that he was present to further Austro-Polish interests in the Hetmanate. The Archduke, however, is adamant he came on his own accord and fought for no one other than the people of Ukraine. It is rumoured that his extraordinary testimony as well as tales of his prior exploits during the Weltkrieg have swayed some soldiers but the government is adamant he be treated like any other prisoner. Plans are already being drawn up to move him to a more secure prison in the capital though no doubt he'll be back in Lemberg within the week."

 ukraine_revolt.104.t: "The Austrians Petition For Wilhelm's Release"
 ukraine_revolt.104.d: "Word has come in from our ambassador in Vienna that Austria has petitioned for Wilhelm's immediate release. The Austrian ambassador in [202.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has passed on a telegram from the Austrian government explaining that Wilhelm's extraordinary appearance in our territories was due to his \"yacht losing course on the Dnipro\" and simply searching for assistance, ironically a direct contradiction of his own account.\n\nIt was further noted that the Austrian government allegedly had no knowledge of his presence and have continued to deny the presence of any Austrian subjects in Ukraine. While their word is hollow, its the best we can get for now."
 ukraine_revolt.104.a: "As expected."

 ukraine_revolt.105.t: "The Red Prince Escapes!"
 ukraine_revolt.105.d: "In the middle of the night, some of the remaining rebels in the region attacked the military base where Archduke Wilhelm was being held. During the chaos of the attack, Wilhelm was able to escape from his confinement and has now disappeared into the countryside, likely already on his way to Galicia. While officially it is the rebel attack that gave him his chance to escape, it is alleged that his jailers and some of the defending soldiers made no attempt to stop him, perhaps some may have even aided in his escape.\n\nDue to the ambiguous nature of what happened it is likely we will never truly know what happened. Wherever he is now, this will no doubt become another chapter in the story of his foreign adventures and his legacy shall no doubt endure."

 ukraine_revolt.106.d: "After being detained in military custody following his capture in [199.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Archduke Wilhelm has been officially returned from the Ukrainian state. After arriving by train in Lemberg, the Archduke was greeted by a massive crowd of cheering Ukrainians that had poured in from the surrounding countryside. Speaking with the press he refused to comment extensively on his whereabouts. While it may not be a hero's welcome, his story will go down in history."

 ukraine_revolt.107.d: "After being detained in military custody following his capture in [199.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Vasyl was able to escape during an attack by the rebels and made his way to the Galician border with the Ukrainian border guards made no attempt to stop him crossing. While still a wanted fugitive in Ukraine, the Hetmanate's ambassador in Vienna has been informed that no man by the name of Archduke Wilhelm had any involvement in the rebellion but that the arrest warrant stood for one \"Vasyl Vyshyvanyi\"."
 ukraine_revolt.107.a: "Welcome home Vasyl!"

 ukraine_revolt.108.t: "Of Vacationers and Archdukes"
 ukraine_revolt.108.d: "The Foreign Ministry on Ballhausplatz recently received an angry call from the Ukrainian embassy: A large number of Austrian citizens have crossed the border in the last couple of weeks, which the ambassador claims is related to recent troubles in Volhynia. More importantly, he also claims that one of these \"vacationers\" is none-other than Archduke Wilhelm. The Ministry gave a fairly-underwhelming response: They would seal the border if the Ukrainian government formally requested it (an indirect admission of a deep crisis in Ukraine) and ensure the Archduke would stay in Austria.\n\nWhat the ambassador didn't know was just how deep the rabbit hole of Austrian involvement went. The War Ministry had recently been granting generous leave to Galician servicemen, while Ukraine's own consul in Lemberg had helped the Evidenzbureau with visas and intelligence.\n\nLater today, the Emperor himself would report that his kinsman was last seen yachting in Lošinj in the Adriatic, knowing full-well the Archduke's car had already crossed into Ukraine, driven by a certain \"Vasyl Vyshyvanyi\" days before the official request."

 ukraine_revolt.109.d: "With the Black Monday economic crisis ripping through the world, disorder has been rife in the Oststaaten. This situation has been particularly harsh on the Ukrainian State, with the country's agrarian economy buckling under its own weight. With the country already a tinderbox, it has now erupted into a civil war with our one-time ally Symon Petliura and his republican coalition leading an insurgency in the West.\n\nThe Ukrainian ambassador in Berlin has assured us that the situation is under control and this will not compromise the position of the Ostwall or the Ukrainian political situation.

Now it seems that the future of the Hetmanate is secured with news that the Republican forces have been driven out of the country, barring a few small pockets of resistance scattered throughout the western portion of the state.\n\nIn the wake of the revolt, the Hetman's government has continued its conservative course under the ruling \"Hetman's Coalition\", but it is expected that the upcoming elections will be a pivotal point, one that may shake up Ukrainian politics greatly."

 #Negotiations with VDR
 ukraine_negotiations.1.t: "Negotiations with the URDP"
 ukraine_negotiations.1.d: "The nation stands on the brink of chaos. The Hetman's attitude is clear - if the Soim cannot defuse the situation, it will be sidelined. Guns will be drawn, and people, perhaps even Ukrainian democracy itself, will die. Understanding all this, Otaman-Minister Doroshenko has gathered a group of his most trusted men and started negotiations to solve the first problem: unity of the Soim itself.\n\nCurrently, the URDP seems to be at least understanding towards the VDR, bordering open sympathy. It is understandable - they have failed to pass their policies under Skoropadskyi's watch. To get their backing, that must change. In tense negotiations between Doroshenko and Shulhyn, a hard bargain was struck: democratic reforms, anti-corruption measures, all in exchange for the URDP's support - and more importantly, for them to act as mediators between Doroshenko's government and the VDR. Now strengthened with an overwhelming majority in the Soim, the government could start working towards an understanding with the socialist opposition."
 ukraine_negotiations.1.a: "A peaceful solution may yet be possible."

 ukraine_negotiations.2.t: "Conflict within the Coalition"
 ukraine_negotiations.2.d: "Doroshenko's optimistic plans have not been received well by the right wing. Borys Homzyn accused the Otaman-Minister of worsening the crisis by not acting decisively and harshly. The SHD and parts of the military proposed to the government to strike now, and ignore stalling attempts by the liberals, which only give the socialists time to organise. Mass arrests and raids on known VDR safehouses could decapitate the beast with one swift strike - if only the Otaman-Minister was not so weak and indecisive, they argue. The final decision lays in the hands of the Hetman."
 ukraine_negotiations.2.a: "Find a peaceful solution."
 ukraine_negotiations.2.b: "Strike while the iron is hot."

 ukraine_negotiations.3.t: "Pre-emptive Strike"
 ukraine_negotiations.3.d: "In the dead of night, our troops have attacked various VDR safehouses in some of the major western cities. Regional mass arrests have been conducted, and people suspected of treasonous activities have been taken into police custody. Our agents inside the VDR claim that the strike has all but destroyed VDR's organisation in various regions, and that the rest will be merely mopping up the remains. However, the less optimistic members within the Coalition are sceptical whether the VDR will be defeated so easily, and if the intel is accurate."
 ukraine_negotiations.3.a: "Great news?"

 ukraine_negotiations.4.t: "An Invitation to the VDR"
 ukraine_negotiations.4.d: "Having received a green light from the Hetman, Otaman-Minister Doroshenko has proposed the opening of negotiations to the VDR leadership, with messages being relayed through the head of the URDP faction in the Soim Andrii Nikovskyi. If the republicans - and Symon Petliura specifically - agree, there might even be a peaceful end to the protests."
 ukraine_negotiations.4.a: "Hopefully they see reason."

 ukraine_negotiations.6.t: "The VDR Agrees!"
 ukraine_negotiations.6.d: "Good news has reached the Soim! Doroshenko's gamble has paid off, and the leadership of the VDR has signalled their willingness to begin negotiations as soon as they can be scheduled, with a small delegation from the VDR, headed by USDRP member Andrii Livytskyi and UPS-R member Vsevolod Holubovych. While success has yet to be proven, their response provided a substantial boost to Doroshenko and his softer approach in the Soim, turning some of the nay-sayers into a cautiously optimistic mood."
 ukraine_negotiations.6.a: "The real work starts now."

 ukraine_negotiations.7.t: "The Question of Prisoners"
 ukraine_negotiations.7.d: "Before talks can begin in earnest, the VDR has made one demand: the release of political prisoners and the suspension of all current political trials. In exchange, the VDR promises to rein in the protestors and end some of the current strikes.\n\nWhile accepting would certainly be a gesture of goodwill towards the VDR, there is worry within the Coalition that the VDR will take advantage of the release to strengthen their protests instead. These political prisoners include numerous agitators and organisers, who might even radicalise VDR's rank-and-file... but it is their first demand."
 ukraine_negotiations.7.a: "They cannot be trusted."
 ukraine_negotiations.7.b: "We must agree for the sake of the country."

 ukraine_negotiations.8.t: "Death in [192.GetName]"
 ukraine_negotiations.8.d: "Despite the VDR's assurances that they would rein in protestors in exchange for the release of prisoners, recent events in [192.GetName] have shown they have less control over the protestors than they are ready to admit. A strike by dock workers in [192.GetName] turned deadly when a confrontation between the police and strikers escalated into a firefight, claiming at least two lives.\n\nWhatever the cause, patience for the VDR is running thin within the coalition and the SHD has cautioned Doroshenko to end the talks."
 ukraine_negotiations.8.a: "The talks must continue."
 ukraine_negotiations.8.b: "They have gone too far. End the talks."

 ukraine_negotiations.9.t: "The SHD Intervenes"
 ukraine_negotiations.9.d: "With no serious pushback from Doroshenko on the incident in [192.GetName], Borys Homzyn turned to the Hetman directly. After lengthy talks, he has convinced Skoropadskyi to favour SHD's approach instead, arguing that the rebels are merely playing for time, and move onto the offensive.\n\nIn agreement, Skoropadskyi made it clear to Otaman-Minister Doroshenko that the talks are only a distraction, and decisive police action must be taken quickly - and if he does not accept it, the Hetman will find himself a minister who will."
 ukraine_negotiations.9.a: "Oh no..."

 ukraine_negotiations.10.t: "A Counterproposal"
 ukraine_negotiations.10.d: "Surprisingly, delegate Livytskyi admitted the VDR's fault in the [192.GetName] incident and expressed their wish to continue the talks. As a show of good faith, they are willing to reveal the location of some of their weapon caches in exchange for the continuation of the negotiations. It is hard to grasp how earnest this offer is."
 ukraine_negotiations.10.a: "They are trying to be reasonable; we should too."
 ukraine_negotiations.10.b: "Their mistakes won't be forgiven that easily."

 ukraine_negotiations.11.t: "The Matter of Representation"
 ukraine_negotiations.11.d: "Now that both parties have agreed to continue negotiations, despite all the setbacks, the question of who will represent the government during the talks must now be answered. The VDR delegation wants to discuss reforms with the Hetman directly, as they want assurance that the negotiations will be sincere. After all, the Hetman has the power to shut down any promises his politicians make, so promises from anyone else matter little.\n\nThe SHD and the Hetman himself are against this. They do not want to recognise the VDR as an equal partner in negotiations, which could negotiate with the head of state directly as if they were a legitimate government. In Skoropadskyi's mind, it is enough for the Otaman-Minister Doroshenko to represent the State. Finally, the Hetman's son, Danylo, has been proposed together with Doroshenko as a compromise candidate due to his constitutionalist leanings."
 ukraine_negotiations.11.a: "Try to convince Skoropadskyi."
 ukraine_negotiations.11.b: "The VDR will have to deal with Doroshenko."
 ukraine_negotiations.11.c: "Suggest Danylo together with Doroshenko as an alternative."

 ukraine_negotiations.12.t: "Negotiations Fall Apart"
 ukraine_negotiations.12.d: "It seems that despite the VDR's demands, the decision to have the Hetman directly represent negotiations between the state and the VDR was a mistake. Skoropadskyi questioned what position the VDR were even in to make such demands, which he likened to Bolshevism, and emphasised that his government had already taken decisive action to resolve the economic crisis via the relief bill. With the VDR's proposals being deemed as pointless to the Skoropadskyi their representatives left the table, and it seems that the negotiations are to end with no clear answer..."
 ukraine_negotiations.12.a: "Oh no..."

 ukraine_negotiations.13.t: "Negotiations Fall Apart"
 ukraine_negotiations.13.d: "The decision to have Doroshenko represent the government seems to have been a mistake. While the VDR acknowledged the move as one of good will, they pointed out the inherent problem with it, saying that while Doroshenko may be able to negotiate there is no guarantee that anything that is agreed upon will be recognised by the Hetman, and thus any further negotiations would be pointless..."
 ukraine_negotiations.13.a: "Oh no..."

 ukraine_negotiations.14.t: "Question of the Land Reform"
 ukraine_negotiations.14.d: "The compromise was enough for the VDR. In-person negotiations were agreed upon, to be held in the small crossroads town of Kalynivka near [198.GetName]. The mood was tense as Hetmanych Danylo Skoropadskyi and Otaman-Minister Doroshenko arrived there with a group of Soim representatives and a relatively small police detachment. The VDR was represented by committee led by Symon Petliura personally, alongside socialist leader Nykyfir Hryhoriiv. They also had a security detail of soldiers, though both sides agreed to restrict their security forces into separate parts of the town, and away from the negotiation building.\n\nThe initial talks agreed on principles of the negotiations, local cease-fire and mutual de-escalation for now. However, to truly de-escalate the situation, the VDR needs proper concessions: promises that will satisfy their enraged base. The first promise the government made was continuation of the land reform, which has been among the main demands for VDR's peasant organisations and militias. Reassurances were demanded to make sure that the reform will actually include adequate land redistribution, instead of mere promise of it.\n\nLuckily, both Danylo and Doroshenko seem to agree on this. While the Otaman-Minister's promises are easily taken back by politicking, the Hetman's heir apparent's official signature on land reform demand should be strong enough assurance, as it puts the prestige of the Hetmanate on the line."
 ukraine_negotiations.14.a: "It's a start."

 ukraine_negotiations.15.t: "Question of the Socialists"
 ukraine_negotiations.15.d: "The VDR's second major demand is for the government to lift ban on socialists running for both local and national elections, which have remained in place since 1920. Lifting the ban on socialists locally is not particularly contentious for moderates of the Coalition, as even if the socialists could win various local council seats, they could not threaten national stability. However, allowing them to run in national elections is a much more worrisome scenario, which could backfire radically."
 ukraine_negotiations.15.a: "Local elections only."
 ukraine_negotiations.15.b: "Local and national elections."

 ukraine_negotiations.16.t: "Outrage from the Right"
 ukraine_negotiations.16.d: "The decision to allow socialists to participate in local and national elections have infuriated both the Coalition and the SHD. They have called it a total \"capitulation\" to the VDR and threatened to end the talks. Without their acceptance or at least neutrality in the Soim it does not matter what we promise, as we cannot pass it through legislation.\n\nA quick compromise has been drafted: allowing socialists in elections with two exceptions. First, they must not push for nor attempt to implement full socialisation of the land. Second, they must not attempt to overthrow the Hetmanate and install a republic."
 ukraine_negotiations.16.a: "Ignore them."
 ukraine_negotiations.16.b: "Try to calm them."
 ukraine_negotiations.16.c: "Allow participation of leftists with two caveats."

 ukraine_negotiations.17.t: "Negotiations Fall Apart"
 ukraine_negotiations.17.d: "With no indication that their concerns were being listened to, the Coalition and the SHD reached out to the Hetman to inform of Doroshenko's \"capitulation\" to radical elements. They made it clear to stop any \"concessionist\" legislation that Doroshenko might suggest. Hetman Skoropadskyi declared soon after that the negotiations would not continue and that Doroshenko would be sacked if he continued. With Doroshenko's reluctant acquiescence it seems unlikely any further cooperation can proceed..."
 ukraine_negotiations.17.a: "Oh no..."

 ukraine_negotiations.18.t: "Negotiations Fall Apart"
 ukraine_negotiations.18.d: "The Coalition and SHD's concerns were met by Doroshenko assuring them that electoral regulations will make it impossible for socialists to win national elections. This has backfired, as the VDR's radicals leaked the information to reveal the lies of these negotiations. This quickly prompted a new wave of protests, leaving the VDR no choice but to accuse the government of deceit. It seems that any further attempt at reconciliation is unlikely..."
 ukraine_negotiations.18.a: "Oh no..."

 ukraine_negotiations.19.t: "Vynnychenko's Book Club"
 ukraine_negotiations.19.d: "Volodymyr Vynnychenko, one of the leaders of the VDR, has recently arrived in [202.GetName] to hold a \"social gathering\" among [202.GetName]an intelligentsia. Operatives implanted in the local intelligentsia circles have informed us that this \"book club\" meeting includes various socialists and radical liberals.\n\nWhile this wouldn't normally be a reason to worry, with the current situation it seems probable that such a prolific socialist as Vynnychenko could potentially heighten the tension. What if this gathering is a mere front for organising revolutionary activity? As we know where his \"club\" is planning to meet, we could arrange an arrest and escort him out of the city before any harm is done. However, this kind of attack, if botched or revealed to the public, could backfire worse than simply allowing the man to speak. After all, his meeting might just be a glorified dinner party. Vynnychenko has even been a voice of moderation at times, and has talked in favour of the negotiations in the past."
 ukraine_negotiations.19.a: "He is a writer after all. Leave him be."
 ukraine_negotiations.19.b: "Stop the meeting."

 ukraine_negotiations.20.t: "Question of the Soim's Powers"
 ukraine_negotiations.20.d: "The third demand of the VDR addresses the powers of the Soim. The principle of parliamentarism must be enshrined in the law, meaning that the Otaman-Minister should be only responsible to the Soim. He would be appointed by the Soim, and removed through a vote of no confidence. The Hetman would merely accept whoever is proposed by the Soim, like in \"civilised democracies.\"\n\nIn practice, this would turn Ukraine into a parliamentary monarchy, where the Hetman's power would become largely symbolic. While Danylo and Doroshenko are willing to entertain the idea, it might be completely impossible to sell to the current Soim or Pavlo himself. After all, it would mean Skoropadskyi giving up much of his power. Promising such a reform to the VDR only to see it blocked by the Hetman would not serve anyone's interests."
 ukraine_negotiations.20.a: "We must try!"
 ukraine_negotiations.20.b: "This is too radical."

 ukraine_negotiations.21.t: "Negotiations Fall Apart"
 ukraine_negotiations.21.d: "On the advice of the SHD, the Hetman informed Doroshenko that negotiations are to end immediately, due to the fact that he has capitulated to giving up not only Skoropadskyi's powers but also his own. Under threat from both the Hetman and the SHD, Doroshenko has acquiesced. There were some final attempts to craft a compromise, but it proved to be impossible as it was clear that the Hetman would not accept it. The negotiations have fallen apart, and the VDR left the table soon after."
 ukraine_negotiations.21.a: "Oh no..."

 ukraine_negotiations.22.t: "VDR's Alternative Option"
 ukraine_negotiations.22.d: "When it was clear that Doroshenko could never get the Hetman to agree to such a radical proposition, Petliura came forward with a compromise. After furious debate within VDR leadership, they decided to accept a slightly less parliamentarian solution: The Hetman shall retain his power to sack the Otaman-Minister and veto legislation, but these powers can be stopped by a two-thirds majority in the Soim. However, an otherwise reasonable compromise has an unacceptable finishing touch: Pavlo must go, and a new Hetman, one who would genuinely support democracy, must be elected."
 ukraine_negotiations.22.a: "How could we agree to that?"

 ukraine_negotiations.23.t: "The Deadlock"
 ukraine_negotiations.23.d: "We were this close to greatness. So many compromises have already been agreed on, but now the negotiations have hit a wall. Hetman Skoropadskyi will not stand down because of the demands of \"rabble-rousers\". Everything has been tried in desperate attempts to save the negotiations, but the VDR will accept only one of two proposals: either full parliamentarism, or reduced parliamentarism with a new Hetman. Even if the more moderate VDR supporters would accept meagre gains, much of the movement are radical republicans or socialists, and have made sure that if the VDR's negotiators accept any \"watered down\" proposals, the revolution will continue without them. The Borotbysts have been particularly vocal in spreading rumours of Petliura's plans to secretly give in to the Hetman's demands, and botch the whole revolution before it can properly begin. Some cells are even planning to restart violence to pressure the talks to cease.\n\nOn the other side of the negotiation table, Danylo has been trying to convince his father to accept abdication, although to no avail. The Hetman cited the fate of the Romanovs as an example - a ruler who gives up his power gives up everything, and the radicals will take over, leading to ruin of the nation. As days pass and negotiators are unable to find compromise, defeatism and depression starts to loom heavy above the democratic reformers of the Hetmanate, who had dared to believe that peaceful solution could be achievable."
 ukraine_negotiations.23.a: "But then..."

 ukraine_negotiations.24.t: "The Train Crash"
 ukraine_negotiations.24.d: "In a section between [202.GetName] and Cherkasy, the Hetman's train faced a horrible accident. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was on his way back to the capital after inspecting the garrison in Cherkasy and meeting with southern regional Otamans to discuss the security situation in their districts. According to the newspapers, the Hetman's train was derailed at high speed due to structural issues. The Hetman was saved from the wreckage, badly wounded, but he died on his way to hospital. Three others, members of the Hetman's inner circle, lost their lives, and a dozen others were wounded badly.\n\nRight from the start accusations were flying: right-wing press was sure that it was not an accident, but a deliberate assassination committed by anarchists. Some spread a conspiracy of disgruntled military officers planting a bomb in Skoropadskyi's personal train to get rid of him before he gives in to the VDR and destroys all the hard work the Hetmanate's supporters have made during the past 20 years. Investigators could not identify the traces of explosives; the rails had been either sabotaged or they had simply broken, possibly because of lack of maintenance. Either way, no one is quite sure what will happen next. The possibility of a military coup or a socialist revolution are widely talked about in the streets as the nation grapples with the death of the Hetman."
 ukraine_negotiations.24.a: "So falls the Hetman."

 ukraine_negotiations.26.t: "The New Hetman"
 ukraine_negotiations.26.d: "When the news of the Hetman's death reached the capital, the mourning was immediately overshadowed by political gambling. There is no precedent to the situation: Danylo does not automatically succeed, and this difficult question should be resolved by a special body tasked with the handling of crucial state matters in the event of sudden death or grave illness of the Hetman - the Collegium of Supreme Rulers, comprised from the representative of the Hetman, picked beforehand and in secret, and representatives of the Council of Ministers and the State Senate.\n\nAware of Danylo's friendliness to the constitutional reformists in the Soim, Borys Homzyn met with General Poltavets-Ostrianytsia early in the morning and discussed the possibility of a military coup in the capital to ensure the continuation of Pavlo's life work, utilising Danylo as a puppet figure of the SHD. The plans were relayed to General Prisovskyi, another potential conspirator; but in a decision that saved the country from bloodshed, he refused to dishonour Skoropadskyi's memory with such plans.\n\nIn a few hours, the window for a military coup was gone, and an emergency session of the Soim was called by the Collegium of Supreme Rulers. All its three members - Otaman-Minister Doroshenko, Senator Chubynskyi and Minister Yasnopolskyi had agreed to bring up a sole candidate: Danylo Pavlovych Skoropadskyi, who was elected unanimously to succeed his father as the Hetman of All Ukraine. His first address in this position was heartfelt and he spoke skilfully. He lamented the tragedy of his late father, and demanded that all Ukrainians withdraw from violence. He portrayed his negotiations with Petliura as Pavlo's final work, and promised to finish them in a way that will satisfy everyone. Such framing silenced the worst protests from the right-wing - after all, the negotiations had been done with Pavlo's acceptance. However, it was clear that despite the appearance of peace in the Soim, there was resentment and even whispers of the son immediately setting to dismantle his father's legacy."
 ukraine_negotiations.26.a: "And so we boldly go into a new era."

 ukraine_negotiations.27.t: "The VDR Refuse"
 ukraine_negotiations.27.d: "Despite high hopes, the VDR have refused any cooperation or negotiation with us, citing the SHD as being \"little more than an outfit of robbers and murderers\" and that our recent show of restraint is little more than an act to appease the people. For now the situation is calm, but it could spark off at any moment."
 ukraine_negotiations.27.d2: "Despite high hopes, the VDR have refused any cooperation or negotiation with us. Though acknowledging the goodwill on part of the URDP to act as a mediator in negotiations they cited the recently passed relief bill, where the URDP was sidelined, as proof of the insincerity of our government, calling it \"held to the whims of landowners and industrialists\". For now the situation is calm but it could spark off at any moment."
 ukraine_negotiations.27.a: "Some can't let go of the past."

 ukraine_negotiations.29.t: "Negotiations Fall Apart"
 ukraine_negotiations.29.d: "The VDR has left the negotiating table. They have claimed that our refusal to let socialist parties run for national elections show the insincerity of the negotiations as a whole and our lack of commitment to true democracy. The negotiations are practically dead in the water now."
 ukraine_negotiations.29.a: "Oh no..."

 ### Land Reform Events ###
 ukraine_landreform.1.t: "Land Reform and Industrialisation Begin"
 ukraine_landreform.1.d1: "As the state finally recovers from Black Monday and the fallout of the revolt gradually diminishes, we can now begin our great land reform and industrialisation projects. Ten years ago, the Hetman's government drew up a controversial land reform plan that was deemed too moderate by parliamentary conservatives and too radical by landowning lobbyists - in hindsight, it was clear from the beginning that it would not succeed. The industrialisation projects fizzled out as well, in realisation that, although it is necessary, it was not as pressing of an issue - nor would it get our politicians any votes. Nonetheless, the revolt has taught us that if the Hetman's state is to survive, we must learn from our mistakes and improvise greatly. The real work begins now."
 ukraine_landreform.1.d2: "As the state finally recovers from Black Monday and the nation recovers from the civil war, we can now begin our great land reform and industrialisation projects. Throughout its existence the Hetmanate consistently failed to deliver its promises on land reform efforts, illustrating why the republican uprising was necessary in the first place. But we are different. We have overthrown the Hetman and his cronies promising power to the people - and it is time we deliver. The real work begins now."
 ukraine_landreform.1.d3: "As the state finally recovers from Black Monday and the process of creating a new Hetmanate comes to pass, we can now begin our great land reform and industrialisation projects. Ten years ago, Pavlo Skoropadskyi's government drew up a controversial land reform plan that was deemed too moderate by parliamentary conservatives and too radical by landowning lobbyists - in hindsight, it was clear from the beginning that it would not succeed. The industrialisation projects fizzled out as well, in realisation that, although it is necessary, it was not as pressing of an issue - nor would it get our politicians any votes. Nonetheless, trials and tribulations of recent years has taught us that if the Hetman's state is to survive, we must learn from our mistakes and improvise greatly. The real work begins now."

 ukraine_landreform.4.d: "Taking note of our plans to distribute land fairly to the peasants, a large landowner in [201.GetName] has petitioned the local government offering us political support if we avoid tampering with his land. Though landlords are some of the most powerful people in Ukraine and their support would certainly be of use, going back on our promises of land reform may radicalise the peasants and bring hosts of other problems."
 ukraine_landreform.4.a: "Of course, we can make exceptions."
 ukraine_landreform.4.b: "We will not play favourites here."

 ukraine_landreform.5.t: "The Marshes of [997.GetName]"
 ukraine_landreform.5.d: "In the marshier parts of Ukrainian [997.GetName], large landowners dominate as the land is seen as too economically unviable to develop, leading to a great deal of unused land. Though it may be costly, attempting to drain the wetlands of the marshes in order to turn the estates more profitable and giving it to the smaller peasantry may work out for us in the long term."
 ukraine_landreform.5.a: "This is too costly."
 ukraine_landreform.5.b: "We shall transform the marshes!"

 ukraine_landreform.6.t: "Question of Priorities"
 ukraine_landreform.6.d: "As our land reform and industrialisation projects continue, there is a tacit recognition that our budget may not be able to account for both, and there is a question of what our priorities should be. We could continue funding our land reform efforts by investing in our irrigation infrastructure, or we could prioritise improving our manufacturing and service sectors."
 ukraine_landreform.6.a: "Continue funding the land reform."
 ukraine_landreform.6.b: "Divert funds to our industry projects."

 ukraine_landreform.7.t: "Successful Reform Efforts"
 ukraine_landreform.7.d: "Our land reform programme is going well. Inequality and poverty has been reduced, while the peasants have given the government their support in return. If this trend continues, there is no doubt the rewards will be worth it in the end."
 ukraine_landreform.7.a: "Splendid."

 ukraine_landreform.8.t: "Subsidies for Veterans?"
 ukraine_landreform.8.d: "In carrying out our land reform programme the government has been particularly interested to select the beneficiaries of the reform. In exchange for their valuable political loyalty, one idea that has been floated around is to prioritise veterans and families of those who have been killed in war."
 ukraine_landreform.8.a: "It would be valuable..."
 ukraine_landreform.8.b: "There is no need."

 ukraine_landreform.9.t: "Funding the Cooperative Movement"
 ukraine_landreform.9.d: "In Ukraine the cooperative movement has existed for decades and has contributed to the wellbeing of our peasants through maximisation of small farmer profits and the ability for farmers to pool their resources together. In western Ukraine in particular, the cooperatives have seen membership in the hundreds of thousands, and direct funding from the state has only bolstered their usefulness."
 ukraine_landreform.9.a: "Fantastic."

 ukraine_landreform.10.t: "Bailing Out Ailing Farms?"
 ukraine_landreform.10.d: "Many of the smaller farms have been doing poorly for some time now, and are burdened with heavy loans. There is a fear that these farmers will go bankrupt if there is even one bad harvest. Peasant's organisations have petitioned the government's land programmes for subsidies and loan restructuring with these smallholders, or they will face financial ruin."
 ukraine_landreform.10.a: "Support the farmers."
 ukraine_landreform.10.b: "Divert funds to our industry projects."

 ukraine_landreform.11.t: "Landowner Petitions the Government"
 ukraine_landreform.11.d: "Taking note of our plans to distribute land fairly to the peasants, a large landowner in Kherson has petitioned the local government offering us political support if we avoid tampering with his land. Though landlords are some of the most powerful people in Ukraine and their support would certainly be of use, going back on our promises of land reform may radicalise the peasants and bring hosts of other problems."
 ukraine_landreform.11.a: "No way."
 ukraine_landreform.11.b: "Perhaps we can seek a compromise?"
 ukraine_landreform.11.c: "We could make exceptions."

 ukraine_landreform.12.t: "Uneven Ownership in the West"
 ukraine_landreform.12.d: "Historically, in western Ukraine, the landowning elites have mostly been of Polish descent, whereas the peasantry have mostly been Ukrainian. The clear divide in land ownership among ethnic lines has been a cause of concern for many peasants and our government. Perhaps we should direct some of our efforts to clearing up this divide."
 ukraine_landreform.12.a: "Of course."
 ukraine_landreform.12.b: "We do not want to alienate the Poles."

 ukraine_landreform.13.t: "Protest in [193.GetName]"
 ukraine_landreform.13.d: "A group of peasants in [193.GetName] have protested against the local government for not doing enough to fulfil their promises, arguing that land ownership in the region is still vastly uneven. It seems that a powerful landowning lobby exists in the state administration which has curbed efforts of land reform."
 ukraine_landreform.13.a: "Attempt to rid the state of the lobby."
 ukraine_landreform.13.b: "We can't do much."

 ukraine_landreform.14.t: "Question of Taxation"
 ukraine_landreform.14.d: "Some in our government have argued for higher taxation of big landowners, arguing that it would grant the government the ability to help fund welfare programmes and support small farms, although this has been cautioned against with others arguing that this will only lead to a drop in agricultural productivity."
 ukraine_landreform.14.a: "It would surely win us the support of the peasants."
 ukraine_landreform.14.b: "This isn't what we need."

 ukraine_landreform.15.t: "Encouraging New Exports"
 ukraine_landreform.15.d: "For many years, Ukraine has been recognised as a major exporter of sunflower seeds and wheat, providing these staples to nations across the globe. However, as the nation's ambitious land reform programme unfolds, there have been increasing calls for the diversification of our exports. This can be accomplished by empowering peasants with new plots of land and promoting the growth of new crops. While this may prove to be a costly endeavour, the potential rewards for expanding our export portfolio are substantial."
 ukraine_landreform.15.a: "Stick to our traditional crops."
 ukraine_landreform.15.b: "It will be worth it in the long term."

 ukraine_landreform.16.t: "Cheating the System"
 ukraine_landreform.16.d: "Some landowners have found a way to circumvent our reform efforts by selling their excess land to friends and family, who in turn rent the land back at nominal cost. This kind of arrangements are hard to stop, as technically no crime is being committed, except against good faith."
 ukraine_landreform.16.a: "Damn."

 ukraine_landreform.17.t: "Tractors, Tractors, Tractors"
 ukraine_landreform.17.d: "Thanks to caps to land rents, more and more farmers have been able to afford more modern farming equipment - chiefly among them tractors. A single tractor can halve the amount of work needed to produce the same amount of grain, which in practice means that the same amount of workers can produce twice as many crops. Welcome to modern times!"
 ukraine_landreform.17.a: "Tax those production increases more."
 ukraine_landreform.17.b: "Let them sell them."

 ukraine_landreform.18.t: "Volynian Poles Petition Government"
 ukraine_landreform.18.d: "Nobility descending from Poles form a significant part of the elites in the western parts of Ukraine, having amassed great estates during imperial times. These landowners have been generally supportive of the Hetman's policies in the past, but recent land redistribution policies have made them wary. They have argued for exceptions based on various local laws and traditions, and are essentially promising their continuing support for the regime in exchange of \"loopholes.\""
 ukraine_landreform.18.a: "Surely traditions must be respected."
 ukraine_landreform.18.b: "They need to obey the laws, like everyone else."

 ukraine_landreform.19.t: "Speculation With Subsidies"
 ukraine_landreform.19.d: "After opening easy credit for small landowners for buying agricultural equipment, some more well-off farmers have taken the chance to use these loans to invest in profitable industries. Technically this is abusing the loan policy and taking funds from people who actually need them, but it is also rather beneficial for our domestic industry."
 ukraine_landreform.19.a: "They are an example to all farmers."
 ukraine_landreform.19.b: "Ensure such things won't happen again."

 ukraine_landreform.20.t: "Distillery Boom"
 ukraine_landreform.20.d: "We have been giving subsidies for any factory projects in rural regions to help those areas grow and modernise. It seems that most popular business there has quickly became distilleries, especially ones mostly producing cheap horilka out of excess grain. There has been critique from many concerned people - priests, mothers, teachers - that these \"devil's machines\" spew indecent lifestyle to the countryside with cheap alcohol. However, they are very productive, and restricting them would mean losing quite bit of potential growth and corporate taxes."
 ukraine_landreform.20.a: "Alcohol is the devil's drink."
 ukraine_landreform.20.b: "Drinking is the joy of all Ukrainians!"

 ukraine_landreform.21.t: "Draining the Marshes"
 ukraine_landreform.21.d: "There are many marshes and wetlands especially in northwestern Ukraine, where the great Pinsk Marshes continue for hundreds of miles. Draining parts of these swamps would create more farmland, but it is also very expensive, as many canals need to be dug to drain the water. Normally these projects are organised by purpose-founded \"swamp cooperatives\", where each member pays part of the draining expenses, and gets new farmland in the proportion to their contribution. With state subsidies, we could greatly help such farmland reclamation."
 ukraine_landreform.21.a: "Swamps will not stand in the way of progress!"
 ukraine_landreform.21.b: "Sounds expensive."

 ukraine_landreform.22.t: "Estates of the Orthodox Church"
 ukraine_landreform.22.d: "Many churches and monasteries own sizeable land estates, and have rent farmers tending to their lands. Under our land redistribution policies, the wealthiest of monasteries should also sell part of their land. However, many of them have petitioned for special treatment, arguing that they are not corporations or individuals with profit motive, but seeking the greater good of the whole Ukrainian people. It is true that the church estates are often more modern and well-tended than the ones owned by aristocrats, but then again making exceptions is not desirable either."
 ukraine_landreform.22.a: "The Church is always right!"
 ukraine_landreform.22.b: "Did Christ own land?"

 ukraine_landreform.23.t: "Price Controls for Wheat"
 ukraine_landreform.23.d: "As the world situation has destabilised much of the trade networks, our greatly improved agricultural output has became a booming business. The American Civil War has essentially destroyed the output of our chief rival in wheat production, and many new markets are open to us. Farmers have been selling their crops with ever-increasing prices, as export companies sell everything they can buy to foreign markets. Despite great profits for the agricultural sector, all this has hurt the Ukrainian urban populations, who have found the price of bread grow to unsustainable levels. We could set maximum wheat prices, or restrict exports in other ways - though it would come at the expense of the agricultural business."
 ukraine_landreform.23.a: "Let's do profits!"
 ukraine_landreform.23.b: "Everyone deserves cheap food."

 ukraine_landreform.29.t: "Growing Support Among Peasants"
 ukraine_landreform.29.d: "It seems our land reform efforts are working. The peasantry have increasingly seen the government as looking out for the common person, as they are able to gain greater control over their own lives and bring themselves new economic opportunities."
 ukraine_landreform.29.a: "Great!"

 ukraine_landreform.30.t: "Increased Agricultural Production"
 ukraine_landreform.30.d: "The government's efforts to bring about an increase in agricultural production with the land reform programme have borne fruit. Surges in food production are being reported across the country and it seems food security is only getting better."
 ukraine_landreform.30.a: "Good news!"

 ukraine_landreform.31.t: "Deradicalisation of the Countryside"
 ukraine_landreform.31.d: "Due to our land reform efforts it seems that the countryside is increasingly looking away from radical ideologies like syndicalism and extreme nationalism. Now that the peasants are increasingly seeing opportunity, they are less likely to join organisations that promote these ideologies, which has in turn brought us greater political support."
 ukraine_landreform.31.a: "Excellent."

 ukraine_landreform.32.t: "Peasant Strikes"
 ukraine_landreform.32.d: "A group of peasants have gone on strike protesting the government for their inaction concerning land reform, complaining of low wages and poor conditions in the fields. Though the strike will eventually come to pass, it is a clear sign that we must redouble our efforts if we want to maintain stability and curb unrest."
 ukraine_landreform.32.a: "Unfortunate."

 ukraine_landreform.33.t: "Peasants Radicalise"
 ukraine_landreform.33.d: "In the countryside large numbers of peasants have turned to radical ideologies. Syndicalist and extreme nationalist sympathisers have appealed to many of these peasants, arguing that the government has been held hostage by groups of landowners and that it does not truly represent the people. We must improve our land reform efforts if we are to have a stable base of political support."
 ukraine_landreform.33.a: "Surely we should take action..."

### SocLib Hetmanate Events ###
 ukraine_danylo.1.t: "Whispers from the Right"
 ukraine_danylo.1.d: "When Hetman Danylo announced his intentions to continue negotiations with the VDR, there was silence, at least at first. Some members of the UDKhP, the USKhD and especially the SHD have approached the new Hetman cautioning against negotiations with radical leftists. When it was made clear that the negotiations would continue \"for the good of the nation\", the issue became clear: the Hetman, powerful as he may be, does not have the backing of his father's coalition."
 ukraine_danylo.1.a: "Can't they just be quiet?"

 ukraine_danylo.2.t: "The Long Road Ahead"
 ukraine_danylo.2.d: "On behalf of Danylo Skoropadskyi, Otaman-Minister Doroshenko announced to the Soim that the elections scheduled late this year would be postponed in recognition of the new situation. He added that recent events have proven that \"proper political representation\" is necessary and that compromise with the opposition is necessary.\n\nWhile a new date was not given for the new elections, this represents a huge opportunity for the new Hetman and Doroshenko to continue negotiations with the VDR and ensure their reformist agenda is put into place."
 ukraine_danylo.2.a: "Let's get started."

 ukraine_danylo.3.t: "The Ultimate Question"
 ukraine_danylo.3.d: "Land reform is one of the most pivotal questions in our nation. The failure of the previous government to handle land reform has led to the new government drafting a proposal that will attempt to satisfy the people. We must choose whether to pursue a more balanced approach and placating the landowners or taking radical action."
 ukraine_danylo.3.a: "Pursue radical action."
 ukraine_danylo.3.b: "We must compromise."

 ukraine_danylo.4.t: "Of Powers and Responsibilities"
 ukraine_danylo.4.d: "For some time now, powers of Hetman Danylo have been in limbo, legally speaking he retains the same authoritarian prerogatives as his father and can exert these at any time. The government is in agreement that his powers should be scaled back by constitutional decree but to what extent is still up in the air. Much of the political scene believe his powers should be scaled back completely to create a regular constitutional monarchy but there have been growing calls for him to retain at least some minor de facto veto power over the final phase of bills to help act as an impartial political scrutiniser."
 ukraine_danylo.4.a: "Perhaps it is time the Hetman surrendered his powers."
 ukraine_danylo.4.b: "The Hetman must maintain some degree of political relevancy!"

 ukraine_danylo.5.t: "Radical Borotbysts Attack a Train"
 ukraine_danylo.5.d: "Still believing that the political situation caused by economic fallout of Black Monday remains volatile enough and that they can get the VDR on their side, the Borotbysts have attacked a train carrying military supplies, thinking this would bring others to an armed revolution. While their efforts have been fruitless thus far, the SHD as well as other members of the conservative opposition has pointed to the attacks as proof that negotiations with the VDR are a pointless endeavour, swaying many on the current government's stance."
 ukraine_danylo.5.a: "Radicals will be radicals."
 ukraine_danylo.5.b: "We must stop them at any chance we can."

 ukraine_danylo.6.t: "The Hetman and the General"
 ukraine_danylo.6.d: "Today General Prisovskyi arrived at the Hetman's office to discuss terms. He warns that the government has not taken appropriate action to curb Borotbyst activity, something he foresees as a precursor to a socialist revolution. While Prisovskyi's word is not final, his words do carry weight, as he was credited with the offensives against Nestor Makhno's anarchist revolt back in 1919. What should the Hetman say?"
 ukraine_danylo.6.a: "We don't really disagree, do we?"
 ukraine_danylo.6.b: "And then what, repeat the same mistakes as in 1925?"

 ukraine_danylo.8.t: "Doroshenko Reins in the UDKhP"
 ukraine_danylo.8.d: "Ever since the ascension of Danylo Skoropadskyi as Hetman, Dmytro Doroshenko has been hard at work using his position as Otaman-Minister to get the UDKhP to support the negotiations with the VDR and the reforms. Most notably he has advocated for turning the position of Hetman into a symbolic one, and the membership of the party is steering towards a more constitutionalist direction."
 ukraine_danylo.8.a: "His efforts are appreciated."

 ukraine_danylo.9.t: "A Visit from the VSZV"
 ukraine_danylo.9.d: "This evening multiple members of the VSZV visited the Hetman's office to plead to the Hetman on one key issue: land reform. While they do acknowledge that land reform is an issue both the left and right agree upon, they have stated that the VDR's plan for land reform is far too radical and utterly detrimental in the long term, only capable of bringing inefficiency and chaos. What should the Hetman's response be?"
 ukraine_danylo.9.a: "You are right, we must not capitulate to radical elements here."
 ukraine_danylo.9.b: "The Hetman and his government shall pursue land reform as they see fit!"
 ukraine_danylo.9.c: "Perhaps we can seek a compromise?"

 ukraine_danylo.12.t: "Question of the Administrative Divisions"
 ukraine_danylo.12.d: "One of the chief complaints of the VDR is the difference in administration. Upon its declaration the people's republic was much more decentralised than the Hetmanate is, being divided up into significantly more lands. The current system closely resembles the divisions of the Tsarist era, and the VDR have argued that these should be redrawn if we are to pursue a truly democratic society."
 ukraine_danylo.12.a: "Pursue great decentralisation."
 ukraine_danylo.12.b: "Try to compromise."

 ukraine_danylo.13.t: "The Final Journey of His Most Serene Highness"
 ukraine_danylo.13.d: "As the nation gathers to mourn the loss of its beloved Hetman, all eyes are on Danylo Skoropadskyi as he prepares to give the eulogy at his father's funeral. As he takes the podium, the young Hetman must decide how to focus his speech, given the current political difficulties.\n\nHe could focus solely on his father's great achievements, emphasising that it was he who was at the forefront of Ukraine's struggle for independence, and led the nation in an honourable way up until his untimely death. Or perhaps he should invoke the image of a somewhat flawed (aren't we all?) but ultimately well-intentioned and dedicated ruler, whose remarkable deeds laid the necessary foundations upon which future generations will build something truly lasting. While the former approach would certainly give the conservative opposition in the Soim and the SHD an impression that the Hetman is simply being led astray by the VDR, such an action would certainly damage the negotiations process, and it is not as though the latter option would seriously harm his reputation in any way."
 ukraine_danylo.13.a: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi was the father of the nation."
 ukraine_danylo.13.b: "He played an instrumental role in bringing a brighter future."

 ukraine_danylo.14.t: "Rozbudova Natsii"
 ukraine_danylo.14.d: "Rozbudova Natsii (Building the Nation) is the main press outlet for the League of Ukrainian Nationalists, and it has gained some attraction since the death of Skoropadskyi as radicalism continues to grow during the political crisis. Today, one of its main editors, Yevhen Onatskyi, published an article detailing his thoughts on Ukrainian society and how it should move forward.\n\nIn the article, Onatskyi states that while there is an anticipation of great changes in the air and Ukraine is definitely moving into a new political age, one shouldn't forget: until the entire Ukrainian society isn't united around idea of serving the Nation above all else and isn't guided by the one organisation dedicated to this sole task, Ukraine will remain vulnerable to threats both external and internal. He hints that perhaps the salvation may come from the military: it represents all layers of society and combines discipline and respect for hierarchy with traditions of selfless service and sacrifice. His words have emboldened the opposition and many are beginning to see the negotiations with the VDR as at best pointless - and at worst, harmful."
 ukraine_danylo.14.a: "Troubling."

 ukraine_danylo.15.t: "The Evil Genius and the Radical Firebrand"
 ukraine_danylo.15.d: "The UDKhP is at its most pivotal moment. Over the past few months, the party has been split on whether to support the negotiations or to ally with the opposition, and neither side has gained a clear advantage. Another question looms, however, as these trying times demand leadership which is universally respected and obeyed without questions. As such, two leading figures of this rather big-tent party are locked into vicious competition. Ihor Kistiakovskyi and Mykola Mikhnovskyi: who will take up the reins of the UDKhP? Kistiakovskyi is famous for his cunning nature and numerous connections permeating virtually the entirety of Ukrainian political sphere. Meanwhile, Mikhnovskyi's outspoken demeanour commands admiration of vast swathes of society: from peasants and soldiers to national-minded intelligentsia."
 ukraine_danylo.15.a: "Kistiakovskyi's political acumen wins the day."
 ukraine_danylo.15.b: "Mikhnovskyi's fiery rhetoric sways the party."

 ukraine_danylo.16.t: "The Final Mystery of Pavlo Skoropadskyi"
 ukraine_danylo.16.d: "As the nation recovers from the shock of Pavlo Skoropadskyi's death, investigators are being called in to determine the cause and identify potential suspects. The first obvious culprit is a radical Borotbyst, however despite their reputation for political assassinations and the possibility for a motive, there is no concrete evidence of one of their members having committed the assassination. It seems that this effort will be more momentous than once thought, and the results, whatever they will be, will surely have an impact on Ukraine's future."
 ukraine_danylo.16.a: "This will be difficult."

 ukraine_danylo.17.t: "Dissolution of the Union of Agrarians-Statists"
 ukraine_danylo.17.d: "The absorption of many of the willing members of the USKhD into the UDKhP has been the straw that broke the camel's back for the former. When Black Monday hit Ukraine, the small, yet influential movement believed they could have taken advantage of the turmoil and become the dominant organisation in the Hetman's coalition. Some have gone as far as to say that Skoropadskyi once planned on appointing Serhii Shemet, the leader of the organisation, as an Otaman-Minister, due to his personal closeness with the Hetman.\n\nLately, the organisation's membership has dwindled owing to the UDKhP's efforts in swaying more pragmatically inclined members of the movement, with many of them heeding the call. With these developments, Mykola Kochubei, the main ideologue of the USKhD, has opted to dissolve the organisation, owing to its insignificant membership and lack of funding and support. In its place, Kochubei and the movement's most influential thinkers have rebranded the movement to the \"Brotherhood of Classocrats-Monarchists\", more accurately representing their main ideas. The new organisation, however, is small and politically irrelevant, and is doubted to make any headway soon."
 ukraine_danylo.17.a: "Being overly concerned with ideological purity usually doesn't lend you any favours."

 ukraine_danylo.18.t: "A True Alliance of the Centre?"
 ukraine_danylo.18.d: "The government's decision to support the USDRP has led to significant concerns among the UDKhP and certain groups within the URDP. Apparently, the right wing of the URDP has reached out to parts of the UDKhP to possibly forge an alliance between more moderately minded circles of both organisations, with the aim of stymieing possible ascendancy of radical left. The negotiations have ended without a result owing to the disagreement on multiple issues between the two parties, however the fact that some of the URDP, who have been the most steadfast supporters of negotiations with the VDR, attempted this still has struck at the VDR's ability to convince the Soim."
 ukraine_danylo.18.a: "The URDP is not as united as it may seem."

 ukraine_danylo.22.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ukraine_danylo.22.d: "At long last. Months and months of negotiating have finally culminated into the bright future many had dreamed of. Several laws enshrining Ukraine as a democratic state and ensuring political pluralism have been passed, as decades of authoritarianism are beginning to become recent memory. The work of the Hetman, Otaman-Minister Doroshenko and his allies in the Soim have finally borne fruit, as the first truly free elections have taken place today. The result was mostly expected, culminating in a victory of the URDP - as the Hetman no longer appoints the Otaman-Minister, the Soim voted to elect the party veteran Viacheslav Prokopovych to the position. Members of the party have been jubilant to finally see the majority in the Soim that they had been denied under Pavlo Skoropadskyi's authoritarian rule.\n\nIn recognition of the government's efforts, Symon Petliura, alongside noted members of the VDR such as Isaak Mazepa, Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Nykyfir Hryhoriiv gathered to officially dissolve the VDR, stating that the organisation had achieved its goals and was no longer necessary. Later that week, Symon Petliura, alongside his protege Oleksandr Udovychenko, met with Danylo Skoropadskyi to informally confirm the agreement between the government and the reformist forces. But most importantly, Petliura offered to serve in Ukraine's armed forces once again, a request that the Hetman and Otaman-Minister Prokopovych accepted.\n\nStill, only the groundwork has been laid. Land reform remains an issue, and as Europe only seems to grow more restless, the need to industrialise and build a powerful army to defend Ukraine is all but a necessity. It remains to be seen whether this new chapter in Ukraine's history can lead to something lasting."
 ukraine_danylo.22.a: "Bozhe velykyi, yedynyi, nam Ukrainu khrany!"

 ukraine_danylo.23.t: "Elections of [GetYear]" #Postwar Elections
 ukraine_danylo.23.d: "The Ukrainian State has faced multiple trials. Its independence, beginning from 1917, was shaky at best, and the following years were tumultuous, owing to great political instability. Though the agreement between the VDR and the Hetman's government successfully ended much of the political polarisation, the greatest test was yet to come. The Russian bear dug its claws into Ukraine as part of the bloodiest war seen in world history. But in the end, as it has and always will, Ukraine has triumphed - its enemies have vanished like dew in the sun. The Russians believed that Ukraine was disunited, but Ukrainians dared to dream of a better future, working together towards a common cause of greatness. More than ever before, people have something to believe in - democracy, justice, and liberty - and they will fight to the death to defend it.\n\nIt is on these beliefs that made the turnout for the [GetYear] Elections the highest it has ever been in the young nation's history. The key players are the URDP, the USRDP and the UDKhP. Out of the three, the URDP commands the greatest legacy; Viacheslav Prokopovych's government may be remembered favourably for decades to come as it carried Ukraine through its most difficult time yet. But the USDRP has become quite the powerful force the years since the last election, attempting to appeal to the workers and peasants alike. Under the leadership of Isaak Mazepa and Panas Fedenko, they perhaps pose the most credible threat to the rule of the URDP. Finally, a dark horse still remains in the electoral race, the UDKhP. Though their membership has somewhat diminished in recent years, they have attempted to recover their image and they have denounced some of the excesses of Pavlo Skoropadskyi's regime, something that was rather rare before. The UDKhP lack the votes necessary to win the election outright, but their presence may turn out to be a crucial factor this election."
 ukraine_danylo.23.a: "The Radical Democrats secure victory again!"
 ukraine_danylo.23.b: "The Radical Democrats form a coalition with the Democratic Agrarians!"
 ukraine_danylo.23.c: "A victory from behind for the Social Democratic Workers Party!"

 ukraine_danylo.24.t: "Investigation to the Hetman's Demise"
 ukraine_danylo.24.d: "The Cherkasy Police District has been investigating the cause of the train crash that ended up in the demise of the late Hetman. The process has been slow due to the sheer number of possibilities, as dozens of people had access to the train and the tracks. The use of explosives has been all but disproven, though it only complicates the situation. Leading detective Mykhailo Prokopenko is currently following the theory that the locomotive was sabotaged to cause catastrophic derailing.\n\nBut sabotaged by whom? It turns out that at least one of the train's brakemen, \"Shevchenko\", was never found, dead or alive. The other surviving men in the locomotive's crew could not tell much of this person, as most of them were hastily recruited strike-breakers due to most of the railway workers being on strike. It seems probable that this missing person is the one behind sabotage.\n\nBut if it is a case of deliberate sabotage by a worker, why and who was he? Was he aware of the critical negotiations between Doroshenko and the VDR leadership? Initially it was assumed that he might have been a socialist militant, who might have tried to spark unrest through his actions - and this is definitely the least politically questionable reading. However, as long as this Shevchenko remains at large, we cannot say anything more.\n\nIt does seem a curious coincidence that the Hetman was removed from the game at such important moment. Had it not happened, negotiations might have collapsed - it is hard to see any other outcome. Perhaps the identity of this Shevchenko will remain in history as Ukraine's greatest unsolved crime."
 ukraine_danylo.24.a: "Quit with the conspiracies."

 ukraine_danylo.25.t: "A Reputation Remade"
 ukraine_danylo.25.d: "One could have reasonably said that Hetman Danylo Skoropadskyi's cheerful attitude, soft-spokenness and calm attitude have made him prone to being influenced by others. For years, the USKhD and SHD in particular sought to use him as a pawn for their ambitions. Pavlo kept distant from the SHD for much of his reign even if he recognised them as patriots and loyal supporters, and the USKhD had always been frustrated by his independent and strong-willed nature. Those factors made influencing the Hetman's heir a prime objective for the two autocratic organisations, and to anyone in the Hetman's circle, Danylo's aloofness to politics would have surely made him a puppet should anything have happened to his father.\n\nThose predictions, of course, have not turned out how many have expected. Surely, Hetman Danylo continues to fulfil his constitutional duties and little more, and frequently refuses to make overt comments on national politics, as is undefined protocol for monarchs under a democratic, parliamentary system. But far from being uninvolved, it was Danylo's initiative that led the reformists to victory, and for bloodshed to be avoided when tensions seemed to be at their highest. In a moment where many expected him to be indecisive, he seemed to be the man of the hour when it most mattered.\n\nPerhaps his actions are best attributed to a man of his character. It is not just about ideology and the desire to rule, but doing what is best for the people. Despite his father's efforts to bring about the latter, it was ideology that blinded him. Ironically, a man experienced in politics for almost two decades seemed to not have the solution, and one with very little experience seemed willing to provide one that, in the end, has borne fruit.\n\nIt could be said that those in the URDP, and Otaman-Minister Dmytro Doroshenko in particular, had just as much, if not more, initiative in the creation of a new, democratic state. Even if that is true, one must ask the question of whether or not they could have succeeded without the new Hetman's backing. Much fewer would answer yes to that question, but at the end of the day, it's not what matters. Prosperity and peace is ahead of us, and the tireless work of those who sought to create it will never be forgotten."
 ukraine_danylo.25.a: "For Ukraine, we lay down our heads."

 ukraine_danylo.26.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ukraine_danylo.26.d: "Elections are being held again to elect delegates to the Soim. Two major parties, the URDP and USDRP, have the best shot at victory. Who will come out on top this year?"

### AuthDem Events ###
 ukraine_coalition.1.t: "The Ukrainian Elections of [GetYear]"
 ukraine_coalition.1.d: "Originally scheduled for sometime in November 1936, the Ukrainian elections were postponed due to the revolt. But with the revolt now over, the elections were able to proceed. Low turnout characterised the elections of the year; the lack of a powerful and unified Radical Democratic Party, which split as a result of the revolt, contributed to a sense of aloofness penetrating the national mood.\n\nNaturally, the coalition between the Agrarian Democratic Party and the Agrarians-Statists have won the elections, but the result was peculiar. The Agrarians-Statists' more ideological nature has proven to be a boon, as their electorate was more easily mobilisable than that of the Agrarian Democrats. Although the Agrarian Democratic Party retains more seats than the Agrarians-Statists, the latter have outperformed expectations.\n\nSkoropadskyi has appointed Serhii Shemet, leader of the Agrarians-Statists, as Otaman-Minister. Despite the Agrarians-Statists' newfound power in the coalition, the organisation faces opposition from every corner, the Agrarian Democrats and the Hetman now watching its every move. Only time will tell if they are able to fulfil their promises of transforming the Ukrainian State."
 ukraine_coalition.1.a: "The first partisan government?"

 ukraine_coalition.2.t: "Fate of the Conspirators"
 ukraine_coalition.2.d: "Arguably the leader of the Union of Hetmanites, Borys Homzyn has wielded significant influence in the executive office for years; while no coup attempt took place, it was clear that Homzyn and the rest of the SHD were attempting to wrestle power for themselves during the revolt.\n\nNow that the dust has settled and the Hetman's Coalition has cemented its position, one question remains: what do we do with the conspirators?\nWhile Homzyn does not wield the same political influence he once did, even with the Hetman himself, he represents a number of opportunities for the Agrarians-Statists, as he continues to possess connections in the security services, army, and police. By striking an unlikely alliance with Homzyn in exchange for letting us use these connections, the Agrarians-Statists' bid to power may become easier. On the other hand, accepting his influence may seem like a desperate attempt, and siding with a man who is seen as a potential conspirator may earn us more trouble than anything else. Reducing his role in the executive office and relegating him to a minor position, effectively exiling him from any political influence, could win us the hearts of many who want to see law and order restored to the country and traitors dealt with."
 ukraine_coalition.2.a: "Strike an alliance with Homzyn."
 ukraine_coalition.2.b: "Relegate him to some minor post in [201.GetName], or something like that."

 ukraine_coalition.3.t: "Fate of General Prisovskyi"
 ukraine_coalition.3.d: "The second most important official in the SHD, General Kostiantyn Prisovskyi, represents a difficult challenge for the Agrarians-Statists. Unlike Homzyn or Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, he maintains a degree of popularity, especially among the military; he is well-known for suppressing the peasant revolts of 1919-1920 and he played a main role in ridding the nation of Makhno's anarchist bandits that same year. This degree of high regard for Prisovskyi has made Shemet and the Agrarians-Statists apprehensive in attempting to move against him, but due to his clear connections to the SHD, forcing him into an early retirement may be a possible option. However, such a move would surely draw the ire of the military and perhaps the Hetman himself, given the long connections between the two."
 ukraine_coalition.3.a: "He is still needed."
 ukraine_coalition.3.b: "He is overdue for a long deserved retirement."

 ukraine_coalition.4.t: "Fate of Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia"
 ukraine_coalition.4.d: "As the head of the Great Cossack Rada, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia wields significant influence among cossack institutions in Ukraine. Nonetheless, among the SHD, he is seen as heavily unreliable, personally ambitious and adventurous, which plays into our favour and should make him easy to deal with. During the revolt, Poltavets-Ostrianytsia commanded a group that had few desertions to republican forces, and as such he is regarded somewhat highly, but many have pointed to his conduct during said revolt as violent and unscrupulous. Having him lose his leadership of the Great Cossack Rada would take less effort and take care of the issue quickly, but bringing him to trial on charges of abuse of power may be a show of strength that the Agrarians-Statists desperately need as they try to cling onto power."
 ukraine_coalition.4.a: "Replace his position as leader of the Great Cossack Rada."
 ukraine_coalition.4.b: "Bring him to trial."

 ukraine_coalition.5.t: "A Last Nail in the Coffin"
 ukraine_coalition.5.d: "The final step has been taken to enshrine the rule of the Agrarians-Statists. The Soim, gradually weakened by infighting and increasing irrelevance, has taken a backseat to the institutions of the USKhD such as the All-Ukrainian Class Assembly and the Council of Jurors. With the direct approval of the Hetman and Otaman-Minister, the head of the Council of Jurors, Mykola Kochubei, convened a congress comprised from representatives of local class councils and the All-Ukrainian Class Assembly, declaring the disbandment of the Soim and the transfer of its powers to the Assembly.\n\nPolitical parties have been restricted, with class councils becoming the sole form of political representation across the state. The reaction of what used to be the UDKhP has thus far been muted; a few of its most prominent officials became part of the Council of Jurors, while the Democratic Caucus lamented the \"unconstitutional coup\" that has just taken place and vowed to fight for democracy, though it seems their efforts are mostly in vain."
 ukraine_coalition.5.a: "This is not a coup, I swear!"

 ukraine_coalition.6.t: "Paving the Way"
 ukraine_coalition.6.d: "With the overall situation gradually stabilising and reconstruction nearing to its end, Otaman-Minister Serhii Shemet has called for a conference to \"expand the mandate of the Hetman's Coalition in view of new political developments\". Despite significant scrutiny and resistance to the Otaman-Ministership being held by a member of the Agrarians-Statists, it remains clear that the coalition under Shemet's rule has been one of, at least so far, stability and peace. At the conference Shemet, likely convinced by Kochubei and his followers, plans to push for inclusion of several more radical proposals in coalitional programme, like the creation of local class councils as well as the elevation of the Council of Jurors to the status of a national institution."
 ukraine_coalition.6.a: "Let's see how this goes."

 ukraine_coalition.7.t: "An Illusion of Unity"
 ukraine_coalition.7.d: "Rumours have been spread around of a \"pact\" between Serhii Shemet's allies and politicians close to UDKhP figure Ihor Kistiakovskyi; apparently, in exchange for generous government positions, parts of the UDKhP would support Shemet's agenda and vote for certain classocratic ideas to be included in the Hetman's Coalition's programme. The rumours have spread so far that Mykola Mikhnovskyi addressed it today to members of the Democratic Agrarian Party saying that if such negotiations exist, then they should be conducted in the open, not in secret, as such secrecy ruins the unity of the party. He even pointed to Kistiakovskyi being the possible culprit of such a deal, invoking his reputation as political manipulator in quite mocking manner. Regardless of whether or not the rumours are true, it's clear that inter-party unity has been strained and that the Agrarian Democrats are more disunited than ever..."
 ukraine_coalition.7.a: "Perfect."

 ukraine_coalition.8.t: "The Last Appeal of Plutocrats"
 ukraine_coalition.8.d: "In response to Serhii Shemet's plans regarding new coalitional conference the democratic caucus of the UDKhP has declared its intention to boycott it, encouraging other UDKhP members to do the same. It is clear as day, they argued, that Shemet intends to capitalise on his recent successes in tackling the post-revolt crisis. The \"expansion of the mandate\", according to them, is nothing more than plain power grab, designed to advance USKhD anti-democratic agenda. While the plea wasn't heeded by many, this demarche only increased divisions inside the party. Although many among the UDKhP chose to ignore these concerns, it is obvious that party delegation at the conference will be at disadvantage, given all the internal disagreements."
 ukraine_coalition.8.a: "Everything is going just as planned!"

 ukraine_coalition.9.t: "A Triumph Long in the Making"
 ukraine_coalition.9.d: "A clueless onlooker might assume that this gathering of the Hetman's coalition isn't all that different from numerous previous ones, including the one that was held very recently, in the aftermath of the last Soim elections.\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nGone is the usual confidence of the UDKhP members. Mikhnovskyi's remarks seem to be subdued in tone. Kistiakovskyi, normally impeccably concentrated, is rather unfocused. He is suddenly just an old man, unsure of his future. Nervous glances are constantly thrown at several empty rows reserved for the UDKhP delegates: apparently the call for boycott was heeded more widely than it was anticipated. Independent representatives are gathered in small groups: the voices are hushed, the options considered all seem unsatisfying in one way or another.\nThe delegation of the Union of Agrarians-Statists seems to be in control for the first time in the history of the Hetman's Coalition. Serhii Shemet managed to win the favour of Pavlo Skoropadskyi: where Lypynskyi's single-mindedness was rejected, Shemet's perceived pragmatism was welcomed. As it befits a recognised leader, his words at the conference were the first and the last.\n\nThe majority of talking in between was done by Mykola Kochubei: he painted a vision of a strong Ukraine, undivided by petty partisan politicking and united around the banner of a Labour Hereditary Monarchy. The first steps towards this dream are the most important ones: local class councils should be sufficiently empowered, their activities overseen by the impartial Council of Jurors. Of course the membership of the Council won't be limited to the members of the USKhD, with Independents and the UDKhP gaining the appropriate share of the seats for themselves.\nIn the end, the final vote on the proposed changes was won by the slightest of margins, but it was enough. The transformation of the Ukrainian State begins now."
 ukraine_coalition.9.a: "Time to get to the real work."

 ukraine_coalition.10.t: "The Cossack Kin Has No End?"
 ukraine_coalition.10.d: "Formal restoration of the cossack social estate was one of the first measures undertaken by Skoropadskyi upon taking power in 1918. This militarised, landowning quasi-aristocracy was supposed to become a backbone of the new conservative order. With time, an elaborate structure of self-government was put in place, starting with local cossack councils (radas) and all the way up to the Great Cossack Rada.\nAfter almost two decades, the results of the experiment seem to be mixed. Bestowed with various privileges such as a right to assist local law enforcement structures, ability to influence local politics through cossack councils and, most importantly, freedom to gather their own armed militia forces, cossacks in the end failed to become anything more than glorified landowning paramilitary laying often flimsy claims to the traditions of old.\n\nAt least, that's a widely accepted opinion among significant parts of the Hetman's coalition. The revolt has only exacerbated concerns and suspicions regarding the issue. Cossack militias were instrumental in its suppression, but poor discipline and a sometimes misplaced sense of duty had led to a number of regrettable incidents. In order to keep the state's monopoly on violence inviolable something must be done.\n\nTwo proposals have emerged: in the USKhD cossack councils were long regarded as a promising foundation for classocratic structures. Surely, a degree of their militarisation should be drastically lowered, but the councils themselves would be useful for the Ukrainian state. For the UDKhP even this is too much: they envision a gradual transformation of these assemblies into purely ceremonial bodies, dedicated solely to the preservation and celebration of rich Ukrainian culture."
 ukraine_coalition.10.a: "Better to reduce these councils to the cultural clubs over time."

 ukraine_coalition.11.t: "Downfall of the Shemet Cabinet"
 ukraine_coalition.11.d: "When the Union of Agrarians-Statists suddenly came to be the dominant part of the Hetman's Coalition things were looking up for them. They had suddenly been handed the opportunity of a lifetime, and they were not going to let it slip.\n\nIt seems that their ambition got the best of them; from the onset of Shemet's tenure as Otaman-Minister difficulties arose. The Agrarian Democrats, despite their big-tent nature and diversity, banded together in opposition to the USKhD, refusing to vote for any laws that they proposed and threatening to break up the coalition between the two. Behind the scenes, Shemet constantly bickered with the more ideologically inclined among the USKhD such as Mykola Kochubei, with little agreement on the measures needed to be taken to consolidate their rule. Though the aftermath of the republican revolt was supposed to be one of rebuilding and peace, it has instead turned to political chaos.\n\nTaking note on the situation, the Hetman privately spoke to Shemet that he has not met expectations and that he will be replaced soon; the Agrarian Democrats were jubilant, as they were informed that the replacement for the Otaman-Minister would come from their ranks, and they were encouraged to settle the question of party leadership. In the end, the tenure of Otaman-Minister Shemet has become the shortest in the country's twenty years of history..."
 ukraine_coalition.11.a: "A return to normalcy, perhaps?"

 ukraine_coalition.12.t: "Collapse of the USKhD"
 ukraine_coalition.12.d: "The now clear failure of the Agrarians-Statists has led to their complete collapse. The to-be final conference held in [221.GetName] was a disaster for all who attended; Shemet accused some in the USKhD of destroying any hope for serious implementation of their agenda, and that if they let him be responsible for most of the political manoeuvring, he would not be in the position he is now.\n\nSoon after, the former Otaman-Minister contacted the UDKhP in order to start the process of negotiations, stating his intent to join the ranks of the Democratic Agrarians. He wasn't alone in this decision, with many Agrarians-Statists choosing to abandon the USKhD in favour of the UDKhP. What had started as a promising party centred around the veteran of the conservative movement and the close confidant of the Hetman soon became an organisation plagued by narrow ideological doctrinarianism, woefully inadequate to the political realities of Ukrainian State. With the last ounce of credibility spent pursuing fancy and far-fetched projects, it was finally time to part ways.\n\nWith their main political backer gone, the USKhD faced a truly grim situation; the next day, as the unofficial head of the USKhD, Kochubei adopted to dissolve the organisation entirely. In its stead now exists the \"Brotherhood of Classocrats-Monarchists\", a small and mostly irrelevant ideological forum for Kochubei and other followers of Lypynskyi's thought."
 ukraine_coalition.12.a: "Good riddance."

 ukraine_coalition.13.t: "[202.GetName] Conference - the Agrarians' Preference"
 ukraine_coalition.13.d: "The conference called in order to determine the leader of the UDKhP (and subsequently a new Otaman-Minister) has finally started. Two titans of the party - Ihor Kistiakovskyi and Mykola Mikhnovskyi will compete for the post. The final result is by no means predictable, since the UDKhP is a large and non-homogeneous organisation rife with factionalism.\n\nThe Agrarian wing of the party is the strongest one, constituting its economic backbone. For a long time it was largely dominated by big landowners, who tend to support Kistiakovskyi as a cunning and well-connected political operator. However, in recent years the presence in the party of those advocating for the interests of small and middle farmers became more pronounced. They prefer Mikhnovskyi, since he always put defence of \"the honest Ukrainian peasant\" at the forefront of his agenda.\n\nWho will be able to secure the favour of the Agrarian wing?"
 ukraine_coalition.13.a: "Kistiakovskyi continues to secure agrarian support."
 ukraine_coalition.13.b: "The Agrarians shift their vote towards Mikhnovskyi!"

 ukraine_coalition.14.t: "[202.GetName] Conference - the Intelligentsia's Choice"
 ukraine_coalition.14.d: "The second issue is that of the nationalist, right-wing leaning intelligentsia. Mikhnovskyi is likely to secure their support, as he can credibly claim to be one of the leading figures in the fight for Ukrainian independence. Decades ago, while many among Ukrainian intelligentsia were advocating for autonomy within a federal Russia, Mikhnovskyi was one of the earliest advocates for complete and full independence; although his sometimes over the top rhetoric has alienated some, he has still earned great respect for his uncompromising stance. Still, Kistiakovskyi commands a certain respect in Ukrainian judicial community, which can influence a stance of the intellectual wing of the party to some degree."
 ukraine_coalition.14.a: "Kistiakovskyi sways the intelligentsia!"
 ukraine_coalition.14.b: "Mikhnovskyi continues his dominance."

 ukraine_coalition.15.t: "[202.GetName] Conference - the Independents' Favourite"
 ukraine_coalition.15.d: "The last and perhaps most important issue is for the two candidates to secure the support of independents - notably party returnee Serhii Shemet and his supporters. While Shemet is somewhat disgraced due to his short tenure as Otaman-Minister he still is one of the founders of the party and may be able to sway the vote, especially given his connections with the agrarian caucus of the party. Shemet was a long-time political associate of Mikhnovskyi in the right-leaning swathes of the National Movement from the days of the early 1900s - but on the other hand, Shemet has primarily gained his position by working close to the establishment, something that Kistiakovskyi represents better than Mikhnovskyi."
 ukraine_coalition.15.a: "Kistiakovskyi wins Shemet and his allies over."
 ukraine_coalition.15.b: "Shemet and Mikhnovskyi maintain their political friendship."

 ukraine_coalition.16.d1: "The [202.GetName] conference is over, and it seems that Ihor Kistiakovskyi has secured the vote of the Democratic Agrarians to become the new party leader. Promising a moderate course and Ukraine safe from radicals \"from within and without\", Kistiakovskyi was sent a letter of congratulations by the Hetman the next day, who announced to the Soim that Kistiakovskyi was to assume the position of Otaman-Minister."
 ukraine_coalition.16.d2: "The [202.GetName] conference is over, and it seems that Mykola Mikhnovskyi has secured the vote of the Democratic Agrarians to become the new party leader. Mikhnovskyi gave a speech focusing on the foreign threat to Ukrainian independence - chiefly that of Russia - and promised to fight against it at any cost. Mikhnovskyi was sent a letter of congratulations by the Hetman the next day, who announced to the Soim that Mikhnovskyi was to assume the position of Otaman-Minister."
 ukraine_coalition.16.a: "Congratulations, Mr. Kistiakovskyi."
 ukraine_coalition.16.b: "Congratulations, Mr. Mikhnovskyi."

 ukraine_coalition.17.t: "Formation of the UNSP"
 ukraine_coalition.17.d: "The Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party is about as much of a big tent party as the Agrarian Democratic Party - and this is something the Agrarian Democrats can take advantage of. For some time the centre and centre-right forces of the Radical Democrats have been rather unsatisfied with the left wing but have continued to be part of the party regardless; however, times are different now. The splintering of the Radical Democrats post-revolt, as well as the recent ascension of the Agrarian Democrats to power without the partnership of the USKhD created an opportunity for a new political alliance. Through the initiative of Otaman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] secret negotiations were conducted with Radical Democrat centrist figures such as Pylyp Pylypchuk and Volodymyr Dolenko to form a new, satellite party to the Agrarian Democrats.\n\nToday a new political party - the Ukrainian Peasants' People's Party - has been registered. It is broadly aligned with the Democratic Agrarians on the land and financial issues, though remains true to the old Radical Democrat values of popular representation and empowerment of the Soim. The formation of the party has infuriated many among the Radical Democrats who are increasingly concerned over their position in Ukrainian political sphere. Although the Ukrainian Peasants' People's Party is small, its existence may be enough to ensure majorities for the Agrarian Democrats in future elections, a potential development the latter are reportedly jubilant about."
 ukraine_coalition.17.a: "Much-needed allies."

 ukraine_coalition.18.t: "The Hetman's Powers"
 ukraine_coalition.18.d: "Throughout the existence of the Hetmanate Skoropadskyi has retained significant powers. He is able to veto laws that the Soim proposes, forcing the Soim to seek a compromise with the Hetman's interpretation, and has the right to appoint the Otaman-Minister without much regard for the composition of the Soim. The democratic caucus of the UDKhP has long pushed for the Hetman to become more of a figurehead not too dissimilar from many constitutional monarchs in Europe.\n\nBut with parliamentary reforms having reached an impasse at least so far, there seems to be little support for these measures. The UDKhP, after all, owe much of their position in Ukrainian politics to Skoropadskyi himself, whose intervention saved the conservative plurality against the URDP. In the end, it seems that any motion to curb his power will have to wait."

He is able to veto laws that the Soim proposes, forcing the Soim to seek a compromise with the Hetman's interpretation, and has the right to appoint the Otaman-Minister without much regard for the composition of the Soim.\n\nThe democratic caucus of the UDKhP has long pushed for the Hetman to become more of a figurehead not too dissimilar from many constitutional monarchs in Europe. With parliamentary reforms gaining traction there is a decent amount of support for this, but the executive office remains a powerful force, as do Skoropadskyi's advisors."
 ukraine_coalition.18.d3: "Throughout the existence of the Hetmanate Skoropadskyi has retained significant powers. He is able to veto laws that the Soim proposes, forcing the Soim to seek a compromise with the Hetman's interpretation, and has the right to appoint the Otaman-Minister without much regard for the composition of the Soim. The democratic caucus has long pushed for the Hetman to become more of a figurehead not too dissimilar from many constitutional monarchs in Europe.\n\nAs three significant reform proposals giving more power to the Soim have been passed, the democratic caucus of the UDKhP has been greatly empowered, and this idea only seems to be a natural evolution of the current political trend."
 ukraine_coalition.18.a: "The Hetman must remain a politically pivotal force."
 ukraine_coalition.18.b: "Perhaps there is a compromise on the issue?"
 ukraine_coalition.18.c: "The Hetman will become a truly constitutional monarch."

 ukraine_coalition.19.t: "An Unsustainable Compromise"
 ukraine_coalition.19.d: "To the now UDKhP-dominated Soim, as well as Independents and others aligned to a reformist cause, one thing is for certain. The Anti-Hetman Revolt and the failures of the short-lived Shemet government have exposed deep flaws in the Hetmanist system. Even prior, the failures of the government to enact meaningful land reform and industrialisation have illustrated that should the government survive in the future, it cannot continue to do so through mere brute force.\n\nThe root of the issue lies within the executive office. For too long, the Soim has been pushed to the side in favour of Skoropadskyi and his close circle of advisors. Despite the Hetman's promises to uphold a democratic system, true democracy has never come.\n\nAll these ills have surely put a dent in confidence in the Hetman, however, and with the UDKhP government now unrestrained by more authoritarian forces in the now-defunct Hetman's Coalition and the backroom politicking of the SHD, an opportunity has arisen. We should by no means seek to abolish the Hetmanate itself - the People's Republic has already shown it is incapable in any capacity - but by working towards the empowerment of the Soim and curbing the Hetman's authority over time, we may be able to fix many of the issues the state has been plagued by for years."
 ukraine_coalition.19.a: "A tall task indeed..."

 ukraine_coalition.21.t: "Corruption from VSZV and Protofis?"
 ukraine_coalition.21.d: "Rumours have been circulated regarding possible interference from VSZV and Protofis in the new USKhD dominated government. According to these rumours, several members of VSZV and Protofis are using their finances and social standing to influence the process of formations and elections to local and regional class councils. The alliance between the USKhD and these lobbying organisations has been quite uneasy from the beginning and many are rather alarmed by this development. We could choose to investigate the matter further, but further rifts between the alliance our government has made with VSZV and Protofis may look bad considering the commitment to the alliance we have made."
 ukraine_coalition.21.a: "Investigate the matter further."
 ukraine_coalition.21.b: "Come back when you have some REAL evidence."

 ukraine_coalition.22.t: "Real Evidence"
 ukraine_coalition.22.d: "It seems that the rumours were true; an investigation into VSZV and Protofis has unearthed plenty of evidence pointing to the machinations of unbelievable proportions. Officials tied to the alliance have lobbied local class councils to favour big landowners and industrialists at the cost of poorer farmers and small businessmen in exchange for greater influence in the local and regional administration, leading to many of the most powerful class councils becoming those dominated by the alliance. This, of course, cannot stand, but wholly dismissing VSZV and Protofis would be an unwise choice. We must figure a way to deal with them one way or another."

 ukraine_coalition.23.a: "Quietly dismiss them..."

 ukraine_coalition.24.t: "Elections Announced"
 ukraine_coalition.24.d: "With the revolt now over and the situation slowly stabilising, the Hetman today made an address on the radio announcing that the elections originally scheduled for November were to be held in the next few weeks. As opposed to previous elections, there is a lack of excitement among the general population who mostly just want to see a quick reconstruction and a return to normalcy.\n\nPredictions have been made as to who will gain a plurality in the Soim but it is assured that the Hetman's Coalition will continue its rule - the URDP has been rocked by defections and splits ever since the revolt, and the lack of a powerful opposition will surely elevate the coalition to an even stronger position. Another point of notice is that of the USKhD - its fate remains uncertain, and the election of [GetYear] may be a pivotal moment for them."
 ukraine_coalition.24.a: "Whatever happens, hopefully there is no violence."

 ukraine_coalition.25.t: "Of Those without a Class"
 ukraine_coalition.25.d: "In the recent weeks the chancellery of the Otaman-Minister has been flooded with a flurry of petitions, complaints, requests and sometimes even demands mostly originating from the various professional organisations of lawyers, doctors, teachers and other professions deemed non-producing. The All-Ukrainian Union of Medical Workers, [202.GetName] Judicial Society, Association of Ukrainian Teachers, Union of Journalists, National Academy of Sciences and many, many others - all demand the same level of representation in the class councils as was given to the agrarian and industrial organisations.\n\nThe situation is tricky. On one hand, these professionals are crucial for society and the country and many of them surely possess only the genuine desire to serve the nation without any political aspirations. On the other hand, time and time again history has shown us that people without strong roots in the traditional structures of producing classes often lack the sense of responsibility towards the society as a whole and are frequently guided by their own petty ambitions. This is what ultimately doomed the People's Republic in 1917 - too much was decided by lawyers, writers and publicists, while those working the land or ensuring the country's industrial development were left outside of the decision making process.\n\nWe should not repeat this mistake, but perhaps a compromise solution is possible?"
 ukraine_coalition.25.a: "We already support these organisations, do we not?"
 ukraine_coalition.25.b: "They may play only an advisory role in the class councils."
 ukraine_coalition.25.c: "Agree to the demands."

 ukraine_coalition.26.t: "Issues with Class Councils"
 ukraine_coalition.26.d: "Our decision to favour the agrarian class over all others has led to some issues. Already for some time the representatives of various industrial associations have been claiming that the arrangement of class councils was too shifted in favour of agricultural organisations. They refuse to see that despite all the successes of industrialisation Ukraine is still a very agrarian country and we can't simply ignore social and economic realities of our state. It's only natural that the agrarian class should take the leading role in the national governance. Still, for the sake of the stability of our country we must address these complaints one way or another."
 ukraine_coalition.26.a: "Ignore them."
 ukraine_coalition.26.b: "Try to strike a compromise."
 ukraine_coalition.26.c: "Use Homzyn's contacts to silence the loudest complainers."

 ukraine_coalition.27.d: "The position of the USKhD as the superior partner in the Hetman's coalition has worried many, especially those in the Democratic Agrarian Party. Some of its party bosses are afraid that the new order of things may threaten their position; the support of some of the UDKhP's membership is instrumental in ensuring the USKhD can continue its rule, although we must attempt to be uncompromising in our vision."
 ukraine_coalition.27.a: "Their concerns shall fall on deaf ears."
 ukraine_coalition.27.b: "Try to reassure them."
 ukraine_coalition.27.c: "Use Homzyn's contacts to blackmail them."

 ukraine_coalition.28.t: "A Major Cabinet Shakeup?"
 ukraine_coalition.28.d: "Thus far, Kistiakovskyi's term as Otaman-Minister has gone rather smoothly - land reform is underway, and the grand industrialisation project is giving Ukraine the necessary materials to build a powerful army. For the first government dominated by the Democratic Agrarians, it seems that they have met expectations, in some cases exceeding them.\n\nWhile the accomplishments of the new Hetman's government have not gone unnoticed problems still have arisen, one regarding Kistiakovskyi himself. A rumour has spread throughout the cabinet that Kistiakovskyi, due to poor health, intended to resign as Otaman-Minister and even proposed his resignation to the Hetman. But no public announcement has been made regarding it, and one could only come to the conclusion that the Hetman refused his proposal. Several answers as to why have been speculated; some say that since Shemet's tenure lasted for such a short period of time, it has become necessary to promote a more stable and long-lasting cabinet. Others agree, but they highlight the importance of foreign powers as well; the Hetman's government must not look weak and unstable in the face of rising Russian revanchism and Internationale warmongering.\n\nPrivately, the rumours have been confirmed to be true, as Kistiakovskyi spoke to his circle about the situation. He stated that although he does not intend to resign, a successor to his leadership must be found. After much internal debate, they settled on Volodymyr Korostovets because of his long-standing tenure in the Foreign Ministry, a breadth of contacts with both the Canadian and the recently recognised Revolutionary British Governments, as well as his overall moderate political leaning. It is expected that he will be able to continue the course set up by Kistiakovskyi."
 ukraine_coalition.28.a: "Best of luck to Mr. Korostovets!"

His legacy will be that of a successful career, one that modernised the Ukrainian State and brought it into a new era. Although it has been more than a year since the Russian invasion began, Ukraine has not yet been lost, and continues to ward off Russian aggression.\n\nIn a show of party unity and respect for Kistiakovskyi's will, Volodymyr Korostovets was confirmed as a leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party, and soon after was appointed Otaman-Minister by the Hetman and the Soim. In his inauguration speech, Korostovets vowed to continue Kistiakovskyi's legacy and ensure that the Ukrainian people would be united in the face of Russian aggression. Korostovets' history may not be as strong as Kistiakovskyi's, having served in less significant government positions all his life, but he has great experience in the Foreign Ministry, something many in the UDKhP respect him for - regardless, he is seen as a compromise candidate between the many factions of the party and someone who could bring the country together in times of despair."

 ukraine_coalition.30.t: "A Meeting in Oleksandrivka"
 ukraine_coalition.30.d: "As with many meetings preceding radical changes, this one was rather discreet. Otaman-Minister Serhii Shemet has received his fellow co-leader and chief ideologue of the USKhD, Mykola Kochubei, in his ancestral home in the small village of Oleksandrivka, to the southeast of Lubny. Two prominent Agrarians-Statists have gathered to discuss the future of the movement and of the country, now that Shemet's grip on national power seems solidified.\n\nKochubei was blunt: the revolt has decisively proved the correctness and profound wisdom of Viacheslav Lypynskyi's vision. As long as national politics are guided by classless demagogues and machinators who sway the gullible masses in pursuit of their own narrow interests, Ukraine will remain in danger. Times such as these require leadership capable of understanding what responsibility to fellow countrymen means, leadership rooted in the most organic social division imaginable - a class. The position of Hetman must also be redefined - a monarch isn't supposed to be \"the most powerful politician\" supported by the servile bureaucracy, culminating in an authoritarian dictatorship. The Hetman should serve as a symbol of unity for all Ukrainians, his task - to protect and preserve a tradition of justice, to serve as a balancing factor between creative impulses and will to power of national elites and receptivity of passive masses. Now that the USKhD has a real opportunity to bring this vision to life, indecisiveness is unacceptable. Otherwise, devoid of purpose, the organisation will cease to exist.\n\nThe monologue, rather resembling a lecture, continued for some time, but Shemet was accustomed to such meetings. In the end, it was agreed that certain points from this \"classocratic\" programme will be brought before the Hetman's Coalition for further consideration. The implementation, should the proposal be accepted, will fall to Kochubei himself, as newly elected head of USKhD Council of Jurors."
 ukraine_coalition.30.a: "Our cause is the most righteous one."

 ukraine_coalition.31.t: "An Audience"
 ukraine_coalition.31.d: "Not many have seen this outcome as most probable, but it is what it is: after a short period of deliberation, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the Hetman of All Ukraine, chose to invest Serhii Shemet, a leading figure in the USKhD, with the authority and responsibilities of the office of Otaman-Minister.\n\nThe audience granted to the would-be Otaman-Minister was brief, though, allegedly, not without its curious moments. Much later, in private, Shemet would recount that upon arrival he found Skoropadskyi idly thumbing through the pages of Viacheslav Lypynskyi's historical work \"Ukraine at a Tipping Point\". Putting the book aside, he in a rather dry and matter-of-factly manner informed Shemet about his decision. A relatively strong electoral performance, trusted advice from his close confidants and a \"longstanding history of hard work towards the wellbeing of all Ukraine\" were mentioned among the reasons for the appointment. Shortly before Shemet's departure, Skoropadskyi supposedly remarked that while Viacheslav Lypynskyi, who remained as the Hetman's personal advisor up to the moment of his death, was many things, he certainly didn't lack loyalty and true dedication - qualities hardly found among modern statesmen.\n\nApocryphal anecdotes aside, the reasons for this curious choice of Otaman-Minister were most likely quite prosaic. After the fiasco of Doroshenko's government, Skoropadskyi opted for the candidate whose backing in the Soim was strong enough to grant him certain legitimacy, but not strong enough to give the ability to act independently."
 ukraine_coalition.31.a: "A long awaited opportunity to realise Lypynskyi's vision?"

 ukraine_coalition.32.t: "One Crucial Step"
 ukraine_coalition.32.d: "Today delegates elected by local class councils from all over the country gathered in [202.GetName] to inaugurate a new legislative body: the All-Ukrainian Class Assembly. From now on, representatives of producing classes will be able to assist in coordination of economical and political matters on the highest level, as the special decree of the Council of Jurors has given the Assembly a significant degree of authority in questions of economic development and even a right to veto Soim legislative proposals.\n\nThe initial session was attended by Otaman-Minister Serhii Shemet, head of the Council of Jurors Mykola Kochubei and, most importantly, his Most Serene Highness Hetman of all Ukraine, Pavlo Skoropadskyi himself. He addressed the solemn gathering with words of encouragement, stating that \"hard-working and diligent people infused with true love to our country always constituted its greatest strength\".\n\nThe first question on the agenda was the election of the Speaker of the Assembly. Vasyl Kochubei, a former member of the VSZV and the older brother of Mykola Kochubei, received the majority of the votes, thus becoming the first state-level official elected in office in accordance with the classocratic principles since the election of Hetman Skoropadskyi in 1918.\n\nHowever, not everyone chose to celebrate this truly momentous occasion. There are numerous voices claiming that \"parallel legislative authority\" will inevitably lead to the \"erosion of the constitutional order\", but who cares about ramblings of plutocrats feeling how their power, undeserved in the first place, is slipping from them?"
 ukraine_coalition.32.a: "Our first real achievement."

 ukraine_coalition.33.t: "The Sovereign"
 ukraine_coalition.33.d: "Many things have changed over the recent years, and one of them is the role played by the Hetman in the day-to-day affairs of the state. The extensive meetings with the cabinet and advisors are mostly relegated to the past, replaced with weekly audiences granted to the Otaman-Minister alone. Public appearances, however, especially together with the Hetmanych Danylo Skoropadskyi, are more frequent than ever. The Ukrainian people should not feel neglected by its sovereign and must be assured of the stability and continuity of the Hetman's rule.\n\nThese changes haven't come easily and at first caused a great deal of controversy. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was a demanding person: in his opinion career politicians fell short when it came to responsibility and selflessness, while professional civil servants often lacked vision and dedication. As such, the Hetman was forced to constantly keep a keen eye on the political developments, laying down strategic objectives while simultaneously curbing the worst excesses of the political class.\n\nSo, when Serhii Shemet and Mykola Kochubei (each, without a doubt, for his own reasons) suggested toning down Hetman's personal involvement in the governance, the first reaction was quite negative. Still, with time, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became more open to the idea: advancing age tempered his inclinations towards excessive control, while classocratic reforms brought a degree of predictability to political life. With partisan divisions lessened, state affairs were now in the hands of more pragmatic and businesslike people.\n\nThe Hetman, however, wasn't completely left without cards to play. Shemet was clever enough to not disregard Skoropadskyi's opinions completely. Kochubei, as a true believer, was more unpredictable, but could be kept in check through his associates. The advancement of one of the Hetman's closest confidantes, Oleksandr Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi, to the post of the Secretary of the Council of Jurors would give the Hetman ample opportunity to steer it in preferred direction if such a need arises."

 ukraine_coalition.50.t: "Oleksandr Paltov's Influence"
 ukraine_coalition.50.d: "Oleksandr Paltov has been seen visiting the Hetman's office several times this past week. Perhaps best described as a \"gray eminence\", Paltov is best known for his involvement in the creation of the Hetman's Coalition more than a decade ago. He served as deputy foreign minister in the early days of the Hetmanate, and authored many of its temporary laws - cementing his status as a rather anti-democratic figure. At the same time, he is seemingly more independent than those who have similar views, as he refused to join the SHD, although he advocated against Doroshenko's moderate course during the Anti-Hetman Revolt. The Hetman has gone on record commending Paltov's brilliance given his service to the state as well. It would appear that Paltov's most recent counselling has been focused on the reforms purposed by the Agrarian Democrats. Noting the specifics of Executive and Anti-Parliamentary Laws ratified on his (among others') insistence many years ago, Mr. Paltov argued that lifting one too many of them could spell disaster for the state and its institutions, destroying the recently achieved stability and peace. Should we heed the advice of our \"gray eminence\" and put the brakes on Otaman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] or let them continue on?"
 ukraine_coalition.50.a: "Talk to the Hetman directly, curtail his influence."

 ukraine_coalition.51.t: "Advice of General Shapoval"
 ukraine_coalition.51.d: "As the parliamentary debate rages on, Hetman Skoropadskyi's Executive Office has received an emergency summon from one of its most notable members, General Oleksandr Shapoval. Mr. Shapoval has been a long-standing sympathiser of the Hetman and the Hetmanist Movement at large, including associations with various Conservative parties and organisations, like the SHD. Even longer still, Shapoval has been a leading military officer, assisting with the growth of our army into the formidable force that it is today. For such loyalty and efficiency, Mr. Shapoval garnered a position close to the Hetman.\n\nSo it was no surprise to hear that Shapoval decided to call upon a summon with the Hetman due to his \"concern\" of the transfer of certain responsibilities to the Soim. Noting that a significant foundation of the Hetman's rule is based on executive power, he proclaimed that it would be better for the stability of the state's institutions for the Hetman to limit the \"intensity\" of recent \"parliamentarisation\" reforms. Of course, the question then arises. Should we heed General Shapoval's fairly non-specific advice or keep our \"hands off\" for now?"
 ukraine_coalition.51.a: "Surely his words don't mean much, we can consider it."
 ukraine_coalition.51.b: "No comment on the matter."

 ukraine_coalition.53.t: "An Intriguing Treatise!"
 ukraine_coalition.53.d: "While the Otaman-Minister's Office and the State Soim are burning with the discussion over Constitutional Amendments and Electoral Laws, our good old friend Mr. Oleksandr Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi has come into the limelight once again. A prolific researcher (when not too busy with chancellery work), Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi's research has been focused on Ukrainian-German relations and their development. So it should come as no surprise that his recently-published treatise focuses on exactly that. Echoing his earlier warnings, the central thesis of Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi's Major treatise follows through with another caution over perceived instability that will stem from these reforms. Noting that Germany is Ukraine's greatest and most important ally, the \"dangers of devolving too much authority to the State Soim, which harbours German-sceptical forces, is too great\". Mr. Chancellor has once again given us much to think about."
 ukraine_coalition.53.a: "Very interesting. Makes a lot of sense!"
 ukraine_coalition.53.b: "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?"

 ukraine_coalition.54.t: "The Great Cossack Rada Protests!"
 ukraine_coalition.54.d: "Our relations with the revived Cossack strata haven't always been the greatest... so it's no wonder that the recently launched reform project has been fraught with controversy within the Cossack ranks. How could they not be, considering the end-point of the revision is a notably more powerless Cossackdom? Even though Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, the former head of the Rada, Cossackdom in general and one of the leaders of the profoundly anti-parliamentary SHD, has had his career \"cut short\", there's still a clear idea within the Cossacks that the Soim should be treated with caution. The newly-elected Cossack Leader, Hnat Zelenevskyi may have much better relations with the Hetman than his predecessor, but is hardly expected to be \"rosy\" with the Hetman's Coalition either. Hetman Skoropadskyi is assaulted with another difficult decision - should we try and keep some limited authority within the strata?"
 ukraine_coalition.54.a: "They've done enough for us... no compromises."
 ukraine_coalition.54.b: "They've done enough for us! A compromise is necessary."

 ukraine_coalition.56.t: "A New Audience with Hetman Skoropadskyi!"
 ukraine_coalition.56.d: "An intervention from the highest echelons of the State Chancellery! Just recently, a certain Oleksandr Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi has requested an audience with the rest of the Hetman's Executive Office. Mr. Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi is, himself, a member of the office and has enjoyed a good relationship with Hetman Skoropadskyi for years by now. Although outwardly a sympathiser of the former Agrarian-Statist Movement, he also found himself in decent standing with moderate Conservative figures, like former Otaman-Minister Doroshenko or the late statesmen Volodymyr Leontovych and Yevhen Chykalenko.\n\nWith such \"multi-vectored\" politics, Mr. Chancellor has clearly kept his cards open - which is why his recent incursion should not come as a surprise. At the latest Executive Office session, Mr. Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi noted that while he doesn't disagree with the fundamental idea behind the reforms pursued by the Otaman-Minister's Office, he believes that forcefully instituting the new doctrines could be harmful for their general success and that it would be best to take on more \"realistic timetables\", with the weakest possible opposition. The Hetman has heard out his appeal and has fallen into deep thought..."
 ukraine_coalition.56.a: "Mr. Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi is correct, we should follow his advice!"
 ukraine_coalition.56.b: "We've been on \"realistic timetables\" for more than 15 years by now. Enough!"

 ukraine_coalition.57.t: "Simferopol Calling"
 ukraine_coalition.57.d: "The Parliamentarisation Reforms launched by the Central Government will, naturally, impact every corner of our state. The Crimean Regional Government is no exception. Assessing the situation, the Crimean Leader Suleiman Sulkevych, has decided to request a visit from the Central Government's delegation to the Crimean Capital. The stated reason being \"negotiations over the implementation of reforms\". Headed by Vasyl Kochubei (no relation to the VSZV official), the delegation arrived in Simferopol and got straight to work.\n\nPrime Minister Sulkevych was surrounded by leading regional politicians like Asan Sabri Aivazov and Leon Krychynskyi; subsequently, Advisor Kochubei witnessed a heated discussion between the Crimeans. On one hand, Mr. Aivazov came out very strongly in support of the Otaman-Minister's reorganisation policies, noting that if implemented, the new State Organisation in Crimea would allow for a more \"representative\" and \"popular\" government. In contrast, Krychynskyi argued that while the project itself has some merit, owning to the \"peculiarities of Crimea's demographics\", the unilateral limiting of Prime Minister Sulkevych's powers could \"destabilise the political atmosphere\" in Crimea and invoke a reaction from the near abroad. After carefully analysing the arguments, Sulkevych made his decision and detailed it to Kochubei, who quickly rushed back to [202.GetName]. On the topic of the Parliamentarisation Reforms, Prime Minister of Crimea Suleiman Sulkevych has voiced his:"
 ukraine_coalition.57.a: "... support!"
 ukraine_coalition.57.b: "... opposition!"

 ukraine_coalition.59.t: "A Deal with VSZV/Protofis"
 ukraine_coalition.59.d: "In a private meeting between members of the UDKhP and VSZV/Protofis, the latter made an unexpected proposition. They are rather confident that with their extensive patronage networks, they would be able to ensure the electability of their preferred candidates \"for years to come\" and as such are quite interested in the Soim becoming a true counterbalance to the influence of the executive office. Apparently, some among VSZV/Protofis are tired from being over-reliant on personal connections with Hetman's close circle and would like to make their presence and influence in Ukrainian politics more \"institutional\". Thus, they explained, they would gladly provide funds to \"smooth\" the negotiations between the Soim and the executive office, as they also believe their position may not be secure with an emboldened Hetman. The offer is hard to pass up though some are cautioning against it."
 ukraine_coalition.59.a: "Sounds like a deal."
 ukraine_coalition.59.b: "We do not need their help."

 ukraine_coalition.60.t: "Lobbying Scheme Exposed"
 ukraine_coalition.60.d: "Somehow it seems as though our earlier deal with VSZV and Protofis has come to light. Though it has been criticised extensively in the Soim with officials in the lobbying alliance receiving great scrutiny - some of their officials even being removed from the government - the worst has come from the Hetman himself, who reportedly is planning to veto the upcoming reform proposal. Without Skoropadskyi's trust there is little we can do..."
 ukraine_coalition.60.a: "No way!"

 ukraine_coalition.70.t: "Elections at Last"
 ukraine_coalition.70.d1: "The post-war elections were widely observed to be the fairest perhaps since the Hetman's ascension. Tragically the conservative establishment woke up into the need of reforms only after the 1936 uprising - but Otaman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand]'s cabinet took in the reins soon after and embarked on an ambitious programme of social and political reforms. They led the country through both the land reform and the great war (for some landowners, threats of comparable seriousness) - and as their final achievement, free elections into the Soim, which is more democratic and legitimate than it has ever been in the Hetmanate.\n\nTake away many restrictions, and the electoral spectrum of Ukraine seems rather different. There was a major shift towards the centre. The URDP and small centre-left parties enjoyed success, but the largest victory came for [GetSecondInCommand]'s UDKhP and its recently established satellite organisation — the Peasants' People's Party, the UNSP. The Hetman is expected to appoint the centrist UDKhP-UNSP cabinet to oversee further democratisation."
 ukraine_coalition.70.d2: "The elections were more of the same, ending up with a victory for the UDKhP with gains for smaller parties. Minor political reforms did not meaningfully change the nation. While some new, less conservative delegates were elected to the Soim, there's little chance they will have much political influence. Instead, the Soim is still the second fiddle to the Hetman, his cabinet and his advisors, who wield true political power.\n\nThough it was expect for Mikhnovskyi or Korostovets to be appointed Otaman-Minister, the Hetman brought forth a new compromise candidate: Oleksandr Shapoval. Although not particularly beloved by much of the Soim, General Shapoval is well known for his career during the war, and he has attained quite the popularity as a result. Though behind closed doors many questioned the Hetman's decision, the Soim narrowly voted to accept Shapoval's appointment.\n\nShapoval enters the Otaman-Minister's office as an independent, much like Doroshenko in 1932. But while Doroshenko's appointment was a centrist compromise between the conservative and liberal forces in the Soim, it is in plain sight that Shapoval's appointment is of the Hetman's deliberations only. Perhaps the lip service to political reform will give the Hetmanite authoritarianism a decade or two of stability more..."
 ukraine_coalition.70.a: "The parliamentarians triumph."
 ukraine_coalition.70.b: "Reforms in name only..."

 ukraine_coalition.71.t: "Hetmanych and the Union"
 ukraine_coalition.71.d: "Dedication to the idea of Hereditary Labour Monarchy was always among the core tenets of the USKhD ideological framework. What they were seeking was a monarch, a keeper of timeless tradition, a quintessential Lord of Land, Order and Labour reigning over hard-working people of Ukraine, a measure to be judged against for both national aristocracy and masses, a personification of national greatness and sovereignty. However, when it comes to the person of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, this lofty ideal often clashed with the harsh reality. Stubborn, temperamental and often short-sighted, the Hetman was a difficult person to work with for the Agrarians-Statists.\n\nIt is of no surprise, then, that the USKhD has spared no time and effort trying to court and influence the royal heir - Hetmanych Danylo Skoropadskyi. Popular, mild-mannered and soft-spoken, but not without an inner strength, he became a living hope for more ideologically inclined members of USKhD, including the head of the Council of Jurors Mykola Kochubei. The Union meticulously curated the personal circle of Danylo Skoropadskyi and carefully arranged his every public appearance. Hetmanych was rigorously prepared for his future role under the watchful gaze of the Agrarians-Statists.\n\nHow successful were those efforts - hard to say for now, as Danylo's usual impeccably cheerful attitude could hide many things. Still, the royal line remains secured and this is a sufficient cause for celebration for many among the USKhD."
 ukraine_coalition.71.a: "To the Skoropadskyi dynasty, may they reign as long as Ukraine lives!"

 ukraine_coalition.72.t: "A Vision... Realised?"
 ukraine_coalition.72.d: "Mykola Kochubei is looking at the rather unostentatious gravestone in the Catholic part of the Baikove Cemetery in [202.GetName]. The inscription in two languages, Ukrainian and Polish, reads: \"Viacheslav Lypynskyi 1882 - 1933\". There is no epitaph.\nMykola Kochubei is deep in his thoughts. He sometimes visits the final resting place of his mentor, especially when dismay or uncertainty appear to overcome him. There seemingly are not any apparent reasons for such feelings now, but nevertheless, the sense of disquiet was strong enough to lead him here today.\n\nSo much work has been done. From the humble beginnings as the splitter from the mainstream conservative party to the force dominating the entire political scene - all the trials and tribulations only made the movement of Agrarians-Statists stronger, winnowing out those too weak-willed to pursue the ideal of strong and independent Ukraine. Still, as time moves on, new challenges appear and while by far the greatest of them, war against Russia, has been overcome, it is too early to become complacent.\n\nUkraine continues to suffer from its chaotic past: it's impossible to undo decades of neglect and irresponsibility in mere years. There are still plenty of those, even in the highest echelons of power, who would see the country weakened while pursuing their own petty interests. They manipulate those who are foolish and corrupt those who are dishonest, they raise an anger among the downtrodden and amass undeserved wealth by selling out their own people.\n\nNothing surprising then, that voices demanding the Union to take a more active and strong stance are becoming louder by the day. The movement, according to them, should become involved in the state governance much more directly and uncompromisingly, and any accusations of building \"a dictatorship\" be damned. Wasn't it Lypynskyi himself who wrote that transition to classocratic order goes so much smoother if undertaken in the conditions of ordered dictatorship than if attempted amidst the chaos of democracy?\nIt would be so easy to follow these voices, to sweep the old order away by the iron hand.\n\nBut this temptation, as many others, should be resisted. And so, feeling beset by friends and foes alike, Mykola Kochubei raises his eyes to the horizon. It's dark with the storm clouds."
 ukraine_coalition.72.a: "So much has been done. So much more work awaits still."

 ukraine_coalition.73.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ukraine_coalition.73.d: "Elections are taking place in Ukraine again this year. The political landscape has changed greatly since the Anti-Hetman Revolt and the war. Additionally, Danylo, the son of the late Hetman, now presides over the elections for the first time. Who will win?"
 ukraine_coalition.73.a: "The UDKhP take another victory!"
 ukraine_coalition.73.b: "The URDP wins over voters!"

### SHD Events ###
 ukraine_shd.1.t: "A Tale of Two Romantics"
 ukraine_shd.1.d: "Since its inception the SHD was pushed forward largely by the efforts of two key figures – Borys Homzyn and Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. The circle of the movement's initial founders was more broad, but with time these two came to define the Union's direction. While they ostensibly pursue a shared set of main goals, perhaps it's through the differences between the two that one can glean the true nature of the Union of Hetmanites-State Builders.\n\nFor Homzyn, the SHD is all about service. A service to the idea of modern Ukraine existing in harmonious agreement with its glorious Cossack past. This idea, in his eyes, is more than a blind veneration of archaic tradition or primacy of ritualist adherence to the customs of days gone, but an aspiration to build a state inspired and governed by spirit and high ideals of more chivalrous, knightly times. The days of the Hetmans were truly a golden age – a time when notions of freedom didn't equal petty individualism, when discipline in life and self-sacrifice in death served as guiding principles for any decent man. The spirit of that age, Homzyn is certain, can be returned and adapted to modern times.\nPoltavets-Ostriyanytsia, meanwhile, has a different flame in his heart. It's a fire of personal ambition, of adventurism, perhaps the same fire that pushed the brave, the bold and the reckless to establish a first fortress on an isle behind the Dnipro rapids – and start the glorious legend of the Zaporozhian Sich. Politics for him are not dissimilar to the daring Cossack raids of the faraway past – a test of mettle in the name of glory.\n\nParadoxically, it's perhaps thanks to the striking differences between the two that SHD managed to survive and succeed. The passions of each helped to attract different kinds of people to the Union and ensure its appeal for various audiences. However, it is now, with power finally secured, when the true test begins. Will these two so different romantics be able to preserve the unity of state they now rule?"
 ukraine_shd.1.a: "Time will tell."

 ukraine_shd.2.t: "On the Integration of Cossack Militias"
 ukraine_shd.2.d: "Cossacks have been part of maintaining law and order in Ukraine for a while now, and have always had a special place when it came to military affairs. However, the SHD is somewhat split on what should be the status of the Cossack militias. Most of the SHD has advocated for directly integrating the Cossack militias into the military. Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia has taken a different direction, however, saying that the Cossack militias should only answer to the Great Cossack Rada - which would effectively give him direct control of the Cossack militias."
 ukraine_shd.2.a: "Integrate the Cossack militias."
 ukraine_shd.2.b: "Keep the Cossack militias autonomous."

 ukraine_shd.3.t: "Righteous among Traitors?"
 ukraine_shd.3.d: "Although previously part of the Hetman's coalition, the UDKhP and USKhD fell out of favour with the Hetman after the enacting of martial law. Nonetheless, these organisations may be useful - while they do not share opinions on most things with the SHD, they do agree with some of its most important tenets, most notably the suppression of leftists.\n\nIn any case, the UDKhP and USKhD could be brought to the SHD's side, which would surely work towards the expansion of the SHD as a mass organisation. Opinions vary on to what extent we should attempt to absorb the willing members of these organisations; should we seek to bring them to our cause at any cost, or is the effort not worth potentially making the SHD a disunited organisation?"
 ukraine_shd.3.a: "Bribes and threats should be enough."
 ukraine_shd.3.b: "Encourage them to join us."
 ukraine_shd.3.c: "This will only bring us corruption and disunity."

 ukraine_shd.4.t: "Against Petty Adventurism"
 ukraine_shd.4.d: "During a session of the Council of Ministers, Otaman-Minister Borys Homzyn delivered a speech on a variety of topics, including the current state budget for ongoing land reform and industrialisation initiatives. He also commended the Union of Hetmanites for their selfless efforts towards building a stronger and more unified Ukrainian State, emphasising the important role of the state in providing guidance and leadership throughout.\n\nIn an unexpected departure from his usual speeches to the Council, Homzyn made reference to the presence of radical elements seeking to destabilise Ukraine, motivated by personal ambition and self-interest, rather than loyalty to the Hetmanate and its institutions. While no specific individuals or groups were mentioned, it was widely understood to be a veiled criticism of the growing influence of Poltavets-Ostrianytsia within the Union of Hetmanites. Homzyn's speech was received positively by the council, and it appears that he has successfully managed to exert his influence over the Union to align with his own objectives."
 ukraine_shd.4.a: "Good."

 ukraine_shd.5.t: "First Party Congress of the SHD"
 ukraine_shd.5.d: "As membership of the SHD swells, with their ranks now in the thousands, the organisation now finds itself in somewhat of an identity crisis. From the beginning, the SHD was created as an elite society of civil servants, politicians and officers during the 1925 uprisings, who supported the Hetman's hardline crackdowns against the Borotbysts. The SHD has always had a clear authoritarian and decisive anti-leftist stance; but even from the beginning, it was led by two men who would increasingly grow distant as their visions of what the Hetmanate would look like vastly differed. Now that membership is higher than ever, the need to define what exactly the SHD stands for is greater than ever, as factionalism and petty divisions must be curtailed.\n\nTo resolve these issues, Homzyn has announced the first party congress of the SHD in [202.GetName], officially marking its transformation from an elite organisation to a political party. At the party congress, Homzyn took to the podium to outline the party's stances. He explained that above all, preservation of the Hetmanate and the enthusiastic participation of all sectors of society, working together as one, organic community, are the first and foremost ideals of the SHD; anything else was secondary. Nonetheless, he highlighted the other main points of the SHD; that it is decidedly anti-socialist and advocates a centralised state, but it also holds to Ukraine's democratic traditions. Homzyn remained vague on when elections would be held in the future, but he remained adamant that like many other countries the SHD pursues democracy - only that it does so uniquely, to the conditions of the Hetmanate.\n\nFor Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, the expansion of the SHD is a mistake in of itself; the organisation must remain pure and unfettered from the mistakes of the Coalition, and the duties of cossack delegations must be expanded, believing that they should become a new agrarian aristocracy as it is natural and organic for the Hetmanate. He then presented these ideas at the party conference, perhaps knowing that this point isn't particularly popular."
 ukraine_shd.5.a: "Homzyn's position holds strong."
 ukraine_shd.5.b: "Poltavets-Ostrianytsia has a point."

 ukraine_shd.6.t: "Establishment of Hereditary Rule"
 ukraine_shd.6.d: "Ever since the Hetman's coming to power in 1918, the lineage of the Hetmanship was not established. Though it has been common knowledge that if Pavlo Skoropadskyi were to pass away, his son Danylo would take the position of Hetman, it has never been enshrined into law. With sufficient support among the Council of Ministers, as well as the tacit acknowledgement of Skoropadskyi's age, this law is finally to be passed.\n\nOne question, however, remains. During the debate on the law, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia argued that the appointment of the Hetman's heir should be confirmed by the Great Cossack Rada. Given the influence of the Great Cossack Rada, it could be argued that this would add legitimacy to the succession, but some are pointing it out as just another power grab by Poltavets-Ostrianytsia."
 ukraine_shd.6.a: "The Hetman's succession is now confirmed!"
 ukraine_shd.6.b: "... and the Great Cossack Rada shall confirm the succession!"

 ukraine_shd.7.t: "Dissolution of USKhD"
 ukraine_shd.7.d: "The absorption of many of the willing members of the USKhD into the SHD has been the straw that broke the camel's back for the former. When Black Monday hit Ukraine and the country was thrown into civil war months later, the small, yet influential movement believed they could have taken advantage of the turmoil and become the dominant organisation in the Hetman's coalition. Some have gone as far to say that Skoropadskyi once planned on appointing Serhii Shemet, the leader of the organisation, due to his personal closeness with the Hetman.\n\nLately, the already small organisation's membership has dwindled owing to the SHD's efforts to bring them into the government. Many of the less ideologically inclined and more pragmatic members of the organisation flocked to the SHD. With these developments, Mykola Kochubei, the main ideologue of the USKhD, has opted to dissolve the organisation, owing to its insignificant membership and lack of funding and support. In its place, Kochubei and the movement's most influential thinkers have rebranded the movement to the \"Brotherhood of Classocrats-Monarchists\", more accurately representing their main ideas. The new organisation, however, is small and politically irrelevant, and is doubted to make any headway soon, as the SHD continues its consolidation over the Ukrainian political scene."
 ukraine_shd.7.a: "Being overly concerned with ideological purity usually doesn't lend you any favours."

 ukraine_shd.8.t: "Corruption in the SHD"
 ukraine_shd.8.d: "The dominant conservative factions within the Hetmanate have traditionally espoused an economic policy that favours state interventionism. This is particularly evident in the case of the SHD, which has embarked on a programme of nationalising several key industries since assuming power. However, this policy has not been without its challenges, as the process of appointing state managers has been beset by allegations of corruption. Many bureaucrats, some of whom are believed to have close ties to Homzyn himself, have been accused of subsidising certain industries in exchange for a share of the profits. The identity of the individual responsible for uncovering these scandals remains unknown, though there are some who suspect Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, who has been actively working to undermine Homzyn's position for some time."
 ukraine_shd.8.a: "We must be ever vigilant."

 ukraine_shd.9.t: "Concerns of Landowners"
 ukraine_shd.9.d: "The emergence of influential Cossack councils as a result of the increasing power of the Great Cossack Rada has brought about a number of challenges in recent times. The Great Cossack Rada's growing influence has led to concerns among many in the SHD about the concentration of power and the implications this might have for governance.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues is the perceived overreach of the regional Cossack councils, as exemplified by the complaint from a local big landowner about the overzealous intrusion of local Cossack assembly in the process of land redistribution. This is just one of many grievances that have been raised against the councils, with many in the SHD believing that they are taking too much interest in matters that should be left to local authorities. Furthermore, there are growing concerns about the extent of the government's reliance on Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. Many in the SHD feel that Ostrianytsia has been given too much power, which has in turn emboldened his allies in the Cossackdom to overstep their bounds."
 ukraine_shd.9.a: "I see..."

 ukraine_shd.10.t: "Against Internal Divides"
 ukraine_shd.10.d: "The SHD has been struggling with issues of internal discord for quite some time. However, recent events have seen a marked increase in the unity of the group, thanks to the actions of Borys Homzyn. Working tirelessly behind the scenes to bring the various factions of the organisation together, his efforts have included extensive consultations with the members of the Council of Ministers, as well as a series of public addresses in which he emphasised the importance of unity in the face of external threats. As a result, there has been a greater sense of camaraderie and shared purpose among members, with many now working collaboratively towards common goals.\n\nHomzyn's efforts to foster greater unity within the SHD have had the unintended consequence of slowly sidelining Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. Despite Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's initial resistance, it has become increasingly clear that the tide has turned against him. Members of the SHD are now looking to Homzyn for leadership and guidance, with many seeing him as the driving force behind the renewed sense of purpose and unity within the organisation."
 ukraine_shd.10.a: "United as one."

 ukraine_shd.12.t: "Otaman-Minister Borys Homzyn"
 ukraine_shd.12.d: "The course of the last few months have shaped a Hetmanate that looks very different to the one that existed before. The SHD state-building project is a large departure from the visions of the Ukrainian State's previous conservative governments - whereas their version of tradition was that of a watchful Hetman balancing parliamentary and regional interests, the figures behind the Union of Hetmanites-State Builders can be described as neotraditionalists seeking to invest absolute power within the sacred institution of the Hetmanate and the ministers acting on its behalf. In their eyes, recent turmoil has vindicated their view that the Hetmanate and State are under siege, and the establishment of a neo-absolutist state is absolutely necessary for the forces of tradition to ward off the global onslaught of modernism.\n\nFew people fit this character as nicely as the new Otaman-Minister, Boris Homzyn. Homzyn is one of the founding members of the SHD, having had a long career in the affairs of military and security, forming a life dedicated to the service of the Hetmanate. In Homzyn's view, the date April 29th, 1918 marks two events that define the Ukrainian nation. The first event is the establishment of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, returning Ukraine to the status it held before 1654 - and the equally important second event was the foundation of the Hetmanist movement, which Homzyn views as the \"creative start\" of Ukraine's bright future, words befitting his hobby of writing poetry, plays, and prose.\n\nCentral to Homzyn's politics is his belief that, upon its independence, Ukraine once again was a Hetmanate, whereas the Russian state overthrew its monarchy - and because of this, Ukraine became a more legitimate state by returning to its natural form of government, something that Russia spurned. Homzyn's views on Russia have been known to take on unusual dimensions, expressing a view that the development of Bolshevism was not foreign to it, but rather a direct result of the Russian mentality and historical past. This goes hand-in-hand with his opposition to Russian expansionism, something that the SHD government adopts as one of its raison d'être. The belief of Homzyn and the SHD is that the Hetmanate is the guarantor of Ukraine's independence, and that its defence and empowerment is necessary to ensure that the nation remains as such - an opinion that informs their entire political programme."
 ukraine_shd.12.a: "The Hetmanate will defeat the dark forces!"

 ukraine_shd.13.t: "Abolition of Crimean Autonomy"
 ukraine_shd.13.d: "Today, with approval from Otaman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] and the Hetman, Crimea's autonomous status has been revoked. The decision - unusually, not a unanimous one - is the latest in a series of administrative reforms aimed at centralising power around the Hetman's government and a move justified by citing bureaucratic bloat and systemic inefficiencies in the Crimean government. For those building the new vision of a Hetmanate, such legal barriers can no longer be allowed to stand - if a law does not serve the needs of a rational and efficient state, then it must be set aside.\nThe decision has been a highly contentious one. During the deliberations, it was brought up repeatedly among the Council of Ministers that revoking Crimea's autonomy could have serious consequences and lead to separatism - the demographics of Crimea are remarkably mixed, consisting of Ukrainians, Tatars, as well as ethnic Russians and Russophones, many of whom have greatly appreciated the autonomy that had previously been granted to them. Indeed, the autonomy of Crimea was arguably instrumental to their accession into the Ukrainian State to begin with - and now that it's gone, the local popular reaction has been resoundingly negative.\n\nA solution was quickly found in the previous head of the Crimean government, Suleiman Sulkevych, who the council made a proposal to appoint as the Crimean Representative in the Council of Ministers. While he would not have the supreme veto over Crimean affairs that he once did, his presence and influence would give him a large voice in handling the government of Crimea, second only to the Otaman-Minister and the Hetman. Although not a particularly popular politician, Sulkeyvych's words carry great weight among the Crimean people, and his reassurances to the people have brought a degree of calm to the public outcry.\n\nNot long after the signing of the bill into law, Russia's foreign minister spoke of the move, accusing the government of oppressing ethnic Russians and Russian speakers and of imagined Ukrainian \"atrocities\". Foreign minister Adam Montrezor responded by stating that there is no such intention, reiterating that the move was to streamline the administration, not to oppress Russians, and further decried Russia as attempting to stir separatism."
 ukraine_shd.13.a: "It was to be expected."

 ukraine_shd.14.t: "Regarding Cooperation with VSZV and Protofis"

 ukraine_shd.23.t: "The Hetman's Right Hand"
 ukraine_shd.23.d: "Months have passed since the anti-Hetman revolt began, and the political landscape, once dominated by the Hetman's Coalition, has seemingly taken a much different shape. During the revolt, Skoropadskyi frequently refused to heed the advice of the coalition, and instead took the word from officers in the Union of Hetmanites, such as General Prisovskyi and Colonel Homzyn. The government's conduct in dealing with the republican traitors was brutal, with many among the Democratic Agrarians criticising the government and comparing it to the crackdowns of 1925.\n\nPrivately speaking to UDKhP leaders Ihor Kistiakovskyi and Mykola Mikhnovskyi, as well as URDP leader Oleksandr Shulhyn, Otaman-Minister Dmytro Doroshenko expressed his disappointment in the government and even in Skoropadskyi, echoing much of the sentiment among the Soim that their pleas to stop the excessive brutality and violence were left unheard. The next morning, key SHD officials - Borys Homzyn, Kostiantyn Prisovskyi, and Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia paid a visit to the Otaman-Minister's office; Doroshenko was informed in no uncertain terms by representatives of SHD that the Soim's power had been relinquished and that he had fallen out of favour with the Hetman, and that if he did not resign his Otaman-Ministership within the next twenty four hours, then they would have to take matters into their own hands.\n\nLater that night, Doroshenko informed a large audience in the Soim that he intended to resign the following day, citing the long and difficult task of providing efficient governance during the civil war. Amidst the finger pointing and infighting the Soim encountered after many chose to follow in Doroshenko's footsteps and resign.\n\nIt was then that the final block was put in place. After a hastily arranged meeting with the \"big three\" of the SHD, Skoropadskyi announced that Borys Homzyn would assume the position of Otaman-Minister, criticising the Soim for its inability to set aside its differences for the betterment of the nation. A law was then passed declaring the Soim to be \"indefinitely suspended until a responsible government can present itself\". Skoropadskyi approved a new cabinet of the Council of Ministers, most of whom had connections to the Union; to any outside observer, and indeed the Hetman himself, it is now more clear than ever who is really in charge."

 ukraine_shd.24.t: "Cossack Militias Rise Up!"
 ukraine_shd.24.d: "In response to the war against Russia, cossack militias, loyal to Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia and the Great Cossack Rada, have risen up to defend the nation!"
 ukraine_shd.24.a: "Excellent!"

 ukraine_shd.25.t: "An Encouragement from His Most Serene Highness"
 ukraine_shd.25.d: "Speaking directly to the Council of Ministers, today Hetman Skoropadskyi praised the SHD for its deep love and reverence for the Motherland, noting that this sentiment is at the heart of the Cossack tradition. He emphasised the importance of this sentiment in the context of the Hetmanate, stating that a strong and unified sense of national identity is essential to the success of any political project. Hetman Skoropadskyi's remarks were seen as a ringing endorsement of the SHD and its commitment to building a Hetmanate that is true to the ideals of the Cossack nation. They were widely praised by members of the organisation, who saw them as a validation of their hard work and dedication to the cause of building a better future for all Ukrainians."
 ukraine_shd.25.a: "Good to hear!"

 ukraine_shd.26.t: "Reestablishing Hetman's Headquarters"
 ukraine_shd.26.d: "With the further centralisation of the Hetman's government, old institutions from 1918 have been brought back, chief among them the Hetman's Headquarters. However, Skoropadskyi must choose who to appoint as the Chief of Hetman's Staff, the key position in the reinstated office. Borys Palii-Neyilo is one of Homzyn's closest cossack associates, and would undoubtedly be a great ally to the technocratic wing of the SHD. Another option would be Ivan Berchak-Voloshyn, a loyalist of Poltavets-Ostrianytsia; appointing him may allow us to reap the benefits of Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's connections among the Cossack councils."
 ukraine_shd.26.a: "Choose Borys Palii-Neyilo."
 ukraine_shd.26.b: "Choose Ivan Berchak-Voloshyn."

 ukraine_shd.27.t: "Poor Discipline among Cossack Militias"
 ukraine_shd.27.d: "The integration of Cossack militias into our military has not been without its challenges. Many of these troops are undisciplined and have caused issues within the ranks, leading to complaints among our high command; the historically highly autonomous nature of Cossack militias has not blended well with the centralised nature of the army, and this fact is further complicated by the fact that cossack integration into the army has been actively discouraged by the Great Cossack Rada."
 ukraine_shd.27.a: "We will look into the situation."

 ukraine_shd.28.t: "The Question of Security"
 ukraine_shd.28.d: "During the temporary government of 1918, where the Hetman ruled authoritatively and decisively, there existed a separate institution to deal with dissidents and tracking agitators: the Special Department of the Hetman's Personal Staff. Compared to the Department of Information of the State Guard, which was subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior, the Special Department was part of the Hetman's personal staff and thus answered directly to him. With the liberalisation of the Hetman's regime shortly afterwards, however, the department was abolished.\n\nWith the reintroduction of many laws from the temporary government, the Special Department has been brought back. The Chief of the Hetman's Staff has been tasked to oversee developments within the SHD and ensure its loyalty to Skoropadskyi, but just how much power it should be given remains to be answered."
 ukraine_shd.28.a: "The Ministry of Interior is doing fine as is."
 ukraine_shd.28.b: "Give extra funding to the Special Department, let's see what it can do."

 ukraine_shd.29.t: "The Future of the Union"
 ukraine_shd.29.d: "The Hetman has arranged a meeting composed of the most prominent in the Union of Hetmanites - notably Borys Homzyn, Oleksandr Paltov, Borys Palii-Neyilo and others. When the attendees arrived, Skoropadskyi laid down potential issues that the SHD may face in the future. He emphasised that the political dominance of the SHD rests on the goodwill and trust of the Ukrainian people, and that the current authoritarian course will not be feasible in the long term. Some day, he noted, there will need to be a sense of normalcy and new elections will have to be called."
 ukraine_shd.29.a: "Words of wisdom."

 ukraine_shd.30.d: "The largest military parade in Ukrainian history has just taken place at Khreshchatyk Square in [202.GetName]. Attendants included renowned generals Konovalets and Prisovskyi, as well as the Hetman himself, who gave a grand speech commending the role of the army in securing the independence of Ukraine. Cossack divisions, such as the 1st and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps, were one of the focal points of the parade.\n\nThe day after a reception was held consisting of top SHD members, such as Borys Homzyn, Borys Palii-Neyilo, Oleksandr Paltov, Hnat Zelenevskyi and Oleksandr Shapoval. Acknowledging that the SHD will not be able to maintain a permanent emergency regime and dictatorship, plans were drafted to begin the process of normalisation; the new regime would soon embark on a partial return to democracy. Nonetheless, it was maintained that no matter the case, the SHD must continue to dominate the political scene - the opposition must become legal but disenfranchised. Homzyn noted to the rest of the attendees that if an opposition party to the SHD were to come to power it would mean the curbing of Skoropadskyi's executive authority, something he and the others believed was the foundation of the Hetmanate itself, the natural state of Ukraine."

The head of the Great Cossack Rada would surely not take a liking to Homzyn attempting to subvert his influence... but at the same time, the Hetman has supported a return to democracy in the past, so surely he has no real power?"
 ukraine_shd.30.a: "Glory to Ukraine!"

 ukraine_shd.31.t: "Elections Announced"
 ukraine_shd.31.d: "The first nationwide Ukrainian election since 1932 is about to be held. Hetman Skoropadskyi formally announced the elections on the radio, stating that they were to take place within the next few months. Adding that the situation has now shown itself as stable and that the threats to Ukraine, foreign or domestic, have been greatly diminished, he encouraged all Ukrainians to vote and join the nation on this \"patriotic endeavour\".\n\nThe announcement of the elections have led to a great number of parties registering hoping to challenge the dominance of the SHD, both regionally and nationally. Yet the SHD has been greatly entrenched in politics and it will need to take a serious shakeup to knock it off its throne; the party's extensive patronage networks and enormous membership among the elite owing to years of consolidation has diminished any likelihood of its dominance ending anytime soon.\n\nAlthough its membership has decreased since the SHD's assumption of power in the late 30's, the UDKhP poses the greatest electoral threat to the SHD. The so-called \"Democratic Caucus\" of the party has been considerably strengthened since the coup, as many of the party's less parliamentary minded members sought to join the SHD to continue their relevance in politics. Those remaining in the party include notable figures such as Mykola Mikhnovskyi who has loudly denounced the great \"betrayal\" in their ranks, but also encouraged those who defected to the SHD to rejoin the UDKhP and secure their electoral victory. Regardless of whether or not they can reconsolidate their position in politics, however, their chances of victory are slim and, at worst, impossible."
 ukraine_shd.31.a: "We have nothing to fear."

 ukraine_shd.32.t: "Law on the Formation of Political Parties"
 ukraine_shd.32.d: "A new law has been approved by the Council of Ministers - the Law on the Formation of Political Parties. The law carries several restrictions to political party platforms. Any party that espouses a \"threat to the state or its independence\", \"unpatriotic views\", \"political extremism\", or is \"against the constitutional order\" are to be prohibited. The restrictions on socialist parties, through the laws on the inviolability of private property, have naturally remained in place, with the URDP remaining as the most left-leaning party legal in the country. Since the signing of the law by the Otaman-Minister and the Hetman, the law has been used to shut down the formation of a new political party in Crimea, the \"Crimean People's Party\", which is advocating that their homeland's autonomous status be restored. Thus far, however, the law has been used sparingly, owing to the SHD's dominance of the political scene; Homzyn's circle has implicitly acknowledged that should the SHD be threatened, the law may be utilised more generously."
 ukraine_shd.32.a: "Excellent."

 ukraine_shd.33.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ukraine_shd.33.d: "The long-awaited elections have arrived. In the end, the results were unsurprising; the SHD, riding on a platform of efficient administration, conservative values, and victory in the war, garnered 76% of the vote, the highest percentage of any party in the nation's electoral history. The UDKhP and URDP, having formed the \"Democratic Coalition\" prior to the election in opposition to SHD dominance, greatly contested the election. Accusing the SHD of intimidation and fraud, the voices of the Democratic Coalition were loud but ultimately inconsequential, only garnering a combined 18% of the vote, with the rest of the votes going to smaller parties.\n\nThe now-reconvened Soim's first task was to approve the new constitution built by the SHD, which passed overwhelmingly. The constitution grants sweeping powers to the Hetman, emphasising his role as the most powerful institution of the state; but otherwise the constitution remains vague, with many outstanding clauses giving the impression of little actual SHD influence.\n\nWith the dominance of the SHD in nearly every political institution the potential for a real democracy seems unlikely anytime soon; the SHD, having become a big tent party, has the ability to reform itself if necessary, and any meaningful competition to its rule will remain limited. If not years, then it shall be decades until the SHD's great state building project will finally be overturned; but even if it does, who shall succeed it?"
 ukraine_shd.33.a: "The nation continues its march."

 ukraine_shd.34.t: "The Hetman's Right Hand"
 ukraine_shd.34.d: "[?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]. Otaman-Minister Borys Homzyn's last day in office, and Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's first. That evening, together with a squad of cossacks loyal to the Great Cossack Rada and his associate Ivan Voloshyn-Berchak, Poltavets-Ostrianytsia came into the Otaman-Minister's office just as Homzyn was about to leave to reconvene the Soim. Years ago, such a meeting would be between close political allies - now, it was between the fiercest of rivals.\n\nHomzyn had remembered the days of the Anti-Hetman Revolt. A tragedy, one that had Ukrainian turn against each other as radicals sought to tear the nation apart. But it was also an opportunity, one where Hetman Skoropadskyi realised the wiseness of the SHD - and by then, ejecting Doroshenko out of office was only a formality. Was that all Homzyn himself was now? Just a formality?\n\nPoltavets-Ostrianytsia informed Homzyn in no uncertain terms that the government and key city structures were under the control of cossack detachments, and that the Hetman was being held in protective custody to protect him from \"all possible harm\". The message was clear: that he must resign as soon as possible, or he will be detained as a person suspected in conspiracy and high treason against the Hetman's will.\n\nLater that morning, the Hetman made a historic radio address: Homzyn, citing poor health incompatible with his current burden of responsibilities, was granted resignation. Taking his place would be head of the Great Cossack Rada, the de-facto leader of the SHD, and the Hetman's right hand man: Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia."
 ukraine_shd.34.a: "Welcome, Otaman-Minister Poltavets-Ostrianytsia."

 ukraine_shd.35.t: "A Council of Equals"
 ukraine_shd.35.d: "Since the closing of the last session of the Soim several years ago, the legislative body existed in a grey area, its activity de-facto fully stopped \"until a responsible government can present itself\". Nothing surprising about this, since those were the times of emergency, of quick and decisive actions: the legalist niceties could wait. Now, with the enemies external and internal routed and with the country finally stabilised by the hard work of the Hetman and his faithful Otaman-Minister, this last loose end can be tied.\n\nObviously, the Soim of the old, of partisan divisions and petty politicking, isn't coming back. Instead, the assembly of loyal servants, people fully devoted to the Hetman, the State and the Nation will provide the necessary assistance in the complex matters of governance. No more decadent partisanship: the delegates will be elected by professional and political organisations guided by the SHD. In order to provide this assembly with the necessary degree of legitimacy and ensure that it fully represents the interests of the Ukrainian people, a certain number of seats will be reserved for the members of the cossack councils: our noble knights, our guardians of tradition and social order. Thanks to the tireless efforts of Otaman-Minister Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, Ukrainian Cossackdom became a crucial element of the societal fabric of our country and thus deserves to play an appropriate role in its political system."
 ukraine_shd.35.a: "An assembly befitting our glorious state."

 ukraine_shd.36.t: "From the Hetman to a Memory"
 ukraine_shd.36.d: "\"How could it happen that among all the people around me in my time as Hetman, there were so few people who thought the way I did?\" The words were inked out on the blank page, but they would never continue. All that Hetman Skoropadskyi would write down would simply become a memory, after all - nothing more. A memory, like that he himself had become. How did it get to this point? How could he have been outmanoeuvred by a prideful misfit? The old Hetman had become frail and indecisive. He had sacrificed all of his comfort and pleasure to serving Ukraine and the happiness of his people, he thought. Would he really live out the last years of his life seeing the state he tried to build mutilated by an upstart adventurist?\n\nLife was bittersweet with victories and defeats. All the troubles that his government endured during the days of the Hetman's Coalition, the civil wars, the Russian invasion... but it was supposed to be worth it. The end of the war in the east in defiance of Russian imperialism was supposed to bring a new era of order, of stability, of freedom. All the work that the Hetman carried out to bring this era forth for almost thirty years - perhaps if he would live long enough, he could see the fruits of it.\n\nPerhaps God had not given him the strength to cope with the task of ruling. The Hetman only in name had become a memory - an unforgettable, yet disgraced, memory."
 ukraine_shd.36.a: "History will judge his worth."

 ukraine_shd.37.t: "The Hetman's Gift"
 ukraine_shd.37.d: "Were it weeks ago, Borys Homzyn's visit to the Hetman's office would be not anything of particular note - briefings of intelligence on rebel locations and the progress of the counteroffensive that would eventually drive the crypto-syndicalists out of the country. But now, things were different. The revolt was over, so what could've been the reason this time?\n\nSitting across from Skoropadskyi at his desk, Homzyn praised the Hetman's work in decisively dealing with the traitors just as he did in 1919 and 1925. The victory was clear proof of the Hetman's wisdom and dedication to his country. This type of talk from Homzyn was not unfamiliar to Skoropadskyi - as one of his closest associates, he and Homzyn had always maintained a close relationship despite their political differences - but now, things were different. Though it was not the first time he spoke of the idea, Homzyn stated the great lesson of the uprising: parliamentarism has failed. Despite the Hetman's attempts to bargain with the liberals and socialists in Ukraine, evident by Doroshenko's appointment to the Otaman-Ministership and the relief bill, the agitators would only use it as an opportunity to backstab the Hetman. Politicians like Shemet and Kistiakovskyi only sought to strengthen their own political power - indeed, only the Hetman understood the correct direction the country must take.\n\nYet, Homzyn continued, without true patriots carrying out the Hetman's vision, how could Ukraine truly prosper? The traitors may have escaped for now, but it is clear that they will not give up, and backed by their self-interested sympathisers in the Soim, they will come again to wreak havoc.\n\nFinally, Homzyn made an appeal to the Hetman. Homzyn and his associates in the Union of Hetmanites had been paramount in aiding the Hetman to deal with the republican threat once and for all. It was only natural that they be rewarded in return, as a gift for their loyalty."
 ukraine_shd.37.a: "Certainly."

 ukraine_shd.38.t: "In the Halls of Justice"
 ukraine_shd.38.d: "With control over the executive branch secured and the Soim proceedings being indefinitely suspended the SHD now shifts its attention to the highest judicial authority in the country - the State Senate. Early retirement of its previous President gives the Hetmanites-State Builders a unique opportunity to solidify their grip over it. Viktor Reinbot, an unremarkable, but pliable and staunchly anti-socialist senator, is a perfect candidate for this crucial post.\n\nThings, however, are not going smoothly. Quite unexpectedly, a number of respected senators privately voiced their dissatisfaction with the prospect of a Reinbot presidency. Their candidate of choice seems to be Mykhailo Chubynskyi - a capable and reasonable Senate member, but also one who won't hesitate to oppose the SHD agenda. While the final decision over the fate of the presidency rests with the Hetman, it is obvious that he will be reluctant to appoint someone who garners significant opposition in the Senate.\n\nThe root of the problem, as numerous sources imply, is Ihor Kistiakovskyi. A political heavyweight with numerous connections in the judicial circles, nicknamed the‘Hetman's Evil Spirit' by both admirers and detractors, he continues to exert his influence even after de-facto retirement in the wake of the UDKhP's fall from power.\n\nUsually, the SHD would appeal directly to the Hetman in order to circumvent the opposition of yet another intransigeant conservative grandee. This case, however, is more delicate: Skoropadskyi would loathe to directly apply coercion in matters of judicial authority. Another approach is needed."
 ukraine_shd.38.a: "It is time to make some calls."

 ukraine_shd.39.t: "To Fight a Dragon..."
 ukraine_shd.39.d: "Sometimes, when it comes to combating the behind-the-scenes influence of a veteran political operator like Kistiakovskyi, one can't resort to tried and trusted methods, such as a public smear campaign, intimidation, blackmail or direct physical removal. Sometimes, fire can be fought only with fire.\n\nExactly this reasoning prompted Borys Homzyn to contact two notable figures of Ukrainian conservative politics: Oleksandr Paltov and Oleksandr Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi. Paltov is not unlike Kistiakovskyi himself: one among many who laid down the foundations of the Hetmanate back in 1918. The creation of the Hetman's Coalition more than a decade ago is too attributed mostly to his machinations. Now he is seemingly retired, but it's an open secret that many influential people (including the Hetman himself) tend to value his advice.\n\nSkoropys-Yoltukhovskyi is an experienced civil servant and a former member of the USKhD. It is through connection to its founder, Hetman's personal advisor Viacheslav Lypynskyi, that Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi managed to attract the attention of Skoropadskyi and win his trust as a level-headed and loyal statesman. Serving in almost every government in various capacities, he cleverly leveraged Skoropadskyi's favour and acquired a plethora of connections.\n\nWith these two joining forces on the side of the SHD, Reinbot's Senate presidency is now all but assured. Additionally, both Paltov and Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi are now expected to enter the highest echelons of the SHD as a compensation for their crucial help."
 ukraine_shd.39.a: "...one needs a dragon of their own. Or better, two."

 ukraine_shd.40.t: "Marching in Unison"
 ukraine_shd.40.d: "The Anti-Hetman insurrection exposed many weaknesses of the Ukrainian state. One of them is particularly egregious - a deeply rooted spiritual malaise affecting the entire military apparatus. During the revolt the army was plagued by insubordination, widespread mutinies and outright defections. The military's underwhelming conduct against the rebels is a testament to the gravity of the problem.\n\nA solution might seem obvious: the toughening of punishments, advancement of reliable officers, dismissal of those that proved to be untrustworthy, changes of curriculum in military schools and academies and so on. Practical implementation of these measures, however, is a different matter. Who can be entrusted with such a momentous undertaking? The SHD itself is rooted in the military class, but it doesn't hold sway over the entire army. Putting someone like Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia in charge of the revision process is bound to alienate many independently-minded officers like Yevhen Konovalets and his Sichovyky or Petro Bolbochan. Meanwhile, Kostiantyn Prisovskyi, widely respected in military circles, outright refused a proposition to oversee the reforms.\n\nA way out was suggested by the Hetman. He proposed the candidacy of general Oleksandr Shapoval, famous for his ability to carefully navigate the clique politics of the Ukrainian army. A suspected Republican sympathiser in early 1920s, with time he came to despise political partisanship, became a vocal supporter of the Hetmanate and acquired a reputation of genuine convert among conservative establishment.\n\nShapoval's ties to the SHD in the past were tenuous and complicated at best, but there is little choice but to accept the Hetman's offer: this kind of personal sponsorship is hard to dismiss. On the bright side, the army at large should be more receptive to his efforts than those of someone more closely involved with the SHD."
 ukraine_shd.40.a: "A bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must accept."

 ukraine_shd.41.t: "The Hetman's Three"
 ukraine_shd.41.d: "More and more often, while discussing internal matters of the SHD, one tends to hear a reference to the ‘Three Oleksandrs'. This phrase became a common moniker for a group of three high-ranking SHD officials composed of Oleksandr Paltov, Oleksandr Skoropys-Yoltukhovskyi and Oleksandr Shapoval. Until recently, each one of them was an outsider to the Union of Hetmanites-State Builders, but through a combination of merit, diligence and patronage from high places they came to exert a considerable influence over the SHD.\n\nRumoured to serve as personal liaisons and envoys of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, they tirelessly work in order to expand the presence of the SHD in all spheres of political and public life. The Hetman's will is clear: one day the Soim will be reconvened and new elections will be called. By this time the SHD should cease to be a mere clique and be ready to play its role at the front and centre of Ukrainian politics as a reliable and trusted ‘Hetman's Party'. Where the Hetman's Coalition fell awfully short, the SHD must deliver.\n\nFor now ‘Three Oleksandrs' work closely with the Otaman-Minister, whose vision for the future of the Ukrainian State is fully aligned with that of the Hetman. Still, the mere existence of this trio serves as constant and pointed reminder for Borys Homzyn: despite all the efforts, he personally, and the SHD at large, are yet to earn full trust of His Most Serene Highness.\n\nOf course not everyone among Hetmanites-State Builders is thrilled with how influential this triumvirate of outsiders has become. Should the balance of power in the SHD shift, all three Oleksandrs might find themselves in a very precarious position..."
 ukraine_shd.41.a: "...as long as the Hetman remains strong, they will play their role."

 ukraine_shd.42.t: "Elections of [GetYear]"
 ukraine_shd.42.d: "Elections are being held in Ukraine once again. While plenty of parties will be participating, only one party has a real shot at power: the SHD. Once again the SHD has maintained their monopoly on power, and gained a majority in the Soim."
 ukraine_shd.42.a: "As things should be."

 ### Borotbyst Events ###
 ukraine_borotbist.1.t: "In Search of a Common Platform"
 ukraine_borotbist.1.d: "As the new elections to the National Zbory were announced, parties quickly began announcing their bids for power. While minor parties grouped into electoral blocs, major ones like USDRP or URDP decided to run alone. This raised a question within circles of the Workers' Democratic Union that used to be in coalition with USDRP. While some members of the R-RB wanted to rebuild a pact with the USDRP, the majority of the UPS-R preferred to turn to a more radical option, the Borotbysts. Unfortunately for them, the UPS-R-B outright refused, out of not wanting to take part in \"Bourgeois Elections\". Afterwards, the UPS-R/R-RB decided to run regardless as the \"Workers' Democratic Union\". Since the announcement, the USDRP leadership reached out to the RDS, negotiating a possible alliance and even signalled a possible government.\n\nWhat no one knew was that the whole RDS-Borotbyst ordeal was monitored by the USDRP. With such information in their files, they have a potential hook on the RDS, which can be also used against Borotbysts to portray them as enemies of the new system and not trustworthy allies."
 ukraine_borotbist.1.a: "I see."

 ukraine_borotbist.2.t: "Local Elections Results - Sudden Borotbyst Surge"
 ukraine_borotbist.2.d: "In local elections across the countryside, the Borotbysts have gained a sudden surge in popularity. They have garnered great percentages of the vote despite never being strong enough to form a plurality. Recognising this, they have attempted to form local coalitions with the USDRP and especially the R-RB and UPS-R in their attempts to gain political influence in the countryside. On some occasions these coalitions have been refused by the latter parties, attempting to isolate Borotbyst influence, but some have suggested that a coalition with the Borotbysts would make it easier to control them. The UPS-R, however, may have their popularity dwindle should they form a coalition with radicals, who openly refuse to participate in general elections."
 ukraine_borotbist.2.a: "Allow them, this way we will be able to control and eventually co-opt these radicals."
 ukraine_borotbist.2.b: "Try to isolate them instead."

 ukraine_borotbist.3.t: "A Voice for the Peasantry"
 ukraine_borotbist.3.d: "Organised to defend peasant interests in local government policy, as well as to contribute to the ongoing land reform, the UPS-R has now reestablished the Selianska Spilka (Peasant Union). In response, the Borotbysts have created the Komnezamy (committees of non-wealthy peasants), which largely follows the same principles. The only difference is that while the Selianska Spilka has somewhat moderated their programme in line with the UPS-R, the Komnezamy has been uncompromising in their calls to abolish private property. There have been concerns that the Komnezamy may become more popular than the Selianska Spilka unless additional support is given to the Spilka."
 ukraine_borotbist.3.a: "Give additional state support to the Spilka."
 ukraine_borotbist.3.b: "Don't intervene."

 ukraine_borotbist.4.t: "The Utsentrprof Congress"
 ukraine_borotbist.4.d: "The newly reorganised Utsentrprof, the largest federation of trade unions in Ukraine, has reconvened and held an election for the first time since the overthrow of the republic in 1918. The election ended with a majority of positions being taken up by representatives of the USDRP and the Workers' Democratic Union. However, there was a sizeable number of Ukapists and especially Borotbysts elected to the Utsentrprof, perhaps proving that the level of radical infiltration of trade unions is higher than anticipated."
 ukraine_borotbist.4.a: "Secretly investigate the election procedure."
 ukraine_borotbist.4.b: "We can't intervene in their proceedings."

 ukraine_borotbist.5.t: "[226.GetName] Railway Workers' Strike"
 ukraine_borotbist.5.d: "While the various new legislation passed by the National Zbory have provided improvements to workers rights', especially in comparison to the Hetmanate, the actual enforcement of such policies have taken considerable time and has been accompanied by various hurdles. Naturally, the Borotbysts have used this as an opportunity to paint the Zbory as an incompetent bourgeois legislature, inspiring a large strike in [226.GetName]. Strikes have not been uncommon since the declaration of the republic, given that the constitution guarantees the right to strike, but this one in particular has been the biggest in the newfound republic's history."
 ukraine_borotbist.5.a: "Negotiate."
 ukraine_borotbist.5.b: "Wait it out."

 ukraine_borotbist.6.t: "Minor Protests Erupt in Countryside"
 ukraine_borotbist.6.d: "Apparently, the Borotbyst formation of the Komnezamy pose a much bigger threat than once thought. Sporadic and small protests organised by the Komnezamy have begun to call for rapid and efficient land redistribution and the abolishment of private ownership. For now, the protests have remained isolated and have not expanded outside the Borotbysts' traditional base, but they have served as a reminder to the government that if the administration is to survive, efficient land reform must be carried out."
 ukraine_borotbist.6.a: "Why do they believe them and not us?"

 ukraine_borotbist.8.t: "Borotbysts' Influence Grows"
 ukraine_borotbist.8.d: "Once seemingly limited to pockets of the countryside, the Komnezamy have continued to expand their protests and spread into the major cities such as [221.GetName] and [192.GetName]. While we could easily be forgiven at first as land redistribution takes time and effort, the people now seem unhappy with our current efforts. Only by redoubling our efforts can we steer them away from the radicals."
 ukraine_borotbist.8.a: "We must regain trust of the working masses."

 ukraine_borotbist.9.t: "Rumours Concerning Yuri Tiutiunnyk"
 ukraine_borotbist.9.d: "Yuri Tiutiunnyk has fought tirelessly for the republican cause and has been quite influential among the Republican armed forces, as he was a key figure in the Anti-Hetman Revolt. But with the Borotbyst presence in the countryside growing day by day, there have been rumours that Tiutiunnyk is more sympathetic towards the Borotbysts than Petliura, and potentially even a member of their ranks. While having the peasants and workers against the regime is one thing, potentially having disloyalties in the military could be disastrous - although openly making a move against him could backfire greatly."
 ukraine_borotbist.9.a: "Reassign him to a different post."
 ukraine_borotbist.9.b: "Better to keep him closer."

 ukraine_borotbist.11.t: "Protests Grow in Numbers"
 ukraine_borotbist.11.d: "The situation in the countryside has grown worse. In various rural areas, especially where wealthy landowners dominate the land, poor peasants affiliated with the Komnezamy have begun to attack landowners and wealthier peasants. To many, all the claims that the republic made during the Anti-Hetman Revolt and campaigning season have been shown to be nothing but empty promises, illustrating the need to take matters into their own hands. If we don't fix the situation quickly, the people's faith in the republic may shatter..."
 ukraine_borotbist.11.a: "It's starting to spiral out of our control."

 ukraine_borotbist.12.t: "Reformation of the Red Guards"
 ukraine_borotbist.12.d: "As if it wasn't already bad enough, the ailing situation in the urban areas has now seen the creation of the Red Guards — revived revolutionary groups from the 1936 uprising. Organised for the purpose of worker self-defence, especially in the Donbas and Kryvbas, they are in fact lacking a Borotbyst connection. Nonetheless, the unity between the peasants and industrial workers is increasing, forming a very dangerous opposition force to the republic."
 ukraine_borotbist.12.a: "Even a small spark may start the fire now."

 ukraine_borotbist.13.t: "Clashes between Militias"
 ukraine_borotbist.13.d: "The formation of the Red Guards has gone about as expected. Clashes immediately began between them and the People's Militia supported by volunteers defending the republic. Sending the army in would likely be disastrous and only inflame the protests, but a decision must be made for what to do with the degree of involvement of the People's Militia. Reigning them in may be seen as an act of goodwill, but some have said that the show of force is necessary if we are to preserve the republic."
 ukraine_borotbist.13.a: "Rein in the militia."
 ukraine_borotbist.13.b: "These measures are necessary."

 ukraine_borotbist.14.t: "Bakhmut Meeting"
 ukraine_borotbist.14.d: "The Red Guards have continued to be an anomaly for the Borotbysts. Indeed, despite being the foremost revolutionary party organising protests and peasant self-help groups, they were not involved in the formation of the Red Guard. After a lengthy investigation from the revolutionary leadership, they have come to discover that the Red Guard and other affiliated groups have been led from \"beyond\" by many of the higher-ups in the Ukrainian Communist Party, such as Mykola Skrypnyk, Vasyl Shakhrai and Serhii Mazlakh. Although there is clear mutual benefit for both sides to support and carry out a successful revolution and topple the republic, there is great distrust between the two. Despite not being opposed in principle, the Borotbysts mostly has its ranks in the countryside, whereas the UKP has a greater amount of representation in the urban areas. There is a real concern that either party will attempt to marginalise the influence of the other, as well as their preferred base of support.\n\nNonetheless, as the republic continues to deteriorate, with strikes and clashes becoming a common occurrence, the potential for a revolution is greater than ever. Top ranking representatives of the Borotbysts and UKP have agreed to negotiate over joint action against the republic. Presiding over the negotiations is middle-man Anatolii Pisotskyi, one of the farthest left Council-Revolutionary Bloc members and one of its main leaders. The UKP and R-RB have offered to cooperate with the Borotbysts should they increase representation for the urban workers, especially miners. Some of the delegates in the Central Revolutionary Committee would thus be aligned to the UKP and R-RB. The negotiations have borne some fruit but the fact remains that the Borotbysts remain the most powerful revolutionary organisation in the country and could carry out a revolution themselves if needed; at the same time, the support of the UKP and R-RB may be invaluable."
 ukraine_borotbist.14.a: "An agreement is reached in the administrative capital."
 ukraine_borotbist.14.b: "No compromises."

 ukraine_borotbist.15.t: "Collapse of Rule of Law"
 ukraine_borotbist.15.d: "With widespread revolutionary guards flexing their muscles and republic's law enforcement careful in their actions, we have once more fallen into the chaos akin to that before the Anti-Hetman Revolt. Since the previous clashes between the People's Militia and protestors only added fuel to the fire, now the government is trying to avoid escalation and any actions that could be constructed as similar to those of Skoropadskyi some years ago, but it hardly seems to be better option. Crime has surged as Borotbysts have essentially took over entire districts in some places."
 ukraine_borotbist.15.a: "Now this..."

 ukraine_borotbist.17.t: "Rumours About General Strike"
 ukraine_borotbist.17.d: "Across the republic there have been rumours about the Borotbysts organising a general strike, one that will bring an end to the violence and the looting — and bring the bourgeois government to its knees. One question remains, however: will the R-RB and the UPS-R support the strike? If we can convince the Workers' Democratic Union not to support it, the Borotbysts' revolution may crumble."
 ukraine_borotbist.17.a: "Prepare for the worst."
 ukraine_borotbist.17.b: "Approach the RDS for help against the Borotbysts."

 ukraine_borotbist.18.t: "General Strike"
 ukraine_borotbist.18.d: "The general strike that was rumoured has finally began. All across the republic, steel workers, railway workers, and miners have refused to work and have called for better working conditions and the resignation of the current government, allowing the formation of a socialist republic. Propaganda of 1936 has been redirected at the republic, accusing the government of merely becoming new Hetmanate equally uncaring of the common man's plight. The whole nation has been ground to a halt - even some in the People's Militia have defected to the Borotbysts, while [UKR.GetLeader]'s government has hotly debated what to do in response."
 ukraine_borotbist.18.a: "The showdown begins."

 ukraine_borotbist.19.t: "Tiutiunnyk's Betrayal"
 ukraine_borotbist.19.d: "When the government debated what action to take in response to the General Strike, one idea in particular was that of using the military to quell the protests - which would be an uncharacteristically brutal action and act of tyranny, but could prove to be the only option.\n\nAt least, it was an option - until general Yurii Tiutiunnyk, long rumoured to be affiliated with the Borotbysts, declared his allegiance to the strike along with his men. With defection of popular general, army mutinies became widespread, and more men joined \"Yurko\" in opposing the ineffective government."
 ukraine_borotbist.19.a: "That snake!"

 ukraine_borotbist.20.t: "The Parliament Assault"
 ukraine_borotbist.20.d: "Yurii Tiutiunnyk's betrayal had caused much confusion among the military - especially the [202.GetName] garrison, which has been now rendered practically paralysed. With thousands protesting in Khreshchatyk Square and outside the National Zbory, the opportunity presented itself. Bolstered by the protestors, armed members of the Borotbysts and small contingents of the Red Guard and other militia stormed the National Zbory, arresting the cabinet and making a grand appeal to the parliament: to voluntarily dissolve the parliament and transfer authority to a transitional government led by the Borotbysts.\n\nThe Borotbysts made an appeal to the Workers' Democratic Union, offering them positions in the new people's government if they agreed to dissolve the parliament. With the momentum fully in favour of the Borotbysts and the threat of armed insurrection should they refuse, the Workers' Democratic Union, together with the Borotbysts, agreed to dissolve the parliament together. Fearing the prospect of civil war, most of the republican armed forces declared their allegiance to the new regime.\n\nAt the end of the day, the man of the hour was the leader of the Borotbysts, Oleksandr Shumskyi. After the dissolution of parliament Shumskyi made a radio address directly to the people, declaring that the people's voice would finally be heard and called on all to support the new government: the Ukrainian Socialist Republic."
 ukraine_borotbist.20.a: "Khai zhyve Ukraina! Khai zhyve Sotsializm!"

 ukraine_borotbist.21.t: "Petliura Rises in [198.GetName]"
 ukraine_borotbist.21.d: "All across the country, senior commanders have reported receiving telegraphed messages calling to \"resist the violent communist uprising\". The messages are from none other than Symon Petliura, the expected culprit. Days ago, Petliura, along with Udovychenko, had set out to [198.GetName], ostensibly to inspect the armed forces there. In fact, it seems as though he was preparing for what would constitute as his first act of treason against the socialist republic.\n\nHoping to decapitate the Borotbyst movement before it could carry out an uprising against the bourgeois republic, Petliura was too late - Tiutiunnyk and the Borotbysts had already taken control of [202.GetName] and much of the country, as the new government has been supported either actively or silently by much of the country. Petliura's messages only reached some detachments in western [226.GetName], [221.GetName] and Poltava, which surrendered after short engagements with Tiutiunnyk's forces.\n\nTaking control of local armed forces in [198.GetName], Petliura then marched his forces east to face Tiutiunnyk's army. Meeting at [201.GetName], both sides suffered low morale as Ukrainian was forced to shoot Ukrainian for the second time in three years. Tiutiunnyk's more numerous and dedicated force has triumphed, as Petliura conducted a hasty withdrawal. Petliura has retreated all the way across the border into Poland, where he reportedly has attempted to appeal to Berlin and Vienna to intervene and crush the revolution."
 ukraine_borotbist.21.a: "Like the tyrant Hetman before him, he bends the knee to the imperialists."

 ukraine_borotbist.42.t: "Borotbysts Lose Momentum"
 ukraine_borotbist.42.d: "After much-demanded expanded funding to the Spilka programme, we have managed to silence much of Borotbyst-inspired critique towards our land reform programme. Komnezamy organised by them have lost supporters and a great amount of poor peasantry has restored their faith in our government."
 ukraine_borotbist.42.a: "Spilka won in the end."

 ukraine_borotbist.43.t: "Protests Slowly Calm"
 ukraine_borotbist.43.d: "Countrywide protests riled up by the Borotbysts have been slowly calming as their demands have been met. New land redistribution programme has been lauded as success. Ironically the Borotbyst core seem the most unhappy with this development, as fulfilling their demands has satisfied many of their less dedicated supporters and encouraged them to distance themselves from protests."
 ukraine_borotbist.43.a: "It is over."

 ukraine_borotbist.44.t: "Borotbyst Infighting"
 ukraine_borotbist.44.d: "The latest party congress of the UPS-R-B saw furious debate over Shumskyi's leadership and its failures. The radicals claim that too little was done and that the revolution did not begin early enough. Moderates argue that the moment was not right, and more agitation would've been needed. A large section of the Borotbysts have even declared quitting the party and seceding to the Workers' Democratic Union, which they now consider to represent \"true workers' interests.\" They are lauded as traitors by the party mainline, but the damage is already done."
 ukraine_borotbist.44.a: "So much for \"Left Unity\"."

 ukraine_borotbist.45.t: "De-Radicalisation of Unions"
 ukraine_borotbist.45.d: "As the Borotbyst influence wanes, many leadership committees of unions have been captured by those more loyal to Vynnychenko and the Workers' Democratic Union. While some unions, such as that of the railways, will remain hopelessly radical, reduction of Borotbyst influence in most other unions should stabilise Ukrainian economic life in the long term."
 ukraine_borotbist.45.a: "Everything's coming back to its place."

 ukraine_borotbist.47.t: "Revolutionary Comrades or Lackeys of the Bourgeoisie?"
 ukraine_borotbist.47.d: "The question of non-producing classes has divided Marxists. Most radical, especially among proper syndicalists, argue that people who do not produce value should not decide on how value of labour is distributed. However, \"worker-intelligentsia\" includes both many important socialist figures and groups such as scientists, who are undoubtedly useful for the proletariat state despite them not being proper workers. Hardliners argue that if bureaucrats and other \"fellow-travellers\" are given too much power, they sill eventually hijack the revolution from the common people, as has happened in many other countries, according to them."
 ukraine_borotbist.47.a: "We're a democracy, even if a socialist one. Let them participate."
 ukraine_borotbist.47.b: "We can't let it taint our cause."

 ukraine_borotbist.48.t: "Elections to The Council of Deputies"
 ukraine_borotbist.48.d: "The National Zbory has been disbanded as a vehicle of bourgeois corruption, and new nationwide elections have been held to elect delegates to the new parliament. As voting is organised by the workers' and peasants' councils, who have put forward the most candidates, the outcome is clear. While there are number of independents and some liberals, the vast majority of the seats went to the Borotbysts. The UKP, UPS-R and R-RB also won numerous seats. As their first decision the Council voted in favour of electing Comrade Shumskyi as their Chairman and de facto head of state."
 ukraine_borotbist.48.a: "A toast to workers' democracy!"

 ukraine_borotbist.49.t: "First Session of The Council"
 ukraine_borotbist.49.d: "After Shumskyi was chosen as the Chairman of the Council of Deputies, the next step is to elect First Deputy Chairman and Chairmans of individual committees - essentially the cabinet of parliamentary states. This appointment is part of a wider debate about the direction of the revolution.\n\nTwo factions quickly emerged. Hryhorii Hrynko and the so-called \"moderates\", who stress the importance of unity of the revolutionary movement, are backed by the current provisional First Deputy Chairman Mykhailo Poloz. Their opposition, Levko Kovaliv's \"reformists\", speak for rapid industrial development according to technocratic principles as the only way to ensure that the workers' Ukraine will survive. Kovaliv's programme is based on the theories of Mykhailo Volobuiev, who has long been an eccentric spokesman for such industrial-economic reforms. After a lengthy debate, eventually a consensus was reached..."
 ukraine_borotbist.49.a: "Keep Poloz, he's done a good job so far with Hrynko as his faithful ally."
 ukraine_borotbist.49.b: "Choose Kovaliv, he and Volobuiev may guarantee a strong and independent Ukraine."

 ukraine_borotbist.50.t: "Nationalisation of Banking Sector"
 ukraine_borotbist.50.d: "There are few more hated institutions to the common man than a bank. It is the very symbol of economic inequality, where the rich get richer with the interest paid by the poor. Memories of lost savings after 1936 bank failures are still fresh for many. It was thus uncontroversial to pass a law that puts all banks in Ukraine under control of Committee of Fiscal Equality."
 ukraine_borotbist.50.a: "We're in control now."

 ukraine_borotbist.51.t: "Central Cooperative Bank of Ukraine"
 ukraine_borotbist.51.d: "To replace private bankers leeching off the working man, the banks of Ukraine have been reorganised to follow the cooperative model, where everyone with savings in the bank own share of the cooperative bank, and can vote whenever decisions are made that concern the bank's rules or future. All small regional cooperative banks, many having already existed in more rural regions, have been united under direction of the Central Cooperative Bank, which is also tasked with maintaining fiscal stability."
 ukraine_borotbist.51.a: "We won't be dependent on Berlin no more."

 ukraine_borotbist.53.t: "Nationalisation of the Arsenals"
 ukraine_borotbist.53.d: "While the late bourgeois republic already implemented number of nationalisations, they left the work half-way done, as usual. The revolution has swept away most of the factory-owners and other useless leeches, and the machines are now controlled by the men who work them. It is especially important to coordinate armaments industries into one economic unit, as something as serious as national defence should not be let to whims of individuals."
 ukraine_borotbist.53.a: "True."

 ukraine_borotbist.56.t: "Question of Workers' Organisation"
 ukraine_borotbist.56.d: "Thanks to all the varying socialist movements within the country, there is no consensus on what proper \"workers' self-management\" means. Especially among agrarian socialists regional councils and collectives have been formed with a principle of locality. Everyone is directly involved in administration of their immediate surroundings, and the government should leave as much power to the local collectives as possible. Meanwhile, especially across our major industrial cities, CGT-influenced industrial unionism have found more support. In many cities, workers are primarily organised in unions, which arrange many everyday necessities for their members. These unions are further coordinated by their common union federation up to the highest level. While we aren't forcing any changes to the system, we should decide policy on the preferred method."
 ukraine_borotbist.56.a: "Local Collectives."
 ukraine_borotbist.56.b: "Federal Unions."

 ukraine_borotbist.58.t: "Criticism of Minority Autonomies"
 ukraine_borotbist.58.d: "After we allowed Ukrainian national minorities to form their own collectives, there have been complaints against these organisations from mainly ethnic Ukrainians, who consider these \"nationalist clubs' as harmful to the spirit of socialism and something that increases division rather than solves it. This debate became especially pronounced when Crimean Tatar and Crimean Russian councils clashed over jurisdiction over certain matters on the peninsula, a situation which needed a negotiator from the Council of Deputies to pacify. However, others argue that these protests are of a crypto-nationalist nature in of itself."
 ukraine_borotbist.58.a: "We stand behind the Autonomies."
 ukraine_borotbist.58.b: "Perhaps we need to refine the system."

 ukraine_borotbist.59.t: "Shumskyi-Vynnychenko Agreement"
 ukraine_borotbist.59.d: "The revolution cannot be bogged down by petty differences when we are facing threats from all ends. In recognition of this, the leadership of the Borotbysts have thus reached out to the other foremost revolutionary parties of Ukraine, the UPS-R and R-RB. In spite of their differences there is a great commonality between the three - all recognise the importance of rural toiling masses in a socialist Ukraine.\n\nTo satisfy their demands and ensure healthy cooperation of all socialist forces, the leader of the R-RB and de-facto leader of the alliance between UPS-R and R-RB as a whole, Volodymyr Vynnychenko has been given the position of Chairman of the Executive Committee — a body responsible for coordination between the Council of Deputies and the Council of Ministers — while various figures in the UPS-R have been given important ministerial positions."
 ukraine_borotbist.59.a: "Onwards, towards a new bright future!"

 ukraine_borotbist.60.t: "Chubar's Proposal"
 ukraine_borotbist.60.d: "Vlas Chubar, chairman of the Ukrainian Communist Party, has suggested an alliance between the UKP and the Borotbysts. The Communist Party is a small, but a well disciplined organisation. Their direct influence over the Ukrainian working masses may be limited, but those followers they have are loyal and committed beyond reproach. The alliance might prove useful, but we must be cautious. The UKP, given a chance, will without a doubt attempt to deeply infiltrate both local councils and trade-union organisations. Should we show any signs of weakness or disunity, the Ukapists would move immediately, aiming to ruthlessly expand their influence at the expense of our own."
 ukraine_borotbist.60.a: "We must all unite to fight the bourgeoisie!"
 ukraine_borotbist.60.b: "The Ukapists are too unpredictable."

 ukraine_borotbist.62.t: "Funds for VAPLITE"
 ukraine_borotbist.62.d: "As part of his \"Revolution in Culture\", Mykola Khyvyliovyi has requested funding for VAPLITE, the Free Academy of Proletarian Literature. Consisting of figures such as Maik Yokhansen, Arkadii Liubchenko, Mykhailo Yalovyi and others, VAPLITE is centred on the creation of a new Ukrainian culture, pursuing a different vision than that of the Hetmanate and Republic. According to Khyvyliovyi, this new Ukrainian culture can be invigorated through influence of established Western European art tradition. He emphasises that despite Ukraine's de jure political independence it has never truly secured cultural independence from Moscow, illustrating the reason why VAPLITE's motto is \"Away from Moscow!\".\n\nBut some Borotbysts, who tend to view Khvyliovyi's ideas with scepticism, have cautioned against funding VAPLITE. The most prominent of these Borotbysts, Andrii Khvylia, has said that art should best be used as a tool to support the socialist revolution, not \"exercises in petty nationalism\"."
 ukraine_borotbist.62.a: "Tell Khvyliovyi he'll get his funds."
 ukraine_borotbist.62.b: "Khvylia is right, we can only allow art to be used as a tool to support the revolution."

 ukraine_borotbist.63.t: "Asiatic Renaissance"
 ukraine_borotbist.63.d: "Mykola Khvyliovyi has published a new article in VAPLITE dubbed the \"Asiatic Renaissance\". In the article, Khvyliovyi praises the socialist revolutions in both China and Indochina and proposes that they are an example of the inevitable: an awakening of Asia and the rest of the colonial world, much of which currently languishes under the boot of European and Japanese imperialism. He says Asiatic nations will \"fire the lamp of new renaissance which will blaze forth as an azure pentagram over the dark European night\"."
 ukraine_borotbist.63.a: "Just as them, we too struggle against imperialism."

 ukraine_borotbist.64.t: "Nova Generatsiia"
 ukraine_borotbist.64.d: "It seems VAPLITE is not the only artistic association that has come to prominence as a result of the revolution. Mykhail Semenko has created a new association, Nova Generatsiia (New Generation), promoting a radical breakaway from the literary traditions of the past. New Generation endorses what it calls \"revolutionary futurism\" and \"functional poetry\". Semenko's organisation has received some support from the government due to their ideological and propagandistic nature. VAPLITE and New Generation have begun to compete for recognition, constituting a sort of ideological rivalry, as the members of VAPLITE still believe in literary traditions. Khvyliovyi has commented in response to the group's ascendance that \"true art is more than ideologically charged propagandist leaflets\"."
 ukraine_borotbist.64.a: "Whether national or futurist, art is still art."

 ukraine_borotbist.65.t: "Anti-Neoclassicist Campaign"
 ukraine_borotbist.65.d: "A prominent group of modernist poets and writers known as \"[202.GetName]an Neoclassicists\" recently has come under vicious criticism in the press, especially in the UKP-aligned newspapers. Proclaiming slogans of \"pure art\", neoclassicists are being accused of \"continuation of decadent bourgeois traditions\" and \"ideological emptiness\". Nonetheless, the group has found a perhaps unexpected ally in the person of Mykola Khvyliovyi. The veteran revolutionary answered with the flurry of pamphlets of his own, attacking \"red graphomania\" and defending \"rigorous and exacting standards of literary art championed by the neoclassicists\". What started as art analysis has turned into full libel campaign through multiple newspapers, as the Ukrainian cultural elite is forced to pick sides in this \"Neo-Classicist War\"."
 ukraine_borotbist.65.a: "Zealotry is no substitute for expertise."
 ukraine_borotbist.65.b: "Reprimand Khvyliovyi, he went too far."

 ukraine_borotbist.66.t: "Latinisation of Ukrainian Alphabet Project"
 ukraine_borotbist.66.d: "The Latinised version of Ukrainian alphabet, since its adoption during 1927 Orthographic Conference, has been in use rather rarely, with the majority of the population being much more accustomed to traditional Cyrillic script. Despite the best efforts of the philologist Mykola Sulyma, who championed wider use of the Latinised alphabet, the question of its adoption and promotion remained largely on the fringes of the cultural debate.\n\nUntil now, that is. It has attracted Mykola Khvyliovyi's attention, who eagerly became its active supporter. However, it seems that he isn't content with the mere \"promotion\" and \"wider adoption\". Khvyliovyi believes that the \"Europeanisation of Ukrainian culture\" dictates that Cyrillic script, as a remnant of Russian-Orthodox hegemony over Ukraine, should be rejected. The latinisation of language, he argues, would permanently free Ukrainian national-consciousness from Moscow cultural hegemony, and tie it to the \"psychological Europe\", where Ukraine's ideological home should be."
 ukraine_borotbist.66.a: "Cyrillic has been our alphabet for ages - it will remain."
 ukraine_borotbist.66.b: "We should use both alphabets, like in times of Old Commonwealth."
 ukraine_borotbist.66.c: "Start preparing plans for future implementation."

 ukraine_borotbist.67.t: "Thoughts Against the Current"
 ukraine_borotbist.67.d: "The latest writing of Comrade Khvyliovyi is an article titled \"Thoughts Against the Current\" where he spends pages to criticise approximately everything in his messy, eccentric style. He declares bureaucratisation the great shackle of Ukrainian revolution, and that if it is not rooted out it will grow and will eventually extinguish the revolutionary freedoms. He attacks excessive bureaucratisation on its every level from village communes to the Council of Deputies, calling for a spiritual purge of the administration and instead shifting focus to what really matters: the defence and advancement of the Ukrainian revolution until Ukraine can be in equal standing with the Western world. His favourite topic - that of apparent stagnancy of Ukrainian art world dominated by mediocrity and cheap propaganda - is thoroughly explored as well."
 ukraine_borotbist.67.a: "Ignore the article."
 ukraine_borotbist.67.b: "Commission an article denouncing his claims."

 ukraine_borotbist.69.t: "Matter of Latinisation Project"
 ukraine_borotbist.69.d: "Mykola Khvyliovyi is not a man to be ignored, it seems. He has launched another press campaign to show the superiority of the Latin script over the Cyrillic, which he condemns as \"remnant of Tsarism.\" It is not unlike it was the last time - large parts of Ukrainians are insulted by the idea and consider Cyrillic part of the national identity. However, Khvyliovyi's cult-like following keeps hammering his mantras relentlessly."
 ukraine_borotbist.69.a: "We should focus on rebuilding the country, rather than dividing it more."
 ukraine_borotbist.69.b: "It's too risky to replace it. Adopting both should please everyone."
 ukraine_borotbist.69.c: "Khvyliovyi waited long enough, implement it."

 ukraine_borotbist.70.t: "Khvyliovyi Resigns"
 ukraine_borotbist.70.d: "Tired of constant opposition to his ambitious reforms, Mykola Khvyliovyi has informed the Council of Deputies of his resignation. In a bitter tone, he has painted his opponents as conspiracy of cultural reaction, which only looks backwards and refuses to understand the great future awaiting the Ukrainian nation. Khvyliovyi will continue to promote his beliefs through his newspaper, but he no longer feels that he can serve as the head of the party's cultural efforts. While popular in his own way, his resignation was welcomed by many, and the more moderate Maik Yokhansen has been elected as his successor."
 ukraine_borotbist.70.a: "Khvyliovyi was too radical. Let's hope Yokhansen will do a fine job."

 ukraine_borotbist.71.d: "Yokhansen, being one of the founders of VAPLITE himself, combines Khvyliovyi's intellectual bravery with much more amiable personality and sensible degree of moderation. While his views aren't all that different from those of his predecessor, it is a certainty that Yokhansen will dedicate much more time to his duties as head of the party's cultural department, and not to constant bickering in the literary press. Khvyliovyi's grandiose style had its merits, but Yokhansen's more subtle, but no less deep touch will serve us better. Under his guidance common parts of everyday Ukrainian life will be raised to the forefront of culture. His Cultural Revival programme will encourage artists to capture and elevate authentic Ukraine, transforming mundane into majestic and beautiful."

 ukraine_borotbist.72.t: "Red Cossacks Raise Banners!"
 ukraine_borotbist.72.d: "The history of the Cossacks within the Ukrainian left is varying. They became infamous as part of the Tsarist state violence machinery, and likewise they were utilised by the Hetman and his cronies to justify their oppressive measures. However the truth of Cossacks is much deeper - they are not glorified military police, but they were among world's first egalitarian societies, which obeyed no lords or kings. After all, Cossacks were born out of runaway serfs, who dreamed of equality between all men. Thus a Hetman is not a king, but a first among equals, until this tradition was ruined through Tsarist subjugation of Cossacks. Now we have the chance to revive the original form of Cossackhood - that of a liberty-loving brother-soldier."
 ukraine_borotbist.72.a: "Together against oppression!"

 ukraine_borotbist.73.t: "The Impending Threat"
 ukraine_borotbist.73.d: "Upon the Borotbyst ascension to power, one of the first acts of the newly-installed Council of Deputies was to repudiate Ukraine's treaties with foreign, imperialist powers. The economic and military agreements with Germany, as well as Austria, were unanimously voted to be revoked by the Council, to be effective immediately. The new law dictated that any German or Austrian advisors or military personnel were to be expelled. Those lucky enough to escape crossed the border mostly into Poland, seeking refuge from the chaotic revolution and telling stories of \"syndicalist oppression\" to local authorities. Others who did not manage to flee in time were rounded up; most were interned at Lukianivska Prison in [202.GetName] to await their ultimate fate.\n\nThe news of the revolution had reached government headquarters in Berlin almost immediately, and the reprisals against German and Austrian tyranny have greatly affected public opinion with calls from newspapers in Berlin and Vienna to crush the revolution and restore order. The same day the law was passed, an ultimatum reached [202.GetName] from Berlin. It stated that the revolutionaries were to relinquish power immediately and restore power to the legitimate government, with \"harsh action\" if they did not comply; the ultimatum was ignored. The most powerful German divisions are located in the west to defend against the major syndicalist powers, with not enough forces near the Ukrainian border to carry out a proper invasion, so it seems unlikely that the attack will take place immediately. Nonetheless, what the Borotbyst revolutionaries predicted will no doubt come true: Ukraine will be forced to defend her sovereignty against the overwhelming forces of the Reichspakt."
 ukraine_borotbist.73.a: "No one will stop the waves of revolution!"

 ukraine_borotbist.74.t: "A Fighter's Analysis"
 ukraine_borotbist.74.d: "With the surge in Borotbyst popularity and rising chaos in the countryside, Oleksandr Shumskyi becomes a bigger problem with each day. To finally deal with him, [UKR.GetLeader] decided to order the APDMVS to examine of Shumskyi's background and character. They began with what Hetmanist Intel has already gathered on him:\n\nNAME: Oleksandr Yakovych Shumskyi\n\nBORN: 2nd of December, 1890, to a family of Batraks (impoverished serfs).\n\nNOTES: Errors concerning his place of birth. Either born in Borova Rudnia ([202.GetName] Governorate) or Turchynka (Volyn Governorate). Member of \"Spilka\" since 1908 and UPS-R since 1911. Together with his associates and followers left UPS-R in 1918 in order to form a new party - \"Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (Communists-Borotbysts)\".\n\nThe agents decided to start with his place of birth to determine which one of them is true. As he wasn't present in church records of Borova Rudnia, the only place left was Turchynka village. Analysis of its church records proved to be useful as an interesting fact was found: not only did Shumskyi lie about his upbringing, he also lied about his ancestry. What was found was that he was son of a forester, and a grandson of a priest assigned to Turchynka village. Additionally, he in fact came from a noble family, with \"Jastrzębiec\" (or Goshawk) as its coat of arms. The obvious question is raised: what should we do with this information? Leaking it to the press might paint Shumskyi as a liar and an enemy to his own supporters. On the other hand, people might not believe these claims - some even mocking it - and Shumskyi himself would most probably deny them."
 ukraine_borotbist.74.a: "We need more solid claims to strike him down."
 ukraine_borotbist.74.b: "Leak it, we must use whatever we can."

 ukraine_borotbist.75.t: "Integration of Komnezamy"
 ukraine_borotbist.75.d: "We created the Komnezamy as an association of free peasants to represent their interests and coordinate redistribution of land. Now that land reform is being finalised, the organisation has outlived its usefulness. The plan is to integrate its main structures, such as peasant's associations, into official state institutions under jurisdiction of Council of Deputies."
 ukraine_borotbist.75.a: "It served its duty well."

 ukraine_borotbist.76.t: "The Constitutional Convention"
 ukraine_borotbist.76.d: "The Constitutional Convention of Ukraine, mostly composed of leading Borotbyst figures, agreed on only one thing: that the former constitution of Ukrainian People's Republic was null and void. The rest collapsed into debate soon after. Chairman Shumskyi had tasked Mykhailo Poloz to prepare a constitutional draft the convention would use as a starting point, but as soon as it was read out, it was deemed entirely unsatisfactory. The Borotbyst political programme it was based on had been woefully vague in many points, so a liberal amount of loaning from the French and British constitutions had been done.\n\nImmediately, vastly different opinions arose. Levko Kovaliv argued that the constitution borrows too much, and it should be \"more inherently Ukrainian\" in its character, though actual details on what this entailed were unclear. Hryhorii Hrynko accused Kovaliv's idea as being nationalist and declared that the Communist-Syndicalist synthesis is a much more rational solution than something stubbornly \"national.\" Mykola Khvyliovyi seemed to oppose the very concept of constitution, arguing that it is a construct made to shackle the absolute power of workers' councils and the revolution. At multiple points the chairman had to call for a pause as emotions heightened too much. After fourteen hours of debating and numerous votes, a draft was agreed upon to be given to the Council of Deputies."
 ukraine_borotbist.76.a: "Great show of unity, everyone..."

 ukraine_borotbist.77.t: "End of the Hetman"
 ukraine_borotbist.77.d: "With the advent of the Borotbyst Revolution, the country has found itself surrounded on all sides, far from its Third Internationale allies. There are rumours that the Reichspakt or Russia is planning an offensive to take [202.GetName] given its proximity to the frontlines. With the country partially occupied, the Borotbyst leadership is discussing what is to be done about the former Hetman, Pavlo Petrovych Skoropadskyi, rotting in Lukianivska Prison in western [202.GetName] ever since the successful revolt against him.\n\nIf [202.GetName] were to fall, Skoropadskyi could be captured and reinstated as a puppet leader for the Russians or Germans. It would be a crushing blow to our righteous cause, for it would risk the outright collapse of the troops' already wavering morale. To the workers of the revolution, it would cause consternation that simply ought to be averted.\n\nWith the Hetman question being the talk of the day in [202.GetName], after the Chervonyi Prapor newspaper spread rumours about it from an undisclosed source, it has reached the ranks of the Lukianivska prison guard. Constituted of primarily fanatical and benighted folk, to them the very sight of the Hetman everyday has grown repulsive with time. Now a frail old man, his days are numbered as he awaits to see how his life will end; his body stiff and immobile for all he has gotten is bits of bread to eat.\n\nIn the evening of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], with the order of an officer, he was dragged by two subalterns out of his cell, limping on his way out to the yard. Tied upright to a wooden pole and his eyes blindfolded, the Hetman uttered his final words. The officer proceeded to announce all the charges against him in a sort of improvised trial speaking vehemently as if preaching to vanquish the devil.\nWith a twilight on the horizon, a soldier shot the man with his rifle. Just like the colour of the sky late that night, this affair was classified."

Obviously the most popular option would be restoring the past government, though the revolution has brought their competence and popularity into question. Perhaps a more responsible option would be pressuring them to accept some cabinet changes, and create an overall more conservative and reliable republican regime.

The Russian government can be assured that Germany and their allies will deal with the communist uprising. If the Russians cross the Ukrainian border, it will be taken as attack against a German ally, the legal government of Ukraine, and thus force Germany to declare war on the invader. Germany has offered the possibility of minor \"border negotiations\" after the revolution has been crushed to ease the tension between Berlin and Moscow. It seems like the Hun is merely playing for time, hoping that offer of negotiations will make us miss the chance of the century."

Their outrageous demands included German withdrawal from the territories \"unjustly taken in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\". As if to call our bluff, they started the invasion almost immediately afterwards, crossing the Ukrainian border at multiple points.

The critics claim that accepting Russian terms would be essentially giving up our hard-won independence, making us no better than Skoropadskyi. Others agree, but admit that there are no other real options, as Ukraine cannot ever find prosperity in stubborn isolation either. Besides, an alliance with the west would be symbolic only, as they can do little to help us in practice. There are also those whole-heartedly supporting the treaty, reminding that [RUS.GetLeader]'s Russia is hardly a Bolshevik one, and that decades old feuds should not stand in the way of international cooperation; did Marx not declare how borders will become irrelevant after the proletariat revolution has succeeded?\n\nBehind the public discussion, the Russian delegation has been clearer. Not accepting the treaty would lead to economic isolation, and Russia might have to intervene to help the Ukrainian proletariat to cast away the false socialists."

 ukraine_borotbist.116.d: "The so-called Friendship Treaty with Moscow has not been without its opponents. Though most in the government understood that without the treaty Ukraine's economy would further deteriorate, behind closed doors the armed forces have not taken it well. To many in the armed forces, especially those in the nationalist clique like that of Yevhen Konovalets, Andrii Melynk and others, who have dedicated their career to an independent Ukraine, the treaty was an affront to everything they have worked for.\n\nFew believed that any action would be taken given the Russian forces stationed in the country; nonetheless, the conspirators executed their plan. With hundreds of soldiers and officers loyal to Konovalets and Melynk, the alarm was sounded, and the Rusanivka Bridge and Darnytsia Railway Station were cut off. With haste, the conspirators moved to capture the security department and the government building to relatively little resistance.\n\nTogether with the rest of the conspirators, Konovalets entered the building to declare his aims. He made it clear that Ukrainian sovereignty would not be infringed upon and that the treaty between Ukraine and Russia will only lead to annexation in the long run - thus, he demanded the treaty between the two to be revoked or renegotiated as to not infringe on Ukrainian statehood. Present in the room was the Chairman himself, who took a sympathetic stance towards Konovalets' demands, but the vagueness of the demands left the legislature in stark debate over what should be done.\n\nA few hours later, it was clear that the conspirators were had ran out of time. Loyalist Ukrainian regiments, aided by the Russian 2nd Infantry Division, began an artillery barrage to clear the blockade of the bridge. Surrounded on all sides, it was clear that the plotters lost momentum. Following their arrests, a Russian newspaper declared: \"Ultranationalist Coup Defeated in [202.GetName].\""

Makhno commanded an army of insurgents that would give the Hetman a tough fight, though in the end he was defeated with the help of German arms. He arrived as an exile to the Commune of France, but ideological disagreements with its institutions led him to arrive in Patagonia, where he has served for years since.\n\nDespite his disagreements with the Borotbysts, Comrade Makhno has stated that he wishes to serve in the army. He furthermore made clear that the language barrier in Patagonia and France had caused significant trouble for him, and though there may be those more aligned with his ideology in Patagonia, there is no greater home than the place where he is known for.\n\nNaturally, Makhno has been accepted into the armed forces, pledging to uphold our struggle for liberty and social justice."

Where stood Shumskyi, Poloz, Hrynko, Kovaliv, Ellan-Blakytnyi was there, as well.\nBorn Vasyl Ellanskyi, our dear comrade was active in Ukrainian Social-Revolutionary and National-Liberation Movements from an early age, first in his home province of Chernihiv and then across the country. Imprisoned in the waning days of the first iteration of UNR, as well as during the Hetmanate, Ellan-Blakytnyi was released after a few months in captivity and immediately began to spread the ideas of our Movement. Such bold and effective actions left an impact and Comrade Ellan-Blakytnyi quickly rose through the party ranks to become the Borotbysts' de-facto second in command.\n\nEven after exile to Paris, our dear comrade remained as active as ever, focusing on ideological polemics with fellow party members and members of other exiled Revolutionary Movements, as well as dabbling in writing revolutionary \"proletarian\" literature.\nIt is with profound sadness then, that Comrade Ellan-Blakytnyi breathed his last in 1926, right as the reactionary forces reared their ugly head in our homeland.\n\nOur dear comrade may not have lived to see the success of our Revolution, but he surely would have been very proud to see us where we are!

##Republic events
 ukraine_republican.1.t: "The New Constitution"
 ukraine_republican.1.d: "On the 29th of April, 1918, the Central Rada approved the Constitution of the People's Republic. The document, slated to create a parliamentary republic which guaranteed equal rights for every citizen, ultimately lasted only a few hours. The very same day, the Hetman's coup would see the constitution swiftly replaced by one far more suited to Skoropadskyi's liking. And yet, those present on the day it was signed into law never abandoned the ideals it represented. Democracy, self-autonomy, independence - they would all be the law of the land one day.\n\nIt would seem that day is almost at hand, as the newly-formed constitutional committee convenes in the Central Council House to begin the process of the restoring the republican constitution. Over the next few weeks, they will thoroughly examine the legislation, amending it where necessary. There are many contentious points in the nearly twenty year old document, which will no doubt cause a stir among the members of the committee, just as they did back in 1918. Still, the Constitution of the People's Republic, thought to be the most progressive piece of legislation in Ukrainian history, is set to come into effect in the coming weeks, this time with nothing standing in its way."
 ukraine_republican.1.a: "As we were saying before we were so rudely interrupted..."
 UKR_convene_constitutional_committee_tt: "At the end of this event chain we will gain a §Ynational spirit§!, the effects of which will depend on the §Ychoices we make§!."

 ukraine_republican.2.t: "Voting Rights for Convicted Criminals"
 ukraine_republican.2.d: "As the constitutional committee mulls over the soon-to-be restored republican constitution, a certain clause has become a topic of discussion over the past few days. The clause in question is Article 17, which states: \"A citizen of the Ukrainian People's Republic may not be restricted in the rights of speech, press, religion, organisation or strike as long as he does not violate the provisions of criminal law.\"\n\nSpecifically, it is the end of this sentence that has caused much debate. Many members of the committee believe that it is unjust to take away these basic rights from criminals, and that this law does not belong in such a progressive document. Others disagree, stating that those who disrespect the institutions of the republic do not deserve to participate in them. Following several days of discussion, a vote is held..."
 ukraine_republican.2.a: "The committee agrees to amend it."
 ukraine_republican.2.a_tt: "The §YConstitution§! will grant us:\n$MODIFIER_STABILITY_FACTOR$: §G+10%§!"

 ukraine_republican.3.t: "Internal Administrative Divisions"
 ukraine_republican.3.d: "The next contentious issue of the constitutional committee was to be the administrative divisions of Ukraine. Before the overthrow of the People's Republic twenty years ago, a law was passed determining the administrative divisions of the state, dividing it between 32 \"zemlias\", lands, which would serve as electoral districts for the Ukrainian National Assembly and the decentralising building block around which public self-government was to be exercised. This proposal was based on Hrushevskyi's ideas, which proposed that the lands were to hold around a million people each, and were to suffice for the independent establishment of sanitary, road, land, industrial and cultural affairs, as well as for the organisation of secondary education.\n\nHowever, upon Skoropadskyi's coup, the divisions were changed, resembling the governorates of the old Russian Empire. Many have argued that Skoropadskyi's administration did not adequately represent the new order, and that power was greatly centralised around [202.GetName]. There is no question that we shall rectify his errors, but to what extent we will do so has been fiercely debated; Ukraine's current borders are not the same as it was during the short period of republican governance, and new divisions must be drawn."
 ukraine_republican.3.a: "The committee agrees to redraw the divisions greatly."
 ukraine_republican.3.a_tt: "The §YConstitution§! will grant us:\n$MODIFIER_STABILITY_FACTOR$: §G+10%§!\n$MODIFIER_POLITICAL_POWER_FACTOR$: §G+5%§!"

 ukraine_republican.4.t: "1937 Constitution of the Ukrainian People's Republic"
 ukraine_republican.4.d: "After days of discussion, the new constitution of the Ukrainian People's Republic has been made the law of the land. The constitution has been hailed as perhaps the most progressive constitutions in Eastern Europe, although not much has changed from the original 1917 constitution.\n\nBut more than anything, the adoption of the constitution has proven to be a significant symbolic victory over the old order. It enshrines the right of the Ukrainian people to exercise their authority through the National Assembly, and the equal rights of citizens of Ukraine whether they are Russian, Belarusian, Polish or Jewish. No longer shall a Hetman have nigh-unrestricted executive authority - the new constitution guarantees that our executive branch, the Council of People's Ministers, is accountable to the people through the National Assembly.\nWith the adoption of the new constitution, we stand as a beacon of liberty in Eastern Europe, a shining example in a land of uncertainty that others are sure to follow."
 ukraine_republican.4.a: "A constitution by the people, for the people!"

 ukraine_republican.5.t: "Finishing the Revolution"
 ukraine_republican.5.d: "Immediately, Vynnychenko set out to order Marshal Volokh and General Tiutiunnyk to begin the disarmament of German army units in Ukraine to protect against the incoming coup. There was some worry that as other higher-ups like Petliura could cause trouble, but surely, after Vynnychenko's next act, there would be none who would stand against Ukraine and the second stage of the revolution. That next act was a grandiose speech to the National Zbory, one that would surely become remembered in Ukrainian history for years.\n\n"For decades, we have fought so that Ukraine may be free. But foreign tyrants have always fought to enslave us! Always and everywhere, for their own selfish gains, they have sought to subjugate the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the face of crushing conditions, we never gave up hope that one day the Hetman would be overthrown, and we still yet hope that we shall resist the Russian aggressors once again.\n\nNow in the west too, they will stop at nothing to exploit Ukraine and the Ukrainian people! The evidence has been made clear:they desire a new April 29th, to destroy the Ukrainian spirit and all we had shed blood for.\n\nWe will not have any of it. We will not make the same mistakes as before. We will fight, and we will win!""
 ukraine_republican.5.a: "It's the final conflict!"

 ukraine_republican.6.t: "Elections to the Labour Congress"
 ukraine_republican.6.d: "Elections to the Labour Congress are about to be held. Differing from past elections, only those who promise to uphold the revolution and to operate in the interests of the working class are allowed to participate in it.\n\nNow that the revolution has succeeded and counterrevolutionary forces have been dealt with, the fate of the Workers' Democratic Union became clear: its two components, the R-RB and UPS-R, have agreed to peacefully dissolve the RDS, and run in the Labour Congress elections separately. In general, control over the Labour Congress is contested by the R-RB and the UPS-R, the former supporting Volodymyr Vynnychenko's bid for Chairman, and the latter supporting Nykyfir Hryhoriiv's.\n\nBut it is not only these who will be participating in the Labour Congress. The Borotbysts have turned around to embrace our successes, and intend to participate in the elections to the Congress. While their popularity has considerably fallen over the years, they may find themselves an influential factor if they are to reconcile with the party they split from originally, the UPS-R. The Ukrainian Communist Party (UKP) has also stated that they will participate in the congress. Roughly, the UKP shares many ideological similarities with the R-RB, in particular with Pisotskyi's wing of the party. While many have expected Pisotskyi to be sidelined, he shares many sympathisers in the R-RB, who believe that Vynnychenko's moderate course is no longer necessary as the revolution has solidified itself.\n\nWhile there were some fears that the USDRP would become irrelevant after the revolution, some of their more independent members continue to align themselves with the moderate wing of the UPS-R, believing that Kovalevskyi's influence may force Hryhoriiv to compromise. Finally, there is the question of Vynnychenko himself. The R-RB likely will not have a majority in the Labour Congress, just as they were outnumbered by the UPS-R when the National Zbory was around. But none can deny that Vynnychenko is quite popular, likely due to his compromising yet skillful leadership. It remains to be seen whether Vynnychenko can muster the support to push forward his \"collectocratic\" agenda, or if he will capitulate to the more radical elements of his party. In the end, the results of the first elections to the Labour Congress are..."

 ukraine_republican.7.t: "1937 General Election"
 ukraine_republican.7.d: "As the unrest following the Anti-Hetman revolt slowly clears, a new, democratic way of life begins to settle in Ukraine. Once a reactionary, authoritarian state, Ukraine now proudly stands as a paragon of democracy and republicanism. It is no understatement, then, that the 1937 general election is going to be an important one.\n\nSymon Petliura announced the election on the dawn of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], and, by the evening, dozens of parties had already declared their intent to participate. Among all the participants three stand out as the most influential ones: the Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party (URDP), the Ukrainian Social Democratic Workers' Party (USDRP) and an alliance of radical socialists known as the Workers' Democratic Union (RDS). Unlike the Soim, the new republican parliament will play a crucial role in the country's politics. As such, this election will largely decide what course will be taken by a reforged Ukrainian state.\n\nOn the surface, the former participants of the now obsolete VDR may espouse similar rhetoric, but they all have their own goals and agendas. Each party has a vastly different plan for the nation, and each candidate a vastly different vision for the future. However, Ukraine's parliamentary system may just force them to compromise on these ideals.\n\nIn order to win the election, they will have to find like-minded allies in the National Zbory, a task which is easier said than done. They cannot hope to secure a majority by themselves and will need trustworthy allies if they want to reform Ukraine to their liking. A coalition, therefore, will most definitely be formed, but who constitutes it depends entirely on how this election will go."
 ukraine_republican.7.a: "It's time to finally seize this long awaited opportunity – go with the URDP!"

 ukraine_republican_dynamic_socialist_win: "The Workers' Democratic Union emerged as the plurality holder. Once considered a dark horse in the campaign for government, the Socialist Revolutionaries and Council-Revolutionary Bloc nonetheless gained a surprising amount of seats in the National Assembly. After reaching out to the USDRP, the Workers' Democratic Union formed the country's first leftist government since 1918. The URDP came to form the opposition, along with the right-wing parties, which barely secured enough votes to remain in the Zbory.\n\nThis result represents a more radical shift in the Ukrainian political sphere, and it remains to be seen whether or not Volodymyr Vynnychenko will be able to deliver on his campaign promises."

However, another candidate has been brought to the National Zbory's consideration: Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, Ukraine's own Habsburg prince. He is a more divisive choice: his supporters, many having already fought under Vasyl's command during the Great War, see Vasyl as a true patriot, one who is not Ukrainian merely because of being born there, but by choice and personal conviction.

The German ambassador has been closely following the Ukrainian elections, no doubt writing reports to Berlin over a potential full socialist takeover of the country. We do not wish for war and hostility with Germany - in an ideal world, we could all live in peace without this sort of political meddling - but the realities of geopolitics have forced Vynnychenko and Fedenko to shake hands and forge a coalition, despite the Worker's Party clearly being the weaker member of the arrangement.\n\nIn negotiations behind closed doors, it is decided that moderates shall take control of the foreign ministry and a number of other minor positions, while the Workers' Democratic Union will take rest of the cabinet posts."

 ukraine_republican.14.d: "The Hetmanist movement has been sent into a tailspin following the collapse of Skoropadskyi's rule. Many parties, organisations and movements that once held a massive sway over Ukrainian politics have suffered major losses, chief among them being the USKhD.\n\nAfter the republican rebellion, the party essentially split itself into two camps: the \"Pragmatists\", headed by Serhii Shemet and the \"True Believers\", headed by Mykola Kochubei. Shemet's Pragmatists quickly abandoned the USKhD and ran alongside the UDKhP, though their former ties to the Hetman's government have effectively made them political pariahs. Expectedly, they achieved abysmal results in last year's election and hold little to no influence in the nation's political scene.\n\nMeanwhile, those who still believed in the USKhD's values joined Kochubei's new organisation: \"Brotherhood of Classocrats-Monarchists\". This group stands for the immediate resignation of the government and the restoration of a classocratic society, with the Hetman in charge. Kochubei's clique now firmly stands against the Republic and its democratic systems, but has nowhere near enough power to realise any of its goals.\n\nHowever, there is one force that has somewhat managed to stay afloat following the crisis. The Ukrainian Democratic Agrarian Party, once the USKhD's coalition partner, barely won enough votes to remain in the National Zbory. While the UDKhP leadership is trying to cleanse the party of its objectionable past, their image is tarnished and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Additionally, with the right beginning to reorganise in a more populist direction, the future of the UDKhP is uncertain."

While every party is definitely taking it seriously, it's the socialists and social democrats who make it the main focus of their campaigns. It's hard to compete with their wild promises, so some in the party suggest keeping our rhetoric on the question reasonable and cautious.\n\nThis is not the last election: broken promises and popular disappointment won't improve our future political prospects. Still, some propose a more aggressive approach. At the very least we should remind the people that during all those years, while our opponents were busy with useless debates in Lviv coffeehouses, we were hard at work here, fighting tooth and nail for fair land redistribution. So now, without resistance from the landowners' lobby and the stubbornness of the Hetmanites, we can put our experience to use and finally bring to the people long anticipated justice."
 ukraine_republican.31.d2: "Land for all! That was the promise that had rallied the peasants to support the VDR against the Hetman. While every party is definitely taking it seriously, to socialists, the other parties still seem too soft on great landowners, talking of compensations and legalism. Most of the farmers support the UPS-R as of now, but by taking the land issue as its own, our party could constantly push for more concessions to the peasants, and eventually win over parts of the countryside from the Socialist-Revolutionaries."

While every party is definitely taking it seriously, to us socialists, the other parties still seem too soft on great landowners, talking of compensations and legalism. Most of the farmers support the UPS-R as of now, but by taking the land issue as his own, Mazepa and his party could constantly push for more concessions to the peasants, and eventually win over parts of the countryside to the USDRP. This outcome isn't guaranteed by any means, but it still might prove useful to partially direct our campaign against the social-democrats."

 ukraine_republican.32.t: "Selianska Spilka"
 ukraine_republican.32.d: "The original Selianska Spilka was an organisation dedicated to giving peasantry a proper representation as well with educational, cultural and judicial matters. It could be desrcribed as form of peasant's union, similar to syndicalist in principle but without urbanism and veneration of revolutionary violence. The model could be restored as a way to organise the peasantry - and perhaps spread UPS-R's collectivist principles among the peasantry while helping them in their issues.\n\nSpilka could potentially be formidable in getting votes for the RDS, and it will certainly be difficult to contend with them on the land issue. To reassure the electorate, we could launch a widepread media campaign, hammering in our promises and showcasing our policies in practice, to show that we are not only solving the land issue, but doing it more effectively than anyone else."

 ukraine_republican.33.t: "Unfulfilled Promises"
 ukraine_republican.33.d: "To win over the support of the populace, one must make vast promises to solve all of the pressing matters affecting our nation. Promises that our government, it seems, has not yet fulfilled. As many grow impatient and restless over our inaction, public support for our leadership has begun to plummet. Protests are becoming more and more prevalent, and many among our voter base have renounced us in favour of the opposition. While our administration soldiers on nonetheless, these developments shall definitely hinder our plans."
 ukraine_republican.33.a: "Remember all those promises you made? Your people sure do."
 ukraine_republican.33_tt: "Our §tfailure§! to fulfil even these simple promises doesn't spell well for our administration, nor the stability of the nation. We §Ymust§! turn this around at once, lest the situation §Rgets out of hand§!."

 ukraine_republican.34.t: "Pragmatism versus Radicalism"
 ukraine_republican.34.d: "For many of the revolutionaries who took part in the Anti-Hetman Revolt, a question arose: what are we? For some, the answer could be found in the RDS - those who fought against the Hetman's tyrannical government were fighting for socialism, radical redistribution of land and uncompromising action. For others, the answer could be found in the URDP and USDRP - those who sought to overthrow the Hetman's government because the Hetman would refuse to compromise and was marred with inefficiencies.\n\nThis question has become the primary issue of the election. For us, however the socialists may portray themselves, the Anti-Hetman Revolt was a peasant uprising for those who wanted peace, land, and democracy. The people never loved the Hetmanist tyranny, but they don't want to see it replaced with a communist tyranny. Still, we may be at risk of sounding too moderate and not properly capitalising on the new political environment of the People's Republic, something the socialist parties are sure to take advantage of."

As we are stuck in the middle between the moderate URDP and the radical RDS, the question has become rather divisive. The Anti-Hetman Revolt was truly a fight for peace, land and democracy, but some argue that it goes much further than that. Under our leadership, we will not simply do the bare minimum that any semi-competent statesman could achieve, but instead achieve a truly social revolution. Perhaps we should emphasise these kinds of ideals; they are what led us to victory, after all."

Naturally, the answer is the obvious: the RDS is the proper choice of the Ukrainian voter. Many will vote just on one long-unsolved issue, that being land reform, and there is no doubt that the UPS-R holds considerable sway over the Ukrainian countryside. A campaign solely based on the land reform would certainly work well, but some worry that it may not be enough to make the RDS stand out. Figures within the R-RB in particular advocate that we should also portray ourselves as the forefront fighters for Ukrainian independence and sovereignty against all kinds of imperialism, be it German and Russian. The other parties may have taken part in the Anti-Hetman Revolt, but there is little doubt that they will sell out to Austro-German imperialism, a fact we should perhaps use to our advantage."

People do remember your promises, even if you do not."

 ukraine_republican.36.t: "URDP Under Scrutiny"
 ukraine_republican.36.d: "The existence of the People's Republic is largely owed to the Radical Democratic Party. One of the party's leaders, Oleksandr Shulhyn, took great effort during the Anti-Hetman Revolt to ensure that Berlin did not intervene to crush the revolution, having been in talks with the German government almost from the beginning. The party also hosts the well-known Vasyl Vyshyvanyi who has come to be seen as a man of the people despite his Austrian origins. For the upcoming election, the Radical Democratic Party could be seen as the most right wing compared to the Social Democrats and the Workers' Democratic Union, which has earned them great goodwill among those in the previous administration.\n\nYet their ties to the Hetmanate have come under fire recently by their opponents. It is well known that Shulhyn worked in the Hetman's government as foreign minister - and that the URDP, though representing the opposition to the ruling Hetman's Coalition, still held various positions. One could pass this off as attempting to work within the system to improve it, something the URDP was clearly trying to do - nonetheless, the socialist parties have weaponised the party's history to paint them as either being unprincipled, or worse, traitors to the revolution. What shall their response be?"

 ukraine_republican.37.t: "Tapping into the Trade Unions"
 ukraine_republican.37.d: "The support of the trade unions will be invaluable in the coming election. The trade unions have traditionally been aligned with the Borotbysts and the Ukapists, following orthodox syndicalist lines; but times are different now. The Hetman's brutal actions, repressing socialists of any kind, had radicalised many into far-left, revolutionary positions. Now that the people's republic has been restored and these same revolutionaries are no longer being targeted, other parties have sought to gain a foothold on the trade unions. Independent unions have sprung up greatly after the revolution and there is significant potential to turn these to their side. However, the people's republic is still young and has yet to prove if it can provide an efficient administration, which has made some apprehensive about declaring their allegiance to a new political party.\n\nFor the USDRP, the question is of how we should, if at all, try to draw away the membership of these more radical trade unions. It may be wise to emphasise the USDRP's rather radical history; the more anti-reformist trade unions may be willing to embrace us if they see as the foremost fighters of workplace democracy and against Hetmanist tyranny. Still, some in the party see it as somewhat of a fruitless endeavour. Now that unions are able to freely organise themselves, there is no doubt that the USDRP will be a big player."

Still, the Borotbyst and Ukapist dominance over the trade unions poses a difficult question for us. Perhaps it would be best to make an agreement with the Borotbysts; in exchange for not trying to contest them where they have made local election gains, they will lend us their support in parliamentary elections. Such an agreement would be rather problematic for the UPS-R, given that they tend to contest the Borotbyst vote in local elections. But it would be equally problematic for the R-RB not to come to an agreement, as it will undermine the amount of votes they will receive from urban workers."

 ukraine_republican.39.d: "The leftist coalition comprising our government came to be from a pragmatic alliance between the Workers' Democratic Union and the USDRP. In order to paint his government in a more moderate light, Chairman Vynnychenko elected to concede several positions to members of the Workers' Party. This alliance, they hoped, would have only been a temporary arrangment, another hurdle to overcome on their way to socialism. However, their hopes seem to have been dashed.\n\nIncapable of ensuring their control over the goverenment, the Workers' Democratic Union's plans seem to have fallen through."

 ukraine_republican.40.d: "The great upheavals of 1936 and 1937 have reinvigorated the semi-dormant Ukrainian intelligentsia circles. Those who ascribe themselves to an ‘intellectual class' are starting to feel that the future is once more full of possibilities and promise. As always, the visions of bright tomorrow tend to be varied, so heated debates, lengthy pamphlets and scathing articles once again accompany tense intellectual discussion on the prospects of the restored Ukrainian republic.\n\nAll main election competitors have a considerable standing among Ukrainian intelligentsia and regard it as an valuable electoral constituency. As such, it's important to construct and carefully push the right campaign message, one that will be able to attract sympathisers without hopelessly alienating all the others. Grudges aren't easily forgotten among these people, so being too vicious in the attacks on our opponents might backfire later.\n\nYears of tireless work in the cultural and educational spheres have already netted us a great deal of goodwill from intellectual circles, so perhaps keeping our message more conciliatory is the right thing to do."

 ukraine_republican.41.t: "Formation of the UNP"
 ukraine_republican.41.d: "Following the restoration of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian right has been thrown into a difficult situation. Attempts to rebuild a proper rightist force, one that can adapt to the new political consensus, have mostly gone awry. Most of the ideologically-minded Hetmanist forces have been almost totally pushed out, whereas the more nonpartisan and independent statesmen that worked under the Hetman's regime are finding it difficult to reenter politics. Perhaps the best chance for the right comes from someone who does not fit either of these descriptions: Mykola Mikhnovskyi. After leaving the UDKhP, Mikhnovskyi decided to found his own party, the UNP (Ukrainian People's Party). With the UDKhP now in a tailspin, the door has been left open for the UNP to become the largest party of the Ukrainian right, and it will certainly be more populist than any of the old Hetmanist parties.\n\nFor the URDP, the UNP's slow rise gives way to an important question. Much of the UNP's rhetoric has been directed at the socialist parties, in particular the RDS, and though the party is quite small, Mikhnovskyi's influence may just be enough to hurt our opponents. Tolerating the UNP's rise, at least in the short term, is not out of the question. However, the right wing of our party has advocated against this, as they see it as a direct challenge to their power and influence, especially in appealing to the up-and-coming small and middle landowner classes. The URDP could certainly do more to attract political moderates, they argue, and we could more easily take on a potential conservative resurgence in the future."

 ukraine_republican.42.t: "A Soldier's Due"
 ukraine_republican.42.d: "Among the various constituencies courted by the competing parties, one stands out in particular: those servicemen who willingly raised weapons against the criminal regime. Their deeds and sacrifices helped to bring down the Hetman's tyranny, their stories will become a part of a foundational mythos of the new Republic, and their political allegiance might influence the course of the country in the future. They constitute a social group whose importance, despite relatively low numbers, is recognised by all main election competitors.\n\nSome among these men turned to the rebellious cause only after the URDP declared its total opposition to Skoropadskyi's government. Additionally, party members played an important role in establishing links between the exiles and those in the military sympathetic to them. On the other hand, electoral performance relies, in no small part, on recognisable personalities, and in this regard the URDP lacks people able to properly compete with the likes of Symon Petliura or Yurii Tiutiunnyk. As such, some suggest shifting our focus to the other side: to those who stood aside or who happened to be on the side of the Hetman. Many of them are demoralised and confused; offering them a prospect of reliable governance and of a stable future might be just enough to earn their favour. After all, the defeated deserve mercy too."

Leveraging his popularity among the soldiers might not only bring us votes, but also lay foundations for the new class of servicemen: one unshakably devoted to the very idea of the People's Republic. Still, even among the party, some advise caution. Tying the party's image to the sole military person too much might prove unwise in the future."

Some propose to seek an alliance with Yurii Tiutiunnyk. ‘Yurko' is rightfully recognised as a hero of the rebellion, widely popular among the soldiers, sympathetic to the cause of true revolution, and, importantly, completely lacks political ambitions. Others caution against the folly of the ‘Petliurism': the celebration of military icons is often detrimental to the revolutionary cause.

Thus, their hopes are that the USDRP in the coalition will, at the least, be able to properly sway the URDP in a more leftwards direction.\n\nWhether those hopes will bear any fruit remains to be seen. For sure, keeping the USDRP happy will be a tall task, but it will be a very important one.

 ukraine_republican.48.t: "The Three Pillars of the Party"
 ukraine_republican.48.d: "With the coalitional talks finalised, a new political landscape is gradually emerging. The URDP, as a senior partner in the ruling coalition, is poised to occupy a key position in it. The party, however, isn't a monolithic structure, so the post-election government makeup reflects not only the compromises reached with the USDRP, but also the existing intra-party factionalism.\n\nOleksandr Shulhyn, representing not only the party at large, but also its centrist faction specifically, has been elected as the Chairman of the National Zbory. The party's centre is an assembly less bound together by strong ideological vision and more by the matters of practicality. It serves as a bedrock of the party's administration and is largely responsible for running its political machine. After all, only a well organised party will be able to uphold ideals of progress and democracy in these trying times.\n\nAndrii Nikovskyi, one of the leading figures of the party's left wing, has been confirmed as the head of the Council of People's Ministers. The left faction has been steadily growing as a result of Hetmanate's inability to address numerous social issues combined with the political vacuum left after the suppression of the USDRP and other left-leaning forces.

Its main interests lie with the support of ‘grassroots capitalism' of small, middle and cooperative enterprises, combined with the advocacy of the interests of the small and middle landowners.

 ukraine_republican.48.d2: "With the coalitional talks finalised, a new political landscape is gradually emerging. The URDP, as a senior partner in the ruling coalition, is poised to occupy a key position in it. The party, however, isn't a monolithic structure, so the post-election government makeup reflects not only the compromises reached with the USDRP, but also the existing intra-party factionalism.\n\nVasyl Vyshyvanyi has been elected as the Chairman of the National Zbory. While he symbolically represents the entire party, his tenure will significantly depend on the party's centrist faction. The party's centre is an assembly less bound together by strong ideological vision and more by the matters of practicality. It serves as a bedrock of the party's administration and is largely responsible for running its political machine. After all, only a well organised party will be able to uphold ideals of progress and democracy in these trying times.\n\nAndrii Nikovskyi, one of the leading figures of the party's left wing, has been confirmed as the head of the Council of People's Ministers. The left faction has been steadily growing as a result of Hetmanate's inability to address numerous social issues combined with the political vacuum left after the suppression of the USDRP and other left-leaning forces. The party's left advocates for the strong state control over crucial economic sectors, champions socially progressive causes, and brings a healthy dose of constructive radicalism to the overall URDP vision.\n\nFinally, the position of the leadership over the URDP parliamentary faction has been bestowed upon Volodymyr Dolenko, one of the heads of the party's right wing.

The cessation of this alliance's operations does not mean we have fallen back on any of our ideals.\" Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Nykyfir Hryhoriiv both concluded by stating that the coalition between their respective parties would continue, most likely for the sake of the upcoming election, which they no doubt plan to participate in."

Prisovskyi is a noted Hetman loyalist, a member of the SHD, and is rather infamous for his efforts in defeating the peasant uprisings of 1919, not to mention one of the Hetman's top generals facing against our forces during the Anti-Hetman Revolt. However, most among our military recognise his expertise and if rehabilitated he could serve well in our armed forces. Indeed, among the Hetman's forces, he is rather palatable, especially in comparison to the likes of Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. We could either have him retire from military affairs and live the rest of his life in private or welcome him back into the military, though the latter is likely to cause some opposition."

 ukraine_republican.52.t: "A Rumble in the East"
 ukraine_republican.52.d: "A right to strike is one of the basic rights guaranteed by the People's Republic's constitution, and, it seems, some are ready to exercise it to the fullest. The Independent Union of Miners is a new organisation, not tied to the established trade union structures and created after the lift of the restrictions on labour associations imposed by the Hetmanate. It enjoys quite a lot of support from the miners of the Donbas region and is responsible for the numerous strikes now gripping the mining industry. Strikes are to be expected, with the economy only recently starting recovering from the shock of the Black Monday crisis, but these ones have a streak of militancy and radicalism more reminiscent of the heady days of 1936.\n\nIt is obvious that while the workers have justified grievances, the UKP and Borotbysts, without a doubt standing behind this Independent Union, are using the situation to further their own political goals: to disrupt public order and discredit our newly established government. Our partners in the USDRP managed to achieve an understanding of sorts with the leading figures of the Union and presented to us a road map, designed to alleviate labour tensions in the long run.\nTwo main points of the agenda: bringing mining enterprises under state supervision and continuous state support for organised labour. A pledge to these causes might win the trust of the Union leadership and calm the present hectic situation.\n\nThis proposition immediately raised suspicion among the party. Some argue that the USDRP is merely using the ongoing crisis to push for its own narrow goals. There are no guarantees, and even in the case of success, the USDRP will simply take credit for it, building its own political capital at our expense. Strikes, after all, can be waited out, while the People's Militia ensures that they cause no disruption of public order. Still, inaction and hesitancy may put our administration in a bad light, so perhaps going with the USDRP's plan is the right thing to do."

 ukraine_republican.53.t: "Nothing Personal, Just Business"
 ukraine_republican.53.d: "The Black Monday crisis has led to an unprecedented level of withdrawal of foreign investments from our economy. Unsure about the future of Ukrainian markets, international capital largely decided to cut losses, only barely halted by the promises of the Relief Bill. Even this relative calm didn't last for long, as the revolt and subsequent Republican victory shattered what little confidence remained in Ukrainian stability among foreign businessmen. Many of them, initially drawn to Ukraine by the promises of cheap labour, weak unions and loosely enforced regulations, realised that these preferable conditions might soon come to an end. Others, confusing our righteous rebellion with some communist putsch, started to fear that their enterprises would be forcefully confiscated by the state. A ridiculous notion, but nonetheless damaging our credibility.\n\nRegaining the trust of foreign investors is an important test for our reforged Republic, one that will show if its government is mature enough to make necessary compromises in the name of common good. At stake is not only economic stability or international credibility, but the very future of Ukraine as a modern state: foreign expertise is indispensable for the successful industrialisation and overall development of our country.\n\nIt will be a long process, but the first steps might be relatively simple. A firm commitment to the rule of law and staunch rebuke against any prospects of ‘revolutionary excesses' will showcase the seriousness of our intentions. Utilising our remaining connections among the circles of the now defunct Protofis might convince those still on the fence. A complex of stopgap legislative measures regarding the tax policy might win us some time, but will without a doubt upset our partners in the coalition. Still, something must be done and necessary decisions must be taken quickly."

As revolutionaries celebrated throughout the land and as the hetmanist forces laid down their arms, the Ukrainian people would find themselves on the cusp of a brand-new age.\n\nThousands had gathered in front the Central Council House in [202.GetName], where Petliura was set to give a historical address: \"... despite all of his attempts, the Hetman could not break our unshakeable belief in a future where we would no longer be bound by chains. The former government tried to silence our calls for freedom and fought with all its might against the unstoppable revolutionary tide. And yet, in spite of it all, the republican cause prevailed. It is finally time to right the injustice committed on our nation eighteen and a half years ago. I, Symon Petliura, hereby declare the Ukrainian People's Republic.\"\n\nThe announcement would be met with cheers from the jubilant crowd. By noon, the entire country had heard the news - the People's Republic, thought to have been cast into the dustbin of history, has returned.\n\nPetliura would assume temporary leadership of the newly declared government until the election, which is set to take place in the coming months. It is still unknown what Germany thinks of this development, but an answer from Berlin is expected in the coming days."

The tenure of the [UKR.GetRulingParty] government is slowly coming to an end, and although an election should be held in the coming weeks, the current situation has certainly complicated matters. The Zbory has, therefore, voted to postpone the election and allow the government to remain in power until peace returns to our lands.\n\nSeveral figures in the parliament and government have stated that holding elections at a time like this would be irresponsible. This is a sentiment shared by the majority of the Ukrainian populace, but many are disappointed to hear that they will have to wait so long to have their voices heard again. A renewed determination to bring this war to a close has resulted from this, with many ready to fight for their democratic way of life."

 ukraine_republican.56.t: "A Threat on the Right Flank"
 ukraine_republican.56.d: "While some might assume that the triumph of the Republic either crashed, or forced into submission all its enemies, the reality is more complicated. Security services indicate that certain threats still remain, lurking in the background, gathering strength and waiting for opportunity to strike.\n\nThe remnants of the SHD is one of these threats. The majority of its leadership have either fled the country or was apprehended, but a significant number of its members are still on the loose. Some of them might have abandoned their cause, but remaining diehards are sure to cause trouble if left unchecked. That's why significant efforts were directed toward the uncovering of remaining SHD structures among the armed forces and the police. Some of the results proved to be quite surprising: there are strong suspicions that Vasyl Murashko, high ranking staff officer of the Air Fleet Inspectorate, was a SHD member since early 30s. Despite his relatively low profile behaviour, he apparently played an important role in facilitating SHD infiltration of Ukrainian security apparatus. Further investigation might gather enough proof for the formal case against him.\n\nAnother, albeit less pronounced threat, lies with the so-called League of Ukrainian Nationalists. A relatively small group, popular mainly among students, it still has some following in the army. For now it's hard to connect its members to any pronounced anti-Republican activities. Even more, scattered reports indicate that during the rebellion some units under the command of LUN-affiliated junior officers mutinied and refused to follow orders of the hetmanists. Still, the League preaches a doctrine of national chauvinism and the Savinkovist veneration of dictatorship incompatible with true Republican ideals. As such, a number of its followers among the army, including one of its founders, colonel Volodymyr Martynets, has been placed under close surveillance."

 ukraine_republican.57.t: "Reconciling with the Agrarian Democrats"
 ukraine_republican.57.d: "One thing that the URDP lacks in common with the other political forces in the People's Republic was its legal status during the Hetmanist era. Though still a progressive reformist force during that time, the Hetmanist system greatly suppressed strong ideological sentiments, leading to the party becoming somewhat ideologically diluted as a result.\n\nMuch of the same could be said for the UDKhP; many had joined the party not out of ideological convictions but simply a desire to find a place in the political sphere. Now that the tables have turned and the UDKhP has been turned into near irrelevancy by the political shakeup, as well as the fact that more of the Ukrainian right wing is turning towards the UNP, a new development has occurred. A number of Independents, formerly part of the UDKhP but who exited the party before the elections due to the party's associations with Hetmanist politics, are now seeking membership in the URDP.\n\nThe political influence of these independents would certainly be useful, as their patronage networks have largely remained despite the uprooting of the Hetmanist system. However, one must ask if their membership will be necessary or helpful in the long term. The ideological tenets of the URDP have become only more pronounced since the republic was reborn, and though the party retains its big tent nature for now, we should be careful not to become a party of apathetic civil servants."

 ukraine_republican.58.d: "With the pro-Hetmanist military cliques in disarray, new centres of influence are rising among Ukrainian officers. One, involving Symon Petliura and his confidants, is of little concern to us: we managed to reach an understanding that political interference has no place in the new Ukrainian army.\n\nThere is, however, another notable group. A high ranking officer clique that has remained untouched both by Hetmanist interference and our attempts to depoliticise the army: the Sichovyky, led by General Konovalets. Konovalets' reputation as an esteemed general is unquestioned, and though he and his clique have remained uninvolved in politics at large (though being somewhat courted by the UNP), the strongly patriotic and nationalist clique he leads has had significant influence over our armed forces.\n\nKonovalets and his men no doubt have a greater allegiance to the People's Republic than the Hetmanate, and his loyalty to the Ukrainian nation is above all else, so there is little reason to distrust them. Still, they remain just outside our grasp, being a far more independent and consolidated clique than the rest. Provided we govern well and the ruling coalition does not fall to disunity, there should be no issues - but if not, then the Sichovyky may prove a more... difficult problem than imagined."

 ukraine_republican.59.d: "For some time our security services have been busy with monitoring the activities of the far-right, ready to counter any threat posed by the remnants of the old order or the new generation of right-wing extremists. Meanwhile, surveillance and prevention measures regarding the far left were being conducted in a far more restrained manner. As such, we might have missed certain important developments.\n\nRecent reports suggest that Borotbysts are preparing to embark on a clandestine recruitment campaign. Utilising their extensive connections among the organised labour and peasantry, drawing on their vast experiences of their slow-burn guerilla campaign against the Hetman, they plan to organise and train a loyal paramilitary force. In support of these reports, a cache of weapons was recently found in one of the raided safehouses. While unaccounted arms stockpiles left from the times of the VDR and the rebellion aren't uncommon, these weapons seem to be recently smuggled into the country. Another troubling factor is that raising and sustaining a paramilitary requires an amount of funds which is hard to obtain without external support. Combined together, these facts are raising some uncomfortable questions regarding the levels of foreign meddling in our internal affairs.\n\nSome in the security circles urge us to redirect at least part of our efforts against this new threat, while others remain sceptical. Surely a far-right infiltration of armed forces is potentially more dangerous than a bunch of bandits armed with old smuggled rifles? This is the job for the People's Militia and police, not for counterintelligence."

In Prime Minister Ponikowski's statement, he identified socialist agitation as the greatest danger to stability in both Poland and Ukraine, and actively complimented the PSL and \"some statesmen in PPS\" for their \"mature\" view towards politics and withholding from alliances with the revolutionaries despite their opposition to MKP's government. It is hard to see if this was genuine, or merely an attempt to drive a wedge between moderate and radical parts of the Centrolew.\n\nHowever, the republican base was electrified. The most vocal activists were actively calling to seize the moment, and ride the great revolutionary wave that has been sparked in Ukraine. Calmer heads have merely acknowledged that the Ukrainian revolution has been proof that authoritarianism can be fought, but shouldn't change the Centrolew's belief in peaceful methods.

 ukraine_republican.75.d1: "As the devastating war finally draws to a close, the people are eager to return to their peaceful way of life. This conflict caused an overwhelming amount of suffering for many people - refugees, wounded veterans, orphans and many others who have lost much to this war. Our nation must begin the process of rebuilding, but first, it is time to hold those elections that were postponed in the wake of the conflict.\n\nNaturally, the main topic of these elections will be reconstruction. All parties have unveiled their plans for ambitious post-war welfare programmes and other campaigns to heal the wounds of the war. The Radicals are banking on securing a majority by promising to create a prosperous and booming economy, which will, in turn, help those afflicted by the war get back on their feet. Meanwhile, the Workers' Party is drumming up support by embracing pacifist rhetoric, promising to never let Ukraine fall victim to a tragedy like this ever again. However, the greatest promises of change are once again coming from the UPS-R and the R-RB. With Ukraine's natural threat neutralised, they claim that now is the ideal time for radical social and political change.\n\nThe electoral situation is made even more unpredictable by a new contender - The Ukrainian People's Peasants' Party, composed from the members of the URDP centre and right factions, somewhat disillusioned with the party's big-tent nature and somewhat vague agenda, and UDKhP defectors aiming to re-enter the political scene under a new brand, not perceived as inherently \"hetmanist\". The party is centred around the leadership of Pylyp Pylypchuk and Viktor Andriievskyi and focused on the defending of economic interests of small and middle holding farmers. While the party remains small, it may prove to be an invaluable partner for a potential parliamentary coalition.\n\nNow, on the [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], millions of voters return to the polls once again to choose their government. To many, it feels like a lifetime has passed since the 1937 elections, and, indeed, the people have been waiting for a long time to have their voices heard again. Democracy, it seems, has prevailed, and the new government shall ensure it thrives for ages to come."

Another potential candidate is former Chairman Symon Petliura. Returning from his military duties, he has expressed a desire to participate in politics yet again.

 ukraine_republican.77.d: "Ever since the election of the Workers' Democratic Union, our diplomats have been fraught with worry. Normally, the election of such a left-wing government in Ukraine would be somewhat tolerable, as their chances of gathering any support from the Internationale would be little to none. But with a socialist government having recently come to power in Russia, this situation has been flipped on its head. The recent direction of the Workers' Democratic Union, including mass nationalisations and land socialisation especially, have been rather concerning - and the chance of Ukraine aligning with a similarly left-wing Russia should we be at war with the latter is now an open question.\n\nLuckily, there are still potential allies in [202.GetName]. We could ask our ambassador to Ukraine, Johannes von Welczeck, to get on the line with Ukrainian foreign minister Arnold Margolin and arrange a meeting with the leadership of the USDRP. The purpose of such a meeting would be to convince the USDRP leadership to limit the Workers' Democratic Union's influence, thus rendering them powerless to conduct any independent negotiations with Russia."

 ukraine_republican.78.d: "Hope for a socialist Ukraine has rekindled lately. Only a few months ago, the exiled Ukrainian People's Republic, led by Symon Petliura and his allies in the Directory, launched an insurgency against the German-backed Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi and successfully overthrew his government. Despite some hoping for a full-blown revolution in Ukraine, many were disappointed when the new government continued ties with Mitteleuropa and alignment with the German sphere.\n\nHowever, some of that hope has come back with the news that Ukraine will be holding an election in the coming months, which has three main contenders: the Radical Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party and the Workers' Democratic Union. The Workers' Democratic Union, true to its name, holds revolutionary socialist views, and though they are sure to be constrained by their rather tenuous position between Germany and Russia, they would be our best bet to support and would no doubt align with us should we prove victorious against Germany. We have maintained unofficial contacts with the Workers' Democratic Union in exile, and some have called for covert funding to the bloc as well as meetings with their leadership so that we may bolster their chances of winning the election."

Covertly, the French have offered to assist the Union with funding and campaigning for the election. Naturally, their assistance has come with some implications - while Germany may be Ukraine's protector now, the tides may shift if the socialist forces in the west are able to make good on their promise of one day toppling the German hegemon."

 ukraine_republican.100.t: "Proposal for a United Ukraine"
 ukraine_republican.100.d: "A union between the Ukrainian part of the Dual Monarchy and the Ukrainian People's Republic was already on the table in 1918, but was struck down by German schemes. But history has given the Ukrainians another chance, as the Hetman has been overthrown and a Ukrainian republic has been created once more. Both the Galicians and the government in [202.GetName] have petitioned for Vienna to allow the people of Galicia decide their own fate, most likely to join their respective nations.\n\nSimply put, the proposal would mean partitioning Galicia to Poland and Ukraine in exchange for their loyalty. This solution is both supported by the Poles of our empire and the Emperor himself. According to the supporters of the Austro-Polish Solution, the Galicians have not become Austrians in 150 years, and they will never become Austrians - so it would make sense to give them their own state in the Austrian sphere of influence. The opponents of such an idea see it as giving in to the Slavic minorities and compromising the empire."

 ukraine_republican.101.d: "Following Hungary's revolt and eventual defeat Zakarpatia found itself transfered to Galicia-Lodomeria following the negotiations at the Augsleich. Now it finds itself at crossroads once more.\n\nIn the early years of Ukrainian independence their claims didn't just encompass the broader region of Galicia-Lodomeria but also the small regions of south-eastern Western Galicia and Eastern Slovakia, based around the Ukrainian population living in the mountains. Yet many in the region, while pertaining many similarities, ultimately see themselves as to having a separate identity.\n\nEither way, the pan balance is set. Shall we transfer it to Ukraine and settle the issue in their favour? Or instead retain it to please those in the cabinet that are sceptical of Ukraine's true loyalties and the local population that wish to retain their identity (that may come under threat from the Ukrainian government) under the Habsburg monarchy?"
 ukraine_republican.101.a: "Zakarpatia is theirs however, with one caveat."
 ukraine_republican.101.b: "Those Ukrainians cannot be trusted with such a strategically important region."

 ukraine_republican.102.t: "Zakarpatia Recognised!"
 ukraine_republican.102.d: "In an astounding surprise following the Galician negotiations, the Austrian establishment has decided to also transfer the region of [73.GetName] rather than retain it for themselves! The prospects of Ukraine one day controlling the region largely faded during the Hetmanate era as more precedented issues concerned the nation but, following the revolution and the setup of a government more friendly to Vienna now in power the Austrians have seen reason. This is a sure triumph for the republic and all the Ukrainian people as a whole."
 ukraine_republican.102.a: "We are grateful."

 ukraine_republican.103.t: "A Necessity or a Mistake?"
 ukraine_republican.103.d: "It is a generally accepted viewpoint among the Ukrainian political scene that foreign alliances are necessary - Moscow may recognise Ukrainian independence officially, but informally, the situation is much more precarious. That fact was what led to the reentering of People's Republic into Mitteleuropa, and even among many in the leftist coalition that now governs Ukraine, the defence treaties with Berlin are mostly viewed as a necessary evil. After all, how could Ukraine defend itself against German aggression?\n\nBut twenty years of exploitation under the German-backed Hetmanate cannot shake off great feelings of mutual distrust - a belief that the new Minister of the Interior, Anatolii Pisotskyi emphasises in his article published in the R-RB newspaper. Pisotskyi is perhaps one of the few bold enough to openly denounce the German government and criticise the Vynnychenko government's course.\n\nCentral to Pisotskyi's views is that the Anti-Hetman Revolt was stopped short before its full 'revolutionary potential' was achieved. Rebels openly espousing socialist slogans toppled the Hetman not by means of peaceful protest, but violent conflict against an openly German backed regime. This revolutionary potential, Pisotskyi states, was cut off when the provisional government chose to negotiate with Germany after the fall of [202.GetName].\n\nPerhaps the most scathing criticism Pisotskyi aims at the provisional government's actions is that its decision to negotiate had no true popular support - the people desire true independence from foreign powers, and the election of the Workers' Democratic Union shows it. But given the fact that many who fought for and approved of the negotiations make up the majority of the RDS' membership, Pisotskyi's dissent has highlighted greater division within the revolutionary left than Vynnychenko's government has let on."

 ukraine_republican.104.t: "The Issue of the Foreign Ministry"
 ukraine_republican.104.d: "As a wise man once said, getting into power is one thing — governing is another. Thus far, this statement has rung true for the Workers' Democratic Union too. Their plans of radical action, from the beginning, have been at odds with the restrictive Mitteleuropean institution and the German demands to keep military spending high, not to mention the stifling of Ukrainian domestic industry due to imports from Berlin.\n\nAlready a controversial figure due to being the most prominent liberal in Vynnychenko's cabinet, it is Margolin and his grip on the Foreign Ministry that has received much of the blame, and the radicals in the UPS-R and the R-RB that have done much of the finger pointing. Behind closed doors, the likes of Pisotskyi and Khrystiuk have called for Margolin's outright removal from the office, stating that his negligence in negotiating more "pro-Ukrainian" terms with Germany have shown him unfit for the office, as well as detrimental to the ruling bloc as a whole.\n\nYet Margolin did not become Foreign Minister to offer an olive branch to the defeated URDP, but to secure recognition of the most left leaning government in Mitteleuropa to date. So far, it seems Margolin has at least kept Germany at arms' length, assuring them that Vynnychenko and his cabinet do not seek any conflicts.\n\nStill, the calls to remove Margolin over this so-called \"negligence\" have only ramped up, after months of so far slow but steady social reforms. Though Vynnychenko has been silent over the matter so far, it is inevitable he must make a decision soon..."
 ukraine_republican.104.a: "Surely we can work things out, right?"

 ukraine_republican.105.t: "Dealing with Margolin"
 ukraine_republican.105.d: "Vynnychenko has already served as the middleman of plenty of inter-coalition negotiations, but the issue of the Foreign Ministry yet still promises to be a significant undertaking. As much as it is an unfortunate reality, for now a working relationship with Berlin is of utmost importance. Failure to salvage it could mean the end of everything the brave heroes of the Anti-Hetman Revolt fought for, extinguishing yet another Ukrainian revolution by the Prussian boot.\n\nAccording to Article 57 of the constitution, members of the Council of Ministers may be subject to removal by the National Assembly given a majority vote. Several candidates have been proposed as a potential replacement for Margolin, mostly from the USDRP. While no vote against Margolin has occurred yet, with all the talk of it lately it seems inevitable to happen in the next few days at most.\n\nLeader of Spilka and Minister of Agriculture Mykola Kovalevskyi has personally advised Vynnychenko on the rumours recently, advocating that he meet with Margolin and encourage him to shuffle positions in the Foreign Ministry more to the Bloc's liking - and in any case, stand by Margolin to avoid the ire of Berlin. It is unlikely that Margolin will be removed by the vote in any case, but it could be a show of unity from the radicals in the Assembly, as well as more directly pressure Margolin to reform his office more thoroughly."
 ukraine_republican.105.a: "Margolin can run the office how he likes. Stand by him."
 ukraine_republican.105.b: "What's wrong with encouraging debate on the matter? Let the vote occur."

 ukraine_republican.106.t: "An Unsustainable Compromise"
 ukraine_republican.106.d: "Out of the many appointed to Vynnychenko's Council of Ministers, a familiar face stuck out. That face is Arnold Margolin: a Jewish Ukrainian and URDP member who served in the judicial system as well as the foreign ministry of the Hetman's state.\n\nMargolin's record as a defence lawyer is truly noteworthy, as he became known nationwide for his involvement in the widely publicised "Beilis Trial" more than twenty years ago. At a time when antisemitism in the Russian Empire was rampant, Margolin skillfully defended the Jewish worker from the accusations of ritual sacrifice. Though Margolin was not the only one defending Menachem Beilis, he still gained a reputation as someone who would defend the rights of minorities in Ukraine, especially the large Jewish population.\n\nBut though that trial has earned him great fame, it is not why he was selected to be Vynnychenko's Foreign Minister. All are too aware of German distrust of the Workers' Democratic Union, and we cannot intend to erupt all of that prematurely. Margolin's experience in the foreign ministry previously, as well as his URDP membership, have shaped an important compromise between [202.GetName] and Berlin - one that, for now, must last if we are to survive.\n\nIt is not a compromise anyone is happy with. Margolin has extensive contacts among his fellow party members, as well as Chief of Staff Petliura, and there is little doubt that he will use the post to influence the revolutionary government in whatever way he can."

 ukraine_republican.107.d1: "Deciding to heed Kovalevskyi's advice, Vynnychenko arranged a private meeting with Margolin to discuss the ongoing issue. When Vynnychenko relayed to Margolin that many in the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly wanted to remove him from his post, the latter responded responded saying that such calls were not new.\n\nApparently, he was knowledgeable of the magnitude of situation, too. A suggestion to reshuffle positions in the Foreign Ministry was rejected by Margolin when brought up, as he believed that it would not only encourage Germany to openly make moves against Vynnychenko's government but also do little to please the radicals in the R-RB and the UPS-R. Several hours of discussion between the Chairman and the Foreign Minister went back and forth, but ultimately, they seemed to yield little results.\n\nOnly a day later, the outcome of the meeting became apparent. In a carefully delivered speech to a Workers' Democratic Union meeting, Vynnychenko warned against \"petty infighting and factionalism\", emphasising unity in the face of overwhelming reactionary forces. While he did not mention Margolin in particular, the statement was clearly intended to defend his post and discourage any attempt by the National Zbory to remove him. It is likely that, at least for now, Vynnychenko's words will salvage Margolin's grasp on the ministry - but the situation cannot be considered resolved, and both men have come out of it unfavourably."

When Vynnychenko made a suggestion to reshuffle positions in the Foreign Ministry, Margolin seemed to hesitate, but agreed that Vynnychenko's advice was sound. As Margolin's hold on the foreign ministry is all but a necessity for Berlin and Vienna's satisfaction, and his willingness to reform it will certainly court the radicals in the R-RB and the UPS-R. In the end, Margolin has made vague promises, but for now promises are good enough."

Endless debate aside, Margolin's dismissal from his post was ultimately put up to a vote in the National Zbory.\n\nAs the votes were counted, it quickly became clear that Margolin would keep his position. Moderates in the UPSR, as well as a unanimous vote from the URDP's deputies and the few right-wing deputies banded together to protect Margolin from these 'baseless' claims. But the fact that Margolin survived the vote was not particularly noteworthy. What was surprising was how easily it was defeated: many of the R-RB delegates aligned to Vynnychenko refused to approve Margolin's dismissal, and Pisotskyi's group was isolated. In a rather obvious quip against Pisotskyi, several deputies questioned why the vote was even necessary in the first place, given the near unamity of the Zbory's decision.\n\nThat criticism seems to have extended to Vynnychenko as well. After all, Vynnychenko encouraged the vote to be put up in the National Zbory. Despite his agreement with the moderates on this particular matter, his encouragement has now made it look like he empowered a loud minority over the silent majority, leading many to question where the Chairman's allegiances truly lie: to the revolutionary coalition and good of Ukraine, or solely his partners in the R-RB?"

Much of the R-RB, even those aligned with Vynnychenko, who has remained cautious over the issue, voted for Margolin's removal - and so did much of the UPS-R's radical faction.\n\nFor once, it seemed as though moderate forces in the National Zbory no longer had a clear edge over the hardline revolutionaries, and their lack of serious pushback against criticism of Margolin before the vote now casts doubt into their ability to contain the radicals in the future."

 ukraine_republican.109.d: "After nearly twenty years in exile, the socialists of the Workers' Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Workers' Party have truly turned the political tables. The fall of \"Hetmanist conservatism\" has been sudden and rapid, and the Ukrainian people, at least for the near future, have rejected it completely, as evidenced by the socialist electoral victory.\n\nThat is the version of events we would have liked to see, at least.\n\nOut of the many smaller parties who barely gained enough seats to remain in the National Zbory, one in particular stood out: the Ukrainian People's Party (UNP). Now the largest right wing party in the Assembly, the UNP was formed sometime during election season, where it seemingly gained little traction. But though their presence in the Assembly is small, they have made their mark on the streets by organising protests against the Workers' Democratic Union's "Bolshevik" policies.\n\nThe party is led by Mykola Mikhnovskyi, a former Hetmanist and previously a candidate for UDKhP leadership who ostensibly left the party to leave behind Hetmanist connections in a Republican age. Wherever these right-wing protests go, Mikhnovskyi has made impassionate speeches painting the RDS as a 'gathering of traditionally feeble intelligentsia, far removed from the struggles and needs of the Ukrainian nation'. His efforts may be few and far between for now, but in comparison to other disgraced Hetmanist figures, Mikhnovskyi's populist rhetoric and political expertise may prove a greater threat than we could have imagined."

 ukraine_republican.110.t: "New Year, New Plans"
 ukraine_republican.110.d: "As the new year dawns, Chairman Vynnychenko took the moment to convene the National Zbory. Reduction in poverty, land for all, and a new industrial base unthinkable in the Hetmanist era were all key themes in the beginning of Vynnychenko's opening statement - but though these were nice to hear, they were not the theme of Vynnychenko's speech.\n\nThe elephant of the room was the matter of national defence. Russia's belligerent actions on the world stage and their denial of Ukrainian statehood made it clear that if Ukraine were to survive, this matter would be of the utmost importance. For the first time since the Workers' Democratic Union's election, military spending was to be a priority above all else. Vynnychenko's words electrified the National Assembly with applause and cheers - after all, who would be against such a patriotic endeavour?\n\nBut after Vynnychenko had left the spotlight, a discussion began to take place, one which would likely have garnered significantly less applause in the Zbory. Gathering a number of R-RB and UPS-R ministers, as well as Generals Tiutiunnyk and Volokh, Vynnychenko petitioned Tiutiunnyk to draw up plans for a defence of Ukraine from the Russians, but from the Germans to the west.\n\nWith a new Great War to potentially come to Europe soon, fears that Germany may take action against the Ukrainian government are no longer just talk. The question is of the nature of these plans: should they only be of a defensive manner, or should they account for the possibility of decisive Third Internationale success and potential offensive manuevers into the western Reichspakt?"

It is true that, in comparison to the Hetman's government, the lack of a powerful landowner lobby like the VSZV will make things easier - but it will not make it easy, and the National Zbory, with its vast range of parties, interest groups and factions, may make the process far more difficult than imagined. It is clear that some degree of centralisation on these matters - which are set to be the most grand projects that the Ukrainian republic shall embark on - is needed.\n\nTo achieve these aims and coordinate planning more thoroughly, a special section named the Central Committee of Economic Development has been proposed. The idea has been welcomed by political forces across the board, even some of the more right wing deputies in the National Zbory, but a question at large remains: what should the Committee be accountable to?\n\nMuch of the UPS-R and USDRP have expressed their desires for it to be accountable to the National Zbory, keeping in line with Republican ideas of parliamentarian supremacy and allowing a wider range of ideas to be proposed. On the other hand, the R-RB has mostly been clamouring for the committee to be accountable to the Ministry of Economy. It is not hard to see why - proportionally, the Council of Ministers carries a greater number of R-RB figures than it does in the National Zbory. Additionally, such a measure would bypass the 'bureaucratic bloat' of the former option, and avoid squabbling with the non-revolutionary forces in the National Zbory."

 ukraine_republican.112.t: "Selection of the Chairman of the Committee" #WIP
 ukraine_republican.112.d: "The next issue is of who the Chairman of the Economic Development Committee will be. The two most promising candidates are divided among partisan lines, so this may end up being a more contentious issue than imagined.\n\nPavlo Popov is one of Vynnychenko's right hand men and has been part of the R-RB for quite some time now. Like Vynnychenko, early on he was a member of the USDRP before the party split into social democratic and fully socialist tendencies. He has recently been appointed as the head of Land Management in Yuzivka, and he has great prominence as an agricultural scientist. Despite that, Popov sees the ongoing industrialisation process as critical, and it seems that under his Chairmanship the Economic Development Committee will shift its focus to creating a powerful industrial base.\n\nMykola Shrah is the second candidate. He was an early member of the UPS-R's Central Committee in 1917, and is respected for his knowledge in the water planning sector as well as his service as a teacher in [221.GetName]."

 ukraine_republican.113.d1: "It is a frequent tale that when socialists are not faced with overwhelming odds against reactionary forces, they quickly turn on each other. Historically, this has been the case in Ukraine as well, evidenced by the splits in the UPS-R and the USDRP during the Ukrainian Revolution.\n\nDespite the rather pluralistic nature of the new government, it was promised that the splintering and squabbling of the past would be put aside. The legacy of the disastrous Hetmanist administration would be swept aside in favour of a revolutionary socialist one, and the good of any party or faction would be put aside for the ultimate good: the good of the Ukrainian nation.\n\nBut it has been only a month since the revolutionary cabinet was assembled, and cracks have begun to show. The appointment of a R-RB Chairman of the Central Committee has shown many aspirations of \"leftist unity\" to be little more than a farce - several UPS-R and USDRP delegates protested the appointment, with some even claiming that the R-RB is planning an eventual takeover of the National Zbory as a whole. Regardless of the validity of such statements, it does not help the already divisive mood in the National Zbory. It is clear that the Workers' Democratic Union, noble as its goals may be, will have a difficult time actually succeeding when there are necessary compromises with liberals, an unenviable geopolitical situation, a powerful right-wing opposition, and clear party differences.\n\nWhatever the case may be, it is clear from these events that the Ukrainian socialist experiment will face many challenges, both internal and external. But perhaps we should remain hopeful. After all, we have fought hard for this electoral victory - naturally, we will fight even harder to fulfil the promises we made."

 ukraine_republican.114.t: "Prosecuting the Past"
 ukraine_republican.114.d: "It is certainly a tall task to undo the two decades of damage the Hetman and his government inflicted on society. As Udovychenko's forces closed in on [202.GetName] and began the final assault, a special committee was created so that the perpetrators of said damage would be prosecuted for their crimes against the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe Special Committee to Investigate the Crimes of the Ukrainian State, as it is formally known, consisted of deputies from the National Zbory from across the political aisle early on, and continues to do so to this day. In theory, the Committee is to be impartial, but some of its membership has come under harsh criticism lately by some in the recently inaugurated National Zbory — specifically, the URDP members serving in the Committee.\n\nWith the URDP a minority in the National Zbory, and the Committee responsible to the latter, a proposal has been put forth: one who serves on the Committee must not have served in the Hetmanist "State Soim" due to potentially conflicting interests, nor been part of a political party that participated in it. In practice, this would bar any member of the URDP from serving in the committee, and their positions would be left to either USDRP, R-RB or UPS-R delegates.\n\nNaturally, the proposal has far reaching consequences and is extremely controversial. During the election, the left-leaning parties painted the URDP as a gang of secret Hetmanist sympathisers who were uncommitted to the revolution, only joining the Anti-Hetman Revolt on the Republican side when it became convenient to do so. Rhetoric is one thing, however - restricting the abilities of a political party simply through association is another."

 ukraine_republican.115.t: "Trial of Prisovskyi"
 ukraine_republican.115.d1: "For a provisional government like that of the Ukrainian People's Republic during the revolt, mistakes were expected to happen — rebuilding the bureaucracy and reorganising the army is no small feat, after all. But it was shortly after the revolt that the provisional government made its greatest mistake yet, a mistake the Workers' Democratic Union has come to greatly abhor: the pardoning of Prisovskyi.\n\nIt is an even greater crime from the borderline bonapartist Petliura administration to not only pardon Prisovskyi, but reintegrate him back into the People's Army. Attempts to conceal Prisovskyi's actions during the revolt have fallen short: there is clear as day evidence that Prisovskyi ordered a bombing raid on the republican regional headquarters in Sarny, which led to the deaths of more than a hundred people. Yet, despite his crimes, today he is a free man. Many have correctly pointed out this unreasonable hypocrisy — after all, we convicted the Hetman, did we not?\n\nIt fell to Vynnychenko's government to deliver justice to those murdered by Prisovskyi's immoral acts. In a highly politicised trial, Prisovskyi argued that it was necessary to do everything in his power to prevent a "Bolshevik takeover", and that none of his political associations then were declared illegal until after the Hetman's defeat.\n\nFor the most part, however, his arguments fell on deaf ears. Prisovskyi was found guilty of organising state violence against the Ukrainian people, ordering executions, and more - but the question remains of how harsh the sentence should be."

 ukraine_republican.116.t: "Funding the Polish Socialists"
 ukraine_republican.116.t2: "Stakes in Warsaw"
 ukraine_republican.116.d: "Eastern European politics are changing. What was once a hotbed of mostly reactionary regimes now contains a shining socialist example in Ukraine, an example that many are sure to follow. For this year, several predict another blow for total German domination over its Eastern client states in the form of the upcoming Polish elections.\n\nRuled by the pro-German Interpartisan Circle, King August IV's bootlicker coalition will certainly face a challenge in halting the momentum of the liberal and social democratic Centrolew alliance. For years, these left-wing activists have criticised the monarchy and its authoritarian Prussian-inspired foundations, as well as promising to restore the economic order after the 'mishandling' of the Black Monday crisis.\n\nBut their fight is not ours. Despite some of their nobler goals, the Centrolew has operated as a parliamentary opposition to the King, much like the bourgeois URDP (rather dubiously) sought to dethrone the Hetman's Coalition years earlier through the elections to the Soim. While we, for now, have attempted to wage war against capitalist institutions through parliamentarian institutions, it is unlikely that the victory of the Centrolew will be any benefit of ours or the Poles - they simply do not have the revolutionary zeal of the Workers' Democratic Union.\n\nMuch like the USDRP in its heyday, however, the Polish Socialist Party contains a sizeable number of true revolutionaries. Funding these activists will certainly be of a great boon to the world revolution as well as ourselves, and perhaps it could spark a revolt that stretches wide across the east, from the Black Sea to the Baltics. Socialist solidarity and principles aside, the only dissenting opinion is that we cannot rely on the Polish socialists who find themselves in far different conditions than we did. Plus, don't we have enough problems at home?"
 ukraine_republican.116.d2: "Elections in the Kingdom of Poland are to be held this year, and there is talk of the entrenched, pro-German Interpartisan Circle losing power. The opposition parties, concentrated around the republican Centrolew movement, have been steadily gaining traction.\n\nOur relationship with the King of Poland, August IV, is rocky to say the least, in large part due to the clashes between the VDR and the Polish garrison stationed near [93.GetName] during the Anti-Hetman Revolt. The regime he reins over is in almost every way opposite to the republican ideal - he is the very symbol of German economic and political influence over Poland, much like the Hetman was for Ukraine.\n\nNaturally, the Centrolew are being eyed in [202.GetName] as a much more attractive partner to work with than the King. Plans for further cooperation between the two democratic peasant republics of Ukraine and Belarus have already been drawn up, and if the Centrolew takes power, those plans could include Poland as well.\n\nSome issues between our two states may remain even with the Centrolew in power, in particular the potential division of Galicia. Otherwise, however, there is little reason not to support their campaign - and our coalition partners have pressured us to do so, given the chances of a new ideological ally and neighbour."

 ukraine_republican.117.d: "In recent days, activists of the left wing of the PPS have been making a steadfast call for the Polish people to overthrow their 'bourgeois institutions' and the pro-German order that continues to oppress the country. After some investigations from the authorities, it seems this support has been smuggled over the border through Ukraine. Their radically socialist government - surprisingly staying afloat in Mitteleuropa - has likely either encouraged such actions or allowed them to happen through undedicated border guards. We can only hope this kind of activity does not continue."
 ukraine_republican.117.d2: "The Chairman of the Ukrainian People's Republic, [UKR.GetLeader], has recently made statements supporting the Centrolew's campaign. Likely due to the poor relationship that has developed between the August IV's Poland and the new government in [202.GetName], they are now actively supporting the opposition and have motioned that they would be willing to cooperate with a similarly-minded republican Poland in the future if it is brought about."

 ukraine_republican.118.t: "A Critique from the Left"
 ukraine_republican.118.d: "Today's talk of left-wing literature is of a new article published by Borotbyst leader Oleksandr Shumskyi. While some had initially believed that the Borotbysts would embrace the new socialist government, Shumskyi's article has shown otherwise. Two sections of it have stuck out in particular, which state the following:\n\n\"I would congratulate comrade Vynnychenko on a 'victory' in recent elections, if there was anything worthy of celebrations, but, alas, the only thing achieved by this 'spectacular' performance is the strengthening of the flawed foundations of this bourgeois republic. Apparently, past experiences didn't teach comrade Vynnychenko anything. This inability to learn from his own mistakes should show everyone what kind of a revolutionary esteemed Volodymyr Kyrylovych is and what prospects await the Ukrainian revolutionary movement under his guidance.\n\nIn 1925 and 1936, we communists fought against the Hetman without regard for the vile slander we received from everyone... we were truly dedicated to the struggle of a free Ukraine. We cannot offer a Tolstoian non-resistance to evil - only to continue onward in relentless support of the socialist cause.\"\n\nSo far, the Borotbysts have not actively attempted to stifle the new government, but Shumskyi's distaste of it is now known and being widely circulated as one of the most well-articulated criticisms of it from the left."

 ukraine_republican.119.t1: "The Deeds We Owe"
 ukraine_republican.119.t2: "The Belarusian Question"
 ukraine_republican.119.d1: "Since early 1936, Belarus has been ruled by a despotic reactionary government, led by [BLR.GetLeader] and his [BLR.GetRulingParty]. A pro-German coup had dislodged the legitimate BSDP government and overturned many of the freedoms and democratic institutions that the latter carefully implemented over the course of two decades.\n\nThus, few were surprised when many prominent BSDP members and soldiers aligned with the party wounded up in western Ukraine right as the Anti-Hetman Revolt began. Naturally, as their cause - the cause of a free, democratic, socialist Eastern Europe - is our cause as well, these Belarusian exiles have found themselves a new home in Ukraine. Since the end of the revolt, they have organised themselves to advocate for Belarusian interests in Ukraine - as well as against their nation's tyrannical regime, publishing articles denouncing [BLR.GetLeader]'s cronies and hoping that one they may be able to return to their true home in safety.\n\nIt is precisely these actions that have angered Minsk. According to the Belarusian Foreign Minister, the Ukrainian government has been sheltering 'convicted criminals' involved in 'sabotage and terrorism', and have demanded us to extradite them.\n\nThis is a clearly unacceptable and outrageous demand. Selling out our fellow comrades to the reactionary authorities across the border would be a betrayal of our principles and our people, but despite that, some have advocated to accept the request anyway. In their opinion, it is not a matter of principle - it is simply reality that should their government not get what they want, they will turn to Germany to force our hand."
 ukraine_republican.119.d2: "Not too long ago, in the midst of the Anti-Hetman Revolt, it was the Belarusians who stood up in solidarity with the Ukrainian people against the Hetman when nobody else would. The Belarusian People's Republic has served as a bastion of social democracy in a region of Europe mostly dominated by German business interests and reactionary autocrats, and ever since the success of our revolution the ties between the two have only strengthened.\n\nThat is why Chairman Vynnychenko organised a visit to Minsk to repay the Belarusians for their help and further the bond between our two democracies. There, Vynnychenko took a stand at the State Sojm to applaud the ruling BSDP government of their accomplishments — and save for some rather specific circumstances, there would have been nothing notable about the tour.\n\nThose specific circumstances are of the BSDP itself. While the party champions itself as the torch of progress for the young Belarusian state, it is dominated by rightist tendencies who do not truly seek socialism, and their land reform agenda, the "Plan Sierada", has been considerably frustrated by increasing compensation to landowners. In some ways, these are understandable - Germany would not hesitate to send in the troops if the party did not make considerable concessions.\n\nThese unfortunate realities do not at all serve our interests, but the BSDP still contains a sizeable and influential left wing that has consistently been sidelined in policymaking matters. With rumoured sympathisers as high up as Chairman Taraškievič himself, there is potential to make them pliable for real socialism. Should we prepare the necessary means and fund the left wing enough using whatever means we can - financial or otherwise - taking control of Belarus as we kickstart our revolution will be a very costly endeavour, but a greatly beneficial one if it succeeds."

By sabotaging our governance and internal order with socialist revolutionary nonsense they render us powerless in the face of the Russian threat'.\n\nThese kinds of fiery oratories were spoken by none other than Mikhnovskyi himself at the latest UNP rally in Kharkiv. Mikhnovskyi's UNP has found itself making significant gains in the city's population who are deeply concerned of a Russian invasion, knowing that if war were to come they would be one of the first targets.\n\nUnfortunately, Mikhnovskyi's party has not fizzled out immediately as we had hoped. A promise of a new Ukrainian future — not Hetmanist nor socialist — has become quite the successful message, and Mikhnovskyi has been touring the countryside and urban areas to shore up support for a conservative voter base that will challenge the left.\n\nEven more worrying is Mikhnovskyi's connections to other prominent conservatives, who have increasingly left behind Hetmanist politics to rally behind the UNP. Chief among them are the likes of Yurii Kollard, Ivan Lutsenko, and Opanas Andriievskyi — including Mikhnovskyi, all have acted as Ukrainian independence advocates early on, openly challenging the Workers' Democratic Union's grip on the national narrative.\n\nThe initial 'lineup' was later joined by a cast of younger generation of rightist thinkers and culturalists such as Yevhen Malaniuk, Leonid Mosendz and most notably, Makar Kushnir. The notoriety of Kushnir's ideological and publicistic work and overall ability of the UNP to expand its base of support beyond the long-time "veterans" of the national struggle has drawn notable concern in our government circles."

 ukraine_republican.121.d: "Beyond the UNP's increasing connections to the peasant and urban base, it seems that Mikhnovskyite propaganda is infiltrating the military as well.\n\nEven since the Hetmanist days, contacts between right-wing nationalist groups and prominent military men - especially involving the LUN - were commonplace, even if they were isolated incidents or simply coincidences. In some ways, this is unsurprising. While most of the army has remained ostensibly apolitical, some military circles see their role in the Ukrainian state as more than just the state security apparatus but the defender of the common man, a defender of greater importance than any Zbory or Chairman.\n\nWhile the LUN has been kept distant from most of the higher-ups in the army, likely due to their esoteric and totalitarian beliefs, these military circles have found a new place among the UNP, where Mikhnovskyi's populist rhetoric and commitment to the army as the saviour of Ukraine has resonated with many.\n\nIn particular, generals Petro Bolbochan and Volodymyr Oskilko, who have garnered a reputation for being rather independently-minded and bold, have echoed some of the same rhetoric as the UNP and emphasised increased military spending to ward off foreign threats. A serious debate is now occurring among Vynnychenko's close circle who are trying to make sense of these schemes: are they simply meaningless talk or part of a broader conspiracy against the Workers' Democratic Union and the People's Republic as a whole?"

Best known as a Marxist doctrinaire and uncompromising individual, Pisotskyi now wields one of the most powerful positions in the government.\n\nImmediately, he embarked on a radical reorganisation of the Interior Ministry - those with ties to the Hetmanist government and plenty in Petliura's provisional administration were dismissed, and those with close ties to Pisotskyi have reached high-ranking posts, mostly hardliner veterans from the Anti-Hetman Revolt and fellow party members.\n\nAdditionally, citing the possibility of 'anti-republican activity' after the election, Pisotskyi has also issued an expansion of the People's Militia. Generally, the People's Militia has far more socialist leanings than the army, and many of their best fighters experienced the worst of the Hetman's regime, which has been a key factor in their ideological development as a force strongly associated with the Workers' Democratic Union.\n\nWhile those truly dedicated to the revolution recognise many of his acts as necessary, it hasn't been long since the inauguration of the people's rule. Too radical action too quickly may convince Germany to get second thoughts - or emphasise the disunity between our coalition as a whole."

Citing the threat of an immediate revolution in the country, the document states that the operation must be carried out as 'swiftly and smoothly as possible' so that any potential consequences will not greatly affect the German war effort in the east.\n\nThe document goes into further detail about how this task may be carried out:\n-German army units in Ukrainian territory will encircle Kyiv and the National Zbory.\n-Force the Vynnychenko cabinet to resign.\n-Appoint an interim government favourable to Berlin. Exact details will be considered once the operation is secure, but potential allies in the UNP or restoration of the Hetman are heavily considered.\n-If deemed absolutely necessary to ensure military cooperation and grain exports to Berlin, a German commissar will take temporary control.\n\nThere was no time to decide whether the document was a forgery or not.

Since then, much has been accomplished - the land reform and industrialisation has progressed smoothly, legislation protecting the workers has been enacted, a social safety net was created, and more.\n\nPutting all of these policies into action was not simply a matter of taking action, though. From the start we were divided, and had to coalesce with an even less radical partner in the USDRP. In the face of great right-wing resistance, complaints from our coalition partners and foreign threats, we surprisingly have prevailed.\n\nNow that it seems that many of the more serious issues of governance have been taken care of, we can only look outwards. Russian aggression cannot and will not be tolerated, but eventually, the same will have to be for German domination. The true freedom of Ukraine is inevitable - and now, we must tirelessly work towards that great dream."

 ukraine_republican.127.t: "The Beginning of the End"
 ukraine_republican.127.d: "A serious complication has been noted coming from the Ministry of the Interior: the leadership of the UNP is coming under investigation. While there has been no official statement by Pisotskyi just yet, one can only guess the reason for the investigation. The UNP has thus far acted as one of the strongest right wing opposition parties to the Workers' Democratic Union, and, seemingly in an effort to decapitate their irksome influence, are being painted as foreign implants, receiving money from opposing countries' intelligence services to destabilise the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe timing of the investigations are not coincidental. Under Pisotskyi's pen name "Andrii Richytsky", a new article has been published in the R-RB newspaper, Nova Doba (New Life). The article, titled "On the Matter of Public Vigilance in the Age of Advancing Socialism", calls for 'rigorous measures against counterrevolutionary forces". While Pisotskyi has always acted as a hardliner force in the R-RB and the Workers' Democratic Union in general, his language in this particular piece has rightfully been seen as unusually bellicose, even towards other members of the Union."

 ukraine_republican.128.d: "Word reached the National Zbory of yet another initiative of the Ministry of the Interior. In order to protect against 'anti-republican measures', the Ministry has been preparing a legislative package to, in practice, bar any individual who served in the Hetmanist regime to serve not just in the National Zbory - but the civil service as a whole.\n\nIt did not end there. The Ministry of Interior also requested an investigation into Foreign Minister Margolin on charges of 'illegally receiving donations from foreign intelligence services' and corruption. Unfortunately for Pisotskyi's initiatives, such a proposal was shot down quickly by the National Zbory, with much of the UPS-R and USDRP voting against and thus the proposal failing to achieve the two-thirds majority necessary.\n\nA wash of anger fell upon much of the hardline revolutionaries in the R-RB and the UPS-R. Subsequently, in the next legislative session where a reform proposal based around land nationalisation was put forth, they sought their revenge and voted out the proposal as well.\n\nAt this point, legislative deadlocks have become nothing new. But they are becoming increasingly personal - lines are being drawn not out of serious consideration for decent policymaking, but to toe the party line.\n\nFor a man supposedly representing the centre of revolutionary politics, Vynnychenko has expressed great dismay at this fracturing of the coalition. His status and reputation as a middleman and negotiator is quickly falling apart - and so, in an effort to mend the party rift, an extraordinary session of the R-RB has been called by the Chairman."

 ukraine_republican.129.d: "As many of the most important R-RB delegates and ministers were called into the meeting, all eyes were on Pisotskyi. Immediately, Vynnychenko asked for an explanation of these heavy measures, which were quickly destroying any hope of unity in the Workers' Democratic Union and creating a lasting deadlock in the National Zbory.\n\nPisotskyi defended himself fiercely. As he had explained in his recent article, revolutionary momentum was being lost, and it needed to be regained in some way. The spirit of the Anti-Hetman Revolt must be channeled in the people once again - if it is not, then the R-RB will be destroyed, attacked simultaneously by other socialists on the left, like the Borotbysts and the UKP, and the reformists to the right. In harsh times such as these, where Berlin is watching Ukraine's every move and secretly plotting against its Republican institutions, such vigilance is necessary to save the revolution.\n\nVynnychenko responded by repeating his previous statement, openly criticising Pisotskyi for not discussing these motions with the rest of the party and acting too independently when in reality the situation demands compromise.\n\nUnfortunately for the R-RB, it was a response too forgiving.\n\nAt a counterpart meeting of the UPS-R, the content of the R-RB's meeting was decided to be leaked to the public, as a fellow party member had reported on the events. Though the leak was presented in a rather biased manner, it now threatened the existence of the R-RB itself: to everyone in the know, Vynnychenko's lack of critique of Pisotskyi's actual arguments was proof that the R-RB was out to destroy the coalition and take full control."

 ukraine_republican.130.t: "The End of the Union"
 ukraine_republican.130.d: "The R-RB took another hit when an enormous rally in [221.GetName] was organised by the USDRP party leader, Isaak Mazepa. Attended heavily by USDRP and UPS-R aspirants, like Petliura and Kovalevskyi, Mazepa took to the podium to capitalise on the news of the leak.\n\n'The aspirations for freedom and democracy lie in the very foundation of our people's republic. It is the very reason that we took up arms against the Hetman when nobody supported us: because these beliefs are inherent to the Ukrainian people. Against every odd, we carried out our revolution knowing we would have to brave the enemy's fire. The Hetman's fate should serve as a reminder to all who seek to subvert our democratic process, for if we have to die to save it again, we will not hesitate to do so.'\n\nWhile Vynnychenko has been scrambling to defend himself and deny the contents of the leak, behind closed doors the situation in the R-RB is extremely serious. In a last ditch effort to save face, Vynnychenko asked for Pisotskyi to resign, arguing that the Workers' Democratic Union could be saved if a thorough compromise with the USDRP was made.\n\nBut his efforts were in vain. In a thorough rebuttal, Pisotskyi dismissed Vynnychenko's demand immediately: the time for compromise was over. Only decisive action could save the party and the future of the country. If that meant war with Germany, so be it - the decades long struggle must be concluded, even if it takes a million souls."

 ukraine_republican.131.d: "Organising the People's Militia was not going to be easy, and time was running out. In the first few hours of the so-called 'Second Revolt', under the orders of Pisotskyi the People's Militia gathered arms and prepared for a decisive battle against the [202.GetName] Garrison. Few truly understood what they were fighting for, and abandoned their attempt to dislodge the Army almost as soon as the order was given.\n\nAs the People's Militia approached the garrison and the order was given to fire, shots were exchanged, but the affair did not last long. Unable to shoot their countrymen, many of them who also fought in the Anti-Hetman Revolt and were comrades then, the great 'March on [202.GetName]' lasted no longer than twelve hours at most.\n\nAs the Army began the disarmament of the People's Militia, an arrest warrant was made for Pisotskyi and his allies in the Ministry of the Interior. Meanwhile, Vynnychenko was in tense negotiations with the USDRP. He sincerely argued that he had done everything in his power to save the frailing coalition, but continued to be criticised for his lack of rebuttal to Pisotskyi earlier, which only gave him another reason to execute this lawless coup. Still, they came to a deal: in exchange for Vynnychenko's resignation as Chairman, he would be able to avoid any investigations into the affair.\n\nInterim Chairman Khrystiuk's tenure lasted only a day. In a vote of no confidence, with the UPS-R's moderate faction and the USDRP voting almost unanimously, Isaak Mazepa was inaugurated as the country's new Chairman.\n\nMazepa's promises to heal recently opened wounds in the National Zbory received some fanfare, but ultimately, it could be best said that the whole messy affair has sown great seeds of doubt in the legitimacy of the People's Republic. What may exist now may be more sustainable than the Hetman's government, but will faith in democracy be restored after such an incident?"

 ukraine_republican.132.t: "Factions of the Workers' Democratic Union"
 ukraine_republican.132.d: "The Workers' Democratic Union consists of two major parties: the UPS-R (Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries), led chiefly by Nykyfir Hryhoriiv, Pavlo Khrystiuk, and Mykola Kovalevskyi, and the R-RB (Council-Revolutionary Bloc), led chiefly by Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Volodymyr Chekhivskyi and Anatolii Pisotskyi.\n\nThe UPS-R stresses the Ukrainian village community as a natural form of people's organisation. In 1917, the party suffered multiple splits - one of the splinter factions became the Borotbysts, which remain separate from the main UPS-R party today. The former remains a populist and peasantry-based socialist party, whereas the Borotbysts adopted a more Marxist outlook, considerably shifting their focus to industrial proletariat.\n\nToday, the UPS-R can be roughly split into two factions, a moderate and radical faction, which are led by Kovalevskyi and Hryhoriiv, respectively. The ideological differences are not particularly great between the two, but in comparison to the radicals, the UPS-R moderates generally view a potential revolt against Germany as premature and prefer to work towards socialism pragmatically within the German sphere. They also view the coalition with the USDRP as more or less desirable, especially in comparison to their more radical counterparts.\n\nThe R-RB has its roots in the far left wing of the USDRP, bearing a council-communist programme and collective ownership of the means of production. Opinions in the party on private property are mixed: the moderates, led by Vynnychenko himself, have signalled their support for limited private property, while the radicals, led by Pisotskyi, are completely against it, and maintain a closer focus on party governance. Besides these ideological tenets, the moderates and radicals in the party differ on the direction the Union as a whole should take, with the latter preferring more hardline measures to maintain the RDS against foreign subversion and internal dissent, and viewing the coalition with the USDRP with great suspicion."

 ukraine_republican.133.t: "A Promise Never Received"
 ukraine_republican.133.d: "With the horrors of war receding into the past, a question of postponed elections becomes more pressing day by day. The electoral prospects don't look particularly bright for the governing coalition — despite its numerous successes, the opposition was able to rebound from the defeat of 1937, exploiting various shortcomings of the government reform projects of the late 30s and inevitable mistakes of wartime governance to their utmost. Internal disagreements in the socialist alliance, which have been reaping apart its coherence for some time now, don't help either.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Borotbyst leader Oleksandr Shumskyi published yet another article directed against the Workers' Democratic Union. Its conclusion was rather blunt.\n\n“The deeply reactionary nature of the so-called ‘Workers' Democratic Union' was apparent to anyone with at least a modicum of common sense from the very beginning. Despite the incessant repetition of the hollow slogans of revolution and liberation, in practice, the RDS immediately aligned itself with the bourgeois state which had arisen from the ashes of revolt, becoming its enabler and defender.\n\nSome have pointed out the Union's role in the Anti-Hetman Revolt, describing it as revolutionary and progressive. It pains me to explain the obvious, but the only revolutionary part they played was part in the bourgeois national revolution, started in faraway 1917, of which the anti-Hetman revolt was merely a final act. After the settlement of the national question any proper socialist force would immediately engage in the constructive task of building communism, directing its efforts towards the development of proletarian consciousness and dismantling of capitalist institutions. No surprises, then, that an alliance of two petit-bourgeois parties instead turned to petty politicking, becoming eager servants of reaction. Seeing how factionalism and the burden of past choices slowly crushes them I can say only this: it serves them right.”"

 ukraine_republican.134.d: "In a new episode of German imperialistic meddling in our affairs, the German ambassador to Ukraine Johannes von Welczeck has called for a direct meeting with Chairman Vynnychenko. Normally, diplomatic messages between Germany and Ukraine would be handled by Foreign Minister Margolin, so this instance seems particularly worrisome.\n\nWelczeck and Vynnychenko thus far have had somewhat cordial relations despite their ideological difference, as Welczeck is a noted anti-communist. These contrasting visions aside, Welczeck communicated that Berlin was deeply concerned at the new labour policies passed by the new government. These new laws, Welczeck added, were making it difficult for German companies to operate in Ukraine freely. He even called the legality of such policies into question: Mitteleuropean law dictates that one should be able to freely conduct business in any member state.\n\nVynnychenko is not negotiating on equal grounds. That being said, any sensible socialist knows that our legislation to protect the Ukrainian worker is of utmost importance, especially after so many years of the Hetman who consistently sold out the proletariat to industrialists in Protofis. Perhaps offering them concessions in other areas will make them drop this outrageous demand - or we could simply accept that we have little way of getting out of this one."

 ukraine_republican.135.d: "Von Welczeck's demands did not stop when the issues concerning Mitteleuropa were dealt with. The next matter was of security. According to von Welczeck, the German security service Abteilung III has uncovered 'questionable sympathies' from some in the Ukrainian government, many of whom belong to Vynnychenko's own party.\n\nThough stopping short of accusing Vynnychenko directly, von Welczeck implied that such individuals presented a grand security risk to both Germany and Ukraine. If they, as suspected, have ties to Paris, then the possibility of Reichspakt military documents being leaked to the Third Internationale is not only possible, but probable.\n\nThese statements have come with a demand from von Welczeck: Ukraine must release a statement formally denouncing the Third Internationale and their sycophants, as well as ensure that these radical politicians either are marginalised as much as possible - or taken out of the party altogether.\n\nOnce again, Vynnychenko has been put in a difficult spot, as a total reorganisation of the Union in general would not only be disastrous but rather difficult, as it's likely only the R-RB would be susceptible to such acts, given Vynnychenko's leadership of the party. But perhaps there's still a way to worm out of Germany's unreasonable demands?"

 ukraine_republican.136.d: "Investigations into Hetmanist officials have been ongoing for some time now. High-ranking ones in particular, like Skoropadskyi himself as well as Prisovskyi, have been convicted of their crimes, and most of what is left seems to be mostly on the local level. As of late, it is not just those in the UDKhP or former USKhD and SHD that are being investigated, but some in the UNP as well. After all, its leader Mikhnovskyi worked in the Hetmanist system and was previously a candidate for party leadership in the UDKhP.\n\nThough investigations into the UNP have sparked local protests from the party, who claim they are being persecuted by the Committee, but so far they have gained little sympathy or attention. That was until a particular figure in the UNP had an investigation opened against him.\n\nIn the Hetmanist government, Makar Kushnir was a independent delegate in the Soim who had ties to both the right wing of the URDP and the populists (those generally aligned with Mikhnovskyi) in the UDKhP. Today, in the republican era, he is a rising star in the UNP. His decision to defect to the republican side at the onset of the Anti-Hetman Revolt led him to be part of Shulhyn's delegation to Berlin, where Shulhyn and a number of other liberal politicians negotiated with Germany on behalf of the VDR as the revolt was ongoing. After the revolt had succeeded, Kushnir did not run for the 1937 Zbory elections, instead gaining prominence through the local legislature of his homeland in Ukraine, Cherkasy.\n\nIn addition to these feats, he represents the UNP in Cherkasy's local land council, and serves in the UNP's Foreign Relations Committee. All of these factors have made him a rising star in the UNP, perhaps a representative of the new generation of Ukrainian conservatives unaffiliated with the Hetmanists.\n\nProtests against the investigation have been calm thus far, and it is likely that Kushnir will be acquitted as there is little evidence against him."

 ukraine_republican.137.t: "UNP Member Arrested on Accusations of Treason!"
 ukraine_republican.137.d: "A sudden escalation of the situation in Cherkasy is now underway, as just yesterday, Makar Kushnir was arrested by the police and accused of treason.\n\nThese accusations come from Kushnir's previous work as a Hetmanist intelligence officer, as he was ostensibly recruited due to his ties to some in the Republican movement. Those ties, according to the accusations, allowed him to infiltrate Shulhyn's delegation to Berlin as a Hetmanist spy and convey information back to [202.GetName] so that the delegation could be sabotaged. Even now, the accusation states, Kushnir may be involved with criminal Hetmanist exiles who escaped Ukraine after the revolt succeeded.\n\nThe UNP's claim is that the situation is quite the opposite. According to them, Kushnir was working as a double agent of the Republicans, being recruited as a spy for the Hetmanists but in reality worked for the Republicans.\n\nNonetheless, Kushnir's arrest has greatly inflamed tensions not only in Cherkasy, but across the country in general. Though usually the UNP would be alone in marching against this 'tyranny', much of the URDP has issued a statement of support for Kushnir, including Shulhyn himself, who has now vigorously defended Kushnir's role at his delegation.\n\nIt is not as though Shulhyn's delegation is defended by all Republicans. To the Workers' Democratic Union, Shulhyn's delegation had no right to negotiate on behalf of the entire VDR, especially considering their now-minority status in the National Zbory - and besides, who knows what kind of crazy concessions the URDP may have made to the Germans early on? But it is exactly this distrust that has led to the URDP defending Kushnir as much as they have, as there are worries that the entire delegation will be accused of treason too."

 ukraine_republican.138.t: "A Way Out of the Mess"
 ukraine_republican.138.d: "Word has reached the governing coalition that, due to a lack of evidence, it is most likely that Kushnir will be acquitted. In of itself this is not a defeat for the Workers' Democratic Union, but there are worries that the ongoing protests may lead to one. The URDP and UNP have shown an unprecedented level of solidarity with each other, cooperation once thought unlikely despite socialist dominance in the National Zbory. Disunited, neither of them are a threat to the RDS, but they could be a serious threat should they overcome their differences.\n\nPisotskyi, along with his allies, have cautioned against handing a 'victory' to the UNP now when they are the height of their publicity, as it could be disastrous for the ruling coalition. Instead, they have advocated to inform the URDP in general that they are not, nor will they be, targeted in any investigations from the Special Committee — and to shift the focus from Shulhyn's delegations to the UNP's "foreign contacts". According to Pisotskyi, there is scattered evidence that the UNP have received large donations from foreign, reactionary powers. As a member of the UNP's Foreign Affairs Committee, it is not only possible, but probable that if this evidence holds water, then Kushnir is involved.\n\nOn the other hand, some see this prolonging of the investigations as unnecessary and would only be seen as further persecution from the rightists. It may not be a good look for the RDS to simply let the issue go, but perhaps it's the best and most reasonable option. After all, the UNP is probably not as strong as some in the coalition have made them out, and the protests will fade once Kushnir is acquitted."

In particular, for the past few years, the UNP has been rather troublesome. Parliamentary bickering and anti-revolutionary activity cannot continue as it is now.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Union's membership, ranging from the radicals in Pisotskyi's camp to moderates in Kovalevskyi's, have banded together to vote on the last act of the National Zbory, which passed easily. To ensure that treasonous actors do not betray the revolution and that all factionalism is put aside for the war effort, as well as to further the interests of the revolution in general, the National Zbory is to be disbanded.\n\nThe act stated that the Zbory is to be replaced or altered in the near future, as soon as the situation is stabilised. Despite right-wing and liberal protests, they are powerless to oppose the act. Still, the question of what the National Zbory will be replaced with remains to be seen.

 ukraine_republican.142.d: "Mykhailo Hrushevskyi's role in the history of modern Ukraine can hardly be overestimated. A historian by trade, he was among those who significantly developed the intellectual framework of the Ukrainian national cause. His contributions were not purely scholarly, however. In 1917 Hrushevskyi was elected as head of Central Rada — a parliamentary institution of a new Ukrainian republic. During this period he developed strong ties with the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. He took an active role in the development of the Ukrainian constitution and even the modern administrative divisions of Ukraine are partly rooted in his ideas.\n\nAfter the Hetmanist coup, Hrushevskyi left Ukraine and moved to Lviv, where he gradually withdrew from politics, focusing primarily on historical studies. Perhaps a key role in that decision was played by the fact that Ukrainian national movement was growing increasingly divided, with large parts of it accepting the Hetmanist regime and the exiles bogged down in petty disagreements. So, when in 1923 he received an invitation from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences to return to Ukraine and continue his scientific work here, he, perhaps unexpectedly, agreed.\n\nNow, with the Republic restored, Hrushevskyi's position is an unusual one. Radicals view him as a petty intellectual who legitimised a criminal regime by his activities. No matter that Hrushevskyi never missed an opportunity to critique it for excesses: in their eyes, this only created a false illusion of pluralism, only perpetuating its existence. Still, many argue that more than once he was able to draw public attention to the missteps of the former regime and, after all, who but him was better prepared to protect Ukrainian historical science from Hetmanist revisionism?\n\nFor now, it seems that with an esteemed scholar starting to receive positive attention from the authorities, his detractors are forced to leave him in peace."

 ukraine_republican.143.d: "It is finally finished. The vow made by the Workers' Democratic Union - to complete the revolution that started with the fall of the Hetmanate - has been fulfilled. After years of struggle, Ukraine is no longer bound to the German empire, and can now concern itself solely with the march towards socialism.\n\nMuch has changed in those years. Over time, power has been slowly decentralised to peasants' and workers' councils across the country, who have become increasingly responsible for local and regional affairs and largely determine the makeup of the Labour Congress. This process is expected to continue as wartime measures hopefully become unnecessary in the near future. Even now, Ukrainian politics bear the marks of this transformation. It is true that the Council-Revolutionary Bloc remains at the helm of government, with the Socialist-Revolutionaries their largely constructive partners, as things were before. But beyond the most basic dynamics, the landscape is completely different: the oft-provincial nature of the councils has given rise to a caucus of local factions and deputies, affiliated with neither the R-RB, nor the UPS-R, nor even the rump USDRP opposition. Political intrigues now centre largely around them, as their alignments fluctuate between support and opposition to the two leading parties, and temporary alliances between various forces constantly form and break. The Labour Congress is unmistakably a place of lively debate.\n\nSome in the R-RB dismay at the state of things, holding that this chaos is only harmful to socialism and dangerous to the standing of the party in the long term - but Chairman Vynnychenko argues otherwise, that trying to enforce unity would run afoul of basic political freedoms and the principles of liberation struggle, surely driving many to the arms of reaction. Indeed, it is Vynnychenko's vision of collectocracy that has won out. Where more radical voices see chaos and dysfunction, the president sees a brotherhood of revolutionaries, building the new Ukraine through their shared struggles. Over it all, the chairman serves as an elder statesman, mediating disputes and providing guidance as necessary to ensure that the Congress remains productive.\n\nWhile some view Vynnychenko as a man lacking vision, to many more he is nothing less than the father of the revolution; the architect of free Ukraine. With luck, these will be the ones to inherit his legacy — and not those who would burn the revolution down to save it."

After years of struggle, Ukraine is no longer bound to the German empire, and can now concern itself solely with the march towards socialism.\n\nMuch has changed in those years. Peasants' and workers' councils have had certain state responsibilities devolved to them, and ultimately determine the makeup of the Labour Congress. However, the Council-Revolutionaries have gone to great lengths to ensure that they have as much presence and influence within the councils as possible, and therefore a position of dominance inside and outside the Congress. As such, the party exerts a hegemony over Ukrainian politics, between its own strength and that of their supportive partners in the Communist Party. The R-RB itself has gone through drastic changes: Chairman Vynnychenko has been sidelined, and a Presidium elected by party members has been installed as the party's highest governing body. It makes decisions on the highest issues, which then become the basis of party policies that all members are expected to uphold without exception. It is not dissimilar to what the Bolsheviks called democratic centralism.\n\nAll this being said, the People's Republic cannot truly be called a party-state yet. The R-RB does not enjoy total control of the Labour Congress or the councils, and other factions still act as counterweights. The Socialist-Revolutionaries, though weakened, still persist alongside smaller groups that have found footing through success in the councils. While these outer factions are encouraged to cooperate, the R-RB cannot force them to, and their party committees have not yet supplanted the Republic's executive branch in the practical execution of policy. For his part, the architect of the R-RB's ascension does not care to force the issue. Anatolii Pisotskyi - First People's Minister of the Republic, First Secretary of the Presidium of the R-RB, and the true leader of the party - believes that it is predetermined that this situation shall pass. In time, the need for various parties will disappear, and all truly progressive forces will naturally unite into one body. Trying to force its creation will only create a reactionary opposition - in due time, the material conditions will provide.\n\nTime will tell whether he is right."

Over time, power has been slowly decentralised to peasants' and workers' councils across the country, a process expected to accelerate as wartime measures hopefully become unnecessary in the near future. The reality of Ukraine's demographics means that the peasants' councils are significantly more numerous and important than the workers' ones, and without special measures will remain so - a situation that perfectly suits the powers that be. These councils have some say in the makeup of the Labour Congress, a power designed to maintain its proletarian character. But otherwise, the Congress has remained surprisingly close to the Zbory it replaced: the centre of a system bearing some resemblance to traditional parliamentarianism. As such, even the Radical Democrats have been able to claw out a presence alongside the USDRP in the Congress, albeit a very marginalised one.\n\nThe Socialist-Revolutionaries, led by their radical components, have shaped these developments and now sit at the centre of the new revolutionary order. The title of Chairman has passed from Volodymyr Vynnychenko to the S-Rs' man, Nykyfir Hryhoriiv. The government is now helmed by First People's Minister Pavlo Khrystiuk, the man most responsible for the party's ascent. Under his direction, the Borotbysts have been brought into the revolutionary fold, and their agrarian wing actively cooperates with the highly peasant-minded government. The R-RB has been largely supplanted by its former partners, but still competes with the Communists for industrial constituencies, where it takes the role of constructive opposition to the government compared to the latter's dedicated opposition. The difference between their electorates is mainly whether a voter believes in cooperation with the countryside, or that they have been left behind by it.\n\nThe S-Rs do not see it that way. The peasants felt the brunt of the Hetmanist yoke, and in the fields of Ukraine laid the seeds for revolution - who's to say that they should not be the ones to reap it?"

The Congress is still governed by fairly traditional parliamentarianism, and the government's relative disinterest in persecuting the bourgeois and “revisionist” left has meant that the USDRP still finds a considerable place there alongside the leftists, and Radical Democrats can sometimes enter through seats designated for the “labour intelligentsia”. Even among the peasants' councils - which substantially outnumber the workers' ones - one can occasionally find a surprisingly conservative independent being sent to the Congress, to much shock and horror.\n\nDespite some teeth-clenched dynamics, many of these progressive forces have actually been able to form a working, if sometimes shaky relationship with each other. Vynnychenko has ultimately been replaced as Chairman by the UPS-R's Nykyfir Hryhoriiv, but the real orchestrator of this harmony has been the First People's Minister, Mykola Kovalevskyi. Leading the moderate Socialist-Revolutionaries, he has maintained a balance between the forces of revolution and evolution and forged a peace between the factions, all while manoeuvring the S-Rs into a leading position within the Congress. Together with the Social Democrats, the S-Rs now preside over a popular front of themselves and the Council-Revolutionaries, while the Communists have emerged as the main antagonists of the system.\n\nWhether this state of affairs can last is anyone's guess. Some predict that the front cannot hold; that the Congress will eventually be captured by more revolutionary elements - or infiltrated by reactionary ones and subverted from within. But that is the future: for now, the revolutionary honeymoon goes on."

 ukraine_republican.147.t: "A Troublesome Future"
 ukraine_republican.147.d: "With the troubles of day-to-day governance fading, the Russian threat seems to be on the horizon. Our intelligence service, the APDMVS, has identified a large Russian buildup on the Ukrainian border from every direction, raising fears that their promises to renege on Brest-Litovsk may come sooner rather than later.\n\nChairman Vynnychenko's response has been characteristic, denouncing the imperialist Russian mentality towards Ukraine and calling on Moscow to renounce their foolish ambitions, which will not only harm Ukrainians but Russians as well, as Ukrainians will fight to the last man to preserve their country's sovereignty. His rhetoric towards Germany has been shifted to a more conciliatory tone, even emphasising the Germans as a reliable defence partner.\n\nPublicly, these kind of statements work for the Germans, and it seems that as of late they have been less eager to demand we give them unending concessions just so we may keep our government. In more clandestine meetings with his cabinet, it is simply a reality that one day Ukraine must completely decouple itself from Mitteleuropa entirely. Despite seemingly being an impossible feat, Vynnychenko stated that it must be carried out regardless.\n\nMinister of Agriculture Mykola Kovalevskyi made a statement to the rest of the cabinet disagreeing with Vynnychenko's analysis. The first and foremost threat to Ukrainian independence will always be Moscow, he explained - decoupling from Germany would offer the Workers' Democratic Union total dominance over the political system, but it is better to try and win future elections, even if Germany remains influential. After all, so much has been accomplished - reelection for the RDS is surely inevitable. Khrystiuk and Pisotskyi took the opportunity to attack Kovalevskyi's statement, pointing out that Germany will intervene in Eastern Europe how they see fit, and even if the RDS is reelected, the Kaiser will use all means to oppose a government they openly believe is harboring Internationale sympathisers.\n\nIn the end, Vynnychenko had to calm down the room, but the argument only illustrated how divided the government was on the issue. Nonetheless, this kind of bickering cannot stand when the opportunity arises - a decision must be made, and it will have to be made soon."

 ukraine_republican.148.d: "Few men can claim to be as influential in Ukrainian national and social liberation movements as one Mykyta Shapoval. Born near Bakhmut in the Donbas, Shapoval's early life was largely limited to activity within his home region. His revolutionary campaign took on a new role once he moved to Kharkiv, wherein he began formally joining underground Ukrainian structures, including some of the first cells of the future UPS-R. As dear Comrade Shapoval moved further in the country, so did his standing in Ukrainian political circles. By the time of the revolutionary years of the late 1910s, Mykyta Shapoval was one of the foremost revolutionary socialists, as well as national liberation activists, in all of Ukraine.\n\nAlthough not initially repressed after the coup of Hetman Skoropadskyi, Mykyta, along with his cross-party allies, attempted and failed to organize an uprising against the Hetman. Faced with imminent suppression, Shapoval, as well as his Comrades in the UPS-R, and the USDRP crossed the border and began organising in Austrian Galicia.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the exiled central committee of the UPS-R elected Mykyta Shapoval as the Party's Primary Chairman. That is where things had gotten controversial."

 ukraine_republican.150.t: "The Dangers of Revolutionary Zeal"
 ukraine_republican.150.d: "The far left have played a very important role in the struggle against the Hetmanate. By keeping the flame of resistance alive and by raising the banner of rebellion among the downtrodden, the communists have helped us greatly. That doesn't mean, however, that we don't have a fair share of disagreements between us. While some, like the majority of the RDS, decided to properly integrate themselves in the new political system, others chose a more ambiguous or even openly hostile stance towards the People's Republic.\n\nSuch developments can't be ignored. Political disagreements aside, those who refuse to recognise our Republic's right to exist should be fought regardless of past merits. For now, our security services, supported by their German counterparts, have two main aims: to closely monitor the internal organising measures undertaken by certain radical groups and to investigate their potential foreign contacts.\n\nRegarding the first task, the name of Mykhailo Poloz immediately came to attention. A talented coordinator of underground activities during Hetman's reign, he once again seems to be involved in the revolutionary plotting. With another prominent Borotbyst, Levko Kovaliv, leading an influential left faction in the local Poltava council, Poloz has a comfortable base of operations in this region.\n\nWhen it comes to potential foreign meddling, the focus should be directed towards the UKP and the radicals in the RDS. The 'internationalist' wing of the first, led by Stanislav Kosior and Lazar Kahanovych, is under suspicion of keeping close contacts with Russian socialists.\nMeanwhile, certain elements of the RDS, centred mainly around Anatolii Pisotskyi and Pavlo Khrystiuk, are rumoured to retain extensive connections with Paris. Given our country's precarious position and the importance of Germany's security guarantees, it's of utmost importance to pay close attention to such activities."

 ukraine_republican.151.t: "A Lone Shot"
 ukraine_republican.151.d: "A couple of weeks ago, a particularly troubling incident occurred during the routine inspection of the Northern Military District in Chernihiv. General Tiutiunnyk, a head of the delegation, was attacked with a firearm while preparing to depart the city. Fortunately, the general remained unscathed and the perpetrator was quickly apprehended, all thanks to the quick actions of the personnel present during the attack.\n\nThe detainee, a captain of a local garrison, denied involvement with any group and insisted that he acted alone, 'out of patriotic duty and devotion shared by any Ukrainian'. The investigators found this statement to be quite dubious, and indeed, after a thorough background check, a possible link to the SHD was uncovered.\n\nThis revelation is quite alarming. Our security services, preoccupied as they are with curtailing the activities of the radical left, seemed to underestimate risks posed by the remaining hetmanist infiltration of the armed forces. Many now call on the government to rethink its strategy with regards to political extremism and redirect counterintelligence efforts against remaining monarchist elements in the military. Even a bare minimum, like more thorough background checks for the officers, might reveal potential threats and help to prevent incidents similar to this assassination attempt. Still, there exists an opposition to such suggestions. The investigation, after all, failed to pinpoint any accomplices of the perpetrator or connect him to any ongoing conspiracy. The opponents argue that this regrettable, but most likely isolated, incident doesn't facilitate a full-scale witch hunt among the officers."

For all their efforts, the democratic opposition in Russia has failed, and now, fleeing for their safety from tyranny, are now ironically asking for asylum in the same place they often have denounced as a German puppet state for years: Ukraine.\n\nThere is a number of notable names: on the left, there are Daniil Sulimov and Alexander Titov, as well as more right-wing, Kadet figures such as Pyotr Dolgorukov and Anton Kartashyov. Naturally, being an open and free society unlike Russia, we have allowed them to enter. However, even if some of them may share the same ideals that we do, they were still Russian statesmen. Democratically-minded or not, those in the Kremlin have often thought of Ukraine to be little more than a German invention, one that will always serve as a bulwark against Russia."
 ukraine_republican.152.a: "They are welcome here, but... keep an eye on them."

 ukraine_republican.153.t: "Echoes of Discontent"
 ukraine_republican.153.d: "When Russian politicians opposed to [RUS.GetLeader]'s rule had arrived in Ukraine, few thought much of it - at least at first. The exiles had mostly organised among themselves, seeking to shore up support against 'the evil residing in the Kremlin' and to warn the world about the dangers that the new Russia had posed. For that reason, there were relatively few comments about the country that they had just settled in, and those that existed seemed relatively good intentioned.\n\nHowever, as time went on, the remarks regarding the political history and developments of the People's Republic, while remaining benignly sounding, acquired a certain patronising air. The Ukrainian parliament was simultaneously too weak to ensure stable governance and had too much power for its own good. The lack of 'strong executive authority' hampered necessary reforms. The land reform was too bold in its goals and too meek in its execution. The system of national personal autonomy was too labyrinthian and overbearing, but at the same time not robust enough to defend the interests of the Russian population. The cultural policies and initiatives were too narrow-minded. Left-sympathising exiles lamented that the Republic was too beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, while more conservative ones criticised it as defenceless against the 'delusions of socialism'. The 'heartless', 'exploitative', 'all-pervading' German influence and, apparently, a lack of will to counter it, were often mentioned too.\n\nAll in all, an external observer might have gotten an impression that the certain receptivity of the Ukrainian audience drew many of the exiles towards preaching about each and every pet cause and personal political fixation, now denied in the new Russia."

 ukraine_republican.154.d: "It would not be long before the Russian exiles living in a country were to become a problem, but not one that we had expected. For the general public, the exiles' criticisms of the Ukrainian republic did not reach very far, and for their part, the exiles themselves have thus far committed themselves to mostly anti-Savinkov activism. It is for the latter reason that Russo-Ukrainian relations have further deteriorated.\n\nThe Russian ambassador to Ukraine relayed a note from Savinkov's government demanding that the exiles be handed over to face trial for their 'crimes against the Russian people'. After being vaguely warned about the consequences should we refuse, foreign minister Margolin addressed the National Zbory explaining the details of the message. Direct threats from Moscow have been few and far between for some years now, but with the creation of the Moscow Accord and other such developments, such incidents are becoming less and less common.\n\nIt did not take long for a consensus to be reached: Ukraine will not bow to Russian imperialism again, especially not after the restoration of democracy in [202.GetName]. One way or another, we will rebuke their sad attempt to bully us into submission. The question of how we should do this remains, however. The more left-wing members of the Zbory want to offer a stalwart rebuttal, questioning what right Savinkov has to demand the extradition of those who want to reside in Ukraine. It will most assuredly show that Ukraine is willing to stand up to foreign aggression. On the other hand, some have exercised caution and propose that we not send a message back at all. After all, they say, it will only further inflame the already growing tensions between the two countries."

 ukraine_republican.155.t: "The Wealth of the People"
 ukraine_republican.155.d: "State support for cooperative enterprises has always been a common cause for both the URDP and the USDRP. The Ukrainian cooperative movement has been steadily growing since the 1860s and even the Hetmanate assisted it to a degree. The realities of practical governance, however, might put our relations with the cooperatives into a different context.\n\nIn order to pursue an ambitious programme of welfare reforms, our government turned to one of the most common and reliable sources of state revenue – tax increases. While we did our best to ensure fair and just distribution of tax burdens, complaints were to be expected. This time they come from the cooperative businesses.\n\nThrough public statements and private channels, several cooperative associations voiced their dissatisfaction with the government's course. They state that cooperatives should either be exempted from tax hikes, or at the very least should get a considerable period of grace. Their arguments are the usual: cooperatives are the most natural form of grassroots entrepreneurial activities and their development is crucial for the prosperity of the nation. As for the workers' wellbeing, they, apparently, have it already covered: extensive mutual benefit funds and self-help networks provide all necessary accommodations. Surely taking money directly from the workers' pockets only to put it into an ineffective, rigid and overly bureaucratised system of 'state welfare' isn't the best solution?\n\nWhile this line of reasoning is rather unconvincing, there remains a far more prosaic point of concern. Cooperatives constitute a substantial and well organised part of our electoral base. Upsetting them too much might jeopardise our political prospects in the future."

 ukraine_republican.156.d: "Extensive nationalisation of mining enterprises wasn't among the most prioritised points of our agenda, but economical and political circumstances forced our hand in this regard. Now the government is bogged down in lengthy and arduous negotiations with the prominent mining moguls, both Ukrainian and foreign ones, many of them members of the National Union of Mining Industry (formerly part of the infamous Protofis). The talks are progressing very slowly, thanks to the mining magnates using each ounce of their influence, both public and discreet, to push for more preferable conditions.\n\nTheir intransigence is expected, but nonetheless creates a great deal of headache for us. The delays already harm our abilities for proper planning with regards to the industrialisation programme. Additionally, our partners in the USDRP are becoming increasingly impatient as the negotiations drag on. Why, they ask, shouldn't we use our legislative and executive powers to dictate our conditions? No need to be conciliatory towards the people uninterested in returning the favour. We should simply present them with the fait accompli in a form of state-mandated procedure for the buyout prices establishment. They might go to the courts in response, but are unlikely to gain much from it.\n\nWhile this approach sounds tempting, burning bridges with the influential business people might create more problems for our government in the future. Pursuing mutually beneficial compromise may still remain our priority."

 ukraine_republican.157.t: "A Threat or an Opportunity?"
 ukraine_republican.157.d: "The recent deal struck between the party and a group of independent deputies affiliated with the UDKhP and Protofis opened new opportunities for us. The cultivation of close ties with business circles might not only contribute to the overall development of a healthy economy, but also help the party directly. Still, it's useful to remember the lessons of the previous administrations. Under no circumstances should our government become the hostage of the large capital, like it often happened during the Hetmanate times.\n\nThat's exactly why the latest proposal raised by certain circles of our party caused quite a commotion. The proposition in question is concerned with Fedir Tereshchenko – an influential aviation industrialist with extensive connections to the now defunct Protofis. Tereshchenko is an apt organiser who started with aircraft workshops and ended with the establishment of the largest aviation manufacturer in Ukraine. His path, however, was made significantly easier by the patronage of his immensely wealthy family and by large state subsidies, acquired most likely through Protofis lobbying efforts.\n\nStill, Fedir Fedorovych has genuine and considerable expertise, and that's why some suggest bringing him to one of the state planning boards overseeing the industrialisation programme. He apparently is interested and ready to cooperate, especially if the government ensures that his aviation company won't be nationalised.\n\nThis is a tempting proposition, but also a controversial one. Our partners in the USDRP and some among our own party might see this appointment as a capitulation to large capital. Pledging to keep Tereshchenko's company private will upset parts of our base and the entirety of our left wing. Will the potential benefits be able to outweigh internal disunity?"

With many judges being either under review, suspension or in the process of the appeal, courts, overwhelmed with the lawsuits and proceedings pertaining to the land redistribution, have ground to a halt. The severity of the issue increases by the day, as the judicial backlog continues to grow. Various bureaucratic hurdles have already been plaguing the land reform, and this latest development certainly doesn't help.\n\nOne possible solution is to place all cases tied to the land reform under the jurisdiction of a special judicial body staffed with judges, whose integrity has already been proven by the General Court's review. Of course, the establishment of a new structure during the ongoing crisis might complicate the situation even more, so this decision shouldn't be taken lightly."

However, in the years since Black Monday, those complaints - and sometimes threats from Moscow - have only grown.\n\nEspecially after Savinkov's rise and subsequent consolidation of power, Russian state media and high-ranking politicians have began to engage in extreme anti-Ukrainian rhetoric. Much of the hatred, though, is directed towards the republican government itself. The idea being pushed forth is that the Hetman had always been too friendly with Russia, and so the Germans, desiring to expand both their influence over Eastern Europe and the Ostwall fortification system, had engineered his replacement with a regime dedicated solely to erasing the Russian identity and language in Ukraine.\n\nIt is all, apparently, part of a concentrated effort to firmly secure Germany's hegemony in Eastern Europe and wholly eliminate any Russian presence or influence in the region. Such ideas are nonsense, of course, but they seem to at least somewhat resonate with the Russian people - and it is likely that sooner or later, their words may be backed up with force." #Savinkov

Despite acknowledging some similarities in governance and ideology between our two countries, their rhetoric has only intensified. Russian politicians have criticised the Ukrainian People's Republic as not a 'true democracy', claiming that it is still beholden to the rigid demands, treaties and economic influence of Berlin. As long as Russians and Ukrainians are separated due to Germany's iron grip over Eastern Europe, mutual hostilities will always remain. If war between [202.GetName] and Moscow will come, they say, it will be because of the forced divisions between the two, engineered by greedy and xenophobic German elites.\n\nSuch ideas are nonsense, of course, but they seem to at least somewhat resonate with the Russian people - and it is likely that sooner or later, their words may be backed up with force." #Democratic

Many remember the long periods of Russification and oppression under the tsar, and now are worrying that a renewed attack on Ukraine and her way of life is inevitable. Statements from Russian politicians since the restoration have not been surprising, but still concerning; they say that the very existence of an independent Ukraine, especially one tied to Berlin, is a 'dagger aimed at the heart of Russia'. For hundreds of years, Ukraine was a rightful part of the Russian cultural and political sphere of influence, the 'Russkiy Mir'. Without a preemptive strike to get rid of this threat, they say, Germany will strike first and destroy Russia again.\n\nSuch ideas are nonsense, of course, but they seem to at least somewhat resonate with the Russian people - and it is likely that sooner or later, their words may be backed up with force." #Empire

The Russian narrative is that the Ukrainian People's Republic is beholden solely to the interests of German capital - in the end, the republican restoration served to reinforce bourgeois rule and to sideline socialist efforts to build a free Ukraine. The total destruction of the enemies of the revolution - German imperialism, Ukrainian bourgeois-nationalism, and so on - are necessary to ensure the victory of socialism and the end of capitalism in Europe.\n\nSuch ideas are nonsense, of course, but they seem to at least somewhat resonate with the Russian people - and it is likely that sooner or later, their words may be backed up with force." #Socialist

 ukraine_republican.160.d: "What has started as an outburst of labour unrest in the Galician town of Drohobych may very well have noticeable repercussions here in [202.GetName]. A demonstration consisting mostly of local oil workers was handled rather roughly by the police: shots were fired and some of the protesters were injured. This outrageous occurrence drew strong condemnations from socialist and generally left-leaning forces both in Galicia-Lodomeria and Ukraine. In the latter case, however, the outcry has one distinct trait, being directed not only against the cruel police and uncaring authorities of Drohobych and Galicia, but also against the Chairman of the National Zbory, Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen.\n\nThe blue-blooded Chairman has always been somewhat of an anomalous peculiarity of the Republican political landscape. Despite being essentially an outsider in Ukrainian politics, he acquired a status close to that of a folk-hero among parts of the general populace and a respect (albeit sometimes begrudging) from the former exiles. Indeed, the 'Austro-Ukrainian Friendship Association' established by Vyshyvanyi in Galicia significantly helped their cause and earned him a great deal of appreciation.\n\nHowever, it's one thing to be a benefactor behind the scenes, and completely another to appear at the centre of political life. The RDS especially have always detested his appointment as Chairman, deeming a foreign noble simply unfit to occupy such an important position. Now their critique has become particularly incendiary. The Hapsburgs, these tyrants, these prison-keepers of nations, gorge themselves on the blood of the people and one of them presides over the parliament of the People's Republic? Isn't this an ultimate humiliation, a great desecration of republican values?\n\nUsually such preposterous nonsense wouldn't even require a recognition, much less a direct answer. Nowadays, however, the political climate is so electrified that even some among our coalition partners find it convenient to acknowledge this hateful drivel, to cater to parts of their base. To avoid further complications, perhaps it would be prudent to carefully address this situation."

While some low-level priests might have been enthusiastic about the Republic overthrowing the Hetman, significant parts of the higher church hierarchy were composed from Skoropadskyi's loyalists and this fact inevitably was reflected on how church behaved itself, and how some Republicans viewed it in response. A lot of initial goodwill towards church was lost, some among even non far-left republicans became sceptical towards it, so overall relations with it might be described as neutral.\n\nThe polarisation of opinions also extends to the URDP. Much of the party recognises the value of having healthy relations with the Church; in rural Ukraine in particular, the church has a great grip over the education system and acts as the forefront of anti-poverty measures. The party's right wing faction especially sees ties with the faithful as paramount.\n\nHowever, due to hesitancy from the other wings of the party, and in particular our coalition partners in the USDRP, serious efforts to cultivate those ties have largely been avoided. The slowly growing UNP, who the URDP-Right sees as its main rival, has been filling this gap instead and cultivating a greater following in the countryside as a result.\n\nWith their support base now under threat, URDP-Right leader Volodymyr Dolenko has been calling for the rest of the party to redirect efforts towards building a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Church. It will no doubt be difficult to convince our partners in the USDRP of such endeavours, though."

The once polarised political scene is now gathering together to resist the invasion - nationalists, democrats, and even the far left have mostly united to one goal: Ukraine must be free and the invaders must be driven out of the country.\n\nWith the elections being postponed until the end of the war, some say that it would be prudent to extend a hand to the forces currently in opposition. They are suggesting that we quickly form a national unity government, one that brings together not just the existing coalition, but the opposition too, mostly from figures in the RDS and perhaps even from the UNP. As leader of the RDS and UNP respectively, Vynnychenko and Mikhnovskyi have both signalled support for such an idea.\n\nIt will no doubt be beneficial for all Ukraine, but some see it as an unnecessary endeavour and one that might undermine legitimacy of the elected government among population, not even mentioning how bringing together people with such differing views might complicate the process of governance."

 ukraine_republican.167.t: "A Progressive Force"
 ukraine_republican.167.d: "Eighteen years of existence under the Hetmanate system affected the political trajectory of the URDP in various ways. Permanently residing in the opposition, acting in the virulently anti-socialist political landscape, it was forced to perform a careful balancing act: to champion its progressive policies without giving authorities any reasons to suppress the party as a hotbed of dangerous radicalism.\n\nThese circumstances eventually led to the formation of the three factions within the party, the rise of each one of them a reaction to the pressures of the Hetmanate. While the right largely limited its focus to the concerns of landowning peasants, the centre, following the old credo of 'the party of responsible statesmanship', became a faction of compromises. The left, meanwhile, sought to fill the niche freed after the ban of openly socialist forces.\n\nElaborating on the more idealistic strains of the party's own doctrine, combining them with the ideological legacy of legal marxism and other reformist tendencies of the former empire, it eventually formed its platform. A proper transition to a just and equal society was to be achieved not through wholesale rejection of capitalism, but via its careful and controlled development. The modernising influence brought by the capitalist system was to be acknowledged, together with the utmost importance of curtailing its inevitable excesses.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the relative influence of the party's left has helped during the negotiations with the USDRP. While both parties have worked together during the fateful days of 1917 and 1918, there were concerns that passing years had pulled them too far apart. The confirmation of Nikovskyi as a head of the cabinet, however, seems to indicate that the USDRP trusts our party enough and is ready for cooperation."

 ukraine_republican.168.d: "Several weeks ago a leading trio of the party's right wing – Volodymyr Dolenko, Yevhen Arkhypenko and Pylyp Pylypchuk – announced their intention to leave the URDP and, together with their followers, pursue new political venues. As unwelcome as this proclamation was, it didn't come fully unexpected. For some time, the tensions in the party have been running high, with the right faction being vocal about its displeasure with concessions to the USDRP and presumed disregard towards the party's 'natural interests'.\n\nToday Dolenko, Arkhypenko and Pylypchuk, joined by the former UDKhP member (and one of its founders) Viktor Andriievskyi, announced the formation of a new political party. The new force, called the Ukrainian People's Peasants' Party (UNSP), promises to champion the economic interests of small and middle holding farmers, support amiable relations between the state and the Orthodox Church, all the while protecting the ideals of 'freedom and prosperity of the whole Ukrainian nation'. The party is poised to attract parts of the base of both the URDP and the UNP, with the latter's nationalist and jingoistic rhetoric being barely palatable for some.\n\nWhile it can be argued that this outcome was predetermined long ago and that outsiders who joined the URDP in early 1920s never fit the party anyway, this loss remains quite palpable. With the URDP plurality in the Zbory diminished, relations with the USDRP will undoubtedly come to the forefront of the party's agenda."

 ukraine_republican.170.t: "The Revolt of Idealists"
 ukraine_republican.170.d: "'The party has lost sight of its ideals, but we will bring it back on track!' Those were the closing words of Andrii Nikovskyi during the last annual party congress. While they presented a facade of confidence, the reality turned out to be less accommodating towards Andrii Vasylovych and his plans. The motion to change the composition of the party's central committee, championed by him, was eventually defeated.\n\nThis setback is but the last one among many recently suffered by the URDP left wing. Overshadowed by its right counterpart, finding little understanding among the dignitaries of the party's centre, in the end it adopted a policy of obstructionism towards almost any of the party's initiatives. All the while, Nikovskyi's position as a head of the Council of People's Ministers makes him virtually unassailable, and the party's left in general still demonstrates discipline and unity surpassing those of the URDP at large. There are even rumours of tacit support from Serhii Yefremov, one of the party's founders and its former leader, who nowadays keeps himself out of political life.\n\nThere are no signs that this standoff will be resolved in the near future. The party, allegedly, lost its truly progressive cause. What was once a force ready to fight for democracy, workers' rights, women's liberation and more is now becoming a mouthpiece for situational interests. The right is too preoccupied with its limited agenda, unable to reconcile itself with the broadly progressive nature of the URDP. The centre deems the demands of the left regarding party's reorganisation as too radical, while the rebels refuse to budge, fully convinced that it's their duty to return the party to the right course, away from the narrowmindedness of the rightists and conformity of the centrists. Will this stubbornness save the URDP or break it – only time will tell."

 ukraine_republican.171.d: ""...of course they are building yet another Hetmanate, this time under the thin veneer of 'republican values'. The entirety of their political experience simply won't allow them to do anything else, even if they desired so. They had once the word 'federalists' in their name. Ironic, given that their real platform has nothing to do with autonomy and self-government. By placing full control over the People's Militia in the hands of the central government they showed how little they actually care about ideals of popular sovereignty. The URDP simply needs an obedient tool, always ready to strangle people's resistance against their rotten bourgeois regime, and..."\n\nThis is but a small fragment of the article in the latest issue of a newspaper 'Nova Doba', authored by none other than Andrii Richytskyi, a widely recognisable pen name of an infamous R-RB deputy, Anatolii Pisotskyi. The rest of the piece is no less critical, and what's worse, it doesn't seem to be merely an outcry of a fringe radical. Indeed, our latest decision regarding the accountability of the People's Militia raised a lot of questions and objections. This article, while especially provocative, is just a manifestation of a wider discontent.\n\nWhile we maintain that defence of the Republic requires streamlined and rationalised control over security forces, there are some amendments that can be made. We can define a procedure, in which certain cases will allow local legislatures to overrule a deployment of the People's Militia, authorised by the central government, provided there is the 2/3 majority behind the motion. Given how fractured local assemblies tend to be and that exact procedure will be still designed by our government, the practical effect will be negligible. Still, sometimes a symbolic concession is exactly the thing that can sway public opinion."

 ukraine_republican.172.t: "Crime Wave in [192.GetName]"
 ukraine_republican.172.d: "Nowadays pages of local [192.GetName] newspapers feature an ever increasing stream of reports on violent crimes. While a relatively lively criminal underground is nothing new for a big port city, recently matters seem to get out of hand. The gang warfare assumes an increasingly brazen and violent manner – the gangs fight each other with no concerns for collateral casualties among law abiding citizens. This recent surge is mostly attributed towards fierce squabbles over the profitable smuggling routes.\n\nUsually, such a drastic situation would call for an active use of the People's Militia, but certain local aspects complicate the matter. Legislatures of both the city and a wider region harbour unusually powerful and united radical left factions. Their representatives view the People's Militia with distrust, deeming it merely a rebranded National Guard of hetmanist times. Thus, local units tend to be underequipped, understaffed and led by people mostly chosen for their lack of initiative and political convenience.\n\nThe central government can do little with this state of affairs, but simply staying aside is hardly an option either. The root cause of the issue at hand is the rampant smuggling. As usual, it was allowed to grow to such proportions by local officials and custom officers, all too easily swayed by bribes. A thorough investigation and appropriately harsh punishments will go a long way in reducing the allure of the smuggling business, thus decreasing criminal activities surrounding it."

 ukraine_republican.173.d: "While the entire country celebrates long awaited reunion with our Galician brethren, there are still some elements for whom hatred and prejudices make the new status-quo unpalatable. Three days ago, mobs of Polish radical nationalists, mostly supporters of extremist right parties like the Endecy and ONR, poured on the streets of Lviv to cause havoc and disorder. Ukrainian and Jewish shops were attacked, while the group of most impudent rioters attempted to seize the Town Hall. The next day the order was restored, in no small part due to the help of Ukrainian volunteers, but now we have another question on our hands.\n\nThe Polish National Union, an organisation tasked with the representation of interests of the Polish minority in the People's Republic, still struggles to form an official line with regards to the recent incident. Still, some of its leadership has contacted our government through the backchannels, pleading for a degree of leniency towards the arrested radicals. They argue that while the select few ringleaders might be charged with treason, the majority of the defendants should be accused of nothing more than hooliganism and vandalism.\n\nThis is a difficult request. The political affiliations of the rioters and their attempt to seize the city administration, not even mentioning deliberate targeting of their vandalism, clearly indicate the true nature of their motives. Being too soft on them might send a dangerous message to other national chauvinists: the Ukrainian People's Republic is weak and unprepared to defend itself. The potential outcry among the population and right opposition can't be underestimated too: the UNP will use the situation to the utmost of its ability. While magnanimity is indeed the virtue of victors, perhaps now is not the right time to express it."

The actual costs of the reform have surpassed even our most pessimistic estimates. For some time already the Ministry of Agriculture has been asking for additional emergency funding. Recently these pleas grew even more urgent, as the current People's Minister of Agriculture, Yevhen Arkhypenko, threatened to resign if the monetary requests remain unanswered.\n\nArkhypenko, one of the leaders of the URDP right wing, is a responsible and experienced statesman. He served (albeit not in a leading position) in the agricultural ministry of Doroshenko's cabinet and has been an avid proponent of comprehensive land reform since the 1920s. Still, given the recent troubles, perhaps it would be wise to allow him to resign and bring in new expertise.\n\nThe most obvious alternative is the USDRP candidate, Borys Martos. A scholarly figure, he is famous for his broad experience in the matters of cooperative enterprises. During the exile he taught in the Ukrainian University in Lviv and authored several treatises on the cooperatives. After the return he put his theoretical knowledge in practice, playing a key role in the reorganisation of the Kooptsentr.\n\nThere is, however, a more unorthodox choice. Mykola Kovalevskyi, one of the leading figures of the UPS-R's moderate faction, was brought up as a candidate. Kovalevskyi was instrumental in the revival of the peasant trade union 'Selianska Spilka' and remains immensely popular among the peasantry. While the UPS-R as a whole is a radical oppositional party, Kovalevskyi is fairly amiable towards our coalition. His appointment might appease the RDS and reassure the population. A symbolic aspect mustn't be overlooked either: Mykola Mykolaiovych served in the government overthrown by Skoropadskyi in 1918, so this assignment might be presented as a return to the Republican roots."

 ukraine_republican.176.t: "Our Hopes under Threat"
 ukraine_republican.176.d: "The failure of the National Defence Act has shown deep political divisions at a time when we cannot afford them. Much debate now surrounds why it failed: was the political importance of the land reform too deep-rooted for such a change in budget priorities? Was it due to grievances and petty angers between the two parties at the top, the URDP and USDRP? Or was the belief that Russia would invade soon seen as too farfetched, too nonsensical given German military dominance in Europe?\n\nRecent statements by the Russian foreign minister, as well as fears that Communard aggression towards Germany could spiral into a greater conflict, have only contributed to the worry that the bill's failure may be more costly than imagined. Proponents of the act, many of whom are concentrated in Mikhnovskyi's UNP and other right wing figures, have loudly denounced the bill's failure, citing it as one of the greatest failures of the restored people's republic. If Ukraine cannot defend itself because it failed to recognise the importance of a domestic military industry and the dangers of increasing Russian revanchism, then the only ones to blame will be the ruling coalition.\n\nThe army had not taken the bill's failure well, either. Behind closed doors, members of the nationalist "Sichovyky" group in the army, in particular General Konovalets, have expressed extreme disappointment in the National Zbory. There have even been murmurs that, should the coalition continue to fail to uphold its duties to the nation, then military interference in politics may become a serious problem.\n\nThe reality of an imminent Russian invasion is beginning to set in. We must recognise it is there or it will crush us like a tidal wave."
 ukraine_republican.176.d2: "It's been some time since the passing of the National Defence Act, and its provisions are certainly being carried out, granting Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself. While the internal threats to the People's Republic have largely withered away, and the act's passing was a sign of much-needed unity in the National Zbory, one prospect still looms large.\n\nReality is hitting that Russian invasion may be just around the corner, and it is not a reality that anyone in the Zbory nor in the whole country want to entertain. But in particular, for the dreamers of 1917 who made their hopes of an independent, free Ukraine come true, it is even more of a dreadful thought. Soon the Second People's Republic will have hit its third year its existence; frankly, a time too short, given the Hetman's nearly two decades of neglect.\n\nMuch has happened in the past two years, and that is exactly why the thought of Russian invasion razing the fields and towns of Ukraine, undoing everything that we have accomplished, is not the most comforting thought. Even disregarding Russian ambitions of the reconquest and total subjugation of Ukraine, we are stuck in a rock and a hard place. The military alliance with Germany will make [202.GetName] a target, and yet this is a military alliance we cannot forgo.\n\nThe Ukrainian People's Republic has not lived long enough yet. It has yet to fully show that the dreams of 1917 were something worth fighting for. Hopefully, some day, we can prove that it is."

 ukraine_republican.177.d: "Just a year after the 1937 general elections, the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries is reconsidering their direction after the party's defeat to the moderate coalition. After some internal debate, much of the party had agreed that the UPS-R's association with the more radical R-RB had made creating a consistent message that would appeal to voters difficult, something that the more moderate parties could do much better. Additionally, with the land reform ongoing, the once revolutionary mood at the onset of the elections seems to be disappearing.\n\nFaced with these developments, a change in leadership occurred: after a party conference the previous chairman of the UPS-R, Nykyfir Hryhoriiv, was ousted in favour of the leader of the party's moderate faction, Mykola Kovalevskyi. A peculiar twist, given that Mykola Mykolaiovych was at the head of the party in 1917 and 1918. Kovalevskyi is a proponent of land nationalisation rather than socialisation, a position he shares with the USDRP - who have reacted warmly to Kovalevskyi's return to the chairmanship. A change of relationships between the two parties in a very positive direction now seems to be a distinct possibility.\n\nThe change in the UPS-R's leadership has been hotly debated by the URDP. Some are seeing it as a rather significant threat - the matters of practical governance have left our partners in the USDRP dissatisfied at times, and the potential of a moderate socialist coalition emerging in the next elections cannot be understated. Others see it differently, though, believing that it may split the left and leave the URDP as the kingmaker, one that can dominate the political centre and freely choose its course."

This conflict caused an overwhelming amount of suffering for many people - refugees, wounded veterans, orphans and many others who have lost much to this war. Our nation must begin the process of rebuilding, but first, it is time to hold those elections that were postponed in the wake of the conflict.\n\nNaturally, the main topic of these elections will be reconstruction. All parties have unveiled their plans for ambitious post-war welfare programmes and other campaigns to heal the wounds of the war. The Radicals are banking on securing a majority by promising to create a prosperous and booming economy, which will, in turn, help those afflicted by the war get back on their feet. Meanwhile, the Workers' Party is drumming up support by embracing pacifist rhetoric, promising to never let Ukraine fall victim to a tragedy like this ever again. However, the greatest promises of change are once again coming from the UPS-R and the R-RB. With Ukraine's natural threat neutralised, they claim that now is the ideal time for radical social and political change.\n\nThe electoral situation has been made even more unpredictable by an up and coming contender - The Ukrainian People's Party (UNP). While the Ukrainian right has still not fully rebounded from the defeat of the Hetman, and the People's Republic has proved itself beyond all doubt, the political landscape has been changing in their favour. The war stoked patriotic fervour so desperately called for by the UNP, and under the popular leadership of Mikhnovskyi, the party is attracting voters more than ever before.\n\nNow, on the [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], millions of voters return to the polls once again to choose their government.

 ukraine_republican.182.d: "With the URDP now occupying the position of the governing party, disagreements between its different wings tend to lose their purely theoretical character and drift into the sphere of practical policy. While the debates usually are concerned mostly with an order of priorities of certain decisions, some questions remain rather divisive. One of these is the place of Ukraine in the Pax Germanica.\n\nThe URDP right is mostly in favour of the prevailing status quo. While these notions are rarely put at the forefront of the faction's public image (given the relative unpopularity of Berlin among common Ukrainians), many right-wingers privately maintain a fairly positive view of current international order. The Reichspakt, according to them, is a bastion of order against the syndicalist anarchy, the Mitteleuropa – a union of the most developed economies of the continent, crucial for the peaceful and fruitful cooperation between the nations of Europe. So it is unsurprising that Pylyp Pylypchuk, one of the leading figures of the URDP right and a member of the party's economic committee, has been always pushing for the strengthening of ties between Ukraine and Germany.\n\nThese views, however, find little understanding among the party's left nowadays. They maintain that German militarisation is partially responsible for the increased tensions in Europe, while Mitteleuropa is too overbearing an institution to allow for the proper development of its member-states (with Germany being an obvious exception). As Ivan Feshchenko-Chopivskyi, a prominent URDP left-winger and People's Minister of Economy, put it: 'national development should be controlled by the national government, not by unelected foreign bureaucrats'.\n\nAs time goes on, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has less and less space to manoeuvre between these conflicting views.

Many view this vast grassroots organisation, reopened under the patronage of the UPS-R, as evidence that the ability for cooperation and local organisation remains among the Ukrainian people's strong suits.\n\nNot everyone, however, shares this view. The URDP right wing in particular is quite suspicious of this structure. As always, its membership is wary of the potentially destructive influence of 'social collectivism', which, according to them, is not typical for the Ukrainian peasantry and remains a burdensome legacy of Russian colonialism, a dangerous foreign export.\n\nThese fears have now taken the shape of concerns for the security of the Ukrainian state. Apparently, the Spilka provides a perfect cover for radical socialists spreading anti-Republican propaganda among the poorest strata of the peasantry. With the organisation being so large and decentralised, it's only natural to expect the Borotbysts and UPS-R radicals secretly co-opting its local branches and turning them against the Republican order. A thorough investigation into possible illegal activities must be conducted and the union itself should be placed under close surveillance.\n\nThe URDP left wing, however, isn't very keen on this line of reasoning. Kostiantyn Matsiievych, one of its leading figures and a key member of the party's agrarian committee, has privately called these suspicions 'borderline paranoid'. He maintains that Spilka is important for the development of the countryside and its educational and organisational efforts are especially valuable now, during the ongoing land reform. To add onto that, it strengthens the positions of the moderate wing of the UPS-R, thus decreasing the overall radicalism of the socialist opposition. As such, the state should cooperate with the union, not curtail it."
 ukraine_republican.183.a: "A suspicious organisation indeed."
 ukraine_republican.183.b: "Its efforts should be encouraged."

 ukraine_republican.184.t: "Generals Voice Concerns"
 ukraine_republican.184.d: "Our decision to support the USDRP initiative regarding the proper ideological and educational development of the armed forces has unsurprisingly drawn a lot of criticism. While the loud outcries of the general Bolbochan and the quiet grumbles of general Omelianovych-Pavlenko were to be expected, dissatisfaction is noticeable even among more reserved high-ranking officers.\n\nGenerals Hrekiv and Chyzhevskyi are rare examples of the members of the military brass sympathetic to our party, particularly to its right wing. This affiliation is rooted in their connections to the parties of Socialists-Independists and People's Republicans, many of whom joined the URDP in 1920s and now constitute its right faction. Now these officers privately contacted the party in order to voice their concerns regarding the reforms in the army. The crux of their argument boils down to the simple notion: excessive politicisation of the army is harmful, no matter who conducts it, a hetmanist or a democrat.\n\nWhile we reject the accusations of 'excessive politicisation' and maintain that the long-term benefits of the reform will outweigh short-term disruptions caused by it, some among the party call to at least acknowledge the genuine concerns of our allies among the military. Others are more sceptical and see in this message merely a veiled plea to the party, an appeal to use its influence in order to safeguard the positions of two generals and their associates — rather rich, coming from the people bemoaning the alleged 'politicisation' of the army."
 ukraine_republican.184.a: "A polite nonanswer will suffice."
 ukraine_republican.184.b: "Reassure the generals that they have nothing to fear."

 ukraine_republican.185.t: "The Future in Danger"
 ukraine_republican.185.d: "The war situation has not necessarily developed to our advantage. The overwhelming firepower of the Russian offensive has forced us out of our defensive positions, with many major cities having fallen to the Russian bear.\n\nIn a time where millions of Ukrainians now lay under occupation and our armed forces have underperformed, the blame is being cast on the ruling government. The opposition has become even more emboldened as a result, and popular opinion is seemingly becoming negative about the government's handling of the war.\n\nWhile our victory in due time will come, these developments do not bode well for our prospects in the postwar elections. The patriotic Ukrainians under occupation by Russian forces will certainly not remember kindly how we abandoned them."

 #USDRP Events Start Here
 ukraine_republican.187.t: "Eyes to the Left"
 ukraine_republican.187.d: "Despite our best efforts, Ukraine remains tied to the Mitteleuropean order — Berlin continues to exert pressure on us, often using Mitteleuropa as a tool to do so. Our trade independence is thus limited and our economy still retains the sizable influence of foreign powers.\n\nThere is one way we can circumvent these unfortunate circumstances. While we have little sympathy for the Internationale's violent brand of socialism, perhaps reaching out to them to come to a bilateral trade agreement would be the best way to move our economic independence forward. France and Britain, after all, are industrious nations with much to offer Ukraine.\n\nHowever, such an agreement would be unprecedented, given the past twenty years of German dominance over Eastern European trade. Additionally, Mitteleuropa was designed with protectionism in mind, so trade outside of it is generally discouraged, especially for countries under the German jackboot.\n\nAll of that aside, for our own benefit, we are ready to send a negotiator to Paris to make this a reality. Arnold Margolin, a URDP member, has a history in the foreign service, and would be a good way to compromise both with our junior partner and Berlin, should our negotiations with the Internationale draw their ire. Some instead advocate sending a fellow party member, like Mykhailo Yeremiiv, to signal that we are serious about these negotiations and are acting independently of Germany."
 ukraine_republican.187.a: "Let's send Margolin to Paris."
 ukraine_republican.187.b: "Send Yeremiiv instead!"
 ukraine_republican.187.a.tt: "§HArnold Margolin§!, from the §lURDP§!, will be sent to Paris to negotiate a trade deal with the French and British.\n\nThis will §Rworsen§! the terms of the deal, but the chance of it succeeding will be §Gincreased§! by §Y20%§!."

 ukraine_republican.188.t: "Art of the Deal"
 ukraine_republican.188.d: "Our negotiator has arrived at the French capital to the slight surprise of Communard officials. It is already becoming clear that Internationale-Ukraine relations are much better than they were under the Hetmanate, which we should take great pride in.\n\nIn exchange for cheap Ukrainian grain, we have a couple of options to choose from: the provision of high quality consumer goods, or perhaps machinery much needed for the ongoing industrialisation programme. The shipment of fuel to the Internationale, given the current oil boom, is also on the table, and would likely allow us to better the terms."
 ukraine_republican.188.a: "Industrial assistance is certainly important."
 ukraine_republican.188.b: "We can take care of our industrialisation. Consumer goods comes first."

 ukraine_republican.189.d.schleicher: "While the Schleicher administration seems pragmatic on the surface, there is no doubt that they will use this opportunity to squeeze every concession out of us.

 ukraine_republican.190.t: "Wrath of the Puppetmaster"
 ukraine_republican.190.d: "The Germans did not respond well to our offer.\n\nAmbassador Welczeck relayed the reply from Berlin, in which they questioned what position the Ukrainian government was in to make such demands, and called into question the defence treaty between the two nations.\n\nThey furthermore sent an ultimatum: within 24 hours, Ukraine must assume responsibility and terminate these harmful negotiations which threaten the security of both nations. Failure to comply will mean a wave of sanctions, the freezing of Ukraine's Mitteleuropa membership, and other measures. It became clear that through these threats they were attempting to engineer a second coup against the People's Republic and force the USDRP government's hand.\n\nWhen this was read out to the National Zbory, panic ensued. Our junior partners in the URDP accused us of destroying the German-Ukrainian relationship, a necessary one to ensure our safety from Russian aggression. Figures from the URDP's right wing and the UNP, like Mykola Mikhnovskyi and Volodymyr Dolenko, loudly denounced the USDRP as a party of lofty idealists who will stop at nothing to drive Ukraine into ruin with their ignorant foreign policy.\n\nIn the end, our diplomat sent to Paris was called back, and the Germans sent not a word more to us. To say that this whole affair was an embarrassment for the party, however, would be a great understatement."
 ukraine_republican.190.a: "Reality is a harsh mistress..."

 ukraine_republican.191.t: "Lenience Goes a Long Way"
 ukraine_republican.191.d: "The Germans have responded warmly to our counteroffer, meaning that the Franco-British-Ukrainian trade deal can finally go underway.\n\nBesides the material benefits, this is also a huge propaganda win for the USDRP. Despite the protests of the rightists, even the URDP seems to mostly be on board with the negotiations's success. Above all, we have shown that we can pursue our own, independent direction, and negotiate with Germany on equal terms."
 ukraine_republican.191.a: "What the Hetman could never do, we have done in a year."

 ukraine_republican.192.t: "Laying the Foundations"
 ukraine_republican.192.d: "For nearly two decades our beloved Ukraine languished under Skoropadskyi's yoke. With the hopes and dreams of 1917 dashed, our country was reduced to little more than a personal fiefdom of the so-called 'Hetman' and his cronies. Despite the thin veneer of a 'national Ukrainian character', that regime, at its core, was a direct continuation of a Tsarist rule – cruel, uncaring, and deeply reactionary.\n\nTo undone all the damage and to make up for all the years of neglect, a formidable resolve is required. Ours is rooted in a devotion to the socialist cause. We recognise, however, that the material and geopolitical conditions of Ukraine don't allow for an immediate, violent transition to the socialist system so passionately advocated by Paris and London. No, the painful lessons of the failed Bolshevist revolution amply showed us that open class warfare in a country like Ukraine leads only to chaos, economic collapse and, eventually, tyranny of the few. Here socialism can only be built on strong democratic and parliamentarian foundations. Our crucial task is to lay them.\n\nIt won't be easy. In order to do so we will need to thoroughly transform the very fabric of Ukrainian society and political system, all the while expanding the reach of our party, converting it into a truly mass movement of the working class. We expect to meet resistance both from the left and from the right, from the misguided extremists and complacent moderates alike.\n\nLet us not falter, though. The intransigence of our opponents will only hone our convictions and give us new strength to fight for our ideals."
 ukraine_republican.192.a: "Za vilnu i protsvitaiuchu Ukrainu!"
 ukraine_republican.192.a.tt: "§gFor a free and prosperous Ukraine!§!\n\nDepending on the level of §1Idealism§!, shown in the decision tab, many of our focuses will be granted additional buffs.

 ukraine_republican.193.t: "The Split"
 ukraine_republican.193.d: "The dissolution of the Ukrainian Socialist Bloc, announced in the wake of the proclamation of the People's Republic, was presented to the public as a peaceful and amicable affair: old comrades parting the ways at the doorstep of something new. However, there is more to this split than meets the eye. The disbandment of an already uneasy alliance was agreed upon amidst internal tensions, greatly flared up by a relatively recent incident.\n\nIn the closing days of the anti-Hetman campaign, an impromptu meeting between the representatives of the USDRP and the RDS was held in the town of Bila Tserkva, not far from Kyiv. The RDS delegation was headed by Antin Drahomyretskyi, one of the chief members of the R-RB radical faction, and Pavlo Khrystiuk from the UPS-R. The Social Democrats were represented by two members of the central committee – Panas Fedenko and Andrii Livytskyi – accompanied by Mykola Galagan, a member of the party's committee of military affairs.\n\nDrahomyretskyi was clear: it's time to seize revolutionary momentum and follow up the ousting of the Hetman with the proclamation of the socialist and councilist republic. No need to replace one bourgeois regime with another, even one ostensibly more democratic, when there is a chance for true revolution. While Galagan showed some reserved interest in the proposal, Fedenko and Livytskyi were plainly befuddled. The latter recalled 'previous agreements with the URDP and the risks of German intervention', while the former focused on the 'inadequate material conditions and lack of political consciousness among the masses', stating that revolutionary attempts at this point might doom the entire endeavour, even this close to victory.\n\nThe plan was ultimately rejected, with this episode signifying the final division among the former exiles. Will the USDRP and the RDS be able to reach a reconciliation in a new political climate or will they remain in complete opposition to one another – only time will tell."
 ukraine_republican.193.a: "An old rift between the reformists and the revolutionaries."

 ukraine_republican.194.t: "The URDP at Crossroads"
 ukraine_republican.194.d: "The annual URDP party conference will be held three months from now, and, undoubtedly, a significant part of it will be dedicated to the composition of the party's leadership. The underwhelming performance during the last elections raised doubts among the membership about the current direction of the URDP, so, unsurprisingly, the party's right faction seems to be gaining traction. Volodymyr Dolenko, its leader, has levied criticism against the party's left and centre, remarking that they are unable to 'keep the socialists in the Zbory in check' and cannot provide adequate leadership for the party as a whole.\n\nIt's therefore rather unsurprising that the URDP's right faction is supporting Dolenko's bid for the URDP secretary of the central committee, which is currently held by Viacheslav Prokopovych. Prokopovych belongs to the party centre, which has emphazised good relations with us in the past and will likely continue to do so. It would undoubtedly be destructive for our relations with the URDP if Dolenko takes his position.\n\nSome in the USDRP, namely Andrii Livytskyi, have proposed potential countermeasures: should the URDP turn further to the right and become a thorn in our side, the USDRP should turn to greater measures to secure its position. Transferring more power to the executive, through the establishment of a presidential office, may be our ticket to defy rightist intransigence."

 ukraine_republican.195.d: "Volodymyr Dolenko's gamble has paid off, as he now assumes the position of the URDP Secretary of the Central Committee. Upon his ascension, he promised to take the party in a more "rational direction", promising that the URDP would not become a satellite of its senior coalition partner.\n\nThe effects of this will certainly be felt in time. However, we have an ace up our sleeve, and would be wise to use it."

 ukraine_republican.196.d: "Volodymyr Dolenko's gamble has failed. At the conclusion of the URDP party conference, the centre and left banded together and helped Viacheslav Prokopovych to keep his position as URDP Secretary of the Central Committee.\n\nIn practice this means that little will change in the relationship between the USDRP and URDP. For now, at least, that is a victory."
 ukraine_republican.196.a: "Good."

 ukraine_republican.197.t: "The Revenge of the Left"
 ukraine_republican.197.d: "Volodymyr Dolenko's gamble has failed — and in the most spectacular way. When faced with accusations from the URDP right faction of being too soft on socialism, Andrii Nikovskyi, leader of the left faction, skillfully defended himself. Managing to turn the tables, he countered by arguing that the URDP's right faction had little to no common causes with the rest of the party at all, and was only aiming to take over to fulfil their narrowminded interests.\n\nSo masterfully did Andrii Vasylovych crash the right faction's momentum that something unexpected happened. Despite initial expectations of Prokopovych retaining his seat, it was Nikovskyi who became the new Secretary of the Central Committee.\n\nThis is great news for us. Nikovskyi will no doubt be a more reliable junior partner than any of his predecessors, and we can expect our coalition to sail on smoothly for now."

 ukraine_republican.198.t: "Who Are You, Symon Petliura?"
 ukraine_republican.198.d: "His face is on a myriad of propaganda posters, his name is chanted by crowds and whispered in smoke filled rooms, he is lauded as the saviour of the Republic and denounced as a lucky opportunist, yet even attentive observers struggle to discern his exact agenda. Where does he stand? Surely, the clout and fame of such proportions are signs of a person with ambitions stretching farther than the mere People's Ministry of Military Affairs?\n\nSome seek answers in the distant past, especially in the uncertain and murky years of the early exile. There, one can find a story of conflicting views and egos, where amidst the first attempts at consolidation of the wavering exiled movement, Petliura's vision clashed with those of Vynnychenko, Shapoval and the like. They viewed the anti-Hetman cause as a form of social struggle, a resistance of downtrodden masses against the exploiters, while Petliura advocated for a more broad approach, urging to place the interests of the enslaved Ukrainian nation above class and partisan divisions.\n\nOthers look at later years, when Petliura, his circle of supporters diminished by the constant bickering, left the limelight of exiled politics and immersed himself in more practical organisational matters. There, one can't be certain either. Were his successes in the rooting out of Hetmanist agents among the exiles and planning of the revolt determined by his talents, or merely by the luck of picking competent and active associates, like Udovychenko, Tiutiunnyk or Chebotariv?\n\nThe revival of the Republic, in which Petliura undoubtedly played a significant role, added additional weight to the numerous questions surrounding him. One of them, however, retains its prominence. Was his retreat to the backstages of the political scene a temporary measure or a lifelong decision? Perhaps the overall direction of the party will provide an insight into the plans and expectations of the elusive rebels' leader."

 ukraine_republican.199.d: "It is becoming all too clear that the parliamentarian ideal has not worked out in the USDRP's favour as expected. With the right faction having taken over the URDP, the coalition between the two parties is beginning to fray, as the National Zbory is becoming a place of meaningless debate and no action.\n\nAndrii Livytskyi's proposal, that of the creation of a presidential office and thus empowering the executive branch, was now being seriously proposed among the USDRP. However, such a proposal required a constitutional amendment vote, and it was considered divisive even among the party.\n\nUltimately, when the vote was held in the National Zbory, the result ended up being more unanimous than expected. It was a surprise that the URDP's right faction, in particular, largely voted for the proposal; they probably believed that, come the next elections, this decision would backfire on the social democrats.\n\nAs of today, the title of "President of the Ukrainian People's Republic" has been established, and all of the powers that come with it."

After removing the more moderate elements from their government, the Union has consolidated full control and declared their allegiance to the Internationale, presenting yet another threat to the Reichspakt in the east."

Numerous candidates stood for the position,like Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Mykola Mikhnovskyi, and Volodymyr Dolenko. However, as expected, the only candidate who had a shot at winning was the current Chairman of the National Zbory: Isaak Mazepa.\n\nGven how far the USDRP has gone to lift the Ukrainian people out of poverty, distribute land fairly, establish workers' rights and more, it was expected that we have been given a second mandate.\n\nHowever, in no small part contributing to the result, Mazepa himself is also widely popular: at this point, he is likely only second to Petliura as the face of Ukrainian republicanism. He has never sought fame nor fortune, and has a reputation as someone who is quiet and modest in private, and a stalwart defender of republican ideals in public. Naturally, then, this outcome was never in doubt.\n\nAs the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic, Mazepa now wields an important power: the presidential veto. Unless overruled by a two thirds majority in the National Zbory, legislation can be vetoed by the President. It is unlikely that the rightists, at least for now, will be able to make an appropriate response."
 ukraine_republican.201.a: "Congratulations, Mr. President."

 ukraine_republican.202.t: "United in Struggle?"
 ukraine_republican.202.d: "Relations between the USDRP and the UPS-R were always complicated. Both parties pledged themselves to the cause of socialism and often cooperated, but difference in approaches and organisational quirks set them relatively apart – the USDRP always was a more centralised organisation, while the UPS-R, especially in its early years, often resembled a public movement rather than a disciplined party. The revolt and the early days of the Republic increased the distance between them, with one becoming a leading force of a government coalition, and another – a part of the opposition.\n\nStill, even with the relations between two parties strained, there are voices calling for increased cooperation. One of the most vocal supporters of a possible rapprochement is Mykola Galagan, who barely avoided expulsion from the USDRP over his unauthorised negotiations with the UPS-R during the early exile years. Even now, he, a member of the party's more notable circles, insists that the future of the Social Democrats is tied to that of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Drawing them away from the R-RB radicals, co-opting or allying the most receptive elements and building together a united socialist front – those should be key priorities for the party. Without the UPS-R's popularity, the RDS will be reduced to nothing more than a club of pseudo-Marxist dogmatists. Mykola Kovalevskyi, leader of the UPS-R moderate faction, is potentially too valuable an ally to simply ignore him.\n\nThese passionate appeals find both supporters and sceptics among wide USDRP membership. Some think that the UPS-R is too far gone, completely lost to the delusions of revolutionary councilism. Others are mindful of the potential repercussions for the alliance with the URDP. Still, even sceptics tend to agree that limited cooperation might bear its fruits."

Today, one of these efforts became manifest in the so-called Kyiv Conference, where delegates from social democratic parties in the region, including the USDRP, Belarusian BSDP, Lithuanian LSDP and the Georgian SSDP have gathered to discuss the future of social democracy.\n\nA number of issues were brought up as our ideological brethren shared their theoretical works, the practical matters of governance, and more. The USDRP delegate, Panas Fedenko, took to the podium to emphasise the similarities the delegates' home countries had: all were formerly part of the Russian Empire and had to struggle for national and social liberation. While the former had largely been achieved, the struggle for social liberation continues on.\n\nFedenko's speech then became more bold. He highlighted the fact that the greatest obstacle to social progress was not from within but from without: it was necessary to limit the destructive influence of the German capitalist class and preserve the sovereignty of the Eastern European nations. The presence of a SPD observer at the conference did not derail Fedenko's attempts to paint Germany as an oppressor of nations.\n\nStill, his words became more controversial than what was expected. Some delegates, like the BDSP member Jan Sierada, questioned the need for such aggressive rhetoric towards their German allies. Despite all their similarities, one fact remains: the USDRP had to come to power in Ukraine through violent struggle against the Hetman, one that our foreign social democratic brethren never faced. It is that struggle, or the lack of it, that has largely informed the delegates' viewpoints."

Instead, as USDRP delegate Panas Fedenko spoke about, it was necessary to ensure that the German social democratic programme was upheld as a model for Eastern Europe to follow.\n\nSome seemed more joyed at the presence of a SPD government in Berlin than others, however. A few, such as BSDP delegate Jan Sierada, gave off the impression that Germany would finally have rational diplomats who would negotiate on equal terms with its Eastern European allies. Fedenko, however, despite admiration for the SPD and acknowledging the USDRP's ideological heritage coming from it, remained sceptical."

 ukraine_republican.205.d: "Either because of the overall political climate in the party, imbued with enthusiasm and eagerness, or because of a more personal change of heart, it seems that the Chief Otaman returns to political life. Surrounded by veteran true believers from the party, like Mykola Galagan and Ivan Romanchenko, he does so in, perhaps, an unexpected role – as a public face and a champion of the party's radical reformist programme. Once again he turns to the pen, with his articles frequenting the pages of ‘Robitnycha Hazeta', and once again he turns to the people, with his speeches rallying the crowds of his followers.\n\nObservers debate how much of this is sincere and how much is caused by cold calculations, but one thing can't be denied – Petliura effectively converts his own broad popularity into the support for the USDRP."
 ukraine_republican.205.d2: "It seems that Petliura's alleged promise to keep his distance from public politics holds true. With the party struggling to keep the balance between its own agenda and the expectations of the coalition partners, Symon Vasylovych chose to keep his political presence subdued. Instead he fully immersed himself in the matters of the People's Ministry of Military Affairs. With his trusted associates, like generals Udovychenko, Salskyi and Bezruchko, at his side, his focus remains on upholding and raising the Ukrainian defensive capacity.\n\nHis status and fame certainly help: sometimes one phone call from the People's Minister is enough to overcome a large bureaucratic hurdle, clear up delays with the defence contract or stop a months long dispute between some ministry's department and the General Staff."
 ukraine_republican.205.d3: "The long predicted return of the Chief Otaman to political life didn't surprise many. With the party embroiled in internal disagreements, Petlura decided to somewhat distance his image from the partisan squabbling. Advised by the People's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrii Livytskyi, and a high-ranking functionary in the Ministry of Communications, Ilarion Kosenko, Symon Vasyliovych prefers to portray himself as a patriot who stands above narrow party interests. In this role he often serves as a mediator between the USDRP and the URDP, pushing for compromise and cooperation instead of immature maximalism.\n\nThis paternal attitude surely proves to be popular among the masses tired of instability and uncertainty. Even some among a more conservative and right-wing audience, usually supporting the likes of the UNP, are starting to switch their sympathies towards the Chief Otaman."

 ukraine_republican.206.d: "If we intend to transform the USDRP into a truly mass labour party, we can't overlook its position among the peasants and rural workers. Ukraine is still a predominantly agrarian country, so it's paramount to court the sympathies of the countryside. The revival of 'Selianska Spilka', a peasantry focused trade union network, mainly functioning under the patronage of the UPS-R, gives us an opportunity to expand our rural presence.\n\nThere are, however, debates regarding the exact approach. A more proactive one would imply official state support for the trade union, an aggressive propaganda campaign targeting local union branches, and an attempt to court non-UPS-R members of the Spilka central committee. While promising, this tactic will undoubtedly greatly irritate the UPS-R, with which we already have a complicated relationship.\n\nA more restrained approach would be limited to the government support for Spilka without attempting to infiltrate and co-opt its administrative bodies. The results would be admittedly smaller, but perhaps better relations with the UPS-R would compensate for it."

 ukraine_republican.207.d: "Despite whispers of a potential change in course, the UPS-R's radical leadership, concentrated around Nykyfir Hryhoriiv and Pavlo Khrystiuk, has held on.\n\nWhile it may have been expected that their electoral defeat a year ago would have led for the Socialist-Revolutionaries to reconsider their platform, at the latest party conference such notions were not brought up. The idea of a reapproachment with the Social Democrats were also dismissed due to the apparent "slowness and inefficiency of the land reform".\n\nWith this development, the UPS-R's moderate faction, centred around Mykola Kovalevskyi, continues to be somewhat marginalised. It is unlikely that it will gain significant prominence anytime soon, either, barring unforeseen circumstances."
 ukraine_republican.207.a: "So be it."

 ukraine_republican.208.t: "Clash of the Socialist-Revolutionaries"
 ukraine_republican.208.d: "A rift is starting to grow in the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries.\n\nMany have expected such a rift to come: left out of the government after the party's electoral defeat, combined with the relatively quick deradicalisation of the peasantry after successful land reform, the party seemed destined for a change in direction. That is not to mention recent events highlighting how insufferable German meddling has been to an even less radical government, and Russian rearmament stifling many of the more idealistic proposals in the National Zbory.\n\nAt the last UPS-R party conference, the more pragmatic faction of the party, concentrated around Mykola Kovalevskyi, banded together to force what was seen as a necessary change in the party direction. A vote was held to oust the current leader, Nykyfir Hryhoriiv. In the end, Hryhoriiv managed to keep his position, but the vote was remarkably close. For the first time in a while, it seems like the UPS-R's radical faction may not be able to adapt to the current political conditions in Ukraine.\n\nThe slight shift rightwards has certainly complicated relations between the UPS-R and the R-RB, but for us it represents a potential opportunity. Should they see it as beneficial one day, perhaps the UPS-R moderates will choose to consolidate with the Social Democrats instead, abandoning narrow minded sectarianism in favour of a broad democratic front."

 ukraine_republican.209.t: "Limiting the Damage"
 ukraine_republican.209.d: "Recent political developments have proven to be rather detrimental to our relationships with the UPS-R. As this party is unlikely to become significantly less popular in the future, it is bound to retain its considerable presence and influence in the Zbory – the fact we should keep in mind. As such, both short and long-term strategy for the engagement with the UPS-R is needed.\n\nOne of more radical proposals meant to limit the potential disruption of the parliamentarian process is to change the makeup of the Council of Senior Representatives. This body, composed of a single representative (usually a faction leader) of each party in the Zbory occupying more than a certain amount of seats, is tasked with more than simple administrative duties. Its assent is required during the government formation process, and it may propose legislative initiatives independently from other deputies. Right now, both the ruling coalition (the USDRP and the URDP) and the left-wing opposition (the UPS-R and the R-RB) hold an equal number of seats in the Council. So far we have avoided lengthy deadlocks in its work, but with the UPS-R remaining estranged from us, there is no guarantee that reasonable cooperation will continue. As such, a bold proposal was made – to assign to each party a number of representatives proportional to the number of seats occupied by the party in the Zbory. This will considerably strengthen the position of the ruling parties and mitigate the potential risks of the opposition becoming actively disruptive.\n\nWe predict that the reaction of the URDP deputies to the proposal will be mixed – they will support it with votes, seeing clear benefits for their party, but will do so rather hesitantly, as the majority of the URDP prefer not to mess with the parliamentarian workings."

 ukraine_republican.210.t: "Of Populists and Landowners"
 ukraine_republican.210.d: "Nature abhors a vacuum. So soon after the dust of the rebellion's conclusion was settled, the right flank of Ukrainian legal politics started to reorganise itself. Despite the new party names, the faces of the people involved are usually quite familiar. All of them claim to welcome the new republican order, while simultaneously rebuking all allegations of potential Hetmanist sympathies and feigning shock with the regards to the “uncovered crimes of the previous administration”. A distasteful hypocrisy, but one that we are obliged to tolerate for a while.\n\nThe biggest new outfit is called Ukrainian People's Party (UNP) and is headed by a former member of the UDKhP, Mykola Mikhnovskyi. He is lucky to a degree: being neither ideologically-minded Hetmanite, nor a nonpartisan servant of the old order, Mikhnovskyi is well positioned to court the centre-right and rightist electorate under new political circumstances. His populist stance and bombastic personality are sure to attract new followers in coming years.\n\nSomewhat smaller, but no less bothersome, is a new addition to the political landscape, branded as National Agrarian Party (NKhP). Unlike the UNP, it didn't contest the general elections, although there are reports that more and more independent deputies of local councils started pledging their allegiance to it. It's rumoured to revolve largely around two personalities: a former member of the now defunct VSZV, Vasyl Kochubei, and the infamous Serhii Shemet, who abandoned the UDKhP almost immediately after joining it in the wake of the demise of the USKhD. With leadership like this, it's safe to assume that the party will serve merely as a political front for the remaining large landowners, trying to adapt to a new political order."

For now their anti-socialist speeches, publications and overall poor relationship with us is not a big deal - as long as they remain marginalised within the party at large, that is."

The underground is teeming with extremists and fanatics who would stop at nothing in order to sow chaos and disorder. The surviving forces of reaction, shielded now by clever exploitation of our own laws, plot the demise of the Republic behind the closed doors. Our civil service and security apparatus are deeply infiltrated by German agents and informants. The scale is so alarming that it can only be explained by the miracle (or the sluggishness of the German bureaucracy) that Berlin wasn't able to react to our rebellion in time. Russian subversive influence can't be brushed aside either – Moscow still hasn't reconciled itself with the loss of the empire.\n\nTo counter all these threats, we must act with determination. A special counterintelligence body with extensive powers and authority will be created in order to combat the most severe menaces, ones that endanger the very core of our state. Dubbed 'Kosh of the Defence of the Republican Order', it will be subordinated directly to the highest echelons of the People's Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe question of the initial funding remains. We can confine it solely within the limits of the Ministry of Interior budget, or we can put to the Zbory's vote a request for additional funds."

The highest position will be given to one of Petliura's associates – Mykola Chebotariv. Largely responsible for the intelligence efforts for the People's Republic exiles, he is a suitable choice, but one that many still find quite controversial.\n\nAs a ruthless, independent-minded and outspoken person, he managed to garner a great deal of animosity from various politicians. More than once his critical demeanour brought him into conflicts with influential exiles. Some claim that his ruthlessness knows little bounds, and he tends to be as cruel to his own subordinates as to enemies and opponents. A grimly ironic nickname was given to him by detractors – 'Petliura's Vartovyi'. While on the surface it merely underlines his security duties, it also clearly references those who served under the Derzhavna Varta, or the State Guard – an infamous police department of the Hetmanate.\n\nDespite the reputation, his professionalism and dedication to the Republican cause are unquestionable. As an USDRP veteran, he enjoys the certain trust of the party brass. Still, some argue that it would be prudent to keep an eye on him – just in case."

As far as he had guessed, this meeting was going to be more personal.\n\nIt turns out that Livytskyi certainly made it so, but in a rather indirect way. He reminisced about how far the USDRP had come and that it would continue to be a prevalent force in Ukrainian politics for a very long time, as long as the party's “current course” would remain.\n\nIntrigued by this, when Mazepa asked for clarification on what this current course actually meant, the rather casual conversation turned into more of a lecture; Livytskyi gloated that the party had grown past the unrealistic goals so prevalent during the exile, and had properly adapted to the conditions of Ukraine as they are now. The USDRP had become a rational and responsible people's party, and that is what it should strive to be.\n\nMazepa was only bewildered by such statements: wasn't the belief in those “unrealistic goals” what led the party to new heights in the first place? But he could offer little rebuttal. The last few sessions of the National Zbory, the heavy-handedness of German influence, and all the more had proved Livytskyi's vision to be the prevailing one.\n\nPerhaps he was right.

 ukraine_republican.215.d: "A controversy is brewing in the highest circles of the security services. Several reports indicate that Mykola Chebotariv, in whom we placed so much trust, might have been interpreting the directives of the political leadership in a rather free manner. Intercepted communications imply that Chebotariv, contrary to his tasks, has been extensively – and secretly – cooperating with the German intelligence services, namely Abteilung IIIb. Further investigation revealed that this clandestine collaboration has led to an uncovering of several networks of Russian agents. A fine result, but one achieved at the cost of Germany tightening its grip over our internal affairs.\n\nWhen confronted, Chebotariv simply brushed aside concerns and accusations, stating that politicians would do better by not intervening with the work of specialists. Even this bold response, however, didn't thwart his supporters. They claim that Chebotariv's actions were determined by exactly the kind of flexibility and practicality to be expected from an experienced intelligence officer. Their opponents, meanwhile, insist that Chebotariv has violated clear directives given to him, and that the full subordination of security forces to the political leadership is paramount for any self-respecting state. Berlin's attempts to hinder Ukrainian sovereignty, both openly and secretly, remain a credible threat to the country's future, so that's why combatting German intelligence was among the crucial tasks of the Kosh of the Defence of the Republican Order. Chebotariv failed it, and thus ought to be replaced.\n\nThe main candidate is Ivan Lytvynenko, who served under Chebotariv. While somewhat less experienced than his former superior, he might prove to be a more reliable and predictable choice."

In this dangerous atmosphere all the more pressing is the matter of our security treaties with Germany.\n\nA debate is forming within the party and the security establishment: what role exactly should Germany play in the case of potential Russian invasion? A majority of the military establishment and diplomatic corps, mainly represented by the People's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrii Livytskyi, insist that all help is welcome: material support, shared intelligence, training and, most importantly, German armed formations ready to meet the Russian onslaught.\n\nThis point of view, however, is contested by some among the party's leadership. Their scepticism is concerned with the German army units being present on Ukrainian soil. While indirect means of support are to be welcomed, the direct participation of foreign armed forces might pose unnecessary risks for the Republic. A military contingent might provide Berlin with suitable means to limit our sovereignty even further. One should never forget 1918, when, with the silent approval of the German military, the People's Republic was destroyed and tyranny and reaction came to dominate over Ukraine. Thus, the presence of foreign armed forces should be kept to a minimum, ideally limited to training personnel and advisors.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of German troops, a proposal to reform the People's Militia has suggested. Instead of being a police force, it should be tasked with the military training and organising of able-bodied men in the peacetime. This way, militia squads will be able to serve various purposes: from providing trained reservists for the regular army to the behind-the-lines guerrilla activities.\n\nStill, with Berlin's grip over our country remaining tight, this debate will most likely end up as purely symbolic one.

Thankfully, the revival of the People's Republic put an end to this. With the restrictions regarding the freedom of labour association lifted, the Ukrainian working masses finally got the means to properly organise themselves.\n\nFor us this vast organisational process offered an opportunity to draw the proletariat away from the dangerous radicals and establish the USDRP as a preeminent workers' party. While a lot of work still remains, our efforts are already starting to bear fruit.\n\nToday marks the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Workers' Union (USRS) – an USDRP aligned trade-union federation. It will ensure that the party never loses contact with the grassroots labour movement and its concerns, all the while developing the political consciousness and organisational skills of the working class.

Mr. Skoropadskyi believed Mr. Sulkevych enjoyed the benefits of decades-long patronage from Kyiv and had to show his gratitude.\n\nSuleiman disagreed. Crimea is a special region with a unique demography and a particular leadership. He had to make sure chaos from the mainland did not spread far into the peninsula. And in that, he succeeded: Crimea remained relatively stable all throughout the insurrection. Further, he reasoned that it was too late for the Hetman to defeat the revolutionaries anyway.\n\nSulkevych's relative neutrality did not save him from the political developments that occurred on the mainland as the revolutionaries strolled into Kyiv's government quarters, but they did allow him to escape any real consequences as a leading anti-socialist on the peninsula.

The conservative bloc in the Regional Diet has gone the way of the Hetman, while the liberal and newly re-legalised socialist forces have begun competing for the place left by the former. Further complicating matters is the activity of the Crimean Tatar National groups and various other minority alliances. But as election season winds up, so does the campaigning.\n\nOn one hand, there is the Milliy Firqa: the premier Crimean Tatar national force, representing Crimean Tatars of a non-Russified extraction (which makes up the vast majority of said peoples). Ideologically, Milliy Firqa is very diverse, ranging from moderate liberalism to revolutionary socialism, and the strength of each faction is determined by the circumstances in Kyiv.\n\nThen there are the mainstream political parties: the Crimean Radical Democratic Party, Crimean Social Democratic Workers' Party and Crimean Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Although officially the parties are “nationally-blind”, in practice they can be seen as a representation of the interests of the ethnic Russians and Russophones (Russified Ukrainians, Jews and Tatars, among others) on the peninsula. Ideologically, they share the tenants of their mainland namesakes; and although the names are shared, the Crimean parties themselves are independent, tied to their northern associates through political unions.\n\nFinally, there is the Bloc of National Minorities, which represents other peoples living on the peninsula: non-Russified Ukrainians, Jews, and Armenians, among others.

The party press especially is crucial for our tasks, as it allows us to not only keep contact with the broad swathes of the Ukrainian people, but also to influence them and to generally set the tone for the political discussion in the country.\n\nWith this in mind, the editorial direction of our newspaper, 'Robitnycha Hazeta', must be decided. Since the exile it was largely guided by Mykola Porsh, a party veteran and one of its leading theorists. His influence ensured that the newspaper did not merely inform the reader, but also provided a deep insight into the ongoing discussions regarding resonant political matters and general debates surrounding the cause of democratic socialism in Europe and the world.\n\nNow, with our party once again engaged in Ukrainian politics proper, the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Ivan Romanchenko, is advocating for a change in course. The focus on theoretical matters, combined with an overall dry tone, were useful to keep engaged politicised exiles and die-hard party supporters remaining underground in Hetmanist Ukraine. In the current circumstances, however, the newspaper needs to attract a far more broad audience, largely consisting of the poorly educated workers. To improve their understanding, raise their class consciousness and guide them towards a new, socialist Ukraine, the party first needs to get and keep their attention. That's why the newspaper's language and tone should become more inspiring and less sophisticated – at least for the duration of the first formative years of our rule.\n\nWhile this suggestion seems rational, a certain hesitancy exists among the party's leadership.

Vasyl Kochubei, one of the leaders of the NKhP, is on trial after evidence was unearthed that he used his extensive wealth and contacts in order to further his own political influence and that of the now-defunct VSZV. He continued to do so, albeit on a smaller scale, even after the Republican restoration, with his new party slowly infiltrating local land councils. Now, he has been caught red-handed.\n\nIt could be argued that Kochubei and his great landowner allies were the main power behind the Hetmanate: they had essentially ushered in Skoropadskyi's rise to power in 1918 and the regime was kept secure through connections to them. Thus, to say that this trial is particularly noteworthy would be an understatement.\n\nFor now it is the talk of the town, and as Kochubei's immense wealth has allowed him to hire a fantastic defence team to clear his name, it's likely the trial will continue for some time and remain in the public eye.\n\nThe main party organs and newspapers of the URDP, USDRP, UPS-R and others have naturally began commenting on this affair. While for the liberals and agrarian socialists the stance is obvious, we are stuck in the middle and party members have struggled to come to a consistent view. Is the trial of Vasyl Kochubei just an expected outcome of a system who actually punishes lawbreakers, or does it represent something greater: a decisive triumph of the Republican ideal over the tyranny of the big landowners and their reactionary backers?"

 ukraine_republican.222.t: "The Resistance of the Old Order"
 ukraine_republican.222.d: "A steady flow of troubling reports has been assailing the People's Ministry of Agriculture as of late. The land reform process seems to miss all the projected time tables in several regions of the country. In said regions, local land councils are embroiled in small-time bickering, the bureaucracy is sluggish and unresponsive, and courts are too slow to deal with the mounting backlog of land reform related disputes. All in all, an embarrassing situation for our administration.\n\nA further inquiry revealed that the affected regions share a certain trait. In all of them, a significant number of local formerly independent deputies (many of them occupying their seats since the Hetmanate) pledged their allegiance to the National Agrarian Party (NKhP). This fact explains a lot: through these deputies the NKhP slowly infiltrates local land councils, using their influence and all the possible legal loopholes in order to hamper the land redistribution. The courts are of little use in combating these efforts: many judges are simply too lenient when it comes to the prosecution of the wrongdoers with connections to the local grandees and the large landowners.\n\nOne possible solution is to subject the most notorious offenders associated with the NKhP to the scrutiny of the political departments of our security services. One must remember, however, that even if the investigations unearth something valuable, the final verdict would be decided by the same unreformed courts. The URDP, most likely, would voice concerns regarding potential abuses pertaining to these, allegedly, 'politically motivated' cases. Still, perhaps this kind of state attention would be enough to deter at least some opponents of the land reform."
 ukraine_republican.222.a: "We can wait out their futile resistance."
 ukraine_republican.222.b: "Perhaps a more proactive approach is warranted."

 ukraine_republican.223.t: "The Reorganisation of the Army Inspectorate"
 ukraine_republican.223.d: "One of the key priorities of our government is to ensure that the army remains obedient, loyal and dedicated to the Republican cause under any circumstances. We believe that in order to achieve this goal we can't simply leave the armed forces to their own devices. In 1918, the army mostly simply watched as Hetman dismantled the People's Republic and the hesitancy of the officers was in no small part responsible for our inability to launch the anti-Hetman revolt later that year. As such, raising political consciousness and ideological awareness in the military remains paramount. To quote Chief Otaman Petliura: 'To turn our soldier into a fanatic of Ukrainian statehood, but a conscious, educated one – this is what we should be aiming for.'\n\nThus, the political leadership of the country needs a constant presence in the armed forces, a structure that will serve as a liaison between the military and the wider state, able to relay the necessary directives and instructions from the government to the officers. A reformed Army Inspectorate will serve us in this capacity, no longer being merely a body responsible for the material audit, but instead being granted with authority to conduct a wide organisational supervision.\n\nWe would prefer the Inspectorate being headed by a fellow former exile, like general Udovychenko, but this decision might provoke unnecessary resistance from the top military brass, many of whom served under the Hetmanate. Perhaps the appointment of someone like general Chyzhevskyi, known for his sympathies to the URDP, would be perceived as a less controversial choice."
 ukraine_republican.223.a: "No harm in ruffling some feathers, appoint Udovychenko."
 ukraine_republican.223.b: "Chyzhevskyi seems like a reasonable choice."

 ukraine_republican.225.t: "In the Service of Progress"
 ukraine_republican.225.d: "To elevate the Ukrainian people, properly educate our population, give the masses means for self-improvement, and a proper set of social values and ideals to follow, we need not only to expand the educational network, but also to prepare a large body of well-trained and motivated pedagogical personnel.\n\nOne of the milestones of our work in this direction will be the reorganisation of the Kyiv Pedagogical Institute. While it wasn't fully neglected under the Hetmanate, in no small part thanks to the efforts of the URDP, its state isn't particularly adequate to our goals. By increasing the funding, expanding its facilities, changing the curriculum, we hope to transform it into the centre of learning unrivalled in all of Ukraine.\n\nTo better reflect its new and crucial role, it will be renamed to the 'M. Drahomanov High Pedagogical Institute'. Mykhailo Drahomanov was among the key intellectual figures of Ukrainian national movement and one of the main contributors to Ukrainian socialist thought. To be named after him is fitting for the institution which will help us to guide Ukraine to a bright, fair and just future."

 ukraine_republican.227.d: "To ensure a bright future for Ukraine we should put serious efforts into guiding and assisting those who will build this future – the youth of our country. They truly contain an untapped potential which we better put to a good use in the service of the socialist cause. Raised in independent Ukraine, not forced to suffer through the trials of the national struggle, the younger generation is often more receptive to the ideals of social liberation. Their fiery determination and adherence to principles will serve well in reminding us about the dangers of complacency and false allure of excessive compromises.\n\nOur party enjoyed certain support among the students during the exile and after the return we can do even more to attract them. There is, however, the question of our exact approach. We could focus on swaying various student groups and societies, uniting them under a decentralised umbrella organisation loosely affiliated with the USDRP. This will ensure the broadest possible appeal, allowing our word to travel far and wide, and significantly raising our popularity. On the other hand, we could focus on establishing a more centralised youth wing of our party, fully integrated into its structures and subordinated to its leadership. This way it would be possible to use it as a source of motivated and trained cadres for the party."

 ukraine_republican.228.t: "Concerns of the Old Guard"
 ukraine_republican.228.d: "Our decision to follow the URDP's suggestion regarding further centralisation of the People's Militia has caused some uneasiness among the party. Particularly apprehensive are people from the orbit of Mykola Porsh and Dmytro Antonovych, old USDRP veterans, still commanding a lot of respect despite rare involvement in the day-to-day affairs of the party.\n\nCentralisation of the security apparatus seems to them as excessive and unreasonable, a measure which contradicts the principles of the party. A significant portion of security matters should lie in the hands of local authorities, lest they feel themselves threatened by the central government. In addition, they are far better aware about the exact situation on the ground, so delegating to them an ability to organise their own security measures is a rational choice, not merely an ideological one. Was this concession to the URDP really based on a sound judgement?\n\nPerhaps it would be good to remind that the party, as a part of the coalition, can't pursue fully independent policies, and, sometimes, reliance on the experience of others in the matters of practical governance can be useful. Or perhaps we should simply ignore the concerns – these grumblings won't last long."

 ukraine_republican.229.d: "As the devastating war finally draws to a close, the people are eager to return to their peaceful way of life. This conflict caused an overwhelming amount of suffering for many people - refugees, wounded veterans, orphans and many others who have lost much to this war. Our nation must begin the process of rebuilding, but first, it is time to hold those elections that were postponed in the wake of the conflict.\n\nNaturally, the main topic of these elections will be reconstruction. All parties have unveiled their plans for ambitious post-war welfare programmes and other campaigns to heal the wounds of the war. The Radicals are banking on securing a majority by promising to create a prosperous and booming economy, which will, in turn, help those afflicted by the war get back on their feet. Meanwhile, the Workers' Party is drumming up support by embracing pacifist rhetoric, promising to never let Ukraine fall victim to a tragedy like this ever again. However, the greatest promises of change are once again coming from the UPS-R and the R-RB. With Ukraine's natural threat neutralised, they claim that now is the ideal time for radical social and political change.\n\nThe electoral situation has been made even more unpredictable by an up and coming contender - The Ukrainian People's Party (UNP). While the Ukrainian right has still not fully rebounded from the defeat of the Hetman, and the People's Republic has proved itself beyond all doubt, the political landscape has been changing in their favour. The war stoked patriotic fervour so desperately called for by the UNP, and under the popular leadership of Mikhnovskyi, the party is attracting voters more than ever before.\n\nNow, on the [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], millions of voters return to the polls once again to choose their government. To many, it feels like a lifetime has passed since the 1937 elections, and, indeed, the people have been waiting for a long time to have their voices heard again.

 ukraine_republican.230.d: "It is certainly no secret that Yevhen Arkhypenko, one of the leaders of the URDP's right wing, has a younger brother, Oleksandr.\n\nIt is certainly even less of a secret that Oleksandr is a world-famous avant-garde artist, with a particular focus on cubism. Splitting his time three-way between Paris, New York and Kyiv, Oleksandr has found major international success through his artistry. He is considered to be either the first or second (after Pablo Picasso) cubist sculptor in the world of art.\n\nSo it is no wonder that Yevhen has decided to ask Oleksandr about doing a mass art exhibition throughout Ukraine's urban centres, with full government support and sponsorship. For his part, Oleksandr noted his clear interest and said he would be waiting for the “go-ahead”.\n\nThis is where things got dicey, though. When Yevhen proposed the initiative at the URDP Party Conference, there was little immediate opposition. Nevertheless, the point of discussion moved towards the marketing campaign. After all, what's the point in hosting such a major event if all it'll attract will be art school students and underground writers of questionable quality?"
 ukraine_republican.230.a: "...what is cubism?"

 ukraine_republican.231.t: "Do We Hate Cubes? (On Matters of Political Consciousness and Modern Art)"
 ukraine_republican.231.d: "The party's right-wing, to which Yevhen himself belongs to, voiced a number of concerns on the contents of the exhibition and had its leading members, Volodymyr Dolenko and Pylyp Pylypchuk, propose to limit the contents to more 'realistic' art pieces. As they reasoned, the last thing anyone would want is to scare off visitors from Ukraine's 'rural sea' with strange designs and compositions. Some, they concluded, may see certain pieces as completely bizarre and drop support for our government for wasting their time and taxpayer money.\n\nIn contrast, the party's left-wing, articulated its opposite viewpoint through a major speech by Andrii Nikovskyi (himself a major literary and art critic). In it, Nikovskyi argued that it would be much more engrossing for the peoples to see 'all expressions of art', no matter how they may look. The stimulation of conversation is a good goal to work towards, he noted. Further complicating matters was the intervention of Mr. Serhii Yefremov, a former heavyweight of Ukrainian politics. While technically retired from all major political functions, Mr. Yefremov sometimes interferes in matters of cultural politics.\n\nSo in the end, the deciding factor fell on the centrist majority in the URDP. Dominated by diplomats and more amorphous polemicists, such topics aren't usually on the faction's main agenda, in any case. Nevertheless, they have to choose. Taking a stand, Oleksandr Shulhyn and Viacheslav Prokopovych say that they..."

As such, it is instrumental that in addition to the ‘hard sciences', social disciplines and the humanities will get their fair share in the limelight. For more details read on. Signed: Chykalenko, Slabchenko, Hermaize, Bochkovskyi.”\n\nThe proposition noted that the institute is a leader in “imbuing republican and socialist values” and such an expansion will allow the state to raise a new generation of dedicated and passionate citizens. At the same time, it understood that funding is limited and that the institute's particular focus could only be provided to one discipline. Additionally, by sheer and utter coincidence, the proposal came from our fellow high-ranking party members."

 ukraine_republican.233.d: "The first subject was archeology, proposed by Levko Chykalenko, son of the late civic leader and patron of culture Yevhen Chykalenko and student of the late leading archeologist Fedir (Khvedir) Vovk. Perhaps the most “non-partisan” of all proposed subjects, Chykalenko's research focuses on ancient cultures that lived in Ukraine, like the Trypillian. This bid wouldn't find much disapproval among the opposition, but probably couldn't be treated as an element of “socialist research”, either.\n\nThe second subject was history, proposed by Yosyp Hermaize and Mykhailo Slabchenko, both leading experts in their research fields. A fairly “partisan” subject, Slabchenko and Hermaize's studies focused on Ukrainian state-building and revolutionary processes respectively. This type of research would probably show certain elements of socialist bias and may not be too appreciated by our political opposition, but would still be on manageable grounds. History is, after all, in the past.\n\nThe final subject was sociology, proposed by Olgerd-Ipolyt Bochkovskyi, a true master of his craft. Specialising in the study of nationalism, as well as national politics and relations, Bochkovskyi articulated his research through various polemics describing policies of imperial governance on conquered territories and the manner in which various peoples achieve national liberation. This submission would probably find the most disapproval amongst the opposition, given the possible utilisation of Bochkovskyi's research in crafting our own policies, so we might have to tread lightly here."

In the People's Republic, they formed the URDP's right wing, championing the interests of smallholding farmers and small businesses - those who push the nation forward with their initiative.\n\nOnce outsiders to the party, it is these people who now lead it into the future. With Volodymyr Dolenko now chairing the party and the government, the URDP has been able to shed itself of the influence of socialist radicals and set the People's Republic on the path of harmony and prosperity. In their place, a new coalition has been found in the UNP and liberal-minded independents - people who understand the principles of good government. Together, they seek to protect the gains that Ukraine has made; those of a people who have triumphed over both Russian imperialism, and the destructive influence of communism and syndicalism.\n\nIndeed, the Ukrainian people have showed great maturity in overcoming these challenges - especially her industrious and free-minded peasants, who found in their generations of wisdom the strength to reject the siren song of collectivism. They have been rewarded with a thorough land reform, laying the foundation for a new nation led by these hard-working patriots. Under their leadership, Ukraine has a bountiful future ahead for all willing to work for it.\n\nNot all within the URDP enjoy this state of affairs. The party's left still views the UNP as a party of Hetmanist stooges, and whether they will remain in a government dominated by the right remains to be seen.

But under the Hetmanate, they kept its flame alive: the URDP became a refuge for the malcontent, a home for those who dared to dream of a freer, fairer, and more equal world.\n\nThe party, and Ukraine, now belongs to them. With Andrii Nikovskyi's rise to the top of politics, his government now pursues progressive causes with renewed vigour. Together with their fellow republicans in the USDRP, the Radical Democrats dare to take Ukraine into a new age: one where the state supports those with the ingenuity to realise their dreams, and protects those fallen on hard times. At long last, all those left behind by the Hetmanate will be given the land, bread, and freedom once promised to them, regardless of their sex, culture, or faith.\n\nFor these reformers, it feels like living through 1917 once more: a time when their country was finally free, its leaders prepared to end the injustices of the world, and anything was possible. But this time, all its foes have been slain. No more will Moscow, Bolsheviks, or Hetmanists rob the people of their freedom, and no more will its people be pitted against each other. Everyone who built free Ukraine will have a place in it - the People's Republic will make sure of that.\n\nSome still do not see it that way. The party's right still chafes at the thoughts of progressive culture and the continued abetting of socialism, even now.

Some dared to say that this would be their undoing - that the broad church would be toppled by the realities of government.\n\nAnd yet, in its diversity, the party found strength. Where some saw disunity, those leading the party saw opportunity - and the URDP's elder statesmen did not bend to the demands of its wings, as some believed they would. Instead, through diplomacy and acumen, they reunited the party, silenced the competition between the wings, and put them in the service of the whole. No longer is there resentment between left and right, but rather a sense of respect and camaraderie. They find solace in the knowledge that whatever they do, it is in the service of the people - the worker, the peasant, and the entrepreneur alike.\n\nAnd now, nothing seems impossible. The Radical Democrats now sit as the undisputed hegemon of centrist politics. Whether it's renewing the progressive alliance with the USDRP, or forging a new one for national prosperity with the UNP, the party can command the People's Republic in any direction they see fit. The URDP has attained a state long-envied by many a liberal: that of a natural party of government, whose support transcends the lines of class and petty dogma.

Has unity come at the cost of ideals? Is a party without ideals truly a progressive one? One day, these questions may determine the future of Ukraine - but for now, they can do little to trouble the party that has everything."

The revolutionary spirit has died down, and who knows when it will ever rise again?"

 ukraine_republican.241.t: "Urban Political Desegregation"
 ukraine_republican.241.d: "The landscape of Ukraine's urban cities for the past 15 years has seen tremendous change. German investment and the previous Hetman's limited capital ended up in places such as the dockyards of Odesa, military industrial parks of Kharkiv, and the rolling stock production of Kyiv.\n\nYet, when the workers spent large parts of the day laboring away, the other part was spent tending to their families and private/social “housing”. These suburban areas, by contrast, had seen very little change, with rent priced at high figures yet providing very unreliable electricity and water supply. The limited public transportation that did exist rarely passed through these neighbourhoods, all the while the richer, inner urban parts of these cities experienced far fewer problems.\n\nWith urban segregation leading to radicalisation, policing units would begin to retreat from these areas to ease their limited budgets, leading to an increase in violent gang activity. Further, they would only intervene if bribed by those who could afford it, or if the situation in these depressed areas were deemed serious enough to conduct police raids.\n\nThe issue was increasingly amplified and taken note of by the ruling [UKR.GetRulingParty] - these large and depressed urban regions and townsfolk have been observed to be hotbeds of Borotbyst and RDS support, who had recently exercised their will to protest against their woeful conditions.\n\nWith reasons aplenty and almost 3 years of work, recent statistics have finally shown hope. Public and private services have been extended across these previously depressed regions, suburban infrastructure finally repaired or replaced, and proper law and order finally established. With it came the downfall of the final major stronghold of far-left support in Yuzivka.\n\nFor many years, the same slogan had been repeated time and time again by the opposition in these places: that the ruin that had been set in by Skoropadskyi would only be continued by the [UKR.GetRulingParty] government, and that one had to embrace radical and revolutionary methods for any hope of salvation."

 ukraine_republican.252.d: "Nothing seemed to imply any disturbance when Panas Fedenko was announced as a speaker at the Kyiv National University. Mr. Fedenko may lead the government of our nascent republic, but an air of civility should be expected in our society\n\nPanas' planned lecture at the university was going to be on the dangers of extreme nationalism, particularly the 'integral' kind. While not explicitly mentioned in any of the promotional materials for the lecture, it was widely understood to be a critique of the so-called League of Ukrainian Nationalists (LUN).\n\nUpon arriving, Mr. Fedenko took to the stand and was immediately interrupted by a uniformed squad with chants of 'Shame!' and 'Muscovite agents out!'. The provocateurs were quickly subdued and nobody was hurt. Still, it was clear these individuals were members or associates of the LUN.\n\nAfter some investigation, it was determined that this particular unit of LUNists was tied to a certain Panteleimon Sak, a young principal at one of Kyiv's top schools. Although not charged with anything, Mr. Sak was fired from his position immediately. It appears Panteleimon migrated over to the LUN sometime quite recently—further review has found that the young educator has drifted around various movements in the past decade, both socialist and Hetmanist in outlook.\n\nHe is certainly not the only one who has done so. For some, the republican restoration promised a renewal of the Ukrainian nation, one that would bring about the destruction of Russian cultural and political influence on Ukraine that was so pervasive in the Hetmanate. Yet, they have become disillusioned with what they see as the neglect of prioritising Ukraine's titular nationality and the placation of foreign elements. For now such debates are largely irrelevant, but in the event of war with Russia, it will surely become an issue of profound importance."

 ukraine_republican.253.d: "The Social Democrats have spent a long time in the shadows.

When they finally got their revenge, they swore that such a cruel fate would never befall them again. This time, the People's Republic would be forever, and they would lead it into the future. In a way, they got their wish.\n\nBut this fate was cruel in a different way. It happened slowly, below the notice of most. Its cause may have been anything: a failure to reconcile high ideals with practical government, a failure to consolidate the republican front, a failure to bring equitable growth to the peasants and the workers, or a failure to ward off the designs of Moscow and Berlin. But its effect was not clear until it was too late to stop; when all could be done was watch the Republic's most loyal lose their seats, scorned by the people they swore to protect. Ukraine has rejected its champions, who are now forced to watch as it moves on without them.\n\nIn their place, the Republic falls into the hands of a coalition of the right, where Radical Democrats join forces with the heirs of the Hetmanate to halt progress in its tracks - and with its mission failed, the party now faces a crisis not seen in its history. When the Republic died its first death, even in mourning all knew that hope had no choice to go on; that the fight must continue. But what does a party of the people do when the people reject them? A path back to power may yet remain, but can the party find it in them to walk it? And if they do, what would it cost them? Who will stand by the party in its darkest hour, rather than flee for the left or the right? The future holds many possibilities, but few of them are pleasant.\n\nA precious few years ago, the taste of the USDRP's greatest victory tasted sweet - but those who hoped to change things for the better found that victory can be a bitter thing. Where the party goes from here is anybody's guess, but few know if things will ever be the same again."

But as the campaigns went on, the malaise grew clear: the rallies in the factories and the fields no longer drew the energy they once did. Ukraine does not believe like it once has.\n\nAnd now, the party finds itself a junior partner in the government they helped build. The irony is lost on few - after reviving the People's Republic and leading it through its darkest hours, the people reward the party by deciding they can't be trusted to lead it. It is a bitter pill for many to swallow. But it could have been worse: some predicted more serious losses that never materialised, and so the USDRP remains in a place where it can defend the workers and guide Ukraine to the future. With luck, these results may prove a fluke, and a path back to leadership may yet appear. All that is needed is some reflection…and patience.\n\nThe Social Democrats waited almost 2 decades to see Ukraine's liberation, and two more for its second.

 ukraine_republican.255.t: "To Build a Better World"
 ukraine_republican.255.d: "Some forty years ago, a promise was made. A promise of a country free of empire and capital, of freedom for her workers from their clutches — a promise under which the USDRP built the People's Republic, and one they renewed at its grave. Even when other parties emerged claiming to represent the workers, the Social Democrats have remained their foremost champion.\n\nIt was at the hands of the workers that the Hetmanate fell, and it was with their hands that the People's Republic was built. Its foundation is everything that the Hetmanate scorned: equality, freedom, and respect for life and labour. And their tools were not that of the zealot that would destroy all they have gained, but those of discipline and reform. The workers of Ukraine understood that unceasing revolution was no path to freedom. They knew that, within the halls they had built, they could work towards an inclusive, democratic, humane socialism.\n\nAnd they know, as the USDRP does, that they cannot do it alone. As the workers joined hands to bring down the Hetman, the USDRP has joined hands with the UPS-R and the R-RB, putting their contentious past behind them to build a new coalition in the name of progress. And they do so without malice towards their now former partners in the URDP — simply a recognition that in a Ukraine no longer under the boot of Hetmans, Kaisers, or Tsars, there are too many things dividing them. In a way, it is a happy departure. That the parties no longer feel it necessary to remain together is, perhaps, the greatest proof that the Republic is finally safe.\n\nHow long things will remain happy is anyone's guess. The new coalition's success is not certain, and some doubt whether the rapprochement between the USRDP and the R-RB in particular will be built to last. Perhaps, as the memory of the Hetmanate fades, the spirit of socialist unity will go with it. But few have time to think of the future's uncertainty. The only thought of Ukraine's future to be had, is how it should be built."

 ukraine_republican.256.d: "Some forty years ago, a promise was made. A promise of a free people, with a free government, no longer bound by the chains of empire — and it was for this promise that the USDRP brought about the People's Republic, and it was for this promise that they returned it from the ashes. Since the idea became reality, the Social Democrats have styled themselves as the party of the Republic.\n\nAnd, more than any other, the man most associated with the Republic is the party's own Symon Petliura. The Chief Otaman has been there the whole way: he fought to win Ukraine its independence, he fought to defend it from White and Red alike, and he fought to keep its spirit alive in exile — and, when Ukraine needed him most, he fought once more to keep it from being reduced to a province of Russian chauvinists. In doing so, Petliura has gone down as one of Ukraine's greatest heroes, inspiring Ukrainians of all classes and parties to join with their brethren to come to her defence.\n\nAnd so it was that the USDRP have realised one of their oldest dreams: becoming a party for all Ukrainians. Where they were once derided as a band of rabble rousers and hopeless idealists, the Social Democrats have proved themselves a party of national unity and responsible government, that people of all classes can have trust in. Together with their fellow republicans in the URDP, they look forward to a rebuilding country that is finally secure, and a People's Republic that finally rests in the hearts of all.\n\nStill, some question this future. Will this shift from a party of change to a party of stability be accepted among those who brought it here? Has the journey cost the party its identity, turning it as faceless as its Hetmanist foes? It may take years for the party's scars to become apparent. But the victorious soldier is troubled little by what he has lost.

A promise that one day, the forces of oppression would no longer have any gain in Ukraine, and that all her people would be able to live as equals — a promise for which much blood has been shed to establish a People's Republic not once, but twice. The USDRP were known as the keepers of this promise, but it has inspired many a soul to action in the name of true freedom. Many kinds call themselves republicans.\n\nFor much of their struggle, those who maintained the Republic were divided. Its parties all found reasons to be wary of each other, even when allied. But under the Hetmanate, the seeds for a republican front were laid. The Socialist Bloc brought together much of the disparate left and provided a model for the future, and the struggle for freedom drew the URDP into the republican fold. Together, under the leadership of the Social Democrats, they did the impossible — and set their sights on the inconceivable.\n\nThe USDRP as it was once known is no longer — in its place, the Ukrainian Socialist Party now stands as the titan of the left. Against all expectations, the spirit of republicanism prevailed amongst the S-R's; the spirit that drives men to put aside their differences and embrace what they share. With their aid, the USP can be a mass party in a way the USDRP could never quite achieve — a party with followers in student clubs, trade unions, peasants' associations, and everything in between. Through their fervent belief in their principles and rejection of meaningless radicalism, the USP have won the respect of both left and right. Either would be willing to join hands with fellow republicans, if asked.\n\nWhere will they go from here? Are these alliances as durable as they look? What trials await Ukraine's saviours, and can they survive failing them? The future yet holds dangers, known and unknown. But to the man with history on his side, what is there to fear?"

It certainly helped that Mr. Olesiiuk openly associated himself with the party's centrist majority.\n\nBut afterwards, things went dicey.

The names on the paper were ones he recognised very well: Dmytro Antonovych, Mykola Porsh, Prokip Poniatenko and Mykola Kovalskyi. Colloquially known as “party elders”, these individuals are known for having been at the founding party Congress back in 1905, along with Mazepa, but for one reason or another, have retreated from significant political activity in emigration in the 1920s. Nevertheless, the four have still remained somewhat influential in the party and their word carries weight.\n\nExpecting a warm message, Isaak's expression turned dark when he read the letter. In it, the “elders” criticised the government for straying from the path of reformist socialism and the Marxist doctrine, having instead been “taken hostage by forces of the bourgeois Radical Democrats”. If things don't change, they warn, USDRP may become a “socialist party in name only”.\n\nThis was hardly something Mazepa wanted to hear. He believed it came from a kind place, but it didn't make it much better. Addressing his comrades, Dmytro, Prokip and the two Mykolas, Isaak attempted to assuage their concerns.

He further expressed his belief that the power in the country has been taken over by “soon-to-be-capitulators” who'll run at the first sign of war with either the Russia or the Commune of France.\n\nThe gathering was seen as a partial success for the People's Party, but isn't likely to change anything in the grand scheme of things. Nevertheless, Anatolii Pisotskyi has published an absolutely scathing critique (under his non-secret pseudonym of Andrii Richytskyi) of the way things developed with this entire situation. Pisotskyi reasoned that, even if inadvertently, our government has helped the UNP gain notoriety we were hoping it would avoid. He ended his treatise by sarcastically asking if Vynnychenko was interested in pardoning the former Hetman, as well.

But the toils of exile began taking their toll on him.\n\nIn his usual firebrand nature, Shapoval and his close allies began frequently quarrelling with their fellow leftist emigrants. Questions of strategy, controversies over ideological elements, programme writings and interpersonal relations all invoked debate quite often. Worse yet, a constant tug of war over funding and political tactics with the Austrian patrons invited scrutiny from all sides - including Vienna, the Galician political forces, and other emigrants. There was genuine fear the emigration might collapse before even attempting a struggle against the Hetman.\n\nBut the reactionary danger reared its head first. In 1931, a disgruntled student at the Lviv University and an overt Hetmanist sympathiser shot Comrade Shapoval dead. There was no evidence of any involvement from any organisations or foreign governments. By all accounts, it was a lone wolf with personal grievances. Mykyta's death dealt a huge shock to the entire emigre community. But it all provided significant inspiration for the others and put their differences aside and work towards our common goal.\n\nAnd as such, he may not have lived to see our triumph, but he truly inspired us, even in death.

The debate over who should be elected to the role formed two factions - the radicals of the LUN preferred to keep Stsiborskyi, but they were ultimately outvoted by the more conservative majority behind general Yevhen Konovalets. The stern, popular and non-Hetmanite military man is expected to be impartial in politics and solely dedicated to the national good. As the election of Konovalets was clear, the solemn general received great applause. Finally the half-Russian aristocrat is gone, and a true Ukrainian stays proudly in his place!"

Their economic proposal envisions strong state control of economy through critical export monopolies, nationalisation of heavy industry and executive direction of the banking sector. Stsiborskyi argues that this way, the hegemony of \"un-national\" money-elite can be broken, and Ukraine's vast wealth can be directed more efficiently - and more importantly, directed towards the Ukrainian people.\n\nAdditionally, the proposal includes the organisation of professions in politically consicious unions, which would have corporatist representation in administration. The Legionary Workers' Corps in Romania is cited as a working example of such a form or organisation, one that has won over parts of the working class.\n\nOpponents of this draft argue that it is hardly wise to embark on massive economic reforms on the eve of war, and instead prefer to simply improve the currently existing economic situation with individual national reforms."

The older guard of Ukrainian nationalists, many who have served in the Hetmanist administration and the army, still have respect for Skoropadskyi for his role in securing Ukrainian nationhood, and would not wish to punish him too harshly for his failures. However, more fervent members of LUN demand action. They argue that the Hetman didn't merely fail, but was actively corrupting the Ukrainian nation with Russian influence and servitude to Germany, and so they demand punishment.\n\nIn an extremely politicised trial, these two views conflicted. The prosecutor was fiercely pro-LUN, and outlined a long list of crimes, even arguing that the suppression of the 1936 uprising was \"a crime against the Ukrainian peasant.\" They have also revealed Skoropadskyi personally benefiting from his government's connections to Protofis and other business interests in Ukraine, painting the Hetman as corrupt and a criminal.\n\nOpinions have only polarised during the three-day court hearings, as the LUN's strategy of aggravating people against the Hetman has also created pushback and made the trial seem even more like a show than it already is.

Dmytro Dontsov is perhaps the most vocal supporter of the total abolition of parliamentarism and the creation of a totalitarian, nationalist state.

Dontsov is a virulent Ukrainian ethno-nationalist and preaches supremacy of the nation over everything else.\n\nThis reminds many observers of the Iron Guard and other ultranationalist movements which have been raising their heads across Europe. An additional suspicion is raised by Dontsov's past, as he used to be a supporter of Hetmanist ultra-traditionalism until he grew disillusioned with the regime and joined the LUN. His popularity makes him a potential threat, and some have called for restricting his publications lest they spread needless radicalism to the people."
 ukraine_lun.6.a: "Censor his most revolutionary writings."
 ukraine_lun.6.b: "He has a right to say it."

 ukraine_lun.7.t: "Two Faces of the League"
 ukraine_lun.7.d: "After the League's rise to power, their membership has exploded as various smaller nationalist groups have merged with the organisation. Similarly, a large part of the earlier pro-hetmanite conservatives and nationalists have joined the organisation, and even more are not members, but part of LUN-aligned associations. All this has expanded the League greatly into a proper mass movement, which has come to dominate Ukrainian political life.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the League now had two distinct groups. The Old Guard is composed of more moderate nationalists, many of whom previously cooperated with the Hetmanate. Administrators, older officers and veterans of 1917-1918 battles tend to fall into this group. Their outlook to the national revolution is restricted - they do not desire a great ideological upheaval, but an effective, militarised state, something what the Hetmanate should have been. They are most supportive towards General Konovalets and \"military rule\" in general.\n\nThe Young Guard - which is ironically the group which has been in the LUN for a longer period of time - are young radicals, lower-ranking officers, and of the university-educated middle class. Its symbols are ideologues like Mykola Stsiborskyi and Dmytro Dontsov. Some in the Young Guard have expressed the mentality that their national revolution turned too conservative because of their moderate allies, while the Old Guard has the tendency to see the radicals as perhaps too immature, too prone to dreaming and not experienced enough to properly guide the country."
 ukraine_lun.7.a: "Both have some points."

 ukraine_lun.20.t: "The Hetmanate's New Opposition?"
 ukraine_lun.20.d: "For many, the anti-Hetman revolt once and for all dispelled the notion of the Hetman's regime as a sole possible guarantor of stability so desperately needed for the development of the young Ukrainian state. Yet with the disarray of the Republican forces the greatest threat to Hetmanist dominance over the political system remains a question at large for many.\n\nSome signs are indicating that the greatest threat to the Hetmanate may not come from the left as it once did, but from the right. In the situation the Ukrainian State finds itself in, the nature of the League of Ukrainian Nationalists, an organisation fully and zealously dedicated to radical change, has given the once small and relatively unimportant group a chance.\n\nThe military has become one of the most prominent breeding grounds for the organisation; the defections during the revolt, as well as subsequent attempts of the current regime to make the army more \"politically reliable\", has led the League to intensify its agitation among soldiers and junior officers, invoking a vision of a new Ukrainian state guided by principles of duty, discipline and military camaraderie."
 ukraine_lun.20.a: "We will keep an eye out."
 UKR_lun_firstwarning: "The §nLeague of Ukrainian Nationalists§! may be a fringe movement for now, but should we not deliver on our promises of our land reform, there is no doubt they will grow."

 ukraine_lun.21.t: "The League and the Countryside"
 ukraine_lun.21.d: "Compared to parties such as the Social-Democratic Workers' Party and the Agrarian Democratic Party, the League of Ukrainian Nationalists have never had a strong standing in the countryside, their rhetoric often only finding support among right-leaning intelligentsia. As the left-leaning opposition to the Hetmanate fades and the League tries to improve their standing among the peasantry, they have come across an unlikely ally: a former republican by the name of Kyrylo Osmak.\n\nHead of the cooperative association \"Silskyi Hospodar\", an agricultural organisation founded in Galicia in 1899 and later expanding its operations across Ukraine, Osmak is concerned about the League's authoritarian tendencies and radical proposals. Despite this, Osmak seems to believe that Stsiborskyi's worries regarding the well-being of peasants and farmers are sincere. A de-facto alliance has been formed between the League and Silskyi Hospodar, with many posts in the regional network across the cooperative association are being taken up by the League.\n\nIn addition to providing assistance in setting up and operating farmer cooperatives, offering agricultural education and aid to struggling farmers, League members have used the opportunity to spread their message of a new Ukraine - where the needs of the Ukrainian people are the first concern of the state and where there is no place for the tyranny of big landowners. Local, small protests influenced by the League have taken place in the countryside, demanding the government to distribute land fairly."
 ukraine_lun.21.a: "Worrying."

 ukraine_lun.22.t: "Republican Remnants and the League"
 ukraine_lun.22.d: "It seems that the League's attempts to court support from the Hetman's former opposition has bore fruit. With the support of Kyrylo Osmak's cooperative association, LUN has spread its influence across the dissatisfied peasantry. In an attempt to appeal to the broader populace, Stsiborskyi's party organs have toned down on anti-democratic voices and instead focus on criticising the slow and inefficient land reform policy of the Hetman's government. Under the guise of rural protest movements, the League has started to attract more and more of those who earlier backed the republicans, drawing from very similar ideas: calls for social equality in the countryside, increased representation of people in the \"elitist\" Hetmanite regime."
 ukraine_lun.22.a: "What crypto-republicans..."

 ukraine_lun.23.t: "An Unquestionable Loyalty?"
 ukraine_lun.23.d: "While the League's agitators continue their efforts in radicalising the peasantry and organising new protests, the military remains the most vulnerable institution for ultranationalist infiltration. Although sporadic contacts between even relatively high-ranking officers and the League existed for a long time, they were just that: mostly accidental and insignificant.\n\nThis seems to have changed for the worse however, with rumours emerging about two officers being strongly involved in cooperation with the LUN: Petro Bolbochan and Volodymyr Oskilko, who both have a reputation of being rather independently minded and somewhat rash in thought and action. It's an open secret in military circles that both see the army as something more than a mere part of the state security apparatus. The strongly pronounced elitist tendencies of SHD always put them off, but the openly populist rhetoric of LUN managed to attract their interest. While they remain mostly indifferent to more \"esoteric\" tenets of the League's beliefs, they definitely place certain hopes on this dynamic and uncompromisingly radical organisation."
 ukraine_lun.23.a: "A cause for concern."

 ukraine_lun.24.t: "March of the League of Ukrainian Nationalists"
 ukraine_lun.24.d: "Mykola Stsiborskyi's organisation has turned from a right-wing book-club into a broad organisation uniting various nationalists, republicans and dissatisfied conservatives under one banner. As a show of their strength, a march has been arranged to go through [202.GetName]'s historical landmarks. Yevhen Onatskyi, the chief organiser of the event, issued a statement describing the march as \"a celebration of the Ukrainian nation and its achievements\", though the capital's law enforcement held a more pessimistic view.\n\nWhile the march went on peacefully, it certainly raised quite a few eyebrows. Many speeches held as part of the event were radical in nature, and Dmytro Dontsov's presentation left little to the imagination: the League demanded the Hetman to take immediate actions to \"correct the course of the state.\" The demands of the League included distributing land to faithful Ukrainian people, removing corrupt bureaucrats and businessmen from the Hetman's closest circles, and appointing an Otaman-Minister friendly to the League's cause.\n\nEven more worrying was how many lower officers were privately involved in the protest. The widespread opinion in the army is that the League is a good, patriotic movement, whose goals are admirable even if their means are slightly suspicious. Stsiborskyi himself is a colonel, and has developed quite a following in the military."
 ukraine_lun.24.a: "Let's try to limit their influence..."

 ukraine_lun.25.t: "The League and the Army"
 ukraine_lun.25.d: "Behind closed doors, the leadership of the League met with a number of nationalist-minded generals. Present in the meeting were Mykola Stsiborskyi, Yevhen Onatskyi and Dmytro Andriievskyi from the LUN, while the military men in question were Yevhen Konovalets, Mykola Kapustianskyi and Petro Bolbochan - all former republicans from the People's Republic era, and only lukewarm supporters of Skoropadskyi. They assured that many more in the army share their doubts, especially among the soldiers from Western Ukraine, which has often been left behind in the Hetman's projects. In addition to the concerns of the ordinary soldiers, Konovalets outlined how the earlier revolt and now lagging reforms have been gnawing at the officer corps confidence in the Hetman. In private, many generals have expressed worries of Skoropadskyi's ability to serve as the commander-in-chief in war-time - and war is coming, make no mistake.\n\nThe possibility of a \"transfer of power\" was eventually brought up as a potential solution to these issues. LUN leadership assured that if Konovalets and men loyal to him decided to move against the Hetman, and arrange a \"more responsible government\", they would have the League's backing. The merit of such a plan was quickly recognised, though not single-handedly. Kapustianskyi was concerned of possible bloodshed - this transfer of power shouldn't be another revolt, but a clean and orchestrated sidelining of Skoropadskyi. Otherwise it might only weaken Ukraine's security further. Still, the proposal seemed like the best solution out of the current plight."
 ukraine_lun.25.a: "Konovalets accepted the plan."
 ukraine_lun.25.b: "Konovalets did not accept the plan."

 ukraine_lun.26.t: "The League's Wave Passes"
 ukraine_lun.26.d: "The LUN has lost much of their initial popularity after their heydays. Many of their more moderate supporters seem to be satisfied with some of Skoropadskyi's recent policies, and the great mass movement has dwindled.\n\nAs the land reform has continued - slowly but surely - many have claimed that it was the LUN's demands that made it happen. In addition, the spreading of the League's pamphlets in the military was banned, and even the officers who were friendly with Stsiborskyi's League have adopted a more careful tone."
 ukraine_lun.26.a: "Savinkov's tricks cannot work here."

 ukraine_lun.27.t: "The League's Great Protest"
 ukraine_lun.27.d: "Emboldened by military approval, the second great march was quickly organised, this time with more radical political demands. The government was demanded to be dismissed, with the Hetman having to cede power to \"nationally reliable men.\" No explicit demand of abdication was given, but the implication was clear: either Skoropadskyi would agree to become a puppet of the League, or he would go. To back up their demands, a great rally was held drawing dissatisfied peasantry, students and many others to [202.GetName] and listen to a fiery oratory of General Kapustianskyi, who cited the Scripture to paint the Hetman's government as money-lenders and the false faithful.\n\nThe protests quickly spread across the major cities, and the marchers blocked many streets in [202.GetName] when the Cossacks tried to dislodge them. Skoropadskyi seemed to be very wary of violence, fearing that these nationalists would have wide popularity in the armed forces. But he had little choice - his cabinet and he himself were adamant on keeping their power. Even if this League had agreeable goals, they were radicals who were attempting to overthrow the constitutional order - which is no better than what the republicans had attempted some time prior. Finally, on the third day of the protests, after much deliberation, the Hetman issued a stern order: the crowds must disperse and return to their homes, if they respect Ukraine's national order and stability. Anyone who did not comply would be arrested."
 ukraine_lun.27.a: "Hopefully it works."

 ukraine_lun.28.t: "Removal of Hetman Skoropadskyi"
 ukraine_lun.28.d: "The Hetman's demand of mass arrests was not followed through. As the police units tried to disperse the crowd, the protestors held firm and brawls broke out. Shots were fired. Law enforcement were denounced as traitors serving the corrupt elites by the movement's leadership, and soon the sluggish attempts to drive away the protestors turned into passivity or even joining with them. To many, it reminded them of the days before the 1936 revolt - though this time the protests were for the good of the nation, not to bring about socialism and anarchy.\n\nHetman Skoropadskyi's cards were rapidly running out; it was clear that the League had popular support. He could order the army to intervene, but he was not sure if he could even trust them. One of his confidants suggested packing up and leaving [202.GetName] for [221.GetName] and rallying loyal troops there, but most of the cabinet did not want to start another civil war. Some suggested to Skoropadskyi to perhaps start negotiations - or even accept their demands - for the good of the nation.\n\nAs these debates went on, it seems that the League's leadership ran out of patience. On the morning of the fifth day of the protests, a group of high-ranking officers under the leadership of Yevhen Konovalets arrived at the Hetman's residence and ordered the guards to stand down. Men of the military conspiracy quickly secured the escape routes and arrested the Hetman and the cabinet to \"avoid inciting another Anti-Hetman uprising\", and soon after forced the Hetman to sign his abdication and appoint a cabinet composed of LUN members and Konovalets' supporters. Leader of the League, Mykola Stsiborskyi, was inaugurated as the provisional chief of state until the Soim could meet to decide future of Ukraine."

 ukraine_lun.40.t: "A Revolution Secured"
 # ukraine_lun.40.t2: "A Change of Direction"
 ukraine_lun.40.d1: "With the recent elections to the Soim being dominated by delegates associated with the \"Revolutionary Wing\" of the LUN it is safe to say that the radical core of the organisation's true believers not only managed to retain its positions but also was able to significantly strengthen them. While cooperation between the movement's veterans and so-called \"Old Guard\" wasn't always smooth, especially at the start, it gradually improved as time went on, all thanks to the impartiality and wisdom of our glorious Providnyk. Finally, in the crucible of the war our League was reforged into a truly united entity, focused above all on the most important task: furtherment and defence of the National Revolution.\n\nIt is not surprising then that First State Secretary Mykola Stsiborskyi remains in good graces of our Leader, his position secured, his tireless efforts directed towards the betterment and strengthening of our state and nation. Indeed, wide support for Stsiborskyi in the legislature, so passionately emphasised in the opening speech of the first post-election session of the Soim by Oleh Olzhych, shows how much more healthy our political environment has become. As such, while those who would like to see the First State Secretary dethroned may still plot in the dark, for the foreseeable future they are destined to remain a minority within our organisation."
 ukraine_lun.40.d2: "With the recent elections to the Soim being largely dominated by delegates associated with the so-called \"Old Guard\", it is safe to say that the radical core of the LUN true believers has been significantly weakened since the days of the Revolution of 1938. The cooperation between the movement's veterans and Old Guard was always tenuous, and during the war the Militarist and Moderate wings of the organisation managed to gain the upper hand.\n\n$ukraine_lun.40_mil$ They are contrasted by the Moderate Wing which advocates $ukraine_lun.40_mod$.\n\nWhile our Providnyk allows for a certain freedom of internal discussion and rarely directly intervenes, unless the situation truly demands it, he nonetheless has a keen sense of the pulse of political life of the League and the state. The new composition of the Soim clearly indicates that the Revolutionary Wing has lost much of its support among the movement and as such First State Secretary Stsiborskyi will soon inevitably face significant pressure and opposition from the ascendant Wings. Perhaps, in order to ensure continuation of a smooth governance, it is time for a change."

 ukraine_lun.40_elect: "While the recent elections to the Soim were mostly dominated by delegates associated with the \"Revolutionary Wing\" of the LUN, the \"Old Guard\" managed to expand their influence and may even overtake the \"Revolutionary Wing\" in importance. Though cooperation between the movement's veterans and Old Guard has improved since the start, it is not as strong as it could be and during the war"
 ukraine_lun.40_mil: "The Militarist Wing advocates for rigorous internal discipline and a hierarchical reorganisation of the League along strictly defined lines of subordination and ranking. They place their hopes with Andrii Melnyk, a long time associate and faithful lieutenant of our Providnyk. Under his guidance, they argue, the state will achieve internal cohesion and order so badly needed in these trying times."
 ukraine_lun.40_mod: "for more openness in internal discussions and the relaxation of certain restrictions in the political sphere.

Although First State Secretary Mykola Stsiborskyi remains in the good graces of our Providnyk, his tireless efforts directed towards the betterment and strengthening of our state and nation winning wide support in the legislature, the new composition of the Soim clearly indicates that the Revolutionary Wing is not as strong as it once was among the movement and as such Stsiborskyi may soon face significant pressure and opposition from the ascendant"

From the beginning of his confinement, the disgraced old Hetman set out to write his personal memoirs to recount his life as Ukraine's head of state for two decades. Today, his memoirs have officially been published.\n\nIn its preface, Skoropadskyi notes that he lacks the desire or ability to create interesting memoirs, something exacerbated by his old age. Nonetheless, his publication provides a rather comprehensive account of the Ukrainian State's history from the beginning of the Hetmanate to the nationalist coup in late 1938. Towards the end of the memoirs, where Skoropadskyi discusses the coup itself, he reflects that he is \"not particularly satisfied with the direction the nation is heading\", although he does not elaborate on this. He admits that his administration may have made \"some mistakes\" and that this lead to the destruction of his administration.\n\nYet, he remains adamant that his rule was an overall benevolent one, one which the new leadership must be thankful for; after all, it was he who prevented the socialist takeovers of Ukraine not just once, but three separate times in the young nation's history."

Towards the end of memoirs, Skoropadskyi discusses the coup itself, where he reflects that he is \"not particularly satisfied with the direction the nation is heading\". In an era where Russian revanchism is rising, he predicts that the League's \"delusional demagoguery, blinded by their ridiculous hateful doctrine\" will only divide the Ukrainian people, especially the ethnic Russians and Russophones in the east. He proclaims that while his government may have made mistakes, the League will only worsen Ukraine's problems. Finally, he directs scathing criticism towards the nationalist officers who took part in the coup, decrying them as \"opportunists\" who took advantage of the League's popularity in the countryside.\n\nSkoropadskyi ends his memoirs saying that no matter what, all of his actions were geared towards the interest of Ukraine and its people; and that though he may heavily disagree with the new government, he hopes that they will forgo petty ethnic or linguistic divisions and \"put the Ukrainian people first\"."

In this work, Dr Lypa argued that the Black Sea states should deploy a new geopolitical perspective in determining their national security so that they be redefined as key territories between North and South - not East and West - and use their unique positions to grow in power and ensure their security. The East-West axis was the most dangerous since it would transform the Black Sea states into colonial annexes of more advanced nations.\n\n\"The Black Sea Doctrine\" expands upon his previous work, defining the Black Sea people as possessing a common maritime character and the potential for self-sufficiency. The Black Sea is the heart of the fortress, with its Eastern walls constituted by the Caucasian states while the Western walls run along the Carpathians and the Balkans. The Danube, the Caspian Sea, and the Bosphorus are the gates of this mighty fortress.\n\nThe world powers deny the Black Sea states the right to become independent, which is only possible due to their political disorganisation and economic underdevelopment. Fortunately, Dr Lypa has drafted a political strategy for the Black Sea states to regain sovereignty and acquire real power: the creation of a Black Sea Union will eliminate Moscow and Germanic Imperialism and unite several nations over the Black Sea into one large state economy. Although we are unable to achieve Ukraine's destiny currently, when the opportunity presents itself, we will not hesitate."

The All-Ukrainian Democratic Movement stood true to its assurances and has started work in creating a peasant republic much like what White Ruthenia has been for some time.\n\nOne of the first things the new government did was to reach out to us to assure that they still desired cooperation, especially in military affairs, albeit with hopes of increased economic autonomy in line with their ambitious social-democratic economic programme, which includes constraining power of landowners and - most importantly for us, the industrialists. It's possible that an unsatisfied Ukraine would foolishly attempt to stay neutral or join with Austria's sphere - though making too many concessions would be unpopular at home and in other parts of Mitteleuropa."

 ukraine_forpol.18.d: "Unsatisfied with our demands, the Ukrainian delegation has arrived to haggle. They wish to change some particularly troublesome points of our agreement, such as being permitted to nationalise German-owned assets, though by paying full compensation for them. They additionally wish to avoid a too high German presence in the country and, for additional liberties, offer us more profitable export arrangements. This is obviously more important to them domestically, as they do not wish to be seen as \"selling the country to the Germans\" - the same crime they accused the Hetman's government of."
 ukraine_forpol.18.a: "Seems reasonable."
 ukraine_forpol.18.b: "They are in no position to bargain."
 ukraine_forpol.18.b.tt: "Ukraine may seek a better deal from the £KR_game_rule_flag_AUS  §YAustrian Empire§! in response to our hardline stance, but if they agree the §Gbenefits will be tremendous§!."

 ukraine_forpol.19.t: "Germans Accept Our Deal"
 ukraine_forpol.19.d: "Our delegation managed to convince Germany to lower their unreasonable demands. It is an achievement that we can sell to our domestic supporters as victory over German hegemony, or at least progress towards our eventual liberation - something that the Hetmanate never managed to achieve. As a major part of the renegotiation, the Germans dropped their demand of controlling the railway and manning them with their own soldiers, and were satisfied with the establishment of a joint committee to manage and organise the infrastructure system."
 ukraine_forpol.19.a: "Great that they saw reason."
 ukraine_forpol.19.b: "This isn't enough, perhaps we have friends in Vienna..."

 ukraine_forpol.20.t: "Germany Ignored Our Counter-Proposal!"
 ukraine_forpol.20.d: "Our negotiators did not manage to gain any real changes. The Germans gave us some token concessions, but they were mere breadcrumbs to make it look like Germans were being reasonable and not just forcing us to sign their ultimatum. If we sign it, it's not going to look very good at home - at this point, only real way to improve our situation would be backing of another major power."
 ukraine_forpol.20.a: "Let's see if we have friends in Vienna..."
 ukraine_forpol.20.b: "At least we tried."

 ukraine_forpol.21.t: "Ukrainian Railways Return Under German Control"
 ukraine_forpol.21.d: "As per the agreement with the new Ukrainian government, the main arteries of their infrastructure system have been sold to a German state company, and put under their administration. In practice this means a lasting German grip over Ukraine, with the Heer having free movement through the country - and Germany reaping financial profits from the system. It's a national humiliation for [UKR.GetNameDef], but Berlin's leadership can rest easy, having reaffirmed their grip on the east."
 ukraine_forpol.21.a: "Splendid."
 ukraine_forpol.21.b: "Necessary sacrifice."

 ukraine_forpol.22.t: "Ukraine Seeks an Alliance"
 ukraine_forpol.22.d: "In secret talks with the Ukrainian ambassador in Vienna, the possibility of an official alliance between [202.GetName] and Vienna was raised for the first time. The negotiations between Ukraine and Germany seem to have hit a stalemate, with the Ukrainians being unwilling to accept all the various unreasonable demands that the Germans are making. To escape this plight, they have suggested an alliance between the Habsburg Empire and Ukraine, reducing their dependence on Germans for protection and giving them a better hand for negotiation. This will no doubt annoy the Germans greatly... but on the other hand, they did rob us of this possibility already in 1917. This time we shouldn't let the Ukrainians down."
 ukraine_forpol.22.a: "They are welcome."
 ukraine_forpol.22.b: "They just want us to get into another foolish war."

 ukraine_forpol.23.t: "The Austro-German-Ukrainian Treaty"
 ukraine_forpol.23.d: "After it became clear that a German-Ukrainian treaty was impossible, the three powers started a new round of negotiations. A compromise was as the Austrians sought to balance the equation for their own gain; Ukraine would be military allied to Austria, but remain in Mitteleuropa. However, the economic part is much more complex, going through everything from foreign citizens' rights to conduct business in Ukraine on equal ground to the locals to clauses protecting foreign-owned factories and mines from being nationalised or harassed in other ways. The conditions are way milder than those that the Germans initially demanded."
 ukraine_forpol.23.a: "A return to stability, hopefully."
 ukraine_forpol.23.b: "Whatever."
 ukraine_forpol.23.c: "Wonderful!"

 ukraine_forpol.25.t: "The German-Ukrainian Treaty"
 ukraine_forpol.25.d: "After intense negotiations, the two powers reached a shaky agreement. [UKR.GetNameDefCap] will continue being militarily allied to Germany, and will host German troops in the country. However, the economic part is much more complex, going through everything from foreign citizens' rights to conduct business in Ukraine on equal ground to the locals to clauses protecting foreign-owned factories and mines from being nationalised or harassed in other ways. All this has kept the German industry's faith in Ukraine as a desirable location of investment but will no doubt become a troublesome thorn in the republic's side."
 ukraine_forpol.25.a: "A return to normalcy, hopefully."

 ukraine_forpol.26.t: "Fate of Skoropadskyi"
 ukraine_forpol.26.d: "The tables have turned. The former Hetman and his cronies escaped to Berlin before justice could catch them and are now organising the \"Ukrainian National Government\" in exile. They have petitioned the Kaiser to support them, though with poor results thus far. It's hard to believe that Skoropadskyi could be much of a threat to us anymore - but then again, he is guilty of countless crimes against the Ukrainian people and should face trial. We could request Germany to extradite him, though this might put the German government in an awkward position."
 ukraine_forpol.26.a: "Make the demand."
 ukraine_forpol.26.b: "His fate is no longer a concern of ours."

 ukraine_forpol.27.t: "Extradition Request of Pavlo Skoropadskyi"
 ukraine_forpol.27.d: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the former Ukrainian Hetman, has sought refuge in Berlin alongside what remains of his government. A new republican government sits in [202.GetName], and Skoropadskyi has been petitioning us to start military intervention to restore \"legal rule\" to Ukraine. It is entirely out of the question - the republican regime is willing to negotiate, and intervening at this point would mean open war with Ukraine, an event that the Russians would welcome with open arms.\n\nWe hoped to ignore Skoropadskyi entirely, but now the Ukrainian government has officially requested the extradition of the former Hetman to bring him to Ukraine to answer for his crimes. On the one hand, he is useless to us; extraditing him could be used as a token of goodwill towards Ukraine... but Skoropadskyi still has allies in Germany, and it would look embarrassing if a candidate we supported for two decades were tried as a war criminal."
 ukraine_forpol.27.a: "Send him to Ukraine."
 ukraine_forpol.27.b: "Refuse it."

 ukraine_forpol.28.t: "Germany Accepts the Extradition request"
 ukraine_forpol.28.d: "The German government has agreed, and Skoropadskyi has been arrested and accused of various high crimes. He will be sent to Ukraine shortly to stand for a trial and answer to the Ukrainian people for his deeds."
 ukraine_forpol.28.a: "Let us prepare the charges."

 ukraine_forpol.29.t: "Skoropadskyi Will Stay in Germany"
 ukraine_forpol.29.d: "In a polite answer from Berlin, they informed us that Pavlo Skoropadskyi has been granted asylum in Germany and as long as he has not committed crimes in Germany, he shall not be deported. In private, the German ambassador hinted that further prying on the matter would greatly displease Berlin, and recommended to let it be forgotten."
 ukraine_forpol.29.a: "The tyrant has escaped."

 ukraine_forpol.30.t: "Trial of the Hetman"
 ukraine_forpol.30.d: "The number of charges is enormous - ordering murders, torture, and imprisonment of peasants and workers of Ukraine from 1919, two decades of oppressive measures, and ordering mass executions during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1936. The well-prepared list of charges was politically motivated but genuine: blood was on the Hetman's hands. In Skoropadskyi's defence, he argued that everything he did was to protect the legal order of Ukraine and its democracy. In a surprisingly emotional speech, he assured that he has only ever had the welfare of all Ukrainians in his mind and that the charges - some of which he admits to being true and necessary - are a mere sham, as they were not illegal when they were committed, and have been unconstitutionally declared only after the fact.\n\nIn the end, he is still guilty - the only question is the punishment."
 ukraine_forpol.30.a: "He is a traitor and deserves to rot in prison."
 ukraine_forpol.30.b: "Show the poor man leniency he never showed to us."

 ukraine_forpol.32.t: "Revolution in Ukraine!"
 ukraine_forpol.32.d: "The unrest in Ukraine has finally boiled over, and the communist-syndicalist Borotbyst movement has taken over the republic. The legal government of Ukraine managed to escape, and are currently pleading Germany for help against the socialist menace. Shumskyi, president of the new socialist republic, has denounced them as class traitors and collaborators, and has declared Ukraine's total sovereignty. Rapid mobilisation has begun to defend the revolution from any foreign threats. With this turn of events, the lynchpin of German hegemony in the east has been shattered. Even worse, the new government has aligned itself with the Russians in the east."
 ukraine_forpol.32.a: "This is catastrophic. Ready the troops!"
 ukraine_forpol.32.b: "We must bide our time."

 ukraine_forpol.34.t: "Germany Approaches with an Alliance"
 ukraine_forpol.34.d: "Now that we find ourselves unaligned, Germany has quickly set their sights on us again. Albeit with more a polite tone than last time, they have once again offered us a military alliance. With the current instability in the Danubian region, it would at least defend us from possibly hostile actions by the Austrian ultranationalist regime. While an alliance reminds some of Ukraine's subjugation under Germany during the Hetman's reign, we have no other options if we want protection from any future Russian agression. Thus we must agree,"
 ukraine_forpol.34.a: "Let's ally them - out of our own free will."

 ukraine_forpol.35.t: "Protests in Ukraine"
 ukraine_forpol.35.d: "Just as our own domestic problems continue to rise, so do they for our most important ally in the east. Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who we backed in early 1918 as our key ally in Ukraine, has been facing increasingly bitter criticism from the exiled Republican opposition, who have been demanding political and economic reforms. Worryingly, the situation seems to be spiraling out of the Hetman's control.\n\nIt is true that we have little to spare for our Ukrainian ally, but some say that this is a matter of national security. Should we fail to provide some form of assistance, the Hetman's rule may not be for much longer."
 ukraine_forpol.35.a: "Ensure that he gets everything he needs."
 ukraine_forpol.35.b: "I'm sure he can manage the situation just fine."
 ukraine_forpol.35.tt: "Supporting the Hetmanate may be a costly endeavour for now, but by guaranteeing Skoropadskyi remains in power, we may §Greap the benefits§! in the long term."

 ukraine_forpol.36.t: "Uprising in Ukraine Crushed"
 ukraine_forpol.36.d: "Good news from [202.GetName] has reached us. The Ukrainian ambassador by Germany has informed our respective ambassador, Johannes von Welczeck, that the critical situation in Ukraine has passed. Despite initial setbacks, a counteroffensive has pushed the Ukrainian socialist rebels out of the country and forced them to flee, ensuring that Skoropadskyi's rule in Ukraine is essentially unchallenged.\n\nWhile the Hetman has never styled himself as pro-German, preferring to be labelled pro-Ukrainian instead, there is no doubt that his victory will be beneficial for German-Ukrainian cooperation. Hopefully, we can expect to reap the rewards of said cooperation, as well as remain assured that our defensive Ostwall plans can continue as before."
 ukraine_forpol.36.a: "Good to hear."

 ukraine_forpol.37.t: "Ukrainian Exports Soar"
 ukraine_forpol.37.d: "The war in America has drastically reduced the amount of exported wheat in the world markets, and our loyal ally Ukraine has been among those greatly profiting from the tragedy taking place in the United States. In addition, the world around us has been recovering from the horrible economic recession. Despite the looming threat of war and the still sore wounds from the revolt, Ukrainian exports have recovered very well.\n\nThe willingness on the part of the Skoropadskyi administration to export grain to Germany certainly has its benefits. To some extent, Ukrainian dominance over the grain market has its opponents among more protectionist-minded individuals, however."
 ukraine_forpol.37.a: "Never another turnip winter!"
 ukraine_forpol.37.b: "These can't come at the expense of German farmers."

 ukraine_forpol.38.t: "BASF Declares Record Profits"
 ukraine_forpol.38.d: "The Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik, or BASF, has declared record earnings as of late. As the largest oil company operating in Germany and Eastern Europe as a whole, this is no surprise, as concurrently with Ukraine's ongoing industrialisation programme they have helped Ukraine's oil industry take off. We have been able to reap some of the benefits ourselves, especially due to the Skoropadskyi administration's lucrative deals with German businessmen."
 ukraine_forpol.38.a: "A fantastic initiative."
 ukraine_forpol.38.b: "We should take greater advantage of this..."

 UKR_interservice_cooperation_desc: "Instead of infantryman, or artilleryman, or sailors, they are all knights of Ukraine. Rivalry between branches must end, and a common spirit needs to be created to foster mentality of cooperation between different arms."
 UKR_primacy_of_maneuver: "Primacy of Manoeuvre"
 UKR_primacy_of_maneuver_desc: "Fighting a war of attrition against Russia is an exercise in futility. In the endless plains of Ukraine and Russia, manoeuvre is the key to victory. Whoever can strike first and move fastest will gain the edge, and if they are tenacious enough, they will keep it."
 UKR_valour_and_victory: "Doblist i Zvytiaha"
 UKR_valour_and_victory_desc: "While a soldier's physical skills matter, what truly creates victory is their moral character. Valour was how the Greeks could defeat great Persian armies: valour is how we defeated Napoleon, and lack of it was what caused the downfall of the Russian armies two decades prior. A soldier is only as strong as their conviction."

 UKR_general_staff_reorganisation: "General Staff Reorganisation"
 UKR_general_staff_reorganisation_desc: "The old system proved its faults during the 1936 uprising. The system of Hetman-appointed regional Otamans was too unwieldy, and often the Otamans either had to wait for orders for long time, or went entirely outside their given orders. This military adventurism must stop, and the system needs to be formalised properly."
 UKR_refund_kharkiv_design_bureau: "Re-fund Kharkiv Design Bureau"
 UKR_refund_kharkiv_design_bureau_desc: "The Hetmanate was in the process of developing a grand budget for armoured warfare, chiefly through the Kharkiv Design Bureau, the primary armour development centre in the country. Though we could not afford such endeavours at first, with military spending at an all time high it is time to reinvest into this ever-more important component of modern war."
 UKR_partisan_training: "Partisan Training"
 UKR_partisan_training_desc: "While ideally no part of our country will be occupied, it is simply good preparation to educate our troops in asymmetrical defence. Our military organisation and communications must remain operational in occupied territories, and our leaders must understand how to wage an effective guerilla campaign in support of the proper army."
 UKR_ncos: "New Generation NCOs"
 UKR_ncos_desc: "Despite attempts to instil Auftragstaktik to our army, it has been plagued by passivity and lack of innovation under the Hetman's Russian-inspired command. The new generation of NCOs must be taught dynamic art of war, where they can be trusted with decisions of their own, and who will lead soldiers through example and not through authority."
 UKR_knowing_the_land: "Knowing the Land"
 UKR_knowing_the_land_desc: "One of the few advantages we have against the great Russian war machine is that much of the fighting will happen in Ukraine.

 UKR_unquestionable_loyalty: "Loyalty to Ukraine"
 UKR_unquestionable_loyalty_desc: "Loyalty to Skoropadskyi and his regime was never great enough to unify the people, and it is doubtful if anyone can be that inspiring. Instead, the Ukrainian soldier fights for the ideal of Ukraine, of everything that is free and dear to them."
 UKR_citizen_defence: "Everyone a Soldier"
 UKR_citizen_defence_desc: "It is a waste to favour upper class families in officer promotions or to close women or Jews from military training. Anyone willing to serve their country should be allowed to, to their best ability."
 UKR_review_structure: "Review Army Structure"
 UKR_review_structure_desc: "The Skoropadskyi-era army was too rigid, too hierarchical. It was not capable of fast enough decision-making nor improvisation. Our entire army organisation must be rethought, and the focus must be moved from the high command to the divisional and brigade level - to the men on the ground."
 UKR_empower_local_command: "Empower Local Command"
 UKR_empower_local_command_desc: "Young officers are both more loyal, more patriotic and more innovative. Often it has been the local command, led by bright man and followed by group of personally loyal men, which has been able to defeat much more powerful foes."

 UKR_ideological_unity: "Promote True Believers"
 UKR_ideological_unity_desc: "To ensure effectiveness and loyalty of our army, we need to quickly find men of impeccable ideological conviction, men willing to die for our righteous cause, who have not been tainted by the old regime's nepotism and inefficacies."
 UKR_centralised_command: "Centralised Command"
 UKR_centralised_command_desc: "The old messy hierarchy must be rationalised and clarified into simpler system where the Stavka has all power over military matters. The stubborn hoarding of military equipment by regional commanders must become thing of the past, and our scarce striking power must be allocated to wherever it is currently needed the most."
 UKR_everything_for_the_victory: "Everything for the Victory"

 UKR_hardiness_and_fervour_desc: "Wars are not won by those who are right, but by those who are left. Perservance and will to go on will triumph over brutish force. Our only goal is not to lose, and to that goal we simply need to not give up."

 UKR_the_plan_to_save_europe_desc: "The German Empire, the great protector of Ukrainian independence (and frankly, dependence) has fallen.

 UKR_salvage_what_we_can_desc: "The collapse of Mitteleuropa has not exactly been a smooth process. There are a great number of arms left behind by the retreating Germans, and plenty was given to us so that we may continue the fight. We must make use of it however we can."
 UKR_something_to_defend: "We Have Something to Defend!"
 UKR_something_to_defend_desc: "It is much better to die a hero than to capitulate to tyranny. We will not give up the institutions that our great People's Republic was founded upon, as we have fought for them for decades. The soldiers of the Anti-Hetman Revolt and the Second Weltkrieg shall go down in history for their efforts, and we will ensure that their losses will not be for nothing."
 UKR_utmost_scientific_cooperation: "Utmost Scientific Cooperation"
 UKR_utmost_scientific_cooperation_desc: "The German Empire had some of the greatest scientists in the world, and their military technology was top notch. Many of their designs have already been shared with us, but in attempting to keep their hegemony we had often been left to our own devices. It is time for us as well as others to put their incredible feats to good use, and to pool together our knowledge so that we do not get obliterated by the opposing armies' superior weaponry."

 UKR_ger_pilot_training_initiative: "German Pilot Training Initiative"
 UKR_ger_pilot_training_initiative_desc: "Germany has first-class avitation schools, and even more importantly way more training aircraft than we do. In exchange, more trained Ukrainian pilots means that Germany has less need to keep fighter squadrons stationed in East Europe. Thus, joint training programme benefits the both."
 UKR_ger_request_heavy_equipment: "Request Heavy Equipment"
 UKR_ger_request_heavy_equipment_desc: "The German military-industrial complex produces in a day what ours does in weeks. Moreover, we don't even have the capacity to build many more advanced weapons of war, but luckily German corporations eagerly sell equipment to us."
 UKR_ger_rockets: "Rocket Artillery Experiments"
 UKR_ger_rockets_desc: "In joint research with the Heer, we have started to develop rocket launchers that would fit the open plains of Ukraine as cheap and light weapon system with great shock capability."

 UKR_protection_of_dual_monarchy_desc: "Austria-Hungary might not be the foremost military power, but they are directly involved in our defence: it is only our arms that stand between them and Russian armies.

Protected by our might, peoples of these lands will be able to build a strong community, free from predations of imperialists."
 UKR_bsd_mil2: "The Crimean Aircraft Carrier"

 UKR_bsd_navy: "The Common Maritime Character"
 UKR_bsd_navy_desc: "The Euxine Sea always served as a key link between various nations settled on its shores. It greatly influenced our national character and was crucial for the establishment of ties with our neighbours. These historical and spiritual connections will go a long way in ensuring our ability to protect our sea frontier from any potential foe."
 UKR_bsd_mil3: "A Legion of Faithful"
 UKR_bsd_mil3_desc: "It is not enough to simply be a trained soldier, but an ideologically convinced one. A professional soldier might accept submission to the Skoropadskyis and Petliuras of the future, but a truly national-minded Ukrainian will not take any part in such plans."

 UKR_the_hour_approaches: "The Hour Approaches"

 UKR_black_monday_focus_desc: "With the German economy imploding, Ukraine, like the rest of Mitteleuropa, has been taken down with it. Ukraine finds itself in dire straits due to the stockpiling of excess grain and a collapse of the agricultural markets. We will have to take extensive measures to recover from this crisis."
 UKR_drop_gold_standard: "Drop The Gold Standard"
 UKR_drop_gold_standard_desc: "Ukraine's currency, the Hryvnias, has been tied to the gold standard for some time now and in the past this provided some measure of economic stability, especially in warding off inflation. These are trying times and Ukraine must follow other countries in their abandonment of this archaic practice allowing us to inject some much needed cash into the economy."
 UKR_bail_out_companies_ger: "Support German Companies"
 UKR_bail_out_companies_ger_desc: "German industrial ventures in Ukraine are few and far between and with the economic downturn, they are disappearing overnight. To prevent even more capital leaking from the country we must bail out these corporations so they can continue operating in Ukraine."

 UKR_railway_issue: "The Railway Issue"
 UKR_railway_issue_desc: "The railways are the lifeblood of the Ukrainian economy and our German benefactors have poured much capital into improving them.

 UKR_export_subsidies_desc: "The rules of Mitteleuropa forbid unilateral tariff increases, but they do not forbid state subsidies for key sectors. Through export subsidies we can keep our industries afloat in this storm."
 UKR_austerity_measures: "Implement Austerity Measures"
 UKR_austerity_measures_desc: "Due to the crisis of Black Monday the government has decided to cut costs and increase taxation in an attempt to ensure the treasury doesn't go completely bankrupt. While this will relieve the burden on our finances it will harm our industrial capacity."
 UKR_creation_of_state_corporations: "Creation of State Corporations"

 UKR_the_march_towards_parliamentarisation: "The March Towards Parliamentarisation"
 UKR_the_march_towards_parliamentarisation_desc: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi's death was a most unfortunate event, but we must not forget his well-intentioned attempts to negotiate with the VDR. Unlike others who would rather see the nation plunged into civil war, we will continue the negotiations and ensure that Ukraine is safe and free."
 UKR_the_necessity_of_reform: "The Necessity of Reform"
 UKR_the_necessity_of_reform_desc: "The VDR has put forward a number of reforms they view as necessary to tolerate the Hetman's government. Fortunately, Otaman-Minister Doroshenko and Danylo Skoropadskyi agree with many of their more moderate reforms - but pushing them through, with opposition from the less constitutionalist-minded in the Soim, will surely not be an easy task..."
 UKR_issue_of_land_reform: "Issue of Land Reform"
 UKR_issue_of_land_reform_desc: "Thankfully, land reform was one of the key ideas that Pavlo Skorpadskyi and the VDR seemed mostly in agreement upon - and Danylo, along with Doroshenko and much of the Soim, seem to be aligned on the issue. Still, questions remain on just what the new government's land reform plans will look like..."
 UKR_reign_not_rule: "Reign, not Rule"
 UKR_reign_not_rule_desc: "Hetman Skoropadskyi's excessive intervention into Ukrainian politics was what made so many resent the Hetmanate. With Danylo's ascension and his lack of interest in ruling directly we can finally turn the Hetman into a more symbolic position."
 UKR_decentralising_the_administration: "Decentralising the Administration"
 UKR_decentralising_the_administration_desc: "Up until now the country and its government have been highly centralised and this has led to some regions, especially in the west, receiving inadequate attention. We shall make rectifying this a priority."
 UKR_lift_ban_on_socialist_organisations: "Lift Ban on Socialist Organisations"
 UKR_lift_ban_on_socialist_organisations_desc: "Socialist parties and organisations have been banned for over fifteen years now. The VDR has demanded that they be allowed to run in local and national elections; as long as they do not attempt a revolution then we will accept their request."
 UKR_expand_suffrage_to_women: "Expand Suffrage to Women"
 UKR_expand_suffrage_to_women_desc: "Women's organisations such as NRUZ have long lobbied for support from our government, advocating the rights of women in Ukraine. As women's rights becomes an increasingly popular idea across Europe we shall enshrine their suffrage."
 UKR_dealing_with_the_coalition: "Dealing with the Coalition"
 UKR_dealing_with_the_coalition_desc: "Skoropadskyi's Coalition is a double edged-sword; the anti-democratic and classocratic USKhD almost immediately voiced their opposition to the negotiations, whereas the UDKhP's opinion was more mixed. Perhaps through sly politicking, we will be able to break apart the coalition and bring some of its members to our cause."
 UKR_strike_the_classocrats: "Strike the Classocrats"
 UKR_strike_the_classocrats_desc: "The USKhD, loud as their voice may be, only have power due to Pavlo Skoropadskyi's grace - and they know it. We will expose their anti-democratic leanings, as well as encourage some of its less ideologically inclined members to join the UDKhP."
 UKR_sack_protofis_representatives: "Sack Protofis Representatives"
 UKR_sack_protofis_representatives_desc: "Though it is long overdue at this point, the landowning and industrialist lobbyists from the Protofis alliance must be driven out from the government. Fortunately, this will be a rather uncontroversial move among the coalition as well as the VDR, and with their influence reduced the opposition to the negotiations will be stymied."
 UKR_defang_the_borotbists: "Defang the Borotbysts"
 UKR_defang_the_borotbists_desc: "Hopelessly believing that their sabotage of the nation will bring the country to revolution, the Borotbysts nonetheless have damaged the potential of successful negotiations with the VDR, and many within the coalition are calling for their immediate suppression. Though it may harm our relations with the VDR, it will assuredly calm the right who have lambasted us for inaction."
 UKR_support_the_usdrp: "Support the USDRP"
 UKR_support_the_usdrp_desc: "Though they may not enjoy support in the Soim currently, we will extend an olive branch to the USDRP, who has been lobbying the Hetman's government to allow socialists to run in the elections, both local and national. Their moderate platform will give us significant leverage in convincing the right that our actions are not of revolution, but of compromise."
 UKR_dealing_with_the_shd: "Dealing with the SHD"
 UKR_dealing_with_the_shd_desc: "The Union of Hetmanites-State Builders perhaps poses the greatest peril to the parliamentarisation process, having threatened to bring an end to the negotiations by force at multiple times. If the negotiations are to survive, they must be dealt with, and quickly."
 UKR_bring_the_military_in_line: "Bring the Military in Line"
 UKR_bring_the_military_in_line_desc: "The potential for a military coup to take over and bring over a swift end to the negotiations is a very real threat. Nonetheless, the military must understand who is Hetman now and that a great era of change is upon us, and that their duty is to protect the nation and keep it safe, not to meddle in its politics."
 UKR_support_loyal_officers: "Support Loyal Officers"
 UKR_support_loyal_officers_desc: "General Prisovskyi and others among the SHD may have attained high prestige, which is exactly why they pose so much of a threat.

 UKR_union_dark_horse_desc: "Among the SHD's members, the head of the Great Cossack Rada, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, does not have the same prestige that Prisovskyi does.

 UKR_curb_right_wing_radicalism: "Curb Right Wing Radicalism"
 UKR_curb_right_wing_radicalism_desc: "Though radical leftism is surely one of the greatest threats to the nation, so is right wing radicalism; whether it be through the SHD, the LUN or otherwise, these dangers must be constrained."
 UKR_the_parliamentary_hetmanate: "The Parliamentary Hetmanate"
 UKR_the_parliamentary_hetmanate_desc: "The long and arduous task of parliamentarisation seems to be coming to a close. With the opposition defanged and the reforms of the VDR fully implemented, elections are ready to be held again as a bright new era shall shine on Ukraine!"

 UKR_the_young_hetman: "The Young Hetman"

 UKR_the_art_of_compromise: "The Art of Compromise"
 UKR_the_art_of_compromise_desc: "Our state was able to negotiate with the VDR because we championed pragmatism and compromise, but without some compromise with the right-wing we could never have gotten here. These principles shall be our guide."
 UKR_time_for_radical_action: "Time for Radical Action"
 UKR_time_for_radical_action_desc: "For two decades this country has been all talk and no action - land reform was promised from the beginning but never carried out as infighting put a halt on any plans. It is time we take decisive action and carry out land reform for the benefit of our people."
 UKR_level_up_the_countryside: "Level Up the Countryside"

 UKR_organise_state_monopolies: "Organise State Monopolies"
 UKR_organise_state_monopolies_desc: "Industrial sectors integral to national security, such as armaments, are best kept in tight control of the government-appointed board. The purpose of industry should not be to reap great profits for the capitalists, but to improve the entire nation."

 UKR_introduce_progressive_taxation: "Introduce Progressive Taxation"
 UKR_introduce_progressive_taxation_desc: "It is common sense that the wealthiest are able to contribute more to the nation's coffers, and still stay wealthy. After all, taxes create the infrastructure and security their businesses rely on."
 UKR_the_retinue_plays_the_king: "The Retinue Plays the King"
 UKR_the_retinue_plays_the_king_desc: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi was always surrounded by a wide circle of advisors and confidants. Some of them had a particularly strong influence on the Hetman and were among those primarily responsible for the regrettable state of our country. Danylo without a doubt will surround himself with a coterie of his own and we must ensure that it is composed of people who will not encourage the new Hetman to abuse his power."
 UKR_uniting_symbol: "Uniting Symbol"
 UKR_uniting_symbol_desc: "With the Hetman's office rendered practically powerless the threat of its executive overreach is no more. From now on the Hetman will become a symbol of national unity and sovereignty, with little actual involvement in the day-to-day political affairs of the state."
 UKR_tour_the_country: "Tour the Country"
 UKR_tour_the_country_desc: "Pavlo was often accused of being elitist, a man in an ivory tower, an aristocrat detached from the common people.

 UKR_bring_justice_to_all: "Bring Justice to All"

 UKR_safeguarding_constitutional_order_desc: "We have made for ourselves a democratic, constitutionalist state that is elected by the people and for the people - but it has only been so long, and some want to overturn all the progress we have made.

 UKR_legacy_of_tup_desc: "Prior to 1917, the so-called \"Society of Ukrainian Progressives\" greatly advocated for democracy, autonomy and Ukrainian cultural and national development. By invoking memories of this society we can further bring about cooperation and reapproachment between the government and the progressive, socialist organisations."
 UKR_lone_pillar_of_progress: "Lone Pillar of Progress"
 UKR_lone_pillar_of_progress_desc: "The Radical Democratic Party was arguably most responsible for the current state of affairs, acting as the main mediator between the right wing and the VDR. Now that they have won the election, it is only right that they alone will bear the torch of progress and lead Ukraine to a bright future."
 UKR_restrict_authority_of_cossack_councils: "Restrict Authority of Cossack Councils"
 UKR_restrict_authority_of_cossack_councils_desc: "For too long have cossack councils organised to stamp out rebellion or deciding local governance. They shall be restricted to a purely ceremonial and cultural role, one that we will surely appreciate them for."
 UKR_new_administrative_divisions: "New Administrative Divisions"
 UKR_new_administrative_divisions_desc: "The administrative regions of the Hetmanate are largely based on those from the old Tsarist days, and the state has thus been rather centralised around [202.GetName]. To correct this we shall redraw our administrative divisions and give more power to local authorities."
 UKR_austromarxist_approach: "Austromarxist Approach"
 UKR_austromarxist_approach_desc: "The Austro-Marxists seek to synthetise belief in the nation-state with social principles of Marxist thought. While these ideas have had some support in Ukraine before, we must support them more strongly and seek to instil healthy national pride in our own revolutionary left, to make them supporters of our state rather than its enemies."
 UKR_principle_of_cultural_national_autonomy: "Principle of Cultural-National Autonomy"
 UKR_principle_of_cultural_national_autonomy_desc: "Regional autonomies such as the one in Crimea only serve the regional majorities, and fail to properly support most national minorities in Ukraine. Instead, the concept of cultural-national autonomy will grant cultural associations their own freedoms, and leave the citizens free to associate with whichever group they prefer."
 UKR_condemn_revolutionary_violence: "Condemn Revolutionary Violence"
 UKR_condemn_revolutionary_violence_desc: "We have allowed the socialists to participate in the democratic process as long as they do not attempt to overthrow the state. Reminding them of their promises will ensure that we remain stable and do not succumb to the same revolutionary violence from before."
 UKR_at_arms_length_from_politics: "At Arms Length from Politics"
 UKR_at_arms_length_from_politics_desc: "In the old Hetmanate, the military, police and secret services often worked plotting against the government, instead of serving it responsibly and dutifully. We must correct this."
 UKR_victory_of_the_fatherland: "Victory of the Fatherland"
 UKR_victory_of_the_fatherland_desc: "Those who called Hetman Danylo's reform efforts idealistic or foolish have now been silenced, and we have now shown why they are necessary. Victory against Russia has been achieved, and it was because Ukrainians were in unity rather than disarray. It's now time we begin a long-deserved era of peace, freedom and solidarity."
 UKR_integration_of_eastern_regions_2: "Integration of the Eastern Regions"
 UKR_integration_of_eastern_regions_2_desc: "The military government of the eastern regions can finally be disbanded, and the long work to integrate these areas to Ukraine proper can be started. While partisan activity during the war was strong, after the surrender of Russia mentalities have changed. Our Russophone community has been priceless in our outreach to these areas."
 UKR_red_tinted_hetmanate: "A Hetmanate with a Red Tint"
 UKR_red_tinted_hetmanate_desc: "The URDP government only laid the groundwork that the USDRP is to finish. Welfare programmes, healthcare for all, a comprehensive social safety net - all these demands will be put in place with the social democratic victory. The ban on the USDRP running in the elections during Pavlo's reign, in the end, never destroyed the belief that democratic and evolutionary socialism could be Ukraine's future."
 UKR_four_more_years_of_progress: "Four More Years of Progress"
 UKR_four_more_years_of_progress_desc: "Who could say that the URDP is not the torchbearer of Ukrainian progressivism, of the Ukrainian national development, the architect of the great Hetmanist compromise, and the party of those who led Ukraine to victory? It is only natural that the URDP once again leads a majority government, and under peace, we shall surely accomplish some of our more ambitious goals."
 UKR_in_defence_of_the_old: "In Defence of Tradition"
 UKR_in_defence_of_the_old_desc: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi was the architect of free Ukraine - and Danylo perfected his vision. Far from being defeated after the elections, the conservatives from the UDKhP and the liberals from the URDP now control the Soim, and they shall continue that vision in their own image."
 UKR_a_hetmans_legacy: "A Hetman's Legacy"
 UKR_a_hetmans_legacy_desc: "Was the late Pavlo Skoropadskyi's death a tragic accident, or an opportunity? Was he an elitist who only sought power, or a caring father of the nation who guided it through tumultous times? Was he a usurper who stole the mantle of the Ukrainian national movement, or a patriot who rightfully deserved it? Perhaps the future will have answers to such questions, but for now, let's focus on the present."

### SHD/PatAut Focuses ###
 UKR_all_the_hetmans_men: "All the Hetman's Men"
 UKR_all_the_hetmans_men_desc: "Ultimately it has come down to the Hetman and the loyal men in the SHD to save Ukraine from syndicalism. While Petliura and his lackeys may have fled, traitors still lurk from the shadows, ready to backstab the Hetman and bring the nation into civil war again. With a more responsible government now in place, we can ensure the enemies of Ukraine are put in their place!"
 UKR_a_united_organisation: "A United Organisation"
 UKR_a_united_organisation_desc: "The SHD must become a well-oiled political machine, its members united by a common cause and championing stability and security the state so desperately needs. There should be no tolerance for dissent and no room for cheap populism — only the unshakeable belief in the wisdom of our Hetman."
 UKR_will_of_the_cossack_nation: "Will of the Cossack Nation"
 UKR_will_of_the_cossack_nation_desc: "We are the brethren of the Cossack nation, our state drawing its lineage from the Zaporizhian Host. With the restoration of the Hetmanate and the formal reestablishment of the Cossack social estate in 1918 a crucial link with our great past was renewed. But it is not enough. The Cossackdom should become a spiritual backbone of our society, thus completing our return to the glory of old."
 UKR_reestablish_hetmans_headquarters: "Reestablish Hetman's Headquarters"
 UKR_reestablish_hetmans_headquarters_desc: "The Hetman's Headquarters, created in 1918, was a body tasked with supplying the intelligence on the matters of national politics and security directly to the Hetman, in addition to its responsibilities for his personal protection. The structure remained mostly defunct since the early 1920s. This egregious limitation of the Hetman's powers proved to be a great mistake and must be quickly rectified."
 UKR_responsible_government: "Responsible Government"
 UKR_responsible_government_desc: "With the indefinite suspension of the Soim, a government more accommodating to the Hetman must be established. From now on the Hetman's will be carried out by truly loyal servants, with the Council of Ministers, composed from the people carefully picked by the SHD, taking on the burden of legislative authority in addition to its usual executive responsibilities."
 UKR_knightly_virtues: "Knightly Virtues"
 UKR_knightly_virtues_desc: "Only a people strong in knightly spirit, infused with deep faith and love for the Motherland will build an independent state and defend it from enemies. Only the chivalric traditions developed over the ages and sanctified by the blood sacrifice of our ancestors will give invincible strength to our nation."
 UKR_further_centralisation_of_state: "Further Centralisation of State"
 UKR_further_centralisation_of_state_desc: "To ensure dominance over the political system, we must return to a policy of the 1918 constitution, where instead of regional leaders being elected locally, they will be appointed from [202.GetName]. This will bring further control of the SHD in not only national, but local affairs."
 UKR_mutually_beneficial_agreement: "Mutually Beneficial Agreement"
 UKR_mutually_beneficial_agreement_desc: "Cooperation with the VSZV and Protofis can only be mutually beneficial. In exchange for their valuable support for the government, they will be able to attract investors and ensure a flow of business that will bring our industrialisation efforts to greater heights."
 UKR_gears_of_industry: "Gears of Industry"
 UKR_gears_of_industry_desc: "With large support from Protofis, Ukraine's industrial might could soar - it will take part in Ukraine's transition from an agrarian economy to a nation of true industrial prowess."
 UKR_well_deserved_compensation: "Well Deserved Compensation"
 UKR_well_deserved_compensation_desc: "While land reform must continue, it is no secret that many of the wealthier landowners have voiced their opposition. In exchange for support of the SHD, we will consider their financial compensation, and limit our breakup of larger estates to only the most inefficient ones."
 UKR_curtail_capitalism_excesses: "Curtail Capitalism's Excesses"
 UKR_curtail_capitalism_excesses_desc: "Many have pointed out that unfettered capitalism is what brought Ukraine to ruin in the first place. Poor peasants and small landowners were affected the most by the crisis, and in these times we must not bend to industrialists and large landholders who will certainly only worsen our problems."
 UKR_favour_loyal_landowners: "Favour Loyal Landowners"
 UKR_favour_loyal_landowners_desc: "As the state commissions for land redistribution continue, we should consider the political allegiances of landowners. Those with allegiance to the SHD will be eligible for compensation and receive greater benefits than those with more questionable loyalties."
 UKR_favour_loyal_landowners_tt: "Beware, as overall §Oland reform§! increases, the §Cstability§! that can be gained increases while reducing the immediate bonus to §Oland reform.§!"
 UKR_empower_financial_council: "Empower Financial Council"
 UKR_empower_financial_council_desc: "For the betterment of Ukraine, financial policy must be guided by the Hetman and those loyal to him, not by wealthy industrialists who only seek to line their own pockets. To this end we will empower the Financial Council, the highest institution concerning matters of state credit, loans and money circulation, and ensure that its deliberations are brought to the Hetman's attention."
 UKR_expand_union_membership: "Expand Membership of the Union"
 UKR_expand_union_membership_desc: "Many believe that the SHD was only able to come to the forefront of Ukrainian politics due to the crises that hit our nation in the wake of Black Monday. They have a point, but there is a solution - we will reach out to members of the Hetman's previous coalition and bring them into the SHD, ensuring it becomes a mass organisation."
 UKR_in_defence_of_law_and_order: "In Defence of Law and Order"
 UKR_in_defence_of_law_and_order_desc: "Peace and freedom cannot come to the Ukrainian people without law and order. The SHD is the only thing keeping Ukraine from falling into chaos and syndicalist revolution again - as such, the current ban on strikes will continue. Additionally, press censorship shall be enacted, to ensure that the average citizen do not get dangerous ideas."
 UKR_the_red_menace: "The Red Menace"
 UKR_the_red_menace_desc: "As proven time and time again both in Ukraine as well as the rest of the world, independent unions are a hotbed for syndicalist activity. All unions not under the oversight of the government shall be dissolved, and potential socialist agents shall be put under constant surveillance to protect the state."
 UKR_discipline_and_obedience: "Discipline and Obedience"
 UKR_discipline_and_obedience_desc: "During the uprising many soldiers, officers and even generals defected to the rebels. And among those that did not were members that aired \"criticisms\" of our regime. A comprehensive review of the military must be conducted so we can root out such disloyal elements, and enshrine SHD supervision over the military."
 UKR_loyalty_and_its_rewards: "Loyalty and its Rewards"
 UKR_loyalty_and_its_rewards_desc: "The SHD's dominance over the political system cannot be achieved without the participation of large sectors of society. To this end, membership in the union shall be a prerequisite for acquiring jobs in the civil service, police and military."
 UKR_line_of_succession: "Line of Succession"
 UKR_line_of_succession_desc: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi is an ageing man, and it will come one day that a new Hetman will lead Ukraine to glory once again. We must enshrine his succession into law, so His Most Serene Majesty Hetman of All Ukraine may one day lead the nation in the SHD's image."
 UKR_father_of_nation: "Father of the Nation"
 UKR_father_of_nation_desc: "Time and time again Pavlo Skoropadskyi has led us, through times of stability and in times of turmoil, through times of peace and times of war. He is an example to all the people of Ukraine, whether they be Ukrainian, Russian, Tatar or Jew, of how to be a leader. We should embrace his cult of personality so the next generation knows who to look up to and emulate."
 UKR_ukraine_faithful_son: "Ukraine's Faithful Son"
 UKR_ukraine_faithful_son_desc: "The idea of the Ukrainian Hetmanship is the idea of a new monarchism. While Pavlo Skoropadskyi may be a great man, he is merely a part of the far greater tradition. The Hetmanship is a symbol of the unity of the Ukrainian Nation and the strength of the Ukrainian State, personified in the person of a traditional, national, hereditary Hetman."
 UKR_mining_mechanisation: "Mining Mechanisation"
 UKR_mining_mechanisation_desc: "To improve our resource management and efficiency, we shall invest in mining mechanisation tools, which will allow us to access Ukraine's vast, untapped natural resources more effectively."
 UKR_everything_for_the_fatherland: "Everything for the Fatherland"
 UKR_everything_for_the_fatherland_desc: "For now, the only guarantor of Ukrainian peace is through its strength. We are the only ones who realise that the armed forces must be the center of our attention, lest Ukraine succumb to Russian aggression. Therefore, the budget for the military - already quite high in comparison to some of our neighbors - will be increased. Some may complain, but there is only one way to keep the Ukrainian state alive."

 UKR_unbroken_resolve: "Unbroken Resolve"
 UKR_unbroken_resolve_desc: "Syndicalists agitated against us. Republicans revolted against our rule. Even those supposedly loyal to Skoropadskyi doubted us. Yet only we can claim to have defended the Ukrainian nation from its greatest threat yet. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Hetman!"
 UKR_true_heirs_of_rus: "True Heirs of Rus"
 UKR_true_heirs_of_rus_desc: "Ukraine is the state most deserving of the mantle of legitimate heir to the [202.GetName]an Rus. We should utilise this image in order to legitimise our rule over the newly acquired territories, underlining our cultural affinity with the Russian people, while not diminishing our distinct national character."
 UKR_a_nation_on_the_march: "A Nation on the March"
 UKR_a_nation_on_the_march_desc: "With the war over we can now begin the \"democratisation\" process. Under the benevolent direction of the Hetman and the SHD, the Ukrainian nation will be able to achieve previously unimaginable heights!"
 UKR_partial_lift_of_electoral_restrictions: "Partial Lift of Electoral Restrictions"
 UKR_partial_lift_of_electoral_restrictions_desc: "We shall pass a law that gives the state new authority to determine what political parties may run for election. Since the law will be constructed by the SHD-led Council of Ministers, we will have nothing to fear of the future."
 UKR_the_hetmans_gift: "The Hetman's Gift"
 UKR_the_hetmans_gift_desc: "The election and new constitution shall be the Hetman's greatest gift to the people of Ukraine. Without the Hetman and the party of his followers, the SHD, there would no longer be any Ukraine at all. Let this fact be known for a thousand years!"
 UKR_the_right_hand_of_hetman: "The Hetman's Right Hand"
 UKR_the_right_hand_of_hetman_desc: "Otaman-Minister Poltavets-Ostrianytsia has made himself the irreplaceable right hand man of the Hetman, often easing his burden of rulership in the darkest times of the war. In the new Ukraine, this dutiful follower must be acknowledged as just as important of a war hero as Skoropadskyi himself was."
 UKR_more_than_a_myth: "More Than a Myth"
 UKR_more_than_a_myth_desc: "The Cossack Radas are not simple cultural organisations, but guardians of Ukrainian national pride. A great number of seats in the Soim must be dedicated to the Cossacks as a reward for their patriotic work, and to safeguard future course of Ukraine."
 UKR_puppet_with_a_mace: "Puppet With a Mace"
 UKR_puppet_with_a_mace_desc: "Poltavets-Ostrianytsia's power is almost solidified. To finally consolidate it, a purge of \"Homzynites\", the only real competing clique within the SHD, is of utmost necessity. Once they are forced out of political power, all that remains is Otaman-Minister Poltavets-Ostrianytsia as Hetman in all but name."

## AuthDem (USKhD) Focuses ##
 UKR_the_center_holds: "The Centre Holds"
 UKR_the_center_holds_desc: "The election of [GetYear] has resulted in the Hetman's Coalition being at the forefront of power once again. Only time will tell if Serhii Shemet's appointment as Otaman-Minister will lead to the USKhD's success or if the UDKhP will usurp them."
 UKR_restore_order_in_the_countryside: "Restore Order in the Countryside"
 UKR_restore_order_in_the_countryside_desc: "Compared to the urban centres, where Skoropadskyi and the government enjoyed the most support, the rural countryside still continues to be a hotbed of leftist activity and support for the VDR. Order must be restored, and quickly."
 UKR_fate_of_the_shd: "Fate of the SHD"
 UKR_fate_of_the_shd_desc: "During the civil war, the Union of Hetmanites-State Builders repeatedly attempted to thwart the Hetman's government and take power for themselves. While we must move carefully against some of these conspirators, they will have to be dealt with one way or another."
 UKR_reorganisation_of_cossack_councils: "Reorganisation of Cossack Councils"
 UKR_reorganisation_of_cossack_councils_desc: "The revolt is now over and as such we can now take a closer look at the roles of the Great and Local Cossack Radas. A reexamination of their paramilitary activities as well as policing functions in exchange for supporting their autonomy in local affairs would likely be best."
 UKR_cooperation_under_state_guidance: "Cooperation under State Guidance"
 UKR_cooperation_under_state_guidance_desc: "The cooperative movement in Ukraine has strengthened the economic power of the workers and peasants and have taught them responsibility to their land as well as each other. With state intervention we can help to organise these cooperative movements as well as root out any socialist sympathisers within them."
 UKR_necessary_compromise: "Necessary Compromise"
 UKR_necessary_compromise_desc: "While many would paint the coalition between VSZV and Protofis as having disproportionate influence in our government and being the primary reason for the failure of the land reform projects nearly a decade ago, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks; our cooperation with VSZV/Protofis has brought about significant economic growth. Let us continue this cooperation."
 UKR_end_alliance_with_vszv_protofis: "End Alliance with VSZV/Protofis"
 UKR_end_alliance_with_vszv_protofis_desc: "The coalition between VSZV and Protofis, while having been important in the early days of the Hetmanate, have outlived its usefulness in our government, and they have been at least partially responsible for the failure of our earlier land reform projects. This time around, we shall no longer be held to the whims of the landowning and industrialist lobby."
 UKR_industrial_subsidies: "Industrial Subsidies"
 UKR_industrial_subsidies_desc: "We can bolster our industrialisation efforts by providing Protofis with much-needed subsidies and state contracts - their invaluable expertise and know-how will give us the necessary resources to fuel our efforts in furthering our nation's grand industrialisation projects."
 UKR_expand_land_credit_bank: "Expand Land Credit Bank"
 UKR_expand_land_credit_bank_desc: "To bolster our agricultural sector, the national bank will be responsible for providing affordable loans to farmers, where they can purchase fertilisers and invest in mechanisation of agriculture."

 UKR_support_state_unions: "Support State Unions"
 UKR_support_state_unions_desc: "By expanding official state-controlled labour unions, we can ensure that our workers receive proper representation and benefits, while also safeguarding our nation from the dangers of socialist influence."
 UKR_curb_populist_rhetoric: "Curb Populist Rhetoric"
 UKR_curb_populist_rhetoric_desc: "Both the VSZV and our government have a vested interest in preventing socialist rhetoric that has led to peasants violently attacking big landowners. By broadcasting propaganda messages speaking against this demagoguery we can ensure our alliance with the VSZV remains and ensure stability in the countryside."
 UKR_extensive_nationalisation_program: "Extensive Nationalisation"
 UKR_extensive_nationalisation_program_desc: "The institution of Social Corporatism can ensure that the interests of all - workers, employers, the state - can be accounted for and create a stable and harmonious system of governance. To that end, we shall pursue nationalisation of certain sectors, such as the forests, railways and coal mines."
 UKR_diversification_of_exports: "Diversification of Exports"
 UKR_diversification_of_exports_desc: "Ukraine is often known as the \"Breadbasket of Europe\" for a good reason, owing to the large amounts of grain that our state exports. Black Monday has shown, however, that our economy can be quite vulnerable to sudden fluctuations. By exporting new raw materials we can reduce our reliance on grain and ensure further financial stability."
 UKR_classocratic_principle: "Classocratic Principle"
 UKR_classocratic_principle_desc: "The core tenet of the Agrarians-Statists is of political representation - we must reject the idea of representation through petty party politicking and parliamentarism and instead focus our attention towards class. Only by pursuing representation of the producing classes - namely the agrarian and working class - can we create a just society."
 UKR_empower_class_aristocracy: "Empower the Class Aristocracy"
 UKR_empower_class_aristocracy_desc: "Only the best and brightest of the agrarian class, the most diligent and hard-working of the labourers, can be fit to lead.

 UKR_leading_role_of_agrarian_class: "Leading Role of the Agrarian Class"
 UKR_leading_role_of_agrarian_class_desc: "The Ukrainian state has been, since its inception, an agrarian one, and this continues to ring true today. With the Ukrainian way of life dependent on agriculture, it is the responsibility of the agrarian class to play the leading role, above all others, in governance. To this end, its representatives shall receive more seats in local class assemblies."
 UKR_mysticism_and_imperialism: "Mysticism and Imperialism"
 UKR_mysticism_and_imperialism_desc: "According to Lypynskyi's ideas, mysticism - utmost faith in the correctness of one's own beliefs, and imperialism - the will to power, desire to rule and organise, are the main characteristics of a successful political movement. Only the Agrarians-Statists have the most clear vision for the future of the Ukrainian state. As such, its main ruling body, the Council of Jurors, must guide the legislative and executive functions of the state."
 UKR_put_end_to_parliamentarian_chaos: "Put an End to Parliamentarian Chaos"
 UKR_put_end_to_parliamentarian_chaos_desc: "Parliamentarism, supposedly meant to represent the commoner's interest, has only led to degeneracy and petty politicking. It is about time we put a final end to this disastrous institution; the Soim shall be replaced with the All-Ukrainian Class Assembly, and with the restriction of political parties, class organisation shall be the sole form of political representation."
 UKR_eliminate_threat_of_ochlocracy: "Eliminate the Threat of Ochlocracy"
 UKR_eliminate_threat_of_ochlocracy_desc: "One thing binding the Borotbysts and the League's nationalists together, in their demagoguery and nonsensical populist rhetoric, is their belief in mob rule - eventually creating a heavily authoritarian, top-down dictatorship. We must defend against these radicals at every turn."
 UKR_lord_of_land_order_labour: "The Lord of Land, Order and Labour"
 UKR_lord_of_land_order_labour_desc: "The proper role of the monarch should be to reign as a personified symbol of Ukrainian nationhood. A good model to replicate would be that of the British monarchy, where traditions, along with the expectations of the masses and the elites, have defined the monarch's role in politics. Our Hetmanate, and thus our Hetman, shall follow this ideal."
 UKR_support_loyal_intelligentsia: "Support Loyal Intelligentsia"
 UKR_support_loyal_intelligentsia_desc: "Many who do not belong to the producing classes - the lawyers, teachers, scientists, physicians and others, still are necessary for the functioning of society and governance.

 UKR_the_highest_moral_authority: "The Highest Moral Authority"
 UKR_the_highest_moral_authority_desc: "Ukraine is a primarily Orthodox country, and as such Orthodox Christianity should serve as the example of moral purity for all Ukrainians.

 UKR_territorial_patriotism: "Territorial Patriotism"
 UKR_territorial_patriotism_desc: "Linguistical and ethnic chauvinism are plagues that have only sowed division and destruction.

 UKR_our_place_in_history: "Our Place in History"
 UKR_our_place_in_history_desc: "Victory over Russia has proved the inherent superiority of the classocratic system of national organisation - even imperfectly implemented - over any competing system.

 UKR_against_the_law_of_capital: "Against the Law of Capital"
 UKR_against_the_law_of_capital_desc: "The law of capital is the law of nameless shareholders, of stock gamblers, of adventurists and plutocrats, always at odds with the healthy and creative forces of nation.

 UKR_dedication_and_will: "Dedication and Will"
 UKR_dedication_and_will_desc: "Much has been done since the ascension of the USKhD and much more remains to be done.

 UKR_after_the_storm_desc: "The war has been won; now it is time to win the peace.

 UKR_justice_at_last: "Justice at Last"
 UKR_justice_at_last_desc: "It is insufficient to simply promise to defend basic rights and liberties of our citizens. Only by punishing each attempt of encroaching on civil liberties can we prevent the rise of yet another SHD trying to subvert our democracy in the future."
 UKR_amend_anti_socialist_laws: "Amend Anti-Socialist Laws"
 UKR_amend_anti_socialist_laws_desc: "The war proved the loyalty of many Ukrainians, even ones who previously opposed the Hetman.

As long as they share our vision of a stable and lawful Hetmanate, they are welcome to join us in building the nation."
 UKR_reject_partisanship: "Reject Partisanship"
 UKR_reject_partisanship_desc: "Reform - yes. Repeating our old mistakes? Absolutely not. Democracy is valuable, but it must not be put above the national good.

 UKR_the_left_wing_unity: "Strength in Unity"
 UKR_the_left_wing_unity_desc: "In order to withstand an assault of counterrevolution we must put aside petty differences and forge an alliance between all truly revolutionary forces. Formal party affiliation matters less than faithful adherence to the ideals of our liberatory struggle."
 UKR_question_of_ideological_rivals: "Deal with the Petliurites"
 UKR_question_of_ideological_rivals_desc: "We must not forget about the traitors who tried to hide their deeply bourgeois nature behind the thin veil of \"reformism\" and \"progressivism\". Chief among those have rallied around the Petliurite flag and they must be dealt with in accordance with revolutionary necessity."
 UKR_from_shopfloors_to_the_trenches: "From Shopfloors To The Trenches"
 UKR_from_shopfloors_to_the_trenches_desc: "To arms! We call for everyone able to fight to rise and defend the revolutionary cause. The reactionary forces all around us are plotting to snuff out the flame of our rebellion, and it is our duty to prevent this by any means necessary."
 UKR_recruit_the_red_militia: "Arm The Red Guard"
 UKR_recruit_the_red_militia_desc: "Those who joined our struggle when our success was far from ensured have amply proven their dedication and loyalty. They will serve as a core around which our new revolutionary cohorts will be raised."
 UKR_establish_the_council_of_deputies: "Establish The Council of Deputies"
 UKR_establish_the_council_of_deputies_desc: "The farce of bourgeois parliamentarism has finally come to an end. In the place of an assembly tasked primarily with the preservation of an unjust social order will arise a new one, dedicated to the faithful representation of the working masses."
 UKR_dismantle_pillars_of_exploitation: "Dismantle Pillars of Exploitation"
 UKR_dismantle_pillars_of_exploitation_desc: "For far too long were the fruits of one's labour unjustly appropriated by exploitative classes. Through total control of industrial, agricultural and financial spheres they continuously ensured their prosperity at the expense of the common people. Thus, our primary task is to destroy the very foundations upon which this wrongful system was built."
 UKR_a_constitution_for_the_working_people: "A Constitution for the Working People"
 UKR_a_constitution_for_the_working_people_desc: "The very core of the new revolutionary order will be defined by this principal law. It will become a true manifestation of people's will, embodying in itself ideals of liberation and justice. The political system built around it will ensure that the achievements of our struggle always remain properly preserved."
 UKR_primacy_of_labour_collectives: "Primacy of Labour Collectives"
 UKR_primacy_of_labour_collectives_desc: "The economical development of our country on both state and regional levels should be overseen by direct representatives of those who toil in the field, in the mine or on the factory floor. Organised in the Unions of Producers and Consumers, they will be able to ensure that proposed economic policies respect the needs of the working people."
 UKR_guidance_of_the_councils: "Guidance of the Councils"
 UKR_guidance_of_the_councils_desc: "The final authority on the questions of economy should belong to the Council of Deputies and regional peasants' and workers' councils - with trade unions and cooperatives fulfilling an advisory role. This will allow us to streamline and rationalise the process of economic planning and ensure maximum efficiency of economic development."
 UKR_peace_for_the_nations: "Peace for the Nations"
 UKR_peace_for_the_nations_desc: "The hydra of chauvinism and bourgeois nationalism must be slain without remorse. Various peoples living in Ukraine should enjoy the state protection of their basic national rights and have the ability to defend their interests through special representative bodies."
 UKR_foster_revolutionary_fervour: "Foster Revolutionary Fervour"
 UKR_foster_revolutionary_fervour_desc: "The ideological front is as important as the military one. Years of oppression have left many Ukrainians confused as to who are their real enemies. We need to winnow out small-proprietor instincts and the petit bourgeois mentality, still lingering among certain social stratums, and strengthen their revolutionary consciousness by means of education and propaganda."
 UKR_justice_for_the_workers: "Justice for the Workers"
 UKR_justice_for_the_workers_desc: "No honest toiler should ever face an unjust or indifferent treatment. It should be ensured that labour tied to health hazards is duly compensated, working hours are limited, and workplace conditions are always kept in a decent state."
 UKR_volobuievs_great_experiment: "Volobuiev's Great Experiment"
 UKR_volobuievs_great_experiment_desc: "Seen as a promising innovator by some and naїvely eccentric by others, Mykhailo Volobuiev is known for his distinct views on questions of economic development. Still, he became a preferred choice of newly appointed First Deputy Chairman Kovaliv and now has the opportunity to prove that the economical strategy advocated by him is something more than a collection of vague theoretical constructs."
 UKR_the_organic_development: "The Organic Development"
 UKR_the_organic_development_desc: "For too long the full realisation of Ukrainian economic potential was hampered by foreign exploitation: firstly by the Tsarist regime, later by the capitalists of Berlin and Vienna. But enough is enough. In order to take a proper place among economies of soon-to-be liberated Europe we must direct our efforts towards the attainment of economic self-sufficiency. Thankfully, Ukraine has all the resources needed for such an endeavour."
 UKR_decentralised_economic_planning: "Decentralised Economic Planning"
 UKR_decentralised_economic_planning_desc: "The legacy of Ukraine being treated as a part of a larger imperial whole is still apparent when it comes to economic planning. However, each Ukrainian economic region has its unique conditions, so the delegation of sufficient powers to regional planning committees is of paramount importance. Local governments in tandem with trade unions and workers' cooperatives will be able to devise plans for economic development in accordance with their capabilities and needs."
 UKR_proletarian_offensive: "Proletarian Offensive"
 UKR_proletarian_offensive_desc: "A true fighting spirit is forged among the deafening noise of factories and in the depths of dimly lit mines. Armed with clarity of purpose and unwavering conviction, the industrial proletariat will fight at the very forefront of revolutionary struggle."
 UKR_industrial_evolution: "The Industrial Evolution"
 UKR_industrial_evolution_desc: "The harmonious and rational development of Ukrainian industrial capabilities will lay down necessary foundations for stable economic growth. This will strengthen the position of Ukraine as an organic subject of the world and regional economy. When our neighbours are finally free from capitalist yoke, cooperation with the strong Ukrainian economy will help them to rebuild and secure prosperity in the future."
 UKR_revolution_in_culture: "Revolution in Culture"
 UKR_revolution_in_culture_desc: "Revolution will bring forth a cultural renaissance of unprecedented proportions. High and proudly will be carried a torch of new, proletarian art. Tremble, false troubadours of bourgeois mediocrity - the new world we are so fiercely fighting for won't have a place for your kind."
 UKR_hrynkos_orthodox_approach: "Hrynko's Orthodox Approach"
 UKR_hrynkos_orthodox_approach_desc: "Demanding, firm and determined - that is how Hryhorii Hrynko is usually described by fellow Borotbysts. It is no surprise, then, that with the support of First Deputy Chairman Poloz, Hrynko's party career quickly took off. Will his steadfast nature help him in forging a lasting compromise between sometimes disparate revolutionary forces? Only time will tell."
 UKR_french_example: "The French Example"
 UKR_french_example_desc: "Paris - a bright torch of liberation and progress, relentlessly fighting against the dark European night. Its light will guide our struggle: French institutions will serve as a blueprint for ours, French revolutionary traditions will inform our decisions, and the selfless bravery of Communard martyrs will perpetually inspire us to new heights of heroism."
 UKR_united_vanguard: "United Vanguard"
 UKR_united_vanguard_desc: "Only by building a strong, enduring alliance between the urban proletariat and rural masses can we fully realise the revolutionary potential of our people. The united vanguard of workers and peasants will sweep away forces of reaction and counterrevolution, bringing us closer to a world where no labouring man knows oppression and injustice."
 UKR_systemic_compromise: "The Systemic Compromise"
 UKR_systemic_compromise_desc: "A key word: balance. Balance between industrial and agricultural, balance between councils and trade unions, balance between internationalism and loyalty to the Fatherland. It is hard to keep the equilibrium, and it is said that compromise leaves no one happy, but we know better: lean on one side too hard and the entire fragile system inevitably goes down."
 UKR_inevitable_future_of_the_world: "Inevitable Future of the World"
 UKR_inevitable_future_of_the_world_desc: "A simple and undeniable truth: the age of bourgeois empires and nation-states will one day come to an end. In its place, a new world will rise: a world of sister republics united around principles of socialist solidarity, progress and common good. Though this outcome is ensured, the fight for it is far from finished, and our place shall be at the forefront of this struggle."

We have prevailed over the Hetman, over the Russians, over the Germans - and more than anything, we have prevailed staying true to our democratic values and institutions. After so many dark days of war and death, it was hard to believe that the sun would ever again shine for the Ukrainian people... but now the guns have fallen silent, and that day seems to be at hand."

 UKR_from_democracy_to_communism: "From Democracy to Communism"
 UKR_from_democracy_to_communism_desc: "One day, the political forces that once made up the Workers' Democratic Union will come to an end. All revolutionary forces shall be properly unified under one banner, one party, to represent the Ukrainian proletariat. To achieve this goal, for now the R-RB shall be a first among equals in the revolutionary movement, guiding the eventual march to the commmunist ideal."
 UKR_utopian_ruralism: "Utopian Ruralism"
 UKR_utopian_ruralism_desc: "The Ukrainian village is the spiritual cradle and true backbone of the Ukrainian nation. The UPS-R may have suffered many splits before over various issues, but now that it is at the forefront of the revolutionary movement, it is time these minute differences be set aside. Protecting the Ukrainian land and preserving its purity is paramount for our national development."
 UKR_all_peoples_revolutionary_front: "All-People's Revolutionary Front"
 UKR_all_peoples_revolutionary_front_desc: "Though the greater revolutionary good has been achieved, let us not forget what brought us there: compromises and coalitions. It is foolish to argue that this is now a time to bicker amongst ourselves just because the threats of foreign domination have mostly faded away. The UPS-R will represent not just those who strive for radical social change and action, but the whole of the Ukrainian peasantry, the rural and urban proletariat."
 UKR_revolutionary_tradition: "Revolutionary Tradition"
 UKR_revolutionary_tradition_desc: "Taras Shevchenko, Lesia Ukrainka, Ivan Franko, Mykhailo Drahomanov and many others who were instrumental for the development of the modern Ukrainian nation - all of them were bearers of revolutionary ethos. The struggle for justice and freedom permeates the very core of Ukrainian identity.

 UKR_mistakes_of_1925_desc: "We cannot repeat our mistakes of 1925, when the government crackdown on Borotbysts was needlessly violent, often targeting civilians with no connection to the Borotbyst movement which just resulted in further insurrection. Instead, we must learn from our mistakes and ensure our crackdown on rebel forces does not turn the people against us."
 UKR_appeal_to_pacifism: "Appeal To Pacifism"
 UKR_appeal_to_pacifism_desc: "Appealing to pacifist tendencies would do much to bolster our legitimacy in the eyes of the people. The Hetman has already shown that he denounces the ongoing violence on both sides, and repeating his message would give the people renewed faith in the Hetman and his government."
 UKR_reach_out_to_urdp: "Reach Out To URDP"
 UKR_reach_out_to_urdp_desc: "The URDP may be in opposition to the Hetman's coalition, but even they can be of use. Reaching out to them would give us a great boost to our legitimacy, as it will be proof of our reformist tendencies in times where there are doubts that the government cares for the average citizen."
 UKR_undermine_vdr_legitimacy: "Undermine VDR Legitimacy"
 UKR_undermine_vdr_legitimacy_desc: "As unfortunate as it is, the VDR does wield great support among the population, but that support can be put into question in the minds of the populace. By exposing the radical Borotbyst tendencies in their ranks and reporting atrocities their forces commit against ours, we can ensure their legitimacy will crumble."
 UKR_promises_of_reforms: "Promises Of Reforms"
 UKR_promises_of_reforms_desc: "The revolt has yet to be suppressed and many of our citizens still give into their lies, but this situation is tenuous. If we are to truly break the revolt we must, for the time being at least, make concrete pledges for reform of the Hetmanate to reassure our new allies and the people."

 UKR_victories_of_1919: "Victories Of 1919"
 UKR_victories_of_1919_desc: "In dealing with the rebellion that the Hetman now faces, we should look to our victories in 1919. When anarchist and Borotbyst terrorists threatened to destroy the nation, the Hetman's forces were able to mount a successful counteroffensive. We should employ the same tactics here, and there shall be no mercy for traitors!"
 UKR_secure_the_military_apparatus: "Secure The Military Apparatus"
 UKR_secure_the_military_apparatus_desc: "The military has been hit especially hard by the revolt, plagued by mass defections and a complete breakdown in communications. The Hetman must reassert his position as Commander-In-Chief and remind the army just who they are meant to serve."
 UKR_purge_vdr_supporters: "Purge Republican Sympathisers"
 UKR_purge_vdr_supporters_desc: "There have been rumours that officials in our government have espoused republican ideals, and although little action was taken against them before, times are dire; at any moment they could declare their allegiance to the illegitimate \"People's Republic\". Conducting a wide-scale purge of republican officials and sympathisers will ensure they will be unable to take action against our government."
 UKR_expand_mil_police: "Expand Military Police Corps"
 UKR_expand_mil_police_desc: "An expansion of military police corps would aid us greatly, especially in the eastern lands, as the bulk of our forces are concentrated against the uprisings in the west. They will assist us in quelling uprisings and insurrections and arresting the key leaders of the VDR."
 UKR_retake_the_railroads: "Retake The Railways"

 UKR_dreams_of_1917_desc: "In 1917, Ukraine had high hopes and dreams of independence - dreams to become a sovereign state after centuries of foreign rule. This independence was to serve as a means of achieving political self-determination and democracy; to allow Ukrainians to govern themselves rather than be subject to the whims of foreign rulers. It is high time to make this dream a reality."

 UKR_distance_from_syndicalism: "Distance from Syndicalism"

 UKR_lessons_of_britain_and_france_desc: "The syndicalist nations of the West have achieved a great deal in their limited time of existence. So great are their achievements that one can only strive to emulate them. Therefore we must adapt their policies to the material conditions of our Ukraine."

 UKR_cure_primitive_ideology: "Cure the Curse of Primitive Ideology"
 UKR_cure_primitive_ideology_desc: "We condemn the antisocial reactionary spirit of so called \"hetmanist conservatism\". We reject the primitive materialism of socialism and demoliberalism.

 UKR_spiritual_mobilisation: "Mobilise the Spirit of the Nation"
 UKR_spiritual_mobilisation_desc: "The spiritual might of Ukrainian Nation lies dormant, constrained by the repugnant stagnancy of the so-called \"Hetmanate\".

The best and brightest representatives of our Nation will gather to formulate a legal, political and economical framework fully suitable for the needs of the National Revolution. The most important question on the agenda is as simple as it is crucial: upon whom will be conveyed the sacred task of guiding our State and Nation through these turbulent times?"

 UKR_annihilate_parasitic_exploitation_desc: "While we, contrary to socialist demagogy and democratic illusions, acknowledge that inequality is immanent to any society, we also understand that work is a creative and noble endeavour and its fruits should serve the entire society and not a few social parasites hiding behind a veil of anonymous capital."
 UKR_avoid_industrial_anarchy: "Avoid Industrial Anarchy"

 UKR_reward_peasants: "Reward the Peasantry"
 UKR_reward_peasants_desc: "Chafing under reactionary yoke of a big landowner, the Ukrainian peasantry was denied an opportunity to improve its regrettable material situation. Refusing to bear it any longer, the rural masses revolted and eventually paved the way for our takeover. It is time to put an end to previous injustices and ensure that the agrarian core of our nation has all the necessary means for its development."
 UKR_organic_economy: "An Organic Economy"
 UKR_organic_economy_desc: "While modern syndicalism poisoned the idea of professional representation as a base of economic organisation with soulless materialism and political anarchy, the core concept itself remains sound. By delegating questions of economic policy to dedicated bodies composed from representatives of various professional organisations, we will ensure that the process of economic development is guided in accordance with the needs of the entire nation."
 UKR_spiritual_labour: "Restore the Spirit and Purpose of Labour"
 UKR_spiritual_labour_desc: "Labour is what elevates a human individual over his basic animal self.

 UKR_cautious_reconciliation: "Cautious Reconciliation"
 UKR_cautious_reconciliation_desc: "The times are changing. Where the uncompromising rigidity was required, now flexibility might serve us better. With major threats overcome, the internal political scene can be made more open, as society cannot properly evolve under constant pressure.

The ardent revolutionary, widely regarded as the face of Ukrainian syndicalism, came from a humble family. Struggling to scrape by in his youth, it is no surprise he quickly embraced socialist ideals. His tales of childhood poverty have resonated among the poor and oppressed peoples of Ukraine, and in the eyes of the droves of supporters now standing by his side, Shumskyi has proven himself to be a die-hard revolutionary.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, Shumskyi would get his start by joining the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Union, where he would help organise peasant strikes. His revolutionary streak would continue in 1915, when he would join the UPS-R. After the February Revolution, he would be propelled to a position in the new republican government, but would quickly grow disappointed with the course the nation was taking. This led him to split from the UPS-R alongside his comrades to form the \"Borotbysts\", which would be chased underground after the Hetman's coup. His organisation would then transform into a guerilla force, one which would spark unrest among the Ukrainian populace for the next two decades.\n\nIndeed, his dedication to the socialist cause has taken him far. The hundreds of strikes, demonstrations and terror attacks have all culminated in his ascension to power. The \"batrak\" revolutionary, for better or worse, now dictates exactly where Ukraine shall go. Shumskyi will build the revolutionary state he has always dreamed of, or die trying.§!"

The skilled writer had initially been interested in studying law, but was expelled from the Kyiv University for his revolutionary activities. He would be arrested for provoking political agitation among Kyivan peasants, before being drafted into a disciplinary battalion in the Russian army, where he would spread revolutionary propaganda among his fellow soldiers. After being threatened with life in prison, Vynnychenko would spend nearly a decade in exile living under a false name.\n\nAfter the February Revolution in Russia, Vynnychenko would become the first president of the General Secretariat of Ukraine. He hoped to use his position to work towards creating an independent socialist Ukraine, but his hopes would ultimately be dashed by Skoropadskyi's coup. In exile once again, his disappointment with the USDRP's reformist course lead him to form the Council-Revolutionary Bloc. His new party, nonetheless, reconciled with the Social Democrats and joined the Ukrainian Socialist Bloc in 1933.\n\nNow, after decades of revolutionary struggle, Vynnychenko finds himself in charge of Ukraine once more.

Owing to his father's position as a teacher, his family often moved from place to place. An agronomist by trade, Hryhoriiv never ended up working in his profession, due to his unwillingness to participate in what he considered to be the \"exploitation of peasants\". He instead moved to Kyiv, where he adopted socialist views and became an agitator for several revolutionary parties.\n\nThe son of a teacher, he took after his father's profession and worked in several schools as a professor and pedagogue. Labelled an \"unreliable teacher\" as a result of his participation in a local teacher's union, he would be transferred to a school in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where he would join the local Prosvita and eventually become its leader. In 1915 he would be mobilised into the Russian army, though he would spent most of his time in the military writing.\n\nElected to the Central Rada in 1917 as a representative of the UPS-R, he went on to hold several positions in the republican government, first as the president of the Council of Soldiers' Deputies and later as the Minister of Education. Following the splits in his party, he headed the Organising Committee of the Central Current of the UPSR, which aimed to continue pursuing the party's original agenda. Exiled to Galicia alongside his fellow comrades, he'd spend much of his time writing for several socialist publications, including the official organ of the UPS-R, \"Trudova Ukraina\".\n\nAll of his life, Hryhoriiv waited for the day his utopian vision would come true.

Later, when the Ukrainian People's Republic was declared, he would serve multiple posts, becoming one of the leaders of the provincial government of Katerynoslav, and that same year he and Panas Fedenko would begin publishing the newspaper of the USDRP, \"Our Voice\", in Katerynoslav. Skoropadskyi's coup threw the people's republic into disarray, and Mazepa worked with the Ukrainian Revolutionary Committee to oppose the coup. At the beginning of January 1919, he received an invitation to the 6th Congress of the USDRP, at which the Katerynoslav delegation, in contrast to the Kyiv delegation, spoke against the establishment of the power of the Soviets and strongly opposed \"the dictatorship of the urban proletariat over the countryside\".

Nonetheless, his tenure in the government would not last long, as Skoropadskyi's putsch would send him into exile, and his beloved Republic into ruin. His underground revolutionary activity would continue in Galicia, this time targeted against the Hetman's government and its German backers.

But most importantly, he is Hetman, the undisputed leader of Ukraine.\n\nDrawing his lineage from an 18th century Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host, Skoropadskyi rose up through Tsarist military ranks in a flash. During the Ukrainian Revolution, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became a chief organiser of the Ukrainian Army Corps and the numerous Cossack Volunteer Units, all of which sought to combat pro-Bolshevik militias. An avid opponent of socialism, Skoropadskyi started plotting against the Ukrainian People's Republic with his allies among the landowners, capitalists, and military, before culminating in its overthrow on April 29, 1918. The so-called \"Ukrainian State\" was established, the Central Rada was abolished and Skoropadskyi seized full authority as Hetman, reversing the many reforms of the previous government. Still, Skoropadskyi promised to hold elections to the Soim as soon as the \"political and financial situation was stable again\".\n\nThe next year, Skoropadskyi would use his temporary powers to significant effect, as he and General Kostiantyn Prisovskyi, commanding troops flush with German military equipment, would crush Nestor Makhno's anarchist revolt with an iron fist. With the German victory in the Weltkrieg and the end of the Russian Civil War, Ukraine set in for a period of peace. In 1920, the Council of Ministers passed a new constitution, which gave significant judicial and legislative powers to the Soim and Senate but retained some of the Hetman's powers from the old constitution, including the ability to appoint the Otaman-Minister and to dissolve the Soim at will. Shortly after the 1924 elections, Skoropadskyi would form a grand coalition of right-wing parties and interest groups loyal to the Hetman, marking the beginning of a ruling circle that would rule Ukraine for fifteen years despite undergoing significant change over time. Skoropadskyi has defined the political landscape in Ukraine since its birth as a nation. Regardless of whether he is the tyrant and German puppet he is decried as, or whether he is the great symbol of Ukrainian unity and a vanguard against socialism he is praised as, none can deny he has made his mark on the country's history.§!"

The next year, he joined the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party and was elected by his division into the Congress of the Soviets in Petrograd, where he focused on opposing the war no matter what.\n\nBy late 1917, Volokh was a company commander in Kharkiv. He fled from the Bolsheviks and joined the \"Red Haidamaky\" aligned with Petliura's army, and clashed with the Bolsheviks multiple times. However, he refused to pledge fealty to Pavlo Skoropadskyi's regime, and resigned from the army.\n\nHis part in the Borotbyst uprising of 1925 is unclear, but it forced him to flee Ukraine in fear of imprisonment. In exile, Volokh turned from an apathetic socialist to a convinced revolutionary, and continued his officer's studies in International Military School in Paris in 1927-1930. Since then, Volokh has been one of the primary military organisers of the republican cause.§!"

He did not see fighting in the Russo-Japanese War, but led his 278th Kromsky Infantry Regiment in the Great War. He fought on the Galician frontlines and received the highest military honour of Order of St. George for bravery and skilled leadership. His regiment was almost wiped out when the Germans broke through at Gorlitskyi in 1916. Prisovskyi was wounded there, transferred to Kyiv, and later promoted to major general.\n\nAs Ukraine collapsed into civil war, Prisovskyi tried to rein in the chaos unsuccessfully. His unit was defeated in Kyiv with chemical weapons used by the Bolsheviks, and had to retreat and ally with Symon Petliura's republican forces. Prisovskyi made solid impressions on anyone he met - a tall, firm and calm man, intelligent and aristocratic yet could make mutinying Cossacks obey him with sheer force of will. He was also entirely ruthless, and took back Zhytomyr from the Bolsheviks after a series of bloody battles. He took back Kyiv on March 1st and was greeted as the liberator, though Petliura quickly moved Prisovskyi into less important positions, fearing his popularity.\n\nAfter Hetman Skoropadskyi's rise to power, Prisovskyi became his palace commandant and trusted second-hand man. He led the Eastern Campaign against Nestor Makhno's revolutionary army, and in a series of blows reduced the rebellion into a ragtag group of guerillas. Makhno himself managed to escape. After this campaign, Prisovskyi joined Omelianovych-Pavlenko's Ukrainian Volunteer Corps in Russia and fought alongside the Don Army against Dzugasvhili's front until the end of the war.\n\nAfter 1920, Prisovskyi has served in various positions, including regional Otaman of Kyiv military district and minister of defence. The Hetman's opponents call General Prisovskyi \"Pavlo's Policeman\" for his role and efficiency in fighting against anti-Hetman insurgencies, and his relatively late embracing of Ukrainian identity did not help in making aristocratic Prisovskyi likeable by the people. However, in the military he is respected, even feared.§!"

In response, Lypynskyi went ahead and gathered his supporters among party members and left, creating a new political organisation - the Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists.

However, he wouldn't serve there for long, with Volodymyr Vynnychenko eventually taking reins of the Union.\n\nIn later years the Socialists-Federalists would reorganise into the URDP, becoming the main legal oppositional force in the Hetmanate. With the other party's founders either in retirement or preoccupied with organisational matters, Nikovskyi soon became a recognised leader among the most uncompromising and radical members of the party, which coalesced over the years in its distinct left faction.\n\nNow, at the top of national politics, he can ensure that the party, which almost lost sight of its cause during the Hetman's reign, always remains true to its origins. National progress cannot be stopped – and Andrii Vasyliovych is here to ensure that the whole Ukraine shares in its ripe fruits.§!"

The ninth child of a peasant family, Fedenko would stand out amongst his siblings due to his diligent and academic nature. By recommendation of his teachers, he would be transferred to a gymnasium in Oleksandriia, where he would continue his studies. There, Fedenko would develop a love for teaching, hopeful to one day teach Ukrainian history and language in his hometown. At the same time, however, Fedenko would also develop a fascination with socialist ideals.\n\nAfter travelling to Saint Petersburg to further pursue his studies, he would quickly find himself radicalised. Joining the USDRP in 1915, Fedenko began to spend much of his energy writing for several socialist publications, including Volodymyr Vynnychenko's \"Our Life\". Following the February Revolution, Fedenko would be elected as a representative to the Central Rada, in which he worked until Skoropadskyi's coup. His new position forced him to move to Katerynoslav, where he would help write for \"Our Cause\", the printed organ of the party. As a result of this, he began to work more closely alongside Isaak Mazepa and Katerynoslav faction of the USDRP. Spending his exile in Galicia alongside his fellow republicans, he would pen several other works, all the while continuing his work as a history teacher.\n\nTruly, the course of history has shown that the people's calls for freedom cannot be suppressed forever. The spirit of Ukrainian republicanism, no matter what befalls it, shall live on among the hills and steppes of Ukraine. With everything in his power, Fedenko stands ready to uphold its core ideal - that liberty reigns forevermore.§!"

During this period Kovaliv would spend significant time working in the land administration of Poltava, personally confronting complex realities of the land question in Ukraine. He would join Shumskyi in the exodus from the UPS-R and after the downfall of the republic would remain in Ukraine.\n\nAfter the government anti-socialist crackdown in 1925 Kovaliv would move to France as a part of the party's foreign bureau. Here he would direct his efforts both towards the representation of the party on the international scene and the studies of chemistry in the University of Paris. Having seen first-hand all the intricacies of the French post-revolutionary order, now First Deputy Chairman Kovaliv is absolutely sure that in order to fulfil its internationalist mission Ukraine should firstly forge its own, unique revolutionary path, in accordance with its specific geographic and socio-economic conditions.§!"

 UKR_mykola_kovalevskyi_desc_body: "Born to a family of Cossack heritage, Mykola Kovalevskyi demonstrated his independent character from the early years. Expelled from the Chernihiv gymnasium over his interest towards Ukrainian newspapers, he was forced to continue his studies away from home, in Radom. His student years were similarly unstable. The scrutiny  of the authorities, caused by his activities in an illegal student organisation, forced him to abandon Moscow University and move to Kyiv, in order to enrol into the Commercial Institute. There he would begin his association with the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries. In 1914, his political activism would lead him to a short sentence in Lukianivska prison, effectively ending his student aspirations.\n\nThe revolutionary 1917 would become a very busy year for Mykola Mykolaiovych.  He was appointed leader of the formally established Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, helped create the 'Selianska Spilka', became a member of the Central Rada and served in the republican government until the very last day of its existence - all this is but a short summary of Kovalevskyi's activities during 1917 and early 1918.\n\nDuring the exile he would briefly abandon political activities and dedicate himself to journalism. The pause wouldn't be long, however, and soon Kovalevskyi would resume his work in the UPS-R. His advocacy for close cooperation between the Ukrainian socialist forces would sometimes put him against his less flexible comrades. However, the tragic death of Mykyta Shapoval, one of the most prominent figures in the UPS-R, would only reinforce his position. Either Ukrainian socialists would triumph together – or fade into irrelevance one by one."
