 IRE_totalist_party: "SÉ"
 IRE_totalist_party_short: "Saor Éire"
 IRE_totalist_party_long: "Saor Éire\n§gSaor Éire, meaning \"Free Ireland\", was formed by Peadar O'Donnell after his ejection from Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin following the British Revolution, when the left wing of the party was purged due to the anti-socialist fervour in Ireland at the time.\n\nAs far as Saor Éire are concerned, the Irish Revolution of the early 1920s was one of the worst missed opportunities in Irish history, which by all means is saying a lot. They believe had only the masses just been a little more educated, a little more informed, just a little bit more class conscious, a Worker's Republic could have been achieved, instead of the \"bourgeois\" one that took its place. For Saor Éire, imperialism and capitalism are two sides of the same exploitative force, one which must be violently purged from Ireland. Related to this, is an intense distrust of the clergy from within the party, particularly their conservatism and \"trappings of wealth and excess\".\n\nThe ranks of Saor Éire are filled with bitter veterans of the War of Independence, who make up the resurrected underground paramilitary wing of the party, the Irish Citizen Army. However, their progress has been stunted for years by two major stumbling blocks: Firstly, the rather robust nature of the reactionary Irish state, which has done what it can to dissolve the party, and secondly, the constant internal bickering over how involved the Union of Britain should be in their struggle. Saor Éire attempt to appeal to the poorest in Irish society, particularly farmers and farm workers, and their vision for the future is as agrarian as it is militant and radical.§!"

 IRE_syndicalist_party_text: "§gThe Irish Syndicalist Party was founded during the War of Independence by Roddy Connolly, son of the martyred James Connolly, following his return from the Commune of France after being there seeking international support for Ireland's revolution. This iteration was quickly put down by the British government, and the party was later revived by Jim Larkin Jnr. in the late 1920s, as a spiritual successor to his father's banned party, the Irish Worker's League. The ISP espouses the beliefs of orthodox syndicalism and republicanism, and sees itself as continuing the legacy of James Connolly's efforts in 1916, and the several small Soviets that formed during the War of Independence.\n\nOne of the major challenges in the implementation of syndicalism in Ireland is the lack of a major industrial base, and in an effort to combat this, the ISP has been in discussion the France and Britain, in seeking international support for building up Ireland's industry, should the party's revolutionary efforts come to fruition. While officially banned, the party is led by Jim Larkin Snr., and is largely made up of the more radical former Labour Party and trade union members who have been expelled from their respective organisations due their more ardent socialist leanings. Being very much an internationalist party, the ISP's goals can be summarised by James Connolly himself; \"For our demands most moderate are, we only want the earth.\"§!"

 IRE_radical_socialist_party_text: "§gThe Progressive Labour Party are the newest political party in Ireland, formed out of the anti-radical purges performed in the Labour Party. Of course if you were to ask their founder, former student activist Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, he would have left the party because of opposition to the purges regardless. Made up of much of the former student wing of Labour, as well as some more senior dissidents within the party, the PLP take a dim view on any form of repression of civil liberties. Unsurprisingly, this puts them at odds with the incumbent Sinn Féin administration, but their non-confrontational parliamentary demeanour has meant that their existence is tolerated, for now.\n\nTheir policies on social justice include supporting the abolition of the death penalty, removal of all political censorship, protections of freedom of speech, and pro-feminism views. Campaigning for a more encompassing welfare state than the mainstream Labour Party, with whom they share the belief of workers' rights, they also promote large scale formation of cooperative businesses and encourage farm collectivisation. They are noted to be avowedly pacifist in international terms and be willing to work with other left-wing parties owing to their small support base mostly consisting of the same kind of young progressives that make up the party itself.§!"

 IRE_social_democrat_party_tweedy_mid: "After the Irish and British revolutions of the 1920s, the party completely eschewed the revolutionary methods of abroad, favouring reformist means and enforcing stricter anti-syndicalist measures on party members, causing a split in the party. Following the events of the Second Irish Revolution, this split in the party has come to an informal end, with both parties now at least nominally back under the umbrella of the Labour Party."
 IRE_social_democrat_party_text_start: "The Labour Party is the second oldest extant political party in Ireland, after Sinn Féin. Founded in 1912 by James Connolly, Jim Larkin and William O'Brien, as the political wing of the Irish Trade Union Congress, it committed itself at the onset to the rights of workers. Members of the Labour movement took part in the Easter Rising as part of the Irish Citizen Army, but while the Labour Party were firmly on the side of complete Irish independence from Britain, they sat out the following two elections, until the \"national issue\" was settled, earning the ever-lasting respect of Sinn Féin."
 IRE_social_democrat_party_text: "§g$IRE_social_democrat_party_text_start$\n\nShocked by the British Revolution, the Labour Party have now eschewed the revolutionary methods of abroad, for purely reformist means. This, as well as the anti-syndicalist measures taken from within the party to root out potential entryism, has led to several prominent members leaving in disagreement, from both the more militant and more liberal wings.\n\nAlongside worker's rights, Labour's policies include widespread social and industrial reform, brought about by income redistribution, extensive infrastructure projects, and publicly-owned universal public services. Their main support comes from Ireland's limited urban industrial base, but their progressive policies have consistently attracted the attention of a small number of the more liberal upper-middle class.§!"

 IRE_social_liberal_party: "CnaT"
 IRE_social_liberal_party_short: "Clann na Talmhan"
 IRE_social_liberal_party_long: "$IRE_social_liberal_party_short$\n§gThe recently founded Clann na Talmhan, or \"Family of the Land\", would have more in common with the agrarian parties of Eastern Europe than other \"liberal\" parties. Formed in response to disillusionment against the more urban-focused government, and the perceived favouring of their more wealthy counterparts, the party's support is based around promoting the interests of the smaller farmers, particularly in the west of the country. Often considered somewhat anti-establishment and populist, they are regularly heard in Leinster House bemoaning the state of rural Ireland, and criticising all those who have it all, and who don't do enough for the man who lives and works on the land.\n\nIn practical terms, they call for land reclamation, lowering the taxes on farming land, and greater afforestation. Officially the party also supports social democratic policies such as state-funded secondary and subsidised university education, as well as publicly-owned healthcare. However, these are not seen as a priority for their limited support base, which unsurprisingly finds itself to be predominantly conservative and rural.§!"

 IRE_market_liberal_party_text: "§gThe National Development Party was founded by Seán Lemass in 1932, after he left Sinn Féin due to his disillusionment with the Collins administrations' further consolidation of power, and repression of radical politics. Being the only sitting TD to leave the party at the time, the NDP was set up alongside the unlikely partners of the National League Party and National Centre Party, both very small remnants of the old Irish Parliamentary Party, who favoured autonomy within the United Kingdom as opposed to independence.\n\nThe fledgling party's support is composed therefore of some members of the Anglo-Irish community, the more wealthy \"big farmers\", and parts of the urban middle class, as well as Lemass' small cohort of followers from Sinn Féin. Such as this, the party would be more Anglophilic than others, while still advocating complete independence, and would class itself as being very pro-business and fiscally conservative. The party see Mitteleuropa as an excellent opportunity to benefit from foreign investment, and hold an ambivalent view on religion and the Church. Seeing all political and social issues in Ireland through the prism of economics, the party believe wealth creation and thorough modernisation should be the key goal of any government.§!"

 IRE_social_conservative_party_short: "An Saorstát Críostúil"
 IRE_social_conservative_party_long: "$IRE_social_conservative_party_short$\n§gAn Saorstát Críostúil, meaning \"the Christian Republic\", reflects the values of this party headed by Éamon de Valera. The party traces its origins to a split-off from Sinn Féin after the 1922 election, when Cathal Brugha would leave the party over disagreements regarding social policy and Collins' role in government, creating \"Cumann an tSaorstáit\", or \"Society of the Republic\". After an underwhelming term in office following a surprise win in the 1926 election, the party has regrouped with former Príomh Aire de Valera taking up leadership, along with changing the party's name and pushing it to his specific vision.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil draw quite a number of their views directly from Catholic doctrine, and would favour more development of Ireland's existing agrarianism over further industrialisation. The party would find themselves firmly more conservative than Sinn Féin on social matters, but is to Sinn Féin's left economically, as they are more willing to consider certain \"social justice\"-based policies advocated by the Church. Breaking with his predecessor, de Valera is somewhat hostile to the Mitteleuropa project and aspires to keep Ireland in splendid isolation away from the horrors of the coming storms.§!"

 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_short: "Sinn Féin"
 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text: "Sinn Féin\n§gSinn Féin, meaning \"Ourselves\", have undoubtedly been the pre-eminent party in Ireland since the mid-1910s. The oldest party in the state, they were founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, originally promoting a Dual Monarchy between Great Britain and Ireland akin to Austria-Hungary, proposing that Irish MPs abstain from Westminster and instead meet in Dublin. Although they remained abstentionist, this policy radically shifted to republicanism following the party being erroneously credited with the Easter Rising of 1916. Griffith remained working with the party, handed over party leadership to surviving 1916 leader Éamon de Valera, and the party steamrolled into power in the 1918 Home Rule Election, foregoing any British authority and instead forming Dáil Éireann in Dublin.\n\nAfter the small split in the party following the War of Independence and subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, it has been the current party's vision that has moulded the young republic. Seen as the party of the Irish middle class, they have formed the pillars of Law, Order, Religious Pluralism and International Trade. While being just to the right of centre on political and economic matters, Sinn Féin are considered to be socially liberal and somewhat cosmopolitan in the Irish context."
 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "$IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text$ It is often joked that the party doesn't care if the youth of Ireland become degenerates, so long as they pay taxes, obey the law and vote Sinn Féin.

 IRE_paternal_autocrat_party_long_text: "Aontas Náisiúnta, meaning \"National Union\", was founded in 1931 as merger of various far-right groups and parties in Ireland. AN's history stems from an anti-loyalist wing within Sinn Féin led by Eoin O'Duffy, that left the party following O'Duffy's dismissal as Garda Commissioner by Collins, and the rump Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, led by John J. O'Kelly, which drifted to the right following the expulsion of the party's left-wing. Aontas Náisiúnta has since become notorious for the actions of its paramilitary wing, the National Guard or \"Blueshirts\", which engaged in violent clashes with the ICA and the UVF, though it has been de-jure disbanded to avoid giving Collins a reason to ban the party.\n\nAontas Náisiúnta advocates for a militaristic and nationalist Irish state based on an ideology of \"faith and fatherland\", that asserts Catholicism and Irish blood as the core of Ireland's national identity. The party is staunchly opposed to the Ulster Privileges, attracting support from many disillusioned Ulster Catholics, and foreign economic involvement in the Irish economy, arguing instead for an autarkic, corporatist and semi-integralist state based on Catholic economic teachings."

The Abstentionists refuse to take their seats in Dáil Éireann, believing liberal democracy to be an Anglo-Saxon invention imposed on the Irish, and advocate for the restoration of an Irish monarchy under the House of O'Neill as a stamp of rejection against liberalism and Anglicisation, claiming that an Irish-speaking king would raise the prestige of the language and remove the stigma of poverty associated with it by some.\n\nDespite the long influence of republican ideas in Irish culture, they regard republicanism as being nothing more than the creation of French Freemasons imported to Ireland by liberal Protestants and incompatible with the true monarchist nationalism of Gaelic Ireland. In spite of their strongly Catholic influence, they support religious tolerance towards Protestantism, believing that Gaelicisation could integrate loyalists into Irish society just as the Hiberno-Normans once became \"more Irish than the Irish themselves\", though they still hold disdain for the Ulster Privileges and militant loyalism."

With Lemass and his associates refusing to be at the helm of a British puppet regime, the National Centre Party have reverted to their old name and policies, focusing their economic efforts on benefiting the big farmers and producing agricultural goods for the British market.

 IRE_country_intro_header: "An Isle Alone"
 IRE_country_intro_content: "Sitting on the edge of Europe, Ireland's ancient legacy as the land of \"saints and scholars\" dots its green landscapes in countless ruins and monuments. Its Celtic language and society developed separately to the rest of the continent, but despite the island's cultural uniformity, Ireland was extremely fragmented politically, only nominally united by various \"High Kings\" throughout the centuries. The beginning of the end for this existence occurred in 1169, with the landing of a small group of Norman knights from Britain, the vanguard of a larger force to support an ousted Irish king, marking the start of the fraught relationship between Britain and Ireland.\n\nOver the coming centuries, the English grip in Ireland would grow increasingly firm, with multiple failed uprisings resulting in the lands of any leaders confiscated, and handed out to British settlers. These policies resulted in the gradual colonisation of the island, particularly in the north-east of Ulster, reinforced by strict Penal Laws that greatly limited the rights of Catholics, creating a new Protestant, English-speaking elite on the island.\n\nAfter the failure of a French-backed republican rebellion in 1798, English control increased greatly in 1801, when the Kingdom of Ireland was formally annexed into the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom. Dublin lost its own, even if exclusively Protestant, parliament, and the island was ruled directly from Westminster, leading to great economic decline.\n\nThe removal of any autonomy would prove to have disastrous effects between 1845 and 1850, where a food crisis brought about by potato blight was exacerbated to catastrophic levels by the mismanagement of Westminster. Despite food still being exported by British landlords for profit, the Great Famine, \"An Gorta Mór\", resulted in the deaths of more than a million people, and the exodus of at least half that again, from a population of eight million. This started a decades-long wave of emigration, particularly to the New World, that the island has yet to recover from, as Irish people routinely left its shores looking for better prospects. The demographic collapse hit hardest in rural areas, where the use of the Irish language was most widespread, sending the language into near-terminal decline in a short period.\n\nIn the aftermath of these desperate events, the eventual representation of Irish Catholics in Westminster meant that Ireland could again attempt to gain at least some form of limited freedom, even if by words and not arms."

 IRE_country_intro_header_1: "The Path to Freedom"
 IRE_country_intro_content_1: "As a formal part of the United Kingdom, Ireland's minimal representation in Westminster meant that it had limited say in its own affairs. After many failed rebellions in the previous centuries, what became clear was the island's most feasible and realistic way of gaining any freedom was through political means.\nIn the years following the Famine, Irish MPs in Westminster proposed a system called \"Home Rule\", where Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom, but governed by its own regional parliament in Dublin.\n\nNot all on the island were in agreement with this however. Those advocating for more autonomy were known as nationalists, whereas those who wanted to preserve the union between Ireland and Great Britain were called unionists, or loyalists. Nationalists themselves were split between \"Home Rulers\" who preferred constitutional, or parliamentary means, and a smaller group of more radical republican separatists known as \"Fenians\", for whom Home Rule was an unacceptable compromise, even as a stepping-stone.\n\nWith some major exceptions, nationalists were largely Catholics, while unionism became associated with Protestants, partially due to ancestral ties held by many Protestants whose families had originated from Great Britain. Unionists, particularly in Ulster, were fearful that Home Rule would favour the predominantly agricultural south of the country, to the detriment of Belfast's industry. They were also wary of the perceived influence that the Catholic Church would have, decrying that \"Home Rule means Rome Rule\".\n\nFollowing decades of debates and delays from the Conservative establishment in Westminster, Home Rule was poised to be enacted in the early 20th century. As a response to this, unionists in Ulster formed the Ulster Volunteer Force, an armed militia swearing to take up arms against the British government should Home Rule be enacted, with nationalists then forming the Irish Volunteers to ensure the opposite.\n\nIreland was on the brink of outright civil war, stopped only by a minor delay to introduction of Home Rule, known as the Weltkrieg..."

 IRE_country_intro_header_2: "England's Difficulty, Ireland's Opportunity"
 IRE_country_intro_content_2: "The outbreak of war in Europe had major effects on Ireland. The implementation of Home Rule was put on hold for the duration of the conflict, and with it any potential civil war was averted, at least temporarily. The Weltkrieg also caused a split in the Irish Volunteers, with most following the beliefs of Irish nationalists in Westminster, who advocated that the Volunteers join the British war effort, with participation in the Weltkrieg cementing Ireland's likelihood of having Home Rule granted.\n\nThe remainder of the Irish Volunteers, under the leadership of Eoin MacNeill, rejected going to fight Britain's war. This group became infiltrated with members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society sworn to bring about an independent Irish Republic. Believing that \"England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity\", the IRB and remaining Volunteers saw one option as the only logical step while Britain was otherwise distracted — a rebellion.\n\nThe leaders of the planned uprising gained unexpected allies in socialist icon James Connolly and his militia, the Irish Citizen Army. Of greater significance, the German Empire also agreed to send a large shipment of arms to aid in this effort. Widespread simultaneous uprisings were planned, but disaster struck when the German arms shipment was intercepted by the British. Through indecision and miscommunication, the uprising was almost entirely cancelled at the last moment, except mainly for Dublin.\n\nEaster Monday 1916 would mark the beginning of what became known as the \"Easter Rising\", an event which would alter the course of Irish history forever. The rebels concentrated themselves in a number of locations around Dublin, declaring a Republic with themselves as the provisional government. Outnumbered and underequipped, they stood little chance when the full force of the Crown was brought upon them.\n\nAfter five days of fighting, which saw the heavy-handed British reaction leading to the devastation of much of central Dublin, the rebels surrendered. Ridiculed by the public, few felt sympathy for them, and it seemed this uprising would simply be another bloody failure. All this changed with the British response however, with almost all of the surviving leaders being executed without trial. The news of these executions electrified the Irish public, turning the volunteers from subjects of ridicule, into martyrs. Through their sacrifice, the leaders of 1916 had brought the republican movement to the forefront of Irish politics."

 IRE_country_intro_header_3: "The War of Independence"
 IRE_country_intro_content_3: "In the aftermath of 1916, Irish politics saw a rapid realignment and radicalisation, with popular support for constitutional nationalism replaced overnight with republicanism. Sinn Féin was the main beneficiary, a minor nationalist party now taken over by republicans.\n\nIrish anger with Westminster grew in 1918, with the introduction of conscription due to intensified German pressure on the continent. With the exception of Ulster, this measure was opposed by the majority of the Irish public, leading to strikes, draft-dodging, and protests from all parts of society.\n\nAs an attempted \"concession\" to the Irish, the British government brought in Home Rule during the war, save for the six north-eastern counties of Ulster. This plan backfired massively for the British, as the old Irish parliamentarians from Westminster were trounced in the Home Rule election, and Sinn Féin captured virtually all available seats.\n\nWith their popular mandate demonstrated, Sinn Féin did not take their seats in the new Westminster-aligned Home Rule parliament, and instead took the momentous step of declaring a wholly independent Irish Parliament, \"Dáil Éireann\", in Dublin, the continuation of the Irish Republic from 1916.\n\nOn the same day, a minor skirmish began the Irish War of Independence, fought between British forces and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the military wing of Sinn Féin. Largely fought through guerrilla warfare, the war was marked by ambushes, flying columns in the countryside, imported German arms, and high levels of public support for the rebels. From the British perspective, fighting an unseen enemy, hidden in plain sight, made a significant difference from the battlefields of the Weltkrieg, and frustrated soldiers often took out their anger on the local civilian population.\n\nNews of reprisals carried out by British forces on civilians lead to considerable backlash for the British government, from both the international community, and the British public, already war-weary from the Weltkrieg. Beleaguered with the unsustainable war effort and public opinion, the British government sought a peace with Sinn Féin.\n\nIn late 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty would be signed, creating an Irish Republic in the twenty-six counties which had previously come under Home Rule. Despite the many concessions involved, few could argue that Sinn Féin had come further than it could have dreamed of just a decade ago."

 IRE_country_intro_header_4: "A Republic is Born"
 IRE_country_intro_content_4: "The Anglo-Irish Treaty created an Irish Republic, even if it was one that remained in the British sphere of influence. The treaty itself commanded significant support among Sinn Féin and the population, but was not without detractors. Sinn Féin split into Pro- and Anti-Treaty groups, with the former unable to reconcile with the reality of partition. Anti-Treatyites were by far the smaller, with its support found closer to the political extremes, and this would mark the beginning of the splintering of Sinn Féin over the coming decade.\n\nFollowing the ratification of a Constitution in February 1922, republican hardliner Cathal Brugha disagreed with the direction of the party leadership, and split from Sinn Féin, forming Cumann an tSaorstáit with Éamon de Valera and several other deputies. The elections taking place shortly after would see Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin easily triumph over the opposition of Anti-Treatyites, Cumann an tSaorstáit, the Labour Party, and other smaller parties. It would also be the sole term of Eoin MacNeill serving as President, with party founder Arthur Griffith stepping down due to ill health.\n\nThe following years would see the continued rise of Michael Collins, hero of the War of Independence and co-negotiator of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Collins served as deputy to MacNeill, and it was under their tenure that Ireland faced the immense consequences of the British Revolution. Through tense negotiations brokered over a full year, and only spurred on by word of looming British invasion of the north, Collins successfully saw the integration of Northern Ireland into the republic - at the price of continued loyalist domination over their northern nationalist neighbours. The fallout from this, and the Great Depression, led Sinn Féin to lose office in the next election, and Cumann an tSaorstáit came to power, finalising Ireland's exit from the old British sphere of influence, and its re-alignment towards Germany.\n\nThe more tumultuous political scene developing since the British Revolution and the end of partition has seen Collins himself become leader of Sinn Féin, bringing his party back into power in the following term, on a platform of a harsh stance against extremism, and entry into the Mitteleuropa economic bloc. The increased level of power given to the Presidency, restrictions on political radicals, tolerance of foreign influence, and power-brokering with the loyalists has led to no small upset, with the party splintering thrice more. Catholic conservatives, liberals and moderate social democrats make up most of the political opposition, but the far right have coalesced from the remains of the Anti-Treatyites and Sinn Féin's right, and the far left's meagre support has steadily grown, despite the political restrictions.\n\nAs the new year begins, few could have imagined the Ireland of 1936, and fewer still could foresee what is yet to come."

A revolutionary, a radical and an arch-subversive, Peadar O'Donnell is the firmest and loudest voice in Irish society when it comes to calls for socialism. His credentials are as strong as any Irish republican, having fought in the War of Independence, and even at that time he advocated for a total revolution that embraced socialism as much as it did anti-imperialism.\n\nAfter the War of Independence, he rejected the treaty on the grounds of partition and External Association, and campaigned vigorously for socialism in Ireland as part of Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin. He became editor of An Saorstát, the party's newspaper which he turned into a popular platform for his left-wing views. Expelled from the party after the revolutions in France, Italy and Britain and having watched as Ireland swapped the chains of British capitalism for German ones, O'Donnell became increasingly more militant in tone, and established his own party Saor Éire, to fulfil his vision of a true Irish revolution. With fears about his goals mounting, the government moved against him and shut down An Saorstát.\n\nO'Donnell's trials have only made him more determined to achieve his goals by any means necessary, even if it meant swallowing his distrust to work with the Union of Britain and their agents. Finally in charge of Ireland, O'Donnell plans to take swift and decisive action to utterly revolutionise society, just as he's always dreamed of doing."

Also like Connolly, he co-founded the Labour Party in 1912, alongside the more moderate William O'Brien.\n\nLarkin has been an advocate for socialism and trade unionism since the 1890s, but first courted public notoriety in the 1910s as general secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, a time period which saw Larkin lead the unions through the infamous \"Dublin Lockout\" of 1913. Known for his imposing physical presence, as well as his considerable oratorical skills, Larkin's uncompromising and larger-than-life persona has caused many of his followers to idolise him, but also has led to some bitter disputes among former comrades. A Christian socialist, Larkin sees no contradiction between his Catholic faith and his socialist ideals.\n\nAfter the Lockout, Larkin spent the best part of the decade in the United States, becoming involved in the Socialist Party of America, further radicalising, and openly espousing support for the Commune of France. He returned to Ireland, and became estranged from the mainstream of the Labour Party. Narrowly evading imprisonment after the clampdown on socialism that followed the British Revolution, he took up an offer from the French, along with his son, to further develop his views of syndicalism in the Sorbonne.\n\nHaving finally returned from France, and now the leader of the Irish Syndicalist Party, Larkin has"

In many ways a \"founding father\" of the Irish state, and certainly a national hero, Michael Collins' firm hand has led the fledgling state since 1930, and so far to great success.\n\nBorn in County Cork to a republican family, Collins originally trained as an accountant, working in London and New York before returning to Ireland and taking part in the Easter Rising. Seen as the head military commander during the War of Independence, he acted as the IRA's Director of Intelligence, and was also lauded for his actions as Minister for Finance during the war. Afterwards, Collins quickly stepped into the role of Ireland's top political figure. As leader of the nation, he moulded the new Republic along American lines, making the office of President unquestionably the most powerful position in the land.\n\nTo date, possibly his finest hour (and certainly his most controversial) came in 1926 during the British Revolution. Amongst the chaos and upheaval, Collins, representing President MacNeill, managed to negotiate an unthinkable deal with the Ulster loyalists: the peaceful entry of Northern Ireland into the Republic, in return for protection against any syndicalist threat. Rather than risk being wiped out by revolutionaries, the Ulstermen chose the devil they knew.\n\nSince Sinn Féin's re-election in 1930 after losing the previous election on account of the Great Depression, Collins is now leader of Ireland and of Sinn Féin"

 IRE_michael_collins_advisor_body: "§gSeeing Ireland engulfed in war, with its sovereignty once again threatened, Michael Collins has returned to active duty in service to the nation.\nAs a military leader, Collins personally gained considerable notoriety from British forces during the War of Independence, and was seen by them as the mastermind behind the Irish war effort. The reality was far more nuanced, but like in all myths there was an element of truth.\nBeing a veteran of 1916, Collins realised the folly in any symbolic, publicly visible victories or attempted large-scale encounters, like what had unsuccessfully attempted in Easter week, especially at the General Post Office where he had been assigned. What was needed against a much better-armed and better-supplied enemy was the ability to strike suddenly, with great effect, and withdraw from the engagement before any response could be mustered. These were the principles that, aided by the mass public support, Collins adopted and found success with during the War of Independence across Ireland.\nCollins' true talent as a commander comes in his organisational skills on a larger scale, and his maintenance of expansive intelligence networks. He also realised the importance of knowing how to pick his men well, as the IRA divisions operated with a significant degree of autonomy. Both of these came to play on a fateful Sunday in November 1920, when Collins arranged the simultaneous assassinations of most of Britain's highest-ranking intelligence officers in Dublin, leading to grave civilian retributions by crown forces.\nPersonally, Collins did his best to feed into the aura of mystique and elusiveness that was attached to his persona during the War of Independence, enjoying his time as a \"man on the run\". This self-confidence followed him out of war-time, leading some of his rivals to resent this popularity, which they felt was at least partially undeserved.\nAfter unexpectedly being ousted from high office and without even a ministerial position, Collins now has his role to play in fighting to save Ireland once again, and of course do his best to help repair his tarnished reputation in the eyes of the people.§!"

Joining the Irish Volunteers in 1917, his skills quickly impressed his superiors, most notably Michael Collins, who described him as \"the best man in Ulster\".\n\nDuring the war, O'Duffy's brigade became notable for their daring attacks, most famously the first capture of an RIC barracks in the town of Ballytrain, but also for sectarian actions against Protestants. Appointed chief liaison officer to Belfast during the Truce, O'Duffy was enraged by attacks on Catholics and the collusion he saw between loyalists and the RUC, marking the beginning of his staunch opposition to loyalist influence. Appointed to the role of Garda Commissioner following the war, O'Duffy strove to create a disciplined and organised police force which would serve as a model of his ideals. The unification of Ireland would upset this order as among the Ulster Privileges was the inclusion of members of the RUC into the Gardaí.\n\nO'Duffy, who had called for the government to invade the six counties during the British Revolution, despised the Ulster Privileges and had no trust for these new members. Disenchanted with his former friend Michael Collins and seeing the UDP block any attempts by Brugha to undo the Privileges, O'Duffy began to organise a far-right faction within Sinn Féin. Dismissed by Collins after his re-election for anti-Protestant discrimination, O'Duffy left the party with his followers and, aligning with hardline anti-Treatyites, formed Aontas Náisiúnta with the objective of overthrowing the democracy that had \"sold out\" Ireland to the loyalists and the Germans, and establishing a Portuguese-inspired Catholic dictatorship."

Like many who felt betrayed by the end result of the Irish Revolution, Ó Cuinneagáin was immediately attracted to Aontas Náisiúnta and became an editor of its Irish language newspaper.

In the immortal words of Pádraig Pearse, Ireland shall be a nation not free merely, but Gaelic as well."

Mulcahy himself spent the Rising in Ashbourne, County Meath, one of the few areas outside Dublin that saw action, and successfully applied the guerrilla warfare tactics that would be developed further in the War of Independence.\nElected as a TD, he held the position of Assistant Minister for Defence during the War of Independence, often acting as a mediator between the frequent clashes of personality of Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha.

Kathleen Clarke (née Daly) has lived a life steeped in Irish republicanism.\nShe was born in County Limerick to a strongly republican family, with her uncle John Daly a leading figure in the Irish Republican Brotherhood. It was through him that she would meet her future husband Tom, recently released from serving fifteen years in an English prison. Kathleen at the time was the manager of a flourishing dressmaking business in Limerick City, when she married Tom, twenty-one years her senior.\n\nThe couple moved to New York for some time, working and gathering support for the Fenians among recently emigrated Irish-Americans, before returning to Ireland and settling in Dublin. There they opened a suite of tobacconists' shops, with Kathleen running the business with her husband, while also joining the Gaelic League and engaging in republican activities herself. Most notably, in 1914 she was a founder member of Cumann na mBan, the women's paramilitary association that was essential in the struggle for independence during the revolutionary period. Tom would later be forever remembered as the primary instigator of the Easter Rising, and the first signatory in the Proclamation of the Republic. For Kathleen however, the Rising meant the loss of her husband, brother, uncle and unborn child. She spent its immediate aftermath organising relief efforts for all those who had family members killed or imprisoned during the rebellion.\n\nDespite the great personal losses Clarke endured, she continued to engage in the republican movement, joining Sinn Féin in 1917 and serving in its executive. During the War of Independence, she was elected as a TD and acted as a District Judge in the Republican Courts set up by the Dáil. Since then, she has been elected as a TD, Senator and Lord Mayor of Dublin. Clarke has championed the rights of women in particular to be enshrined in law, both in the original 1922 Constitution, but also in any subsequent legislation. In gaining support for this, she cites the Proclamation of 1916, with its vision of cherishing all children of the nation equally.\n\nThere is no person in Ireland that can be considered more of a living symbol of the sacrifice made by the martyrs of 1916. It is fitting that she now holds the role of President, where above the banality of wielding executive power, Clarke will act as first citizen of the Republic, and among other duties, have the responsibility of honouring the memory of all of those men and women who gave their lives for the cause of Irish freedom."

The linguist and academic Douglas Hyde was born to a Church of Ireland rector in County Roscommon. At an early age, he developed a fascination with the form of Irish spoken in the area, and despite his Ascendency background, gained a keen motivation for the usage and preservation of the language as a whole, particularly following the calamitous drop its prevalence that occurred with the Great Famine.\n\nHyde originally wrote poems and essays in the Irish language under the name \"An Craoibhín Aoibhinn\", or \"The Pleasant Little Branch\", alongside his career in academia. This eventually led him in 1893 to found the Gaelic League, or Conradh na Gaeilge, a society dedicated to the promotion of Irish language and culture, with its initial manifesto, written by Hyde, entitled \"The necessity for de-anglicising the Irish nation\".\n\nThe Gaelic League became the wellspring of a generation of Irish nationalists and republicans, despite being founded with a non-partisan ethos. While a nationalist himself, Hyde wished for the League to be accessible to those of any allegiance, later resigning in favour of Eoin MacNeill when the movement became increasingly politicised. Since then, he has served as the inaugural Professor of Modern Irish in University College Dublin, and as a Senator.\n\nEven considering his numerous credentials, the selection of a non-Catholic to the office of President is a message to the world that the Irish identity is based on the nation's culture and heritage, and not any sole religious affiliation.

He played a critical role in the War of Independence as Minister for Defence, and was an early advocate for Ireland gaining international recognition.

He is the epitome of the conservative revolutionary, known for his devout Catholic faith and noted by his peers to abstain entirely from smoking, drinking or cursing.

He received his education in Britain, and with his family prominent in British political circles, it was no surprise when he became a civil servant in the House of Commons, at the heart of the establishment. Partly due to the British conservative values that he grew up with, Childers volunteered during the Boer War. This became his first sense of disillusionment with the imperialist project, and led him to become passionate about the cause of Home Rule for Ireland. His wartime experiences also began his penchant for writing, completing two books on military theory, as well as an influential espionage novel.\n\nChilders was a keen yachtsman, and frustrated with Home Rule's endless delays, he furthered his unruly streak by sailing to Germany on the eve of the Weltkrieg and smuggling hundreds of rifles to the Irish Volunteers on his yacht the \"Asgard\". He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the British government for his efforts as an intelligence and reconnaissance officer during the Weltkrieg, but was enraged by the violent suppression of the Easter Rising, and the attempted introduction of conscription in Ireland.\n\nEventually, departing entirely from moderate nationalism, Childers permanently moved back to Ireland and joined Sinn Féin, utilising his literary abilities as Director of Publicity for the first Dáil. His arrival was met with suspicion, as many considered him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. His doubters were muted by the forthright republican views that he displayed as part of the delegation for the successful Treaty negotiations.\n\nChilders has since then lived his life out of the spotlight, spending his time writing, sailing with his wife Molly, and serving as occasional government advisor on maritime matters. As President, he leaves the day-to-day running of the government to the Taoiseach, while frequently publishing articles and essays on Irish international relations, in addition to his formal appearances. Childers represents an Irish Republic that is comfortable with its past, and recognises the contributions of the Anglo-Irish to Irish nationalism and republicanism — from Tone, to Emmet, to Parnell, and to Casement."

Murray's role in the writing of the book brought him to prominence in the eyes of the British, and several years later he would return to Ireland as a part of the Union's Operation Whale, serving as a liaison between Saor Éire and British intelligence, and as head of Saor Éire's Ulster branch.\n\nSeen as more amenable to their \"advice\" than his close friend and colleague, Peadar O'Donnell, Murray was put in place by British forces as Chairman of the newly \"liberated\" Irish Socialist Republic. Murray seeks to fulfil the dream of a socialist Ireland, and replace the long-hostile relationship between Britain and Ireland with one of worker's solidarity united in the coming struggle for human liberty, just as the Fenians proclaimed in 1867."

His paternal uncle took part in the 1867 Rising, while his mother had been joint secretary of a local Ladies' branch of the Land League, seeking to break up the large estates of the Anglo-Irish gentry.\nLike many young men his age, Lynch joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, seeking to secure Home Rule, while completing his apprenticeship in the hardware trade, and being a member of the Gaelic League. Also typical of most, he elected to not join the more militant group of the Volunteers, and as such did not take part of the Easter Rising, while also not enlisting in the British Army. This more moderate approach ended after the Rising, particularly when he witnessed the British Army shooting and capturing the prominent Kent family of Bawnard. After leading the four brothers and their octogenarian mother in handcuffs over the bridge of Fermoy, one brother would die of the wounds sustained in the capture, while another would be executed the following week. It was at this point that Lynch decided to dedicate his life to the cause of Irish freedom.\nHe quickly made a name for himself as the leader of the North Cork No. 2 Brigade of the IRA during the War of Independence, leading multiple successful skirmishes, raids and ambushes. Lynch narrowly escaped capture and death numerous times, with his notoriety to the extent that two other men named Lynch were mistakenly killed by British forces, seeking him out.\nLynch's experiences in the War of Independence have stayed with him, as he enjoys an influential position in the Army. He maintains a low tolerance for politicians, and during the War of Independence was noted to say \"the Army has to hew the way to freedom for politics to follow.\" Known for his attention to detail, he was even at an early stage recognised to have an affinity to military life. Such was his devotion to the cause, that during the War he was frequently compared to a priest. Though that war has ended, for Lynch the Army remains his vocation.§!"

Antrim, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §g$IRE_jack_white_alt$§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gJames Robert White was born into a family of Ulster Protestant aristocrats. He was educated at Winchester, and constantly disciplined for renegade activities, such as urinating openly while fielding on the cricket pitch. His father's status as war hero and Field Marshal gained him admittance to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he completed his training in time to take part in the Second Boer War.\nIt was in South Africa that White first started coming to terms with his disagreements with the worldview of the British aristocracy, having threatened to shoot a superior officer when they ordered the summary execution of a young unarmed Boer prisoner. Nevertheless, he ended the war a decorated officer, with a Distinguished Service Order.\nServing a few more years as the peacetime soldier, he realised it was not the life for him, and went onto teach English in Bohemia, live in a Tolstoyan commune in England, and work as a lumberjack in Canada. Upon returning to Ireland, he saw the Home Rule debate in full swing, and anticipated supporting the unionist cause. This changed when he encountered the Ulster loyalism of the day, with what he considered their \"bigotry and stagnation\" causing him to veer towards Home Rule. After a chance meeting with Roger Casement, and eventually James Connolly, White went from Home Ruler, to republican, to devout advocate for socialism.\nWhite went on to co-found the Irish Citizen Army, and played an instrumental role in their training and organisation, using his extensive experience from the heart of the British military establishment. Ultimately, when the ICA began negotiating with the Irish Volunteers, he disagreed over the level of cooperation and integration the two groups would undergo, and left the militia. His beliefs never left him however, and he later became a founder member of both the Irish Worker's League and the Irish Syndicalist Party. Since the treaty, he has coordinated the renewed ICA from the underground, leading all that volunteer in the cause of a true socialist republic.\nWhite considers himself a Christian socialist, as he abhors the overt influence of clericalism, or any singular religion in Ireland, preferring instead to aim for Tone's dream of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.§!"

As both his parents passed away unexpectedly, he was raised by his maternal uncle and aunt, adding their surname to his own. He joined the Royal Irish Regiment in his youth, being promoted to Sergeant due to his service in India. This time with the British Army did anything but ingratiate him to the political status-quo however, as he resigned in 1907, then with a commitment to a particularly Catholic-focused Irish nationalism.\nUpon returning to Ireland and working as a journalist, he also was an early member of Sinn Féin, as well as prominent local member of the Gaelic League. As could be expected, he joined the Irish Volunteers on their foundation in 1913, with his previous military experience welcome. He served as a Commandant during the Easter Rising at the GPO under James Connolly, at which time he was wounded and captured.\nBrennan-Whitmore was heavily involved in the efforts that took place in Frongoch Prison in Wales, whereby the imprisoned veterans of the Rising took to developing the military tactics that would later be implemented in the War of Independence. During the war itself, he was involved in the North Wexford IRA, but mainly spent his time assisting Collins' creation of intelligence networks.\nSince independence, Brennan-Whitmore has become disillusioned with the more liberal Ireland that come into being. He left the army and returned to journalism, mainly writing of the imminent danger that syndicalism presents to Ireland. Though a devoted Catholic, he has called upon all Christians to do their duty to resist the common enemy of syndicalism, just as they did against British influence in Ireland in past times.\nSuch was the level of extremism advocated in his columns, Brennan-Whitmore was previously investigated by the same intelligence networks that he helped create. But now, with the nation under powerful new leadership, he has volunteered himself as someone prepared to do everything he can for the salvation of Ireland, and of Europe in general.§!"

Raised in County Cork, he was the second of eleven children born to a Royal Irish Constabulary officer, and unlike most of his revolutionary peers, did not join the Gaelic League, or come from a republican or strong nationalist background.\nAt seventeen years old, he did what many young men were doing in Europe during the Weltkrieg, which was enlist. This was not to fight for Ireland, or even Britain; he joined the Royal Field Artillery to see what war was like, get a gun, and to travel.\nThis saw him to Mesopotamia and Egypt, to promotion and commendation. Despite being mentioned in despatches, when word reached about the Easter Rising, Barry began to question his position in the British Army, and turned down an offer of a commission in the Munster Fusiliers, opting to pursue employment elsewhere.\nBarry remained uninvolved early in the War of Independence, until a fellow ex-serviceman was bayoneted to death in Cork city by British soldiers, who did so while calling him and his companion \"Irish pigs\". After serving in the guard of honour at the funeral, Barry could see little appeal with the status quo, and joined the IRA, to fight for an independent Irish republic.\nFrom the onset, he was highly valued for his military background and ability to train and inspire new volunteers, while adapting his previous experiences successfully to a wholly new form of warfare. This could be seen in the legendary Kilmichael Ambush, as well as the Battle of Crossbarry, where he led 104 volunteers of the West Cork Brigade to escape an encirclement of British forces thirteen times their number, to minimal casualties.\nBarry personally came to be known as a ruthless and feared adversary to enemy forces, to the degree that his temporary imprisonment was an initial demand by the British in securing the war's ceasefire — a request that Collins naturally denied.\nThe accolades that he and his men received for their bravery, discipline and efficiency have been many. Not wanting to rest on his laurels however, Barry is keen to remain \"in the field\", and to go beyond his wartime reputation for ambushes and flying columns. He continues to develop his methods, should the need to maintain Ireland's independence arise again, \"in the next war\".§!"

After finishing school, he moved to County Monaghan to work as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway Company, and it was here that he would later make a name for himself during the War of Independence. His initial time in Monaghan was marked by his joining of the GAA and the Irish Volunteers — both of which closely coinciding with his introduction to none other than Eoin O'Duffy.\nHogan developed a reputation as a ruthless and confident leader in the Monaghan IRA, carrying out numerous ambushes and assaults, while acting as O'Duffy's right-hand-man. His wartime experiences involved personal loss, as his brother Michael was the captain of Tipperary team that played in Croke Park during the fateful events of Bloody Sunday, and indeed was the only player shot dead by British forces, with the rest of the victims being spectators. Hogan did not take this well, and his grief only lead him more fully engage in the revolutionary activities in Ulster, in particular targeting wealthy loyalists with kidnappings and the burning down of several of the \"big houses\". At the end of the war, he was given the honour of being the first to raise the Tricolour over Dublin Castle, as part of the handover ceremony where British forces formally relinquished their control of much of the apparatus of state.\nHis friendship with O'Duffy was sidelined when the latter lost favour with the government, with Hogan not wishing his own personal relationship with his former superior to be a risk to his own current position in the army — though there is no doubt that he harbours some sympathy for O'Duffy's cause, likely in part due to his devout religious beliefs. Hogan's past connections and prickly character makes him an unpopular figure with several politicians, but he maintains the respect of the soldiers, who remain in full confidence of his abilities as a commander and leader.§!"

The young Seán took an interest in national matters at an early stage, adopting the Irish language form of his name at eleven years of age. He finished his primary education and began work at the family forge, where he was apprenticed to his father. As the eldest son, Mac Eoin had responsibility thrust upon him in 1913, as he then had to take over full maintenance of the forge and his family's wellbeing, after his father passed away unexpectedly. However, this did not stop him from joining the Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Brotherhood the following year.\nMac Eoin was notable during the War of Independence for leading the only effective flying column in the midlands, as he served the Commandant of the first battalion of the Longford brigade. The first of two major incidents that he was involved in during the conflict was the Battle of Ballinalee, where Mac Eoin was based, where he held his village from British forces despite overwhelming numbers. The other was the Clonfin Ambush, where he performed a well-executed attack on several lorries of British troops, and was recognised for his chivalrous actions in treating the wounded enemies afterwards, at the expense of the opportunity to capture more much-needed weaponry and equipment. These two events became legendary locally, earning him the soubriquet \"The Blacksmith of Ballinalee\".\nHis time in the war was ended with his capture, during which he was shot in the chest. He recovered from his injuries and was sentenced to death for his involvement in the war — but was released before the sentence was carried out, as part of the treaty negotiations. Testimony from British forces over his conduct towards them also helped to delay his sentencing.\nWhile imprisoned, Mac Eoin was elected TD for Longford-Westmeath, but did not contest the seat again after serving two terms in the Dáil, opting instead to focus on the military, after Ireland's independence seemed threatened in the immediate aftermath of the British Revolution. \"The Blacksmith of Ballinalee\", as he is still known, is also noted for his strong religious views, and close association with both Richard Mulcahy and Michael Collins, though his loyalty lies first and foremost to the army itself.§!"

Following this, he returned to Ireland in 1915 and joined the Irish Volunteers as Chief of Inspection, delivering lectures on military tactics as well as on famous Irish battles. Taking no part in the Rising itself, he spent the preceding days in Cork, having been sent there as part of the infamous countermand issued by Eoin MacNeill, which almost stopped the Rising taking place entirely.\nDespite O'Connell's non-involvement, he was nonetheless reprimanded by British forces and imprisoned.

He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Rifles, and was posted to the Western Front, serving in the battles of Messines, Somme and Passchendaele, during which time he was awarded the Military Cross, before being promoted late in the war.\nBritain may have lost the Weltkrieg, but Steele looked to have a bright future ahead of him in the British Army. He was sorely disappointed at the result of the Irish War of Independence, as he considered his Irish identity to be closely entwined with his British one, and was reluctant to see the parting of many of his old comrades in the Royal Irish Rifles.\nThe British Revolution, unsurprisingly, had a significant effect on his worldview. Deeply disillusioned by the exiled government in Canada's decision to seemingly abandon Northern Ireland at a time when its invasion by the newly established Union of Britain seemed imminent, he was among the military representatives present at the tense negotiations with the southern government, which eventually led to Irish reunification.\nWhile he certainly has not voiced any dislike for the institution of the republic, careful listeners would notice that he will always refer to the \"Irish Army\", rather than its full title, as well as using \"Ulster\" to refer to \"Northern Ireland\".\nSteele is loyal to Ireland second, and to Ulster first. His decision to continue his military career as he did, was not an easy choice to make, but he feels it his responsibility to act as a spokesman for the loyalist military tradition in what is now an all-island army, lest their perspective be otherwise under-represented.\nDespite his differences with many of his fellow officers, they hold each other in mutually high regard, and living up to his name, he readies himself for any new conflict between Ireland and the syndicalists with a steely resolve.§!"

Despite regional autonomy in France going from strength to strength under the auspices of the Communards, and in immeasurably better straits than with the old Republic, Hénaff has chafed under what is seen by most proponents of Breton nationalism as a great step forward. For him, it is not enough, and it never could be, sharing a country, however constructed, with those who did their best to destroy his heritage.\nTrained as a chemical engineer, Hénaff was responsible for the demolition of a historic statue which had commemorated the union of Brittany and France in the fifteenth century, in a symbolic act which only encouraged him further. He has come to Ireland to gain first-hand experience of not only with working the IRA, but also the powerful new regime which has taken control of the country, one which shares his hatred of syndicalism.\nHis Breton mother tongue bears little similarity to Irish, but he seems eager to improve his fluency in the language of his adopted home, and is seen as welcome assistance at a time when numbers of loyal officers are dwindling.§!"

Dublin, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §g$IRE_cf_russell_alt$§!\n§YAviation Career:§! §gCharles Francis \"Charlie\" Russell is one of two men who can be most credited with the initiation of aviation in an independent Ireland. The son of a prominent journalist, the former RAF officer joined the Dublin IRA after the Weltkrieg, and became an air advisor to Michael Collins. Russell, along with Jack McSweeney, concocted a plan to purchase an aircraft for the evacuation of the Treaty negotiators from London, should the need arise. Collins approved the plan, but such a swift egress from England never proved necessary, nor did Russell's ideas of using the plain as a bomber in Ireland should the war resume after the negotiations collapse.\nRussell became involved in using the Air Corps as a training ground for civil aviation in the early stages of independence, but has shifted his focus in more recent years. The diversity of his work in civil aviation and the international contacts he made, and his previous experience in the RAF, as well as important work in the foundation of the Air Corps, has spurred him to recognise a myriad of varied emphases, based on the latest developments in aviation internationally, in all its forms.§!"

Often openly sectarian, Brooke holds no love for Catholics or republicans... nevertheless, he understands he and his supporters are tolerated between gritted teeth in Ireland whereas, they would likely be completed dismantled in the Union of Britain. Thus, Brooke has learnt pragmatism the hard way, and to be the sternest of spouses in Ireland's devilish \"marriage of (in)convenience\".§!"
 NIR_basil_brooke_sic_desc: "$NIR_basil_brooke_advisor_desc$\n§gFor Brooke, the ultimate test to his convictions came when Michael Collins, joining the new war against the hated syndicalists and riding an untold wave of public popularity, approached him with an arrangement for them to \"come together as christians\" in the time of war against the red menace. Brooke now performs his new role with surprising alacrity, enthusiastic at the promise of ridding Great Britain of the syndicalists once and for all.§!"
 NIR_basil_brooke_start: "Basil Brooke, 5th Baronet of Brookeborough is a member of the British aristocracy in Ireland who fought for the British in the Weltkrieg and then against the IRA in the Irish War of Independence. The Brookes, originally from northwest England, were granted lands forfeited from the Maguire clan in Fermanagh in the 1640s as part of the Ulster Plantation, and have remained there since, staunch in their Protestantism, loyalty to the British crown, and military service."
 NIR_basil_brooke_mid: "Every aspect of Brooke's life, be it his religion, his politics or his career, originally rested on resisting Irish nationalism. However, following the unimaginable events of the 1920s,"

During this time Brooke and his Ulster Democratic Party leveraged their significant power within the nation to achieve their goals, most notably acting as kingmaker for the ill-fated Collins government.\n\nUltimately however when the Collins government fell, and soon Irish democracy along with it, the loyalist community began to see the new radical regime in Dublin as a threat to said rights and freedoms Brooke swore to uphold. With all attempts made to peacefully resolve the situation failing, Brooke and his supporters saw no opportunity left to them but the violent dissolution of the short lived unity Ireland had grown accustom to. Brooke now finds himself fighting in service of King and Country once more; or at least what is left of it."

 IRE_bm_decisions: "Black Monday in Ireland"
 IRE_bm_decisions_desc: "Luain Dubh, or as what most are calling it, Black Monday.\nThe loyalists in the north of the country have delivered us an ultimatum of six months to make a measurable improvement to their own particular situation, lest they pull their support for the government.\n\nHowever, the rest of the country also suffers, and its population expects the government to do its utmost in starting efforts to relieve the great strain that this catastrophe has placed upon us — with us not doing so being surely felt in the next election.\n\nIf we fail to keep the loyalists on board, as well as fail in starting our economy's recovery, it will have grave consequences for our chance of re-election next year, let alone for the likely welfare of the nation.\n\nIf we fail in just one of these matters, it will damage our odds of re-election, but we would be still in with a good chance if we manage the campaign well.\n\nIf, against the odds, we somehow manage to both keep the loyalists on board and begin to kickstart the economy, we would surely be favourites to lead the next government.\n\nThere are no half-measures here! Our efforts are either seen as §Gappropriate§! by the UDP or the country as a whole, or are deemed not good enough — there is no in-between.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe initial relieving measures are seen as [IRE_loc_UCF_eco].\nThe UDP view the support given to the north as [IRE_loc_UCF_north]."

 IRE_UCF_mission_desc: "Since the 1929 Irish general election, Sinn Féin has been dependent on a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Ulster Democratic Party to achieve a majority in Dáil Éireann. Fearing that the Irish Government would put a greater emphasis on subsidising the south of the country during the crisis at northern expense, the UDP have used their leverage to insist that Sinn Féin's first priority be bailing out Ulster's economy.\nSetting a deadline of six months, UDP leader Basil Brooke has sternly warned he may discontinue his party's backing of Sinn Féin should he feel dissatisfied with their efforts."

 IRE_UCF_meet_loyalist_leaders_desc: "In order to keep our party's close working relationship with the Ulster Democratic Party running smoothly, it remains crucial that we grease the wheels with agreements for additional funding of predominantly Protestant constituencies and organisations. Naturally, as such deals would be exceedingly unpopular in ordinary times, let alone a moment of financial catastrophe, it is imperative that these vital arrangements be handled away from disapproving public eyes."
 IRE_UCF_counter_nordie_syndies: "Counter Northern Syndicalist Rhetoric"
 IRE_UCF_counter_nordie_syndies_desc: "Ulster has a long but marginalised leftist tradition, with socialist Protestants in the past, even those seeking to continue the union with Britain, being branded \"rotten Prods\" and ostracised alongside Catholics. The British Revolution gave birth to left-wing loyalism, seeking the integration of Northern Ireland into the Union of Britain, though their ideas remained fringe until Black Monday gifted them an opportunity to advance their views. Let alone dealing with other more \"mainstream\" socialists, the UDP and Sinn Féin have common cause in combating the rhetoric of these upstarts, neither wishing the Union of Britain the assistance of another fifth column."

 IRE_economy_decisions: "Economic Development"
 IRE_economy_decisions_desc: "Ever since its neglect during the Industrial Revolution, Ireland has never been the strongest of economies. Primarily agrarian, with most industrialisation concentrated in the north and in the few other cities, Ireland has fallen behind the rest of Europe, though has fared better than some other countries in the south and east.\n\nIf we are to have any hope of being a contender in the continent, we must invest in developing our economy, whether that be by expanding and renewing our agricultural tradition, exploiting our limited natural resources, or mass industrialisation to match our European neighbours."

 IRE_cork_steel_works_desc: "Steel production in Ireland has been bolstered in recent years by the creation of a major private steel mill in the Cobh area of [GetVictoryPointName_7394], primarily supplying one of our naval bases there. However, in order to produce the levels of steel needed for a sustained war effort, the state will need at least partial ownership of the site and to expand it greatly.

 IRE_leinster_coal_mines_desc: "One of the most significant weaknesses in the Irish economy has been, for almost a century, our lack of coal. Historically and presently, we have been dependant on importing coal from Great Britain, or in latter years, Germany. This is something that always gave great leverage to the Brits during negotiations. Although we can never entirely level this trade imbalance, we can reduce it. There are minor deposits of coal in the south-east of the country that could take control of and expand. While the amount of coal there is small, it is of a high-quality, helping to balance out the cost-effectiveness of the operation."
 IRE_connacht_coal: "Develop the §Y[IRE_loc_arigna]§! Coal Mine"
 IRE_connacht_coal_desc: "[IRE_loc_arigna] is a remote coal mine in Connacht that has already been in operation for three hundred years. Despite the fact that it is already connected to both a canal system and freight railway, it is still struggling to grow. Its main issue has been in attracting a workforce; which is something the state can overcome by taking at least partial control of the mine, and paying above basic wages. This would not be particularly cost-effective, but if our need for coal is deep enough, these are the measures we have to consider."

Businesses such as this, even in an industry so associated with [IRE_loc_ulster], could be targeted, to better improve industrial development across the country, rather than further centralising it on our two largest cities."
 IRE_guinness_brewery: "Expand the §Y[GetVictoryPointName_11293]§! Guinness Brewery"
 IRE_guinness_brewery_desc: "As one of the largest and most recogisable Irish companies in the world, Guinness is not averse to long-term thinking and investment. Nonetheless, convincing the well-established and conservative company to take a risk and build more modern facilities, will take some coaxing as well as some grants."
 IRE_midleton_distillery: "Modernise the §Y[IRE_loc_midleton]§! Distillery"
 IRE_midleton_distillery_desc: "The [IRE_loc_midleton] Distillery complex, located in [IRE_loc_county] [GetVictoryPointName_7394], is the home of the largest pot still in the world, as well as several of Ireland's best selling whiskeys, including Jameson, Paddy and Powers. Ireland's whiskey industry thrived in the mid-1920s due to the fall off in demand and supply of Scottish whisky in the wake of the British Revolution, but despite these products being powerhouses amongst our exports, their growth will plateau unless modern equipment is introduced to these respected but ageing distilleries."

If the Irish state were to cover the difference, it would ensure another civilian factory in operation, which would be a boon to the economy."
 IRE_ni_furniture_makers: "Subsidies for §YNorthern§! Furniture Makers"
 IRE_ni_furniture_makers_desc: "For over a century the north of Ireland has been the primary base for the island's textile manufacturing, and since independence, one of the persistent complaints from loyalists has been that investment in [IRE_loc_ulster] has never amounted to more than a pittance. Investing in [IRE_loc_ulster]'s historic textile mills might kill two birds with one stone; it can help rebuild the northern economy while also soothing loyalist feelings."

 IRE_harland_wolff_expansion: "Expand the §YHarland & Wolff§! Dockyards"
 IRE_harland_wolff_expansion_desc: "Perhaps more so than any other Irish organisation, Harland & Wolff on the Belfast docks has the greatest institutional memory of what a large-scale wartime effort entails. During the Weltkrieg, the facilities at Harland & Wolff buzzed day and night with activity as they supplied the British navy with equipment. While the company has obviously scaled down enormously since those dizzying heights, the potential to return to those levels of production is possible if called upon. It would require enormous investment for Harland & Wolff to reactivate facilities long-since dormant, as well vastly expanding its workforce, but if there were to occur, it would unlock a vast military-industrial complex for us."

 IRE_cork_car_factory_desc: "Henry Ford, whose father was born in [IRE_loc_county] [GetVictoryPointName_7394], famously set up his first overseas factory in 1917, near to the area where his father had emigrated from. Although the state has already gone out of its way to accommodate the factory in previous years, the reality is that further expansion will require additional grants to the Ford company. The Irish wing of the Ford company has been in a mild disarray owing to the fact the main branch of the company in America has been completely upended by developments over there. The main issue for the Irish wing has been that they are often unable to obtain capital from their American counterparts, an issue the Irish state can overcome if we feel that we must have more factories available to us."
 IRE_ferguson_tractors: "Open the §Y[GetVictoryPointName_9303]§! Tractor Plant"

 IRE_beet_factory_desc_start: "Although sugar is most easily extracted from sugar cane, grown in the tropics, it can also be produced from the sugar beet plant, which is capable of growing in colder climates.

 IRE_electrification: "Electrify the §Y[From.GetName]§! Countryside"
 IRE_electrification_desc: "[IRE_loc_electrification_desc]"
 IRE_leinster_electric_desc: "[GetStateName_113] is the most straightforward province in Ireland to electrify; the vast majority of the province is low-lying and flat, and already is connected to pre-existing infrastructure such as modern roads and railways. By radiating outwards from our capital in [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], we should have this portion completed speedily."
 IRE_northern_ireland_electric_desc: "[IRE_loc_ulster] is a province of two halves; low-lying and densely populated east [GetStateName_119] is already mostly electrified, it was simply a matter of connecting built up towns along a flat plain. West [GetStateName_119], however, is the complete opposite; what land that is not half way up a mountain is found in wet, marshy bogs. Although pre-existing railways will give us a basic blueprint for how to link up the main settlements, covering the hinterlands of the province will still be time consuming."
 IRE_munster_electric_desc: "Although [GetStateName_135] boasts two of Ireland's most significant cities, [GetVictoryPointName_7394] and [GetVictoryPointName_6313], this belies the fact that much of [GetStateName_135] is intensely rural, and this makes electrification of the province a challenge. Additionally, the southwest of the province is a geographical labyrinth of mountainous peninsulas that would challenge even hardy goats to climb, much less humans."
 IRE_connacht_electric_desc: "The electrification of Connacht is a dramatic challenge. To begin with, large sections of the province are covered in soft, damp marshes housing bogs doing their best to prevent any infrastructure ever taking root. Although not as mountainous as [GetStateName_135], Connacht too has its mountain ranges and they too are significant obstacles. Finally, Connacht is both Ireland's least populated and most rural province, with its population the most dispersed of the island, with a huge percentage living in villages and hamlets strung out along distant and far-flung farm roads. With the railroads few, and with many roads no more than muddy dirt paths, there is little existing infrastructure that we can build on top of, and thus in many cases we will be starting almost from scratch."

 IRE_gateway_to_the_atlantic_decisions_desc: "The Emerald Isle has long been a key strategic location due to its close proximity to Great Britain, and the major sea routes in the Atlantic Ocean that link North America and Europe. For centuries, the British have feared the island being used as a base by their enemies, while continental powers have aided Irish rebellions to wrest control of Irish ports from British hands. The Germans succeeded where the Spanish and French failed, and for a decade we have steadily drifted towards their sphere of influence. This was until the upheaval the came with Black Monday, which dealt a major blow to German interests and has given the British an opening to regain their former hegemony and spread syndicalist ideas.\n\nThe LÉ Macha Incident marks the beginning of a contest of diplomacy between the Union of Britain and the German Empire, as both powers seek to expand their influence within Ireland's society and institutions, and to potentially secure mastery over the isle's ports and skies for their use in the event of another Weltkrieg. This tug-of-war presents a great opportunity for Irish leaders to negotiate business opportunities and trade deals with the two naval powers for the benefit of the country's economy, however if not careful the growth of foreign influence may prove the undoing of Irish sovereignty, and political control of the nation will become merely a plaything of Ireland's benefactors...\n\nThe @GER §g[GER.GetName]§! currently have §Y[?GER.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\nThe @ENG §R[ENG.GetName]§! currently have §Y[?ENG.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\n\n$IRE_gateway_desc_ending$"

 IRE_gateway_to_the_atlantic_decisions_GER: "Gateway to the Atlantic"
 IRE_gateway_to_the_atlantic_decisions_GER_desc: "Control over the island of Ireland has always been of interest to European powers at odds with the British, due to its proximity to Great Britain and the Atlantic. No invasion plans or Irish rebellions would end in triumph until the Weltkrieg, during which arms shipments and international recognition from the German Empire successfully assisted the Irish in achieving their independence. Following the British Revolution, Irish leaders developed close ties with their liberator, pivoting the nation into Mitteleuropa. However, German business and investments on the island have been disturbed by Black Monday and the Union of Britain has seized the opportunity to flex their political muscles.\n\nIn the wake of the LÉ Macha Incident, the Union of Britain has intensified its efforts to foment socialist agitation in Ireland. It is crucial to German diplomatic, financial and strategic interests that a nation of the Mitteleuropean bloc does not fall to the growing tide of syndicalism, and to this end we must completely ensure via the promotion of Germanophile influences within the country, that the Irish Republic remains friendly to the Reichspakt. While the Irish may drift closer to us on their own accord, it would be in our interests to fully ensure that this occurs, as the use of the island as a base from which German forces can carry out aerial and naval operations against the British, and extend the Kaiserliche Marine's power into the Atlantic Ocean, may prove vital should war break out against the Third Internationale.\n\n§CWe§! currently have §Y[?GER.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\nThe @ENG §R[ENG.GetAdjective]§! currently have §Y[?ENG.IRE_gateway_influence]§! points.\n\n$IRE_gateway_desc_ending$\n$IRE_gateway_desc_ending_pp$"

The brutal measures taken partly to prevent this ultimately backfired, leading to the Irish becoming independent with the help of the German Empire. Though British intelligence has worked closely with Irish socialists for a decade, the prior stability of the Irish Republic meant they could achieve little as the country drifted into the German sphere, but with the nation's economy shaken up by Black Monday, we now have a renewed opportunity to expand the proletarian revolution westwards.\n\nWhile we clearly have no desire to colonise Ireland as the imperialists once did in the past centuries, it is imperative for the maintenance of British trade and national security that the Irish state does not fall under Teutonic sway, as such an event would allow the isle to serve as an enemy base should a repeated Weltkrieg break out.

With multiple TDs elected from each constituency, a strong party-focused democratic tradition has developed in Ireland, favouring the existence of multiple parties, and ensuring that coalitions and other agreements are often a necessity in the successful formation of a government.\n\nConsidering the banning of the syndicalist parties from elections, the disinterest of the UDP to participate outside of their north-eastern heartlands, and the abstentionism of some members of Aontas Náisiúnta, there are seven different parties competing for a position in government.\n\nConfounding this multi-party system however, is the office of Uachtarán, or President. The Presidency is directly chosen by the people, using a single-transferable-vote, at the same time as the Dáil election. This means that whoever wins the plurality of votes on the initial count, may not end up in charge after all the rounds of counting are completed. While voting for an \"outside candidate\" can never be a wasted vote, unlike some other democracies, the end result is still that the candidates that hold the broadest appeal across the political spectrum are likely to be successful.\n\nAs Ireland is a Presidential Republic, the first role of the President is to attempt to form a government, almost guaranteed to include their own party. Even with multiple parties running for the office, only a few are seen as having a genuine chance of gaining the Presidency itself.\n\nThe parties that have a chance at the Presidency, and to lead the formation of a government, are §gSinn Féin§!, §cAn Saorstát Críostúil§! and the §SLabour Party§!.\n\nThe current likely winner is [IRE_loc_election_plurality_holder]"

 ### Events ###

 # Intro #
 ireland.0.t: "The State of the Republic, 1936"
 ireland.0.d: "President Michael Collins leads the Irish Republic, for his second term and seventh consecutive year. Since gaining independence, his party has overseen all the country's major events, despite a stint in opposition in the 1920s.\n\nIt was through his negotiation that the nigh-impossible was achieved, when during the British Revolution he managed to secure the peaceful entry of Northern Ireland into the Republic, which had remained part of the United Kingdom in the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\n\nIt has also been under his reign that Ireland's economy was realigned from Britain to Germany, so far to great success. However, both have come at a price, with his image as a war hero and unwavering patriot called into question by those disquieted by his government's hostility to political radicals, its reliance on German capital, and his blind eye towards loyalist excesses in the north. This of course is not helped by Sinn Féin's new confidence-and-supply agreement with the Ulster Democratic Party, guaranteeing the northerners' continued autonomy in exchange for their support of the current government.\n\nBeset from the left, right and centre, Collins faces old allies and new enemies, all the while the red menace glares threateningly, just a short trip across the Irish Sea..."
 ireland.0.a: "Freedom imposes responsibilities."

 ireland.1.t: "The Model Republic"
 ireland.1.d: "This new year is notable for containing the 20th anniversary of the Easter Rising, and with it, the Proclamation of the Irish Republic.\n\nThe Irish people eagerly await the upcoming celebrations in April, but few of them could have imagined the Ireland of today. From the outside, Ireland appears a flourishing multi-party democracy, its new more modern image enhanced by the increasingly affluent, cosmopolitan atmosphere of the urban centres, brought on by Ireland's membership of Mitteleuropa and the increased continental presence on the island.\n\nThe incumbent Sinn Féin government looks forward to continue its term in office with the peace and prosperity that has defined it so far, and also with marking the significant approaching anniversary with the appropriate amount of aplomb. But they are not without their critics.\n\nConsidering the failings of previous governments to be the fault of weak executive power, Collins' actions of further centralising the authority of the Presidency, even if by constitutional means, are the cause of great consternation to his rivals. There is also the matter of his governments' tacit acceptance of the loyalist monopoly in the north, to the detriment of their nationalist neighbours.\n\nThis tint of authoritarianism, combined with the government's harsh crack-down on anything resembling syndicalism or radicalism, as well as rigorous political and press censorship, has put a harsher edge on what would otherwise appear a tolerant, modern Republic.\n\nDespite this, public approval remains high, and as Easter approaches, Collins has plenty to be pleased with."
 ireland.1.a: "Times are good."

 ireland.2.t: "The Death of King George"
 ireland.2.d: "George V, King of the United Kingdom, its Dominions, and Emperor of India succumbed to a long illness and finally shuffled off this mortal coil. As what remains of the British Empire enters a state of mourning, Ireland finds itself in a more complicated situation. Unsurprisingly, Northern Ireland and the Ulster Democratic Party have entered a state of official mourning for their King, but elsewhere feelings are mixed.\n\nKing George has often been cited as something of a Hibernophile, and his interventions in support of Ireland are quietly respected among even republicans; criticising Britain's reaction to the Easter Rising, attempting to stop executions during the War of Independence, and fierce opposition to the notorious British paramilitaries, the Black and Tans. But perhaps his most enduring feat would be convincing his Tory cabinet to approve his famous speech at the opening of the Northern Irish Parliament, promoting peace, forgiveness and reconciliation amongst all Irishmen, which at least somewhat has come to pass...\n\nFor most of Ireland, the memory of its one-time King is still tainted by all that he represented, but on a personal basis, he was widely acknowledged as even-handed. While there is no doubt that even outside of the north, many Irish men and women are noting the occasion respectfully, President Collins has been warned that any overt displays of grief or support could ignite tense political strife that runs amok in these trying days."
 ireland.2.a: "It's not really of our concern."
 ireland.2.b: "Send the Canadians a private message of our condolences."
 ireland.2.c: "Politics be damned, Collins shall speak up!"

 ireland.3.t: "Ireland Speaks on the King's Death"
 ireland.3.d.start: "Relations with the Irish Republic have been somewhat cold, if absent, since the collapse of the Empire in 1925, owing to its legally spurious annexation of Northern Ireland and the treaty ports; but some warmer exchanges do occur."
 ireland.3.d1: "$ireland.3.d.start$\n\nToday, a private telegram was delivered to the government from President Collins himself, expressing his sincerest condolences over the death of George, and promising that the memory of its last King would never be forgotten or tarnished."
 ireland.3.d2: "$ireland.3.d.start$\n\nToday, word has reached the cabinet from Dublin, that President Collins gave a respectful and solemn speech in recognition of the passing of Ireland's final King. Even as an Irish nationalist and republican, Collins invoked George's legacy of promoting forgiveness and reconciliation, no doubt aimed towards his own politically divided country. Nonetheless, seeing Ireland show such a public display on the King's passing came as a surprise to many."
 ireland.3.a: "How unexpected."
 ireland.3.b: "Even in Ireland, his legacy endures."

 ireland.4.t: "The Canadians Reply"
 ireland.4.d: "Today the government received a reply from the Canadian government.\n\nThey thanked the cabinet for their wishes on the King's death, and spoke of the hope that both nations could put much of their past behind them."
 ireland.4.a: "That's nice of them."

 ireland.5.t: "Collins Speaks on King George's Death"
 ireland.5.d: "Today in central Dublin, flanked by members of his cabinet, President Collins gave a solemn speech in recognition of the passing of Ireland's final King, George V. Collins invoked his legacy of promoting forgiveness and reconciliation, and called on all Irishmen to focus on unity and peace rather than strife and division.\n\nWhile some hardline loyalists have taken issue with Collins \"appropriating\" King George's death, it appears to have gone down quite well with de facto head of Northern Ireland, Basil Brooke, speaking out in favour of Collins.\n\nNaturally elsewhere, the speech has been controversial with some of the far-left and far-right accusing Collins of \"playing up to a British tyrant\" and \"glamorising the loyalist cause\" respectively, but regardless it appears to have silent approval from most Irish of all allegiance."
 ireland.5.a: "It was the right thing to do."

 ireland.6.t: "The Death of Hugo O'Neill"
 ireland.6.d: "Surprising news has arrived from Portugal, in that Hugo José Jorge O'Neill has tragically died at sea. A former officer of the Portuguese Navy, O'Neill was aboard the Portuguese ship Sol Nascente in a reunion with fellow Portuguese naval veterans, when the ship ran aground and sank with the loss of several of her passengers, including O'Neill himself. The deceased was the head of the Clanaboy O'Neill dynasty, the most prominent sept of the ancient O'Neills, perhaps Ireland's most powerful family in the Gaelic era. The family had fled to the continent in the 1700s after their land was confiscated and colonised, and were now living as a minor noble house in Portugal.\n\nA fringe of the far-right in Ireland hold the belief that Ireland can only truly thrive by restoring the Gaelic traditions, which some go as far as to include a Gaelic monarchy. If Hugo was to be taken by them to be a potential claimant, that has now passed to his son Jorge Maria, who like his late father has also not shown any interest in such propositions.\n\nLow-circulation publications produced by these movements have already begun to spread conspiracy theories around the cause of the accident, claiming that the ship was sabotaged or bombed by British or French agents operating in Portugal."
 ireland.6.a: "What a strange age we live in."

 # Black Monday / Ulster Comes First #
 ireland.7.t: "Black Monday Hits Ireland"
 ireland.7.d: "It hit Ireland like a storm. The gradual change in pressure as German growth slowed, and then a sudden and dramatic onslaught. Multiple, disparate sources from Germany were the first indication, reaching the government and prominent investors first. From there, news of this economic crash in Berlin spread like wildfire, by the time it was in the papers the next morning, there were few who were still unaware. Despite claims in the papers that \"the situation had stabilised\", every day brought increasingly grim news, and soon, the ripples hit Ireland, investments vanished, orders dried up. Government Buildings were filled with individuals rushing from department to department, carrying the latest reports.\n\nWithin days the first factories shut their doors, and the first banks found themselves unable to meet the demands of terrified customers. The economic engine of the nation ground to a halt as the ripples spread to every sector, a shock and a numbness setting in across Ireland; the silence of people living in fear. The calls on Dublin to do something grew louder, almost loud enough to drown out the growling of empty stomachs. If they did not answer these calls soon, they might become more than demands for help."
 ireland.7.a: "Jesus, Mary and Joseph..."

 ireland.8.t: "Unease in Ulster"
 ireland.8.d: "The province of Ulster, particularly in the areas that made up Northern Ireland, has long been the most industrialised region of Ireland. For decades, loyalist arguments against Irish Home Rule or independence have held that the rest of the country would use the area as an economic crutch, propping up the comparatively more rural south. As a result of Black Monday putting a severe strain on the Irish economy, said fears have sprung from the grave, spreading like wildfire among the Protestants of Ulster, including within the Ulster Democratic Party.\n\nUDP TDs have publicly made their demands known through angry speeches in Dáil Éireann, insisting that the wellbeing of Ulster, being the economically strongest province of the isle and having joined the Irish Republic only because they feared syndicalist rule moreso, must be put first during the economic recovery, as well as making vague but ominous threats of upheaval in the province if their urgings are not followed. This is naturally much to the fury of other parties in the chamber, who point out that Ulster is not the only province in the country which is suffering, and that the UDP's insistences are little more than barely-concealed selfishness.\n\nWhile Collins and many of his cabinet share the other parties' strong sense of frustration at the UDP's unreasonableness in a time of national crisis, and their refusal to address rumours of Catholics being fired in disproportionate numbers, he and his ministers are painfully aware that they are unfortunately stuck between a rock and a hard place on the matter — they are dependent on the UDP's confidence-and-supply agreement to preserve a Sinn Féin majority in the Dáil, and are keen to maintain peace on the isle, even if appeasing the concerns and interests of the loyalist population may sometimes upset the general Irish public."
 ireland.8.a: "Those Protestants, up to no good as usual."
 ireland.8.a.tt: "§YThe loyalists demand that we prioritise Northern Ireland in the fallout of the financial crisis.§!\n"

 ireland.9.t: "The Empty Factories"
 ireland.9.d: "In the past few years, while the Irish economy did not exactly boom, it enjoyed a relatively stable growth, particularly in the industrial sector where many have found themselves drawn to the cities with the promise of a reliable wage. While Ireland remains one of the most agrarian nations in Europe, this shift has led to the development of what could be seen as a proper \"working class\" as was previously only seen in the industrial heartland of the north. This promise of steady growth and steady jobs was one of the carrots Sinn Féin had been able to rely on in order to ensure support in urban areas.\n\nWith the economic trauma resulting from the recent crash of the German markets, all this has come to an end. As the Irish economy continues to contract more and more, factories are beginning to shut down, leaving their former employees without any alternative employment to turn to. With the meagre savings they may have kept starting to run dry, many now feel a building resentment towards the incumbent Sinn Féin government who can no longer position themselves as the party of prosperity.\n\nWithout this unspoken contract between them and their voters, many now find themselves wondering why they should bother voting for a status-quo party to begin with? Labour promises salvation for the workers who have been left behind by Sinn Féin, while Saorstát Críostúil acts as a refuge for those on the right who fear the prospect of a Labour government.\n\nSinn Féin is now faced with the nightmare of any incumbent party, it must somehow try to ask voters to forget all they have previously done and show that this time, they will be different."
 ireland.9.a: "We will win them back in time."
 ireland.9.a.tt: "Remove §Y3§! offmap §YCivilian Factories.§!"

 ireland.10.t: "The Silent Ports"
 ireland.10.d: "As demand from the continent plummeted, it was immediately felt in the many ports of Ireland, as every day less and less ships arrived, and those that did arrive left with less and less cargo. Where once the ports had been buzzing with activity, quays stacked high with produce ready to be shipped off to mainland Europe, now there was only emptiness. For the various dock workers in Ireland's major ports, this was a time of great idleness, and as they had nothing else to do, they talked.\n\nThe initial conversations of trivial matters like sports and domestic life inevitably gave way to discussions on the deteriorating economic situation, and as the days went on, these conversations grew increasingly bitter. Many began to openly doubt the government's ability to fix the crisis, and some even began to ask if maybe something different was needed. Eventually they didn't have the money spare to chat in the pub anymore, so they stood in the cold, milling around in the vain hope that some work would appear that day, before the arbitrary time arrived to head home empty handed again."
 ireland.10.a: "They better not get any notions."

 ireland.11.t: "Life Amongst Ghosts"
 ireland.11.d: "Ireland's farmers were not strangers to hard times; whether it be bad weather, unfair prices, or the ancestral horrors of blight baked into their psyche. Those that tended the fields or grazed their livestock only did so because they had been survivors; those who made it through the bad times. But they were surrounded by those that didn't. As they watched their sheep browse amongst the stone shells of old houses, or grazed their cattle over the faint ridges of forgotten potato drills, they were reminded of those who had long since departed.\n\nOf late however, a new set of ghosts has begun to haunt rural Ireland: Houses left newly abandoned; their owners left with nothing, after the demand for cattle and other products collapsed. They sold their lands in an attempt to make what they could before departing for the cities, but this was often for far less than it was worth. Slowly, what had once been patchworks of ownership began to concentrate around a fewer but more comfortable farmers, who found themselves benefiting greatly from the downturn.\n\nAs these families left their homes, they could not help but wonder how such a thing had been allowed to happen, how could an Irish government manage to ruin things for its farmers almost as badly as the British had, a government they had once believed in for that matter. While many undoubtedly still felt the connection between Sinn Féin and their freedom, they doubted if they could ever truly trust the party again."
 ireland.11.a: "Regions struggling to stand,\nbrought to their knees."

 ireland.12.t: "The Dust Clears"
 ireland.12.d: "Taken entirely by surprise by the sudden economic maelstrom which struck Europe, the Irish Government has scrambled in the months following the beginning of Black Monday to rescue the country's financial situation from complete collapse, and appease loyalist demands to prioritise the salvaging of Ulster's economy."
 ireland.12.d1: "$ireland.12.d$\n\nOvercoming these hurdles, the government's swift and decisive efforts on both fronts appear to have succeeded in bearing fruit. Bailouts for farmers have kept the impact of the loss of revenue from exports under control, the Ulster Democratic Party and the loyalist population remain supportive of the current administration as a bulwark against syndicalism and hardline nationalism, and reports from local canvassers have found that despite the circumstances, support among the Irish people for Sinn Féin remains high.\n\nIn spite of public opinion being generally satisfied with the manner in which Sinn Féin have contained Black Monday, continuing issues regarding the closure of businesses, evictions, unemployment and the recurring issue of the Ulster Privileges continue to be a hot topic in the opposition's speeches and propaganda in preparation for the upcoming elections.\n\nHowever, the government's excellent handling of the crisis means that the scenario of Michael Collins' re-election to the Presidency is now a very likely possibility, and senior deputies of An Saorstáit Críostúil have privately intimated that, should the moment call for it, they could be willing to temporarily cooperate with Sinn Féin and even the UDP for the common good of the Irish Republic."
 ireland.12.d2: "$ireland.12.d$\n\nWhile the government have restored stability to the nation's finances and prevented anarchy in rural areas, a choice which the majority of the Irish people agree was the correct decision, its failure to focus on Ulster to the degree demanded of them by the Ulster Democratic Party has resulted in disturbances within the province, and potentially endangered Sinn Féin's chances of re-election, should the UDP choose to end their confidence-and-supply agreement.\n\nNot only have the UDP grown irritated by the limited support provided to Ulster, with their fear of the abolition of the Ulster Privileges by an alternative administration being the only thing holding back notions of ceasing their support, but, making a bad state of affairs even worse, hardline loyalist and anti-Catholic elements have seized the opportunity to boost their fortunes by accusing the UDP of weakness and encouraging Protestant workers to organise protests and go on strike with the goal of further disrupting the Irish state.\n\nWhile their calls have been listened to only sporadically, and the UDP is tacitly accepting of the slight improvement in the state of the overall economy, it still presents a significant thorn in the government's side in light of Black Monday and the risk of violent clashes between loyalists and the Blueshirts."
 ireland.12.d3: "$ireland.12.d$\n\nWhile the Governmnet succeeded in addressing loyalist clamour and keeping a state of calm within Ulster, despite concerns that the crisis would result in the opening of old wounds, they have been unable to avert the deleterious effects of Black Monday's shockwaves elsewhere on the isle, and as a consequence the administration has been left open to accusations of having put loyalist interests first over the rest of the nation.\n\nThe government's attempts to persuade an infuriated populace that the decision to focus on Ulster was a calculated initiative to protect Ireland's industries, and not merely a move to placate the UDP, have swayed fewer than hoped, and scattered protests have broken out against the government throughout the Irish countryside among large and small farmers alike, angered about the inability of the government to resolve declining rural living standards, and its failure to offer significant subsidies to compensate for their loss of revenue.\n\nThe sporadic outcry has been eagerly fanned by the parties of the opposition, recognising a perfect opportunity to take the reins of the Irish Republic in the wake of what appears to have been a great blunder in the court of public opinion for Sinn Féin. The reality is though, Sinn Féin could have done a lot worse than aiding their supporters in Dáil, and their regime looks to run somewhat smoothly until the next election."
 ireland.12.d4: "$ireland.12.d$\n\nThe government's endeavours in both these regards have ended in failure, with severe repercussions being felt throughout the nation. The UDP has grown disenchanted with the incumbent Sinn Féin administration, its position as a big-tent loyalist party under threat from hardliners due to their perceived weakness, and unemployment, declining living standards and crime are on the rise. Opposition parties have avidly fanned the flames of public anger, smelling blood in the water.\n\nAlarmingly for the future of peace on the isle, many have remarked of an upswing in support for Aontas Náisiúnta outside of the party's established strongholds in Munster and predominantly Catholic areas of Ulster, as the dramatic breakdown of pro-German economics, Blueshirt protection of protesting farmers and fears of syndicalist and loyalist upheaval attract surging numbers to their radical proposals.\n\nWithin Sinn Féin itself, whispers of hostility to Collins' leadership are flourishing, his past achievements on behalf of Ireland progressively forgotten in light of his bungling management of the crisis. In the eyes of a growing number of people both in and out of the ruling party, it would appear that the Big Fellow was far better suited as a military man than a statesman."
 ireland.12.d5: "$ireland.12.d$\n\nThe government's failure to do anything with regards to Ulster has exploded in its face, sparking an outbreak of havoc at the most calamitous moment for Ireland's financial recovery. Disturbances have spread like wildfire across the north, worst of all riots in Protestant districts of Belfast and Derry, requiring force from the Gardaí to quell, and a series of bombings, killing several, mostly Catholic, civilians.\n\nThe UDP is simmering with outrage towards the administration, finding itself under severe pressure from hardliners due to their perceived weakness. Their confidence-and-supply agreement is as good as over, holding by a thread only for fear of Aontas Náisiúnta, their leader Eoin O'Duffy now baying for blood over the bombings in speeches given to surging audiences.\n\nCollins' leadership of Sinn Féin lives merely on borrowed time, his legacy forever stained. His foolishly spiteful actions are near-universally condemned even among party faithful, having destroyed any chance of re-election in the foreseeable future and placed the Irish Republic at risk of a return to the economic depression and paramilitary violence that marked Brugha's presidency."

 # Pre-Elections #
 ireland.13.t: "Stitchies and Pinnies"
 ireland.13.d: "Ever since the Great Depression of the 1920s, conflict between far-left and far-right paramilitaries have been persistent occurrences within Ireland, clashing with each other as well as with loyalist groups in the north. The two paramilitary groups, the socialist Irish Citizen Army, or the \"Pinnies\", and the far-right National Guard, also known as the \"Blueshirts\" or \"Stitchies\", trace their origins to the old Anti-Treaty IRA. Their nicknames originate from a remaining symbol of their common descent, the Easter Lily, a stylised calla lily badge sold and worn to commemorate the Easter Rising, with pin-and-paper lilies worn by Saor Éire and the ICA, and embroidered lily badges worn by Aontas Náisiúnta and the National Guard. The choice of lily has ended up being a visible marker of one's political allegiance.\n\nThe Black Monday crisis has led to an upswing in paramilitary recruitment and violent incidents. This has included attacks on left and right-wing speakers and meetings, street fighting, and acts of vandalism and arson on properties owned by the opposing side, particularly in Ulster where tensions around the issues of worker's rights, the Ulster Privileges and allegations of discrimination against Catholics are steadily worsening.\n\nAontas Náisiúnta, seeking to avoid giving the government an excuse for a ban on their party, continues to officially maintain that the Blueshirts have been disbanded and that these clashes are the work of independent vigilantes and not attributable to them, but many naturally remain sceptical of this claim.\n\nThe ICA and their party Saor Éire are also inextricably linked, though both also remain equally as banned. These groups see Irish nationalism and revolutionary socialism as one and the same, and will stop at nothing to advance their aims, even including accepting support from the British — if the rumours are true, that is."

 ireland.14.t: "The Anniversary"
 ireland.14.d: "Today, the 24th of April 1936, marked the 20th anniversary of the start of the 1916 Easter Rising. Many were unsure whether or not the festivities would go ahead as planned, but all fears were allayed by any instructions from the Office of the President.\n\nIt began with an elaborate military parade through the streets of Dublin, culminating in a solemn procession down O'Connell Street, in front of the General Post Office, where the Proclamation of the Irish Republic was first read out on Easter Monday. Marching bands, both brass bands and pipers, accompanied the troops, playing old Gaelic airs in a martial style. The streets were bursting with the crowds present, to the extent that some people watched from the decks of boats floating high on the Liffey.\n\nThe atmosphere was jubilant, and no onlooker would believe this was happening in a country whose economy was falling to pieces at that very moment.\n\nAs the parades stopped and the soldiers assembled, facing the GPO, a single military officer marched forward to the front of the building to read out the Proclamation, as Pádraig Pearse had done twenty years previous. But, to the surprise of both the crowds and the officials that had gathered, this was not just any officer.\n\nPresident Collins, wearing his Generals' uniform from the War of Independence, stood facing the country. The man who had perhaps done more than anyone else, to win Ireland its freedom. He began, in the only words that he could have..."

 ireland.15.d: "\"Irishmen and Irishwomen: In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom...\"\n\nFinishing the Proclamation, he was initially met with a brief stunned silence, and then rapturous applause. When this abated, he began a resolute address to the nation. Speaking with conviction, he acknowledged the challenges that the country was facing, and urged all to face them, together. He went on, saying that militarily, the Easter Rising itself was never going to be a success, but it was built on hope in the face of utmost desperation — much like how Ireland was now, with its current predicaments.\n\nClosing the speech, he announced that the 24th of April was to become the formally recognised Independence Day for Ireland, to be celebrated annually. This was to mark a new beginning, with Ireland's relationship with itself (he said, directing his attention towards the few token loyalists in attendance), and with the world at large.\n\nHis words were met with, at worst, quiet admiration, from across the entire political spectrum. Regardless of their position currently, all political movements in Ireland, except the loyalists, could be traced to the Easter Rising, and as such it was one of the few things that united the country. Whether or not this new beginning he spoke of meant the future for Ireland being reaffirmation of the status quo, or more radical change, was not relevant to this.\n\nFor that day alone, everyone realised that despite the ongoing rampant upheaval, they still had their so long-sought-after freedom and independence. And for a short while, it was all that mattered."

 ireland.16.t: "Rise of the Reds"
 ireland.16.d: "Since Black Monday, our nation has seen a concerning increase in subversion and violence perpetrated by syndicalist agitators. One notorious incident is a murder arising from a land dispute in Edgeworthstown in County Longford, surrounding the treatment of tenants whose rents were fixed, but wages were declining as a result of the economic crisis. The local Tenants' Association passed a resolution inviting the intervention of Saor Éire, and implicitly, its armed wing, the Irish Citizen Army, resulting in the tragic death of land agent Gerald More O'Ferrell's son Richard. This occurred at a dinner party that was stormed by ICA men dressed in Garda uniforms and carrying revolvers, with the intention of kidnapping Gerald. Richard fought against his father's would-be kidnappers, leading to both O'Ferrells being shot during the scuffle, the son fatally.\n\nA Dublin bus and tram strike organised in response to the sacking of a driver accused, without evidence, of dangerous driving, has also seen extensive involvement from Jim Larkin's banned Irish Syndicalist Party, which committed a cell to organise the striking workers and extensively covered the strike in their party newspaper. In addition, members of the Irish Citizen Army fired on the tyres of army trucks deployed to provide transport to the city in replacement of striking buses, injuring two members of the Gardaí while doing so. Though the strike was resolved and the Gardaí arrested forty-four syndicalists including Larkin's son and high-ranking ISP member Jim Larkin Jr., many are beginning to fear the implications of this rise in syndicalist activity, and question whether Ireland could potentially fall to syndicalism as Britain did.\n\nSince this strike, there have been sporadic but consistent protests taking place in Dublin, made up of disaffected workers from urban and rural backgrounds, and generally those just discontent with the government. These protests have taken the form of disruptive but peaceful marches and demonstrations outside of the Dáil, under the watchful eye of the Gardaí, in the unlikely event that anything further develops."

 ireland.17.d: "The university grounds of Trinity College exploded into bedlam today, when a seminar on women's rights given by Progressive Labour Party leader Owen Sheehy-Skeffington coincided with a speech regarding the \"Resurrection of Portugal\" by Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin, a prominent Aontas Náisiúnta politician and leader of the far-right party's youth wing. These attracted large numbers of supporters from both parties who, upon recognising each other, began to fight.\n\nIn recent years the socially liberal and economically left-wing Progressive Labour Party and the radical abstentionist and pro-integralist wing of Aontas Náisiúnta have come to command a notable support base among the youth of Ireland, notably university students, leading to the formation of the youth groups the Young Ireland Association, led by Ó Cuinneagáin, and Young Labour, the latter of which political commentators have suggested was founded to attract the youth of Ireland away from the extremist appeal of AN.\n\nReports vary as to the origin of the violence, with sources sympathetic to the Young Ireland Association claiming that members of Young Labour attempted to prevent Ó Cuinneagáin's speech and ambushed several of his followers, while other sources sympathetic towards the Progressive Labour Party claim that the Young Ireland Association threw the first punch by attacking left-wing students on their way to attend Sheehy-Skeffington's seminar. Several injuries have been reported and, calls in the wake of the battle from PLP and AN supporters that there should be \"no free speech for integralists\" and to fight the \"West Brit syndies\" respectively, increase concerns that this incident will lead to violent clashes between PLP and AN supporters in other universities where sympathies for the two parties are strong among students."

 ireland.18.t: "The Dance Hall Debate"
 ireland.18.d: "The Catholic Church and social conservatives in Ireland have long been opposed to the existence of dance halls, regarding them as responsible for spreading debauchery and social immorality such as fornication and prostitution, and as a foreign influence corrupting traditional Irish values.\n\nIn keeping with his staunch belief in a traditional Irish nation devout in its Christian faith, Éamon de Valera, the leader of the largest opposition party An Saorstát Críostúil, introduced a Private Members Bill in the Dáil, calling for draconian regulations on public dance premises, which would be required to obtain a license subject to the discretion of a district court, with Gardaí and priests granted the power to make oppositions.\n\nThough An Saorstat Críostúil's bill was supported by an odd alliance of Aontas Náisiúnta, Clann na Talmhan and the Labour Party, the bill ultimately failed to pass in the face of opposition by Sinn Féin, the Ulster Democratic Party, the National Development Party and the Progressive Labour Party. For Sinn Féin in particular, such a bill would be seen as going against their overall modernising and ecumenical agenda.\n\nPolitical commentators however suspect that it was never designed to pass, but as an attempt to bolster support of social conservatives and the Church for An Saorstát Críostúil, and to differentiate themselves from Sinn Féin, who presided over the situation that allowed Black Monday and the recent matters in the north to occur. Indeed, this decision has encouraged parish priests across the country to denounce from the pulpit the Germanophilic liberalism of Sinn Féin as inimical to native Irish culture and Catholic morality, and to attempt to persuade their parishioners to support An Saorstát Críostúil."

 ireland.19.t: "What Makes an Irishman?"
 ireland.19.d: "A National Development Party TD, Frank MacDermot, has sparked controversy during a debate in the Dáil by criticising the mandatory teaching of the Irish language in schools, and the required proficiency in the language for entry into the civil service, as was introduced by Brugha in the 20s.\n\nMacDermot describes these as being discriminatory towards loyalists, and detrimental to the education of Irish children, denouncing the desire of the government and many of the opposition parties for the complete revival of the Irish language across Ireland as being impossible and undesirable in consideration of the English language's greater influence.\n\nIn response to claims that the revival of the Irish language was necessary for national independence, MacDermot remarked that the nations of the Americas lacked an exclusive language yet possessed full senses of national consciousness defined by popular sovereignty. He finished, saying that Ireland was now made up of not only those of the Gaelic tradition, and that this should be given recognition.\n\nThis statement created outrage among some Gaelic revivalists, and Aontas Náisiúnta seized the opportunity to stir up their base, and gain support by attacking the National Development Party as a party of West Britons that seek to give even more concessions to loyalists. Speaking at a large rally, Eoin O'Duffy boasted that Ireland would always be a nation defined by its faith and Gaelic identity, and ridiculed the claims that the mandatory teaching of Irish and the requirement of the language to enter the civil service was discriminatory, retorting that the objection of Protestants to such measures only proved them to be untrustworthy and lacking loyalty to the Irish nation."

 ireland.20.t: "A New Force Arises"
 ireland.20.d: "During the past few years, rural regions of Ireland, particularly in the western province of Connacht and the south of Leinster, have seen the rise of a small but well-organised agrarian grassroots movement and party, Clann na Talmhan, under the leadership of Michael Donnellan. Derided as a demagogue by his opponents, he has become known for his rallies and populist speeches attacking \"parasitic elements\" of society such as politicians, financiers, produce processors, farm input suppliers and, on occasion, the Jews. While socially conservative views are frequent among Clann na Talmhan and its supporters, the party's left-leaning economic views, seeking in particular to benefit Ireland's small farmers, have led to close cooperation with the Labour Party throughout the west of Ireland.\n\nThe Labour Party itself has also seen its support rise following Black Monday, with Labour activism and branches increasing throughout the major cities of Ireland, most notably in Dublin where Labour politicians regularly address large crowds on the corner of Abbey Street, with speeches regarding slum housing, unemployment and attacking the Sinn Féin government for a perceived lack of interest in plight of the Irish worker. Labour's opponents have attempted to stem their rise with usual red-bashing, but Labour leader William O'Brien's staunch efforts to cleanse the party of syndicalist influences and disavow any connection to syndicalist parties or organisations have rendered such attacks unconvincing for the growing number of unemployed.\n\nRumours have begun to spread that Donnellan and O'Brien have already met privately to agree the possibility of a coalition between their two parties in the event of success in the next election, and pollsters have suggested that the rise of discontent among Ireland's working class following Black Monday might allow a combined Labour and Clann na Talmhan alliance to rise from being minor parties in the Dáil to a decisive force in Irish politics."

 ireland.21.t: "Going to the Polls"
 ireland.21.d: "Just as soon as the hurdles of Black Monday and the LÉ Macha Incident were passed, did a fresh difficulty appear on the horizon for Sinn Féin. This was an obstacle not entirely unexpected, but one which had been left to gnaw at the back of every SF TD's mind, distracted by the hustle and bustle of the year's crises while the opposition anxiously awaited and prepared; the upcoming 1937 Irish general election.\n\nUnder the current Irish Constitution, the term of the Presidency and the maximum term of the Dáil both comprise a period of four years, at which point the Dáil must be dissolved and an election held within ninety days. As canvassers go from door to door, electoral manifestos are drawn up, and posters and speeches made, many suspect that this election, to be decided on the 14th of February, will be a hotly contested and momentous one.\n\nFor the longest time in Irish politics, from the pre-independence era until the late 1920s, the trend was for one party to achieve a position of ascendancy over all others, often single handedly capturing the seats of the bulk of the island. The fortunes of the Irish Parliamentary Party, Sinn Féin and Brugha's ill-fated Cumann an tSaorstáit all followed this pattern until the fallout of CatS's failures brought about a new age; one of political fracturing in which one party alone could no longer wield the ability to command a majority in Dáil Éireann.\n\nAs Sinn Féin's dethronement appears a possibility, commentators fiercely debate the consequences of what would be Ireland's first coalition government. Is this a victory for representative democracy or does proportional representation bog the country down? It all depends on who you ask."

Newspapers from both the left and right castigated Collins' handling of the crisis and the pro-German business model that had led the country into its current situation, and their fury had begun seeping into the highest offices. Collins' authoritarianism and dependence on Germany had its dissenters among his party, but they previously remained silent out of fear of challenging their seemingly indomitable leader. Now that the Big Fellow's reputation was no longer the sacred cow it had once seemed, these voices were no longer silent. As elections loomed, few wanted to be tied to the sinking ship that Collins' government had become. In backrooms and corridors, members of Sinn Féin began to plan for a future beyond the Big Fellow.\n\nThings came to a head in a meeting with certain members of the party, they hinted to him that perhaps he may wish to \"consider his position\" before the \"certain concerned individuals forced an unfavourable outcome\". The thinly-veiled nature of these statements was obvious to Collins — they were demanding he resign, or they would try and boot him out. He didn't know who they envisioned to replace him, but he suspected Mulcahy being absent from the meeting was no coincidence.\n\nHe was a fox backed into a corner, possibly more so than any time when he was the most wanted man in the United Kingdom. He could still fight back though — he still held all the power in this arrangement and could fire a warning shot to his cabinet that breaking ranks in times such as these would not be tolerated. There were still plenty who still believed in him, to whom his mythos as the man who had won their freedom still mattered, and they would support him if he showed he was not going to give in, and was going to keep fighting. If he could show he still had momentum, he knew those still on the fence would support him, in the interests of party stability if nothing else. He had to make a decision now though, would he step aside and preserve the reputation he had left? Or would he make one last gamble in his long career?"

Initially many within the party were unsure who could even fill the Big Fellow's boots, and in spite of the candidates who had been proposed in backdoor meetings, there was still a vague feeling that anything could happen, one marked by a sense of dread considering the looming election.\n\nIn reality, the question of Collins' successor had been settled from the beginning. While Sinn Féin wished to distance themselves from Collins, they still were largely aligned with his policies, all they needed was a figure to rally around. They found that figure in General Richard Mulcahy, a leading republican since the War of Independence, who has shown himself to be a astute player of the political game, thanks in part to his popularity from the war. In the eyes of many within the party, if anyone was going to be able to set the party back on course, it was going to be Mulcahy.\n\nWhatever his skills however, the mere fact Mulcahy's accession alone will not be enough to secure Sinn Féin victory in this election.

The sentiment that had convinced his colleagues to try unseat him was even more fervent among the public, and knowing that Collins would still be leading Sinn Féin into the election would likely make the grievances of many irreconcilable. The reality was that the party stood a good chance of losing this election, regardless of who was in charge.

They have also promised further land reform, the guaranteeing of wheat prices, the increase of tillage land and a break from the current orientation of Irish agriculture around pasture farming for the European market.\n\nThe Labour Party has denounced the other parties' suggestions of upcoming cutbacks, as striking the poor and unemployed the harshest, and warned that SC's protectionist policies will allow Irish manufacturers to use their privileged status to charge higher prices.

Asked for their opinions on ensuring long-term peace in Ulster, senior SC TDs mooted a move towards a federal Ireland as a possible solution to the current situation.\n\nThe Labour Party, reflecting a long-time position taken by the Irish labour movement, has insisted that Catholics and Protestants workers have more in common with each other than their bosses, and must forgo their sectarian differences to instead unite in opposition to class exploitation.

In line with the party's Germanic influences, Collins has used the example of the relationship between Catholics and Protestants in Germany as a model for the Irish nation to follow.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil has long tried to stand out as the most Christian political party of the Irish Republic, a political position for the party has in recent times found itself with tough competition in the form of the radically right-wing Aontas Náísiúnta. Nonetheless the support of the majority of the Catholic clergy remains for now behind SC, and the party's TDs have a made a point in their speeches to denounce Collins and Sinn Féin as anti-Catholic secularists who have betrayed Ireland's ancient faith by permitting influences such as contraception, dance halls and divorce to corrupt the hearts and souls of the Irish people.\n\nThe Labour Party, being particularly vulnerable to accusations of harbouring anti-Christian politics in light of their centre-left alignment and socialist origins, has taken great measures to emphasise through speeches by their TDs and articles in their party newspaper The Standard of the party's commitment to aspects of Catholic social teaching, and opposition to the godless ideology of syndicalism. As Labour sees it, their belief in the establishment of a just social order are perfectly in keeping with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Papal Encyclical of Rerum Novarum."

 ireland.30.d: "In light of the decrease in German power in the wake of Black Monday, the question of Ireland's relations with its closest neighbour, the Union of Britain, has become a more pertinent matter in the run-up to the election.\n\nSinn Féin, having been denounced left, right and centre by the opposition as being unpatriotic as a result of their support for the Ulster Privileges and continued Irish membership of Mitteleuropa, have eagerly seized the opportunity to play the nationalist and Anglophobic card, calling for increased security and armament to safeguard Ireland from British invasion and infiltration.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil has, in an unusual move, pushed for closer relations between the Irish Republic and the Union of Britain. In a speech that has provoked much controversy, Éamon de Valera argued that so long as the two nations could stick to \"tending their own gardens\", they would find themselves natural allies as the islands of Ireland and Great Britain, in de Valera's view, would always possess a mutual self-interest in preserving each other's independence, for their own sovereignty would be placed in jeopardy if the other's was to be threatened.\n\nThe Labour Party has also called for diplomacy with the Union of Britain, arguing from a trading standpoint that a lack of commerce with Ireland's closet neighbour is a hindrance to Irish economic growth, and that open trade would improve the business prospects of Irish traders, who currently are forced to resort to selling to the Union under the table. Though an abnormal argument for Labour to make, it helps to deter accusations of harbouring syndicalist sympathies of which the party, due to their social democratic politics and trade union ties, remain deathly afraid."

Just like Sinn Féin before them, de Valera will be forced to entreat the support of other parties to form a government, an arrangement that could likely require compromising on their ideals in certain areas."

 ireland.33.d1: "As SC suspected beforehand, the Anglophile leanings of many of the National Development Party's notables have resulted in problems arising as they engaged in talks to form a government. The NDP's leader Seán Lemass, although nowhere near as pro-British as his fellows, is a sternly pragmatic man who unlike SC, spares little sympathy for the plight of Northern Catholics, and regards the resuscitation of the Irish economy as the utmost priority, fearing that alienating loyalists while the effects of Black Monday still continue to take their detrimental toll on the island, might derail any efforts by sparking instability.\n\nHe has insisted that An Saorstát Críostúil must agree to avoid the issue of the Ulster Privileges as a condition for the formation of any coalition between SC and the NDP. Éamon de Valera and his party, on the other hand, are keenly aware that should such the news of such an agreement be leaked in the currently heated political environment, the consequences could be disastrous. As a cunning negotiator and possessing a good personal and working relationship with Lemass, de Valera could try to haggle with Lemass on this matter, pledging to bring Ireland's financial situation under control first, and resolve the issue of the Privileges afterwards, though some of Lemass's colleagues will be less than pleased."
 ireland.33.d.eod: "Alternatively, SC can abandon their negotiations with the NDP, and establish a government with Aontas Náisiúnta. As much as senior SC figures including de Valera hate to admit it, the ideals of SC share more in common with AN than with the NDP, and this has not gone unnoticed by SC backbenchers, party members and voters alike, many of whom increasingly favour a coalition with AN. With resentment towards the Ulster Privileges only becoming more inflamed as time goes on, many in SC see a Faustian bargain with Eoin O'Duffy's party as the only hope for the Ireland's future if the NDP stubbornly refuses to cooperate."

 ireland.34.t: "Sealing the Deal"
 ireland.34.d1: "Though it took several lengthy days of arduous debate and negotiation, eventually Éamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and various senior figures from both parties, managed to work out an arrangement. The National Development Party would agree to form a coalition government with An Saorstát Críostúil and to support the reformation of the Ulster Privileges under two conditions; Irish economic revitalisation must be prioritised, and any proposed alterations to the privileges or measures to distance the Irish Republic from Mitteleuropa would not be implemented without consulting and gaining the approval of the NDP prior.\n\nDe Valera, a conservative and politically savvy man by nature, knew as well as the NDP that, despite whatever he might imply during an election campaign, simply abolishing the Ulster Privileges or leaving Mitteleuropa the next day would wreak havoc in the country, and that a cautious approach to these delicate and tricky issues was necessary to ensure financial and political stability. As such, he readily agreed to these terms.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. The Church and faithful voters are pleased to see the secular-leaning Sinn Féin kicked out, in favour of a party based on Christian principles. Big farmers and some businessmen hope that the NDP will rein SC's anti-Mitteleuropa tendencies in, although other less-established entrepreneurs perceive opportunities in a potential decrease in foreign competition on the Irish market. In Ulster, Catholics have greeted the results with optimism and Protestants with concern, but both remember Brugha's failure to change the state of affairs in the north, to the anxiety of the former and the reassurance of the latter."
 ireland.34.d2: "With the National Development Party refusing to budge on the Ulster Privileges, Éamon de Valera became reluctantly convinced of the necessity to form a coalition with Aontas Náisiúnta. Eoin O'Duffy, keen to legitimise his party in the mainstream and regain his position as a major figure in the running of the country, eagerly opened negotiations, though neither men particularly trusted the other. In exchange for AN's support, de Valera agreed that a commission on corporatist economic policies would be established and an uncompromising line on Ulster taken, aiming for the ultimate abolition of the privileges.\n\nAlthough both believed membership of Mitteleuropa to have negative ramifications for Irish sovereignty, the two leaders concluded that a slow and steady approach was necessary to loosen ties with the bloc without worsening the financial crisis.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. Hardline nationalists and anti-syndicalists are delighted by the result, hoping that SC and AN will restore order and stability to the nation, as are the Church and faithful voters at seeing a government based on Christian principles, after years of Sinn Féin's quasi-secularism. In Ulster, a visible sense of hope is felt on the streets and in the homes of Catholic areas, concerns about Brugha's previous failure to change the Ulster Privileges dampened by the expectation that AN should ensure \"Dev\" keeps his word. The mood among Protestants is quite the contrary, their seething discontent with Dublin only intensening, to the deep concern of local Gardaí who have already begun to pick up rumours in the wind of radical loyalists beginning to stockpile weapons."

Despite this, initially the danger appeared to have passed. Cabinet positions were agreed by the two parties, and it seemed as if An Saorstát Críostúil were back in government once again after half a decade in opposition.\nThis false sense of security was not to last. It was little more than a matter of days until de Valera's worst fears were realised, as news of the conditions on which the SC-NDP coalition was settled were leaked to the press by an anonymous senior SC figure, outraged by the concession.\n\nThe reaction from all sections of the Irish public to the scandal has been nothing short of complete pandemonium. Aontas Náisiúnta's already rising star has skyrocketed, as many turn to radical solutions in the fate of yet another democratic Irish government proving itself incapable of, or unwilling to, resolve the long-running sore of the Ulster Privileges.\nSC's own backbenchers, local TDs and party branches have bombarded their leadership with furious letters and queries. Even worse, this sentiment has spread like wildfire not only among the Gardaí and the army, but also within the Catholic Church, previously SC's key allies in winning popular favour, as priests and bishops across the country have denounced the new administration for again abandoning the faithful of Ulster.\n\nIt is clear to all that Éamon de Valera has signed his political death warrant, and that only one question remains to be answered."

It was only a matter of who would deal the coup d'grace. The revolt began, as so often in Irish history, in Ulster, as Blueshirts under the direction of Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin rallied in Catholic areas throughout the province. Ó Cuinneagáin, in a speech attracting tens of thousands, declared his intention to march on Dublin to demand the sitting government's resignation, in favour of a cabinet comprised of \"true Gaels\", though he claimed his rally was only a peaceful one, a statement which decieved few.\n\nThe next day, all over Ireland, Blueshirts inspired by his words marched on local municipal buildings, before heading to the capital on foot or by train. Despite the government's ban, their desperate pleas to the Gardaí and the army went unanswered, both disgruntled forces tacitly assisting the insurrectionists via inaction. As marchers following Ó Cuinneagáin arrived in Dublin, Eoin O'Duffy himself joined them, attempting to regain control over his movement after being taken unawares by the former's bold move.\n\nThe men clad in azure uniforms and black armbands embroidered with the Easter Lily, the funeral wreath of Irish democracy, appropriately the flower of death and resurrection, were met with a variety of reactions from the citizens of Dublin, ranging from the cheers of supporters to fearful glances and futile attempts to stop them by opponents.\n\nDe Valera had been holding an emergency meeting when the National Guard finally burst into the room. He was accused of failing the Irish people by allowing the loyalists to dictate the course of the nation, and was told to resign to allow a new administration to stabilise Ireland, a more lenient punishment for his disgraceful conduct promised should he comply. Faced with little choice, de Valera signed the piece of paper, aware it was only formalising something already in progress. Within the hour O'Duffy would be sitting in his chair, giving out orders to begin securing the city and preparing for any potential backlash."

 ireland.37.d: "William O'Brien, despite being thought of by most as the underdog of the presidential election, has emerged victorious. Labour and their rural ally Clann na Talmhan additionally achieved record results in the parliamentary elections as Irish voters turned to the change offered by the two parties after a year of economic crisis. Unfortunately, in spite of this impressive advance, their current total of seats in the Dáil remains insufficient to form a majority government, and achieving this will require a coalition with either the National Development Party or the Progressive Labour Party.\n\nThis fork in the road has left Labour's leadership at loggerheads. The PLP was formed to provide a radical alternative to the Labour Party after O'Brien expelled its leader, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, and as a result extensive bad blood exists between the parties. The Labour leader, alongside pragmatic elements of Labour such as Thomas J. O'Connell and James Everett, favour a coalition with the NDP, feeling that Lemass's endorsement will defang the frequent red-baiting flung at Labour by opponents, and that the PLP cannot be trusted not to promote an unacceptably extreme agenda.\n\nOther prominent Labour figures, including William Norton and Richard Corish, have advocated burying the hatchet with Sheehy-Skeffington. Norton has privately met with O'Brien, attempting to persuade him that allegations of the PLP being a syndicalist trojan horse are simply fearmongering, and that an alliance with the party is the only chance Labour shall get to show the Irish people they can deliver real reform, as the NDP would most likely compel Labour to water down even moderate, middle-of-the-road programmes in exchange for their backing. Michael Donnellan, leader of Clann na Talmhan, has also sought to sway O'Brien, fearing that the NDP would overshadow CnaT in a coalition due to their greater influence and support base among big farmers."

As such, establishing a compromise on this matter will prove vital to the success of the coalition talks. With the support of party leader Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, young up-and-coming PLP TD and medical student, Noël Browne, has proposed a scheme that would introduce free ante- and postnatal care for mothers, and free treatment for children up to the age of sixteen, inspired by the proposals of socially democratic parties in continental Europe, particularly Scandinavia.\n\nHowever, O'Brien and other Labour figures fear Browne's plan is too radical, and risks not only the condemnation of Irish doctors opposed to losing out on profits, and the Church hierarchy against family care not in accordance with Catholic teachings, but also undermining the government by playing into fears, stronger than ever only months after the LÉ Macha Incident, that the PLP is a crypto-syndicalist party. Instead, they have mooted a large scale construction drive to build new hospitals and renovate old ones which have fallen into disrepair, though convincing Sheehy-Skeffington and the headstrong Browne of this may take fierce arguing."

It was agreed that Seán Lemass would be granted the post of Príomh Aire, or Prime Minister, in the coalition government, and although Michael Donnellan grumbled at this development and the prospect of concessions being made to Ireland's ranchers, moderate elements of his party were satisfied, though keeping both parties satisfied may prove a tricky task for O'Brien.\n\nIreland's lower classes are jubilant at the change of leadership, having borne the harshest consequences of Black Monday, and hopeful that the new government will prioritise the needs of the Irish people over numbers on a graph. Businessmen and big farmers worry about the possible economic and social repercussions of Labour and CnaT heading up the nation, but are somewhat reassured that the presence of the NDP in the cabinet should keep any radicals in check\n\nThe response among Catholics in Ulster has been generally positive in light of O'Brien's electoral pledges to address discrimination against Catholics, though many remain sceptical of his leftist politics and find his beliefs that Catholics and Protestants should overcome their differences through uniting as workers naive and out of touch. Upper and middle-class Protestants are concerned the result could lead to an upsurge in union activity but consider a Labour administration the lesser of two evils, breathing a sigh of relief that it isn't An Saorstát Críostúil, or worse, Aontas Náisiúnta, at the helm instead."

Thus, they concluded the construction of new hospitals and improvement of existing ones would still benefit the Irish people and lay down the framework for more fundamental changes in the future.\n\nThe announcement of the coalition has divided the country. Ireland's lower classes are jubilant at the change of leadership, having borne the harshest consequences of Black Monday, as are progressive feminists, intellectuals and students, seeing in the election's outcome the dawn of the forward-thinking nation they hoped freedom would bring about.\n\nOn the other hand, businessmen, big farmers, conservatives and the Catholic Church are all united by a sense of deep concern regarding the economic and social repercussions of the left-wing's meteoric rise, ensuring Labour will have a difficult time balancing the needs of their partners, the PLP already begrudging CnaT leader Michael Donnellan's nomination as Príomh Aire, or Prime Minister, due to his antisemitism, while not alarming the right.\n\nThe response among Catholics in Ulster has been generally positive in light of O'Brien's electoral pledges to address discrimination against Catholics, though many remain sceptical of his leftist politics and find his beliefs that Catholics and Protestants should overcome their differences through uniting as workers naive and out of touch.

The Irish Medical Association, unaware of the secret talks taking place between the president and Primate of All-Ireland Joseph MacRory, mistakenly presumed that O'Brien and his cabinet were intent on introducing the scheme despite their protests, and protested publicly against it. Alarmed by the association's complaints, MacRory arrived at the conclusion that the negotiations were merely a stalling tactic, and that the government had no real intention of listening to him.\n\nTaking to the press and to the pulpits, the Church hierarchy strongly denounced the Mother-and-Child scheme and the Labour administration, branding them, as they had previously feared, syndicalist agents in the pay of the Union of Britain. Though some sympathised with the government's aims, those voices swiftly hushed themselves from a fear of social reprisal, in the face of another rapidly building red scare.

Regardless of the predictions of political pundits, Mulcahy is now President, though his inauguration has intensified an already particularly unusual situation.\n\nOne of the quirks of Ireland's recent revolutionary period was the election of many military men to political office, before, during and shortly after the War of Independence, with most holding both roles simultaneously as a matter of course.

Similar questions had been mooted during his time as the Príomh Aire in the last government, where he had been very much following the President's lead.\n\nBut now in his boss's old seat, he will need to decide if it will be worth trying to juggle both responsibilities, whatever the backlash."    # Mulcahy

Not least of its outcomes are its consequences on the Irish Republican Army.\n\nThe army has come into a period of deep disarray, considering that the state whose establishment and preservation it was created for, has now been taken over by those that were aided by the very enemy that the army had been preparing to come into conflict with.\n\nThe extant purpose of the army, and of the positions of its leadership, has brought much turmoil to the past few days. Some officers have stated their loyalty to any form of Irish Republic or any independent Irish state, whereas others refuse to see a syndicalist state as any form of a \"true\" Republic, or even democratic in any form.\n\nThese views have had no choice but to come to the fore, as the new government is eager to sweep away all unwanted reactionary elements within the army's upper echelons, and retain those that are willing to still serve. Former Irish Citizen Army commanders have already adopted the IRA's uniform as their own and integrated themselves into its command, and the new socialist government is clear in its view that the army will remain in its purpose, to protect Ireland from those that wish to destroy her."   # SF/Dem/EOD to Syndie

 ireland.42.d12: "The overthrowing of O'Duffy's dictatorship by the most radical and reactionary tendency from within his party, has had a dire effect on the leadership of the Irish Republican Army. The Aontas Náisiúnta regime had solidified its support by closely allying with the army, working with them to achieve their mutual aims, and making moves towards the gradual intertwining of the Blueshirt movement with the army itself. The violent removal of O'Duffy from power has shattered this dynamic, throwing the army into disarray and questioning its very existence.\n\nWell aware of Ó Cuinneagáin's desire for the restoration of a Gaelic monarchy, some officers have stated their loyalty to any form of independent Irish state, whereas others refuse to see anything but a Republic as being representative of the will of the Irish people. It was for a Republic that the men of 1916 gave up their lives, after all.\n\nSuch words would be among their last, as a swift and merciless purge was performed on officers deemed to have shown themselves to be likely disloyal to the new Ireland. Such members of the old army command were taken from their homes and shot in front of their families, imprisoned, or were simply \"disappeared\".\n\nOnce order and authority in the army command was restored, those remaining were willing to serve Ireland regardless of her leadership, and in whatever form she took, or at least were wise enough to say that they would.\n\nJoining the upper echelons of the army were a select few confidants with military experience that had already been close to Ó Cuinneagáin, and shared his radical views. They quickly began to integrate themselves into the army's command structure, and have readily kept a close watch on the loyalty of their fellow officers to the new regime."  # EOD to NatPop

 ireland.1000.t.IRE: "The LÉ Macha Incident"
 ireland.1000.t.other: "Confrontation in the Irish Sea"
 ireland.1000.d.IRE: "Though Black Monday brought much turmoil, it was cautiously hoped by the government that the crisis would remain the only major issue on their plate as the country recovered. Yet fate is rarely so kind. Yesterday at approximately 1127 hours, the Irish naval vessel LÉ Macha experienced a sudden collision from underneath, fifty-eight miles off the coast of Waterford. As it turned out, she happened to collide with the RNS Thetis, belonging to the Union of Britain and situated outside of British territorial waters. Submerged in the sea, the submarine went unseen as the LÉ Macha sailed over it until, owing to the poor decision-making of the captain, the submarine surfaced, ramming the Macha.\n\nFortunately neither incurred serious damage, both vessels along with their crew being saved by a joint rescue effort organised by the Irish Naval Service and the British Navy. This bold cooperation has been heralded as the beginning of a possible warming in Anglo-Irish relations by advocates of a détente, albeit such sentiments stay firmly in the minority as the public and government alike anxiously question the purpose for which a British submarine trespassed in Irish territorial waters in the first place, hysteric tales of nefarious syndicalist plots already being churned out by the rumour mill.\n\nThese significant concerns are shared by the German Empire, who have strongly condemned the incident, the Reichskanzler making a speech in the Reichstag today denouncing syndicalist aggression, and the German minister to Dublin has promised us of the empire's continued backing should the Union of Britain attempt to expand their influence. However senior diplomats, although grateful for German support, have counselled caution, warning of the risk of sleepwalking into German vassaldom. In their view Irish national interests lie in steering a middle course between the two powers, reaping the benefits of friendship with both while ensuring that what's best for Ireland is not subordinated to the needs of the great powers."
 ireland.1000.d.GER: "Yesterday at approximately 1127 hours, a naval ship of the Irish Republic, named the LÉ Macha, was suddenly rammed by the British submarine RNS Thetis, fifty-eight miles off the coast of the Irish coastal city of Waterford, well within Irish territorial waters. Although rescue efforts ensured both boats were saved and no lives lost, British diplomats have proven to be exceptionally cagey as to the purpose of the vessel's trespassing.\n\nThe German Empire and the Irish Republic have enjoyed a strong friendship since the Weltkrieg, as Germany was among the first to recognise Irish independence and played a significant role in arming the Irish rebels against their British overlords, and while they remained associated with the British Empire after the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the British Revolution saw the establishment of substantial trade with the island country and their eventual entry into Mitteleuropa. In the eyes of our business community and intelligence services, this seemingly minor incident is merely the beginning of a British assault on Teutonic influence on the isle."

Maintaining his moderate image but seeking to deter Britain and deepen ties with the Irish in light of the island's strategic relevance, Schleicher advised Nadolny to respond diplomatically but firmly. Accordingly, the foreign secretary condemned the British navy's intrusion into Irish waters, and gave assurances that Germany would continue to stand by its friends and interests in Dublin with force if need be, while Schleicher himself made a speech on the matter denouncing London's actions."

While heeding Reichskanzler Müller's advice to stick to a cautious approach, with the cabinet unable to afford a diplomatic crisis over this episode while already dealing with the present turmoil at home, Nadolny accordingly condemned the British navy's intrusion into Irish waters, and gave assurances that Germany would continue to stand by its friends and interests in Dublin, aiming to deter Britain from further actions against the Irish while the German nation gets back on its feet."
 ireland.1000.d.GER.pataut: "$ireland.1000.d.GER$\n\nThe episode has provoked discord inside the new cabinet as the hesitancy of Kleist, a man long less keen on Weltpolitik, to stoke foreign tensions while Germany faces turmoil at home has clashed with Hassell's support for the Irish in light of not only his anti-syndicalist and Anglophobic views, but also his naval connections, aware of the island's strategic use to Germany. After discussions between the two, it was agreed that Hassell would issue a strongly-worded condemnation of the incident and assure that the "German sword and shield" would stand behind the Irish against syndicalist aggression, so as to deter the British from further transgressions, but that for now the German response would remain diplomatic."
 ireland.1000.d.ENG: "The renowned Irish socialist James Connolly once remarked \"We believe in constitutional action in normal times; we believe in revolutionary action in exceptional times\". In no nation is this more true than within Connolly's own home, the man having possessed the questionable fortune of not having lived to witness so many of his companions in arms seduced by the siren songs of bourgeois nationalism and German imperialist patronage, where the ramifications of Black Monday have resulted in the scales of capitalism increasingly falling from the eyes of the Irish proletariat.\n\nThe Revolutionary Exportation Directory has worked closely with our Irish comrades in Saor Éire for a decade to overthrow the Irish Government, though their endeavours thus far amounted to little in light of Irish society's conservative and Anglophobic attitudes. Seeing a fighting chance to spread socialist ideals and foment a potential worker's revolt in the crisis, Saor Éire have requested more assistance. Accordingly, we sent three agents to assess the situation on the ground and rendezvous with SÉ's paramilitary wing, the Irish Citizen Army, coming ashore in Castletownshend, County Cork from the submarine RNS Thetis. Unfortunately during the process of their return voyage, our vessel accidentally rammed an Irish naval ship, the LÉ Macha, at around 1127 hours.\n\nWhile we can breathe a sigh of relief that the incident occurred after the insertion of our operatives, narrowly dodging a further breakdown in diplomacy with the Irish Republic, the collision took place in Irish territorial waters, raising great suspicion and drawing the alarm of the German Empire. These unfortunate events do contain a silver lining however, as successful joint rescue efforts by the British and Irish navies prevented any casualties or the loss of either vessels, earning the cautious praise of some liberal Irish newspapers and opening up a possible pathway to a rekindling of Anglo-Irish relations now that Black Monday has proven the Teutonic giant to have feet made of clay."

Reorganised into the Irish Republican Army following the Rising's failure, the IRA fought once more against Britain during the War of Independence, winning Irish freedom after seven hundred years with invaluable German assistance. As a result of this cooperation and many among their ranks being sent to Germany to learn from the force that had won the Weltkrieg in the decade afterwards, the IRA has become a bastion of Germanophilic sentiments.\n\nSuspicious of politicians and displeased with the concessions granted to loyalists, the IRA has resisted attempts by civilian administrations to assert authority over the army, with the soldiery often united more by a feeling of allegiance to their commanders and the abstract idea of the Irish nation than to the state. While they have remained loyal so far, this loyalty is a strictly conditional one, and in this time of crisis any government must tread lightly, lest the officers who regard themselves as the country's true masters feel forced to step in \"for the good of the Irish Republic\""

These claims have grown recently, as rumours of disproportionate numbers of Catholics being laid-off during the crisis have circulated for months. Dismissed as lies and persecution fantasies by loyalists, a booklet named \"The Orange Terror\" by an unknown author writing under the pseudonym \"Ultach\" has exposed in detail not only inequity in the workplace, but also how the clauses of the Ulster Privileges according increased powers to the local councils of the six county area, and forbidding the alteration of electoral boundaries, have instead resulted in frequent occurrences of pro-Protestant favouritism, particularly in housing.\n\nThough these clauses were intended to prevent the Irish State from discriminating against Protestants and gerrymandering in favour of Catholics, they failed to account for the fact that said boundaries had been manipulated to under-represent Catholics by the former Northern Irish Government over the course of 1923 and 1924. The booklet's notoriety has spread rapidly and sales are soaring, even outside of Ulster, assisting the rhetoric of the opposition in excoriating Sinn Féin for turning a blind eye to the \"maltreatment\" of loyal Irishmen and Irishwomen in the name of short term political gain."

Harry Midgley's NILP, though officially non-sectarian, have become a party primarily of the Protestant working class, and there exist whispers of support for the union of Northern Ireland with the Union of Britain, with rhetoric playing on resentment that the upper class in 1926 \"chose money over Ulster\". The UPL, led by former UUP politician James Hanna McCormick, is stridently anti-Catholic and also regard the UDP as traitors, calling for a policy of abstentionism toward Dáil Éireann. With these changes, the UDP's position as the big-tent representative of the Protestant community is no longer as certain as it once was."

For too long have they been the bastard children of the Republic, disregarded by their fellow countrymen and expected to be a sacrificial lamb offered up on the altar of appeasing loyalists, they proclaim, and at last many Catholics have decided that enough is enough.\n\n[IRE_loc_civil_rights_event_1]\n\nTaking matters into their own hands, prominent Ulster Catholics, in addition to some sympathetic Protestants and southerners, from all walks of life, including politicians across the political spectrum, came together in Belfast to announce the formation of a new organisation, the National League for Civil Liberties, or NLCL, under the chairmanship of Cahir Healy, an independent TD and one of the most prominent Ulster Catholic leaders since the War of Independence.\n\nAs Healy has informed interviewing reporters attending the conference, the NLCL profess to be a cross-party and cross-community group which seek to apply pressure on Dublin to finally address the rampant anti-Catholic discrimination in the north, particularly in the areas of employment and housing. The government, in turn, has yet to respond to these developments, and although the desire for action is now ripe, it remains to be seen how effective this nascent movement will ultimately prove itself to be."
 ireland.1004.d.sf: "The continuation of the pact between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Democratic Party after several elections is viewed with much resentment by the Catholic community, and their willingness to patiently tolerate their condition until another party should come to power and potentially resolve the situation is at an end."
 ireland.1004.d.scndp: "Though de Valera promised during his electoral campaign to reform the Ulster Privileges, his words are viewed with distrust by much of the Catholic community in light of his major role in Brugha's administration, and his party's choice of coalition partners, the NDP, are trusted even less."
 ireland.1004.d.scan: "Though the role of Aontas Náisiúnta as junior partner in the new ruling coalition has been the source of optimism for plenty in the Catholic community, there exists also a strong sense of having been let down before, and in particular by the current President, [Root.GetLeader], given his previous part in Brugha's administration."
 ireland.1004.d.lab: "Though the ascendance to power of a new governemnt has proved encouraging to the Catholic community, plenty remain sceptical of what they see as a naive and equivocal approach on the part of Labour to the situation in Ulster, and have felt the bitter sensation of having been let down before."
 ireland.1004.a: "Who will look out for us, but us?"

 ireland.1005.t: "Rallying to the Call"
 ireland.1005.d: "Confounding the expectations of those who expected the National League for Civil Liberties' foundation to come to nothing, it soon became apparent that the organisation enjoyed a frenzy of popularity from the disgruntled Catholics of Ulster, as plenty were quick to flock to the movement's banner. Though an initial march in Ulster against anti-Catholic discrimination within the province by the NLCL was a peaceful affair, with Gardaí maintaining order by preventing the marchers from marching into loyalist areas or loyalists from attacking the protest, its low-key nature meant it attracted little attention from the press or politicians, defeating the protest's main aim.\n\nDialing up their tactics as a result, the NLCL recently organised a large parade and leafletting drive in Dublin under the banner \"Irish Rights for Irish Citizens\", gaining approval from locals, even those who were otherwise in support of political parties supportive of the Ulster Privileges, and achieving its goals in bringing the question of Catholic rights to the eyes of the newspapers and Dáil Éireann.\n\nUlster loyalist TDs have hit back at the protestors' allegations, decrying the NLCL as a \"Blueshirt stalking horse\". James Hanna McCormick, seizing the opportunity to present his Ulster Protestant League as a radical alternative to the UDP, declared the marches an existential threat whose ultimate purpose was the imposition of \"Portuguese despotism\" upon the people of Ulster, and encouraged loyalist counter-protests.\n\n[IRE_loc_civil_rights_event_2]"
 ireland.1005.d.sf: "The protests have become the source of many furrowed brows for Sinn Féin, who find themselves under attack from not only the opposition, but also from supporters who agree with SF's economic policies, or perceive them as the natural party of government owing to their history, but additionally hold sympathy for the northern Catholics' grievances. Once free to sweep the issue under the carpet to preserve their alliance with the UDP, it seems the party will now be forced to respond."
 ireland.1005.d.scndp: "The protests have proven troublesome for Éamon de Valera and his party's coalition with the National Development Party, having promised the latter that any measures related to Ulster would be addressed only after Ireland's economic issues had been resolved. With pressure mounting from voters and backbenchers inside his party, de Valera may find himself forced to make a choice whether to alienate his followers or his coalition partner."
 ireland.1005.d.scan: "The protests have led to cracks forming in the coalition between de Valera's SC and O'Duffy's AN, as the latter have heaped praise on the protests, intending to take credit for reform to the Ulster Privileges, while at the same time putting pressure on de Valera to deliver. Worse for the Long Fellow, the protests have resonated with his party's backbenchers, and they too have called for immediate changes. Though de Valera is a man of cautious instincts, he has found himself with his back to the wall on the matter."
 ireland.1005.d.lab: "While the Labour Party have been swift to promise to resolve the employment and housing situation in response to the protests, behind closed doors the issue has them at odds with one of their coalition partners,"
 ireland.1005.d.labndp: "$ireland.1005.d.lab$ the National Development Party, as leader Sean Lemass is aloof to the plight of Ulster's Catholics, and opposed to anything that could endanger the nation's stability and financial prospects due to loyalist outrage. Although Labour sees reform as the key to ending sectarian tensions, they will have a difficult time convincing the NDP to agree."
 ireland.1005.d.labplp: "$ireland.1005.d.lab$ the Progressive Labour Party. The issue has divided the latter party, as while some support the protestors, seeing the end of discrimination as a step to stopping religious division of the working class, others are reluctant to speak on a matter which they regard as sectarian, and what form reforms will take may be a matter of much debate inside the coalition."

 ireland.1006.t: "Casement's Body"
 ireland.1006.d: "There was surpise and consternation at this week's cabinet meeting, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs notified the government of a most unusal offer from the Union of Britain; that they return to us the corpse of Sir Roger Casement, the Anglo-Irish anti-imperialist campaigner and hero of the independence era. Against his own wishes, Casement was buried in an English prison following his execution in 1916 for treason, after he ran guns from Germany to Ireland for the Easter Rising.\n\nAn immediate and rowdy debate ensued amongst the cabinet about whether this is some kind of ploy by the British, or a genuine attempt at soothing relations. The British, for their part, have presented this as an olive branch that will coincide with the 21st anniversary of the Easter Rising.\n\nWhile the opportunity to give Casement a proper burial is extremely appealing, some members of the cabinet have noted this deal would require at least some kind of glad-handing of the Union of Britain, if not an outright public acknowledgement of them as a \"fellow Republic\".\n\nIt would be difficult for the government to publically sing the Union of Britain's praises in return for Casement, but on the other hand, refusing the offer might be tantamount to political suicide, as the opposition and public would never claim to understand it."

 ireland.1007.t: "The Rules of the Road"
 ireland.1007.d: "As antagonism heats up between the Reichspakt and the syndicalist powers, Ireland has found itself on the front line in the battle for influence among the two great naval forces of Europe. With the sleepy status quo of previous years broken, the desire to update certain facets of Irish life to mainland standards has begun to be embraced by cosmopolitans and nationalists alike, the former seeking to tie Ireland closer to its European partners, and the latter favouring the abolition of archaic leftovers inherited from the legacy of British rule.\n\nReflecting the growing popularity of such modernising proposals, it has been suggested that Ireland should transition from the old British system of left-hand traffic to the continental system of right-hand traffic, bringing the nation's road rules into line with the other nations of Europe and the Americas.\n\nSupporters have emphasised the long-term benefits such a switch may have on foreign tourism and on importing and exporting vehicles internationally, though opponents have fired back, decrying the proposal as likely to lead to havoc on Irish roads and a frivolous waste of valuable time and resources better spent tackling the remaining effects of Black Monday."

 ireland.1007.b: "What a pointless waste of time, dismiss\nthis idea."

 ireland.1008.t: "Setting the Clocks Forward"
 ireland.1008.d: "With a continued demand among sections of the public to re-examine practices passed down from Ireland's history of British governance, the previous motion to alter the state's road rules to be in accordance with the bulk of the continent's traffic systems appears not the last suggested reform, as a considerably more radical proposal has taken shape. It has been advocated by this strange reformist coalition of cosmopolitans and anti-syndicalists that the nation's clocks should be moved ahead an hour to match Germany's Central European Time.\n\nSynchronising the Irish Republic's time zone with central Europe would, the reformers argue, lessen syndicalist influence and prove beneficial with regards to commerce with its Mitteleuropan partners, comprising the destination of the majority of Irish exports since the fall of the British Empire, aiding the country in resuming its vital export trade and mending the damage caused by the preceding year's financial crisis.\n\nDetractors, on the other hand, have derided the idea as an act of utter madness, warning of its effects on sunrise and sunset times, and of the detrimental consequences it may have on Ireland's economic sovereignty by tying Irish national fortunes further to those of Germany despite Black Monday having, in their view, dramatically unveiled the flaws of such a strategy."

 ireland.1009.t1: "A Hot July"
 ireland.1009.t2: "Putting the Foot Down"
 ireland.1009.d.start: "On the 12th of July in the year 1690, the Catholic King James II of England was defeated by William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne. For Irish Catholics, James' defeat brought about their subjugation under the harsh Penal Laws, but for Ulster Protestants, the victorious William was a saviour who had delivered them from the spectre of Catholic domination, and solidified their legitimacy to settle in Ireland, having arrived from Britain only a few decades prior.\n\nThe date became a key loyalist commemoration, celebrated with marches by the fraternal Orange Order and with bonfires the night before."
 ireland.1009.d1: "$ireland.1009.d.start$ Although the majority of loyalists had grudgingly accepted joining the hated Irish Republic as an alternative to syndicalism, the burning of Irish, British and German flags atop these bonfires took off during the interwar period, as an avenue to express passive resistance.\n\nThough the month was always a nervous affair due to the ever-present ethno-religious hostilities, the rise of AN, the NLCL and the UPL made the build up to this year's twelfth particularly tense, as June and early July were marked by an increase in reports of sectarian violence perpetrated by Blueshirts and UPL supporters. These mounting tensions exploded on the Twelfth itself, as a confrontation broke out while an Orange Order march passed through a Catholic area, escalating into a riot. Gardaí were ineffective at quelling the rioting, with allegations spreading of local Gardaí siding with rioters from their own communities, and by the end of the day several people were dead and many homes destroyed.\n\n"
 ireland.1009.d1.otherdem: "Worse yet, as news spread from Ulster, a series of incidents were reported of angered Blueshirts attacking and intimidating southern Protestants in retaliation, but Gardaí were quickly mobilised to restore order, and those threatened also received aid from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, opposing sectarianism and never missing a chance to brawl with their \"integralist\" enemies. With all eyes now focused north, the government has found itself in an even more tricky position as public pressure for reform has become all the more intense."
 ireland.1009.d1.scan: "As news spread from Ulster, incidents were reported of angered Blueshirts attacking and threatening southern Protestants in retaliation. While the Príomh Aire's influence ensured that the Gardaí attempted to sweep such crimes under the rug, the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, denouncing sectarianism, stepped in to protect the threatened Protestants where the government failed, their clashes with their azure-shirted foes drawing public attention to the attacks and criticism of O'Duffy's continued ties to the supposedly disbanded National Guard."
 ireland.1009.d2: "$ireland.1009.d.start$ While the build up to the Twelfth had always been a tense affair, it was particularly true for this year, as the Blueshirt coup was greeted with much alarm by Ulster loyalists. These tensions erupted in Belfast today as not only did loyalists set off multiple bombs, but several parades devolved into riots as they were blocked by Blueshirts upon attempting to march through Catholic areas. Though the riots were put down with an iron fist, the brutality used only served to alienate Ulster Protestants against the government.\n\nDue to this growing resistance not only from loyalists but also in the south, from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army and pro-democratic elements, O'Duffy and Ó Cuinneagáin have met with the cabinet to discuss how to approach the situation. From the former general's perspective, the issue is domestic, the result of a lack of discipline among the Irish people and demanding the expansion of the Gardai to maintain order, with Protestants to be kept under close watch given their believed inherent disloyalty.\n\nFor Ó Cuinneagáin, the source of the regime's troubles lies abroad with the sinister force of \"Anglo-Syndicalism\" plotting to subvert the Irish nation, and to combat the Red threat a secret police must be established and granted extensive powers to root out via any means, including torture, those traitors willing to take the Saxon shilling. However, such an organisation would be quickly staffed with Blueshirts seeking a more legitimate form of career than their National Guard membership, expanding the integralists' internal influence."

 ireland.1010.t: "By Another Metric"
 ireland.1010.d: "As the breaking of the post-independence era's lull continues to spur on a desire for change, an additional motion has been proposed with the objective of bringing Ireland more in line with the continent, this time around involving units of measurement. As another consequence of having been formerly under the rule of the British Empire, the Irish Republic currently uses British imperial units for its system of measurement. In contrast, many nations in continental Europe, most notably Germany, use the metric system. Though calls for metrication have existed since Ireland achieved its freedom, support for reform in this area has begun to gather further steam, in keeping with other recent initiatives to follow European trends.\n\nIn the eyes of cosmopolitans, this would serve to further modernise the nation, and from a nationalist viewpoint it would represent a further rejection of British influence. However, opponents of this latest proposition have pointed to the deep roots imperial measurements have within the minds of the Irish people, being extensively used in everyday activities for much of the public such as pubs, horse racing and on roads among other things, and the difficulty of updating the country to the metric system, a process which could take numerous years. In the feelings of the proposal's opposition, the imperial system, although contrasting the mainland, isn't broken and therefore is in no need of fixing."

 ireland.1011.t: "Radio Free Scotland"
 ireland.1011.d: "One of the largest technological developments of note in recent years has been the growth of radio. Although radio broadcasts have existed in Ireland since the mid-1920s, the initial range of the channels were limited and required relay stations to carry their signal from Dublin to Cork. However, the technology has developed rapidly, and new, more powerful transmitters have emerged that can carry a signal over vast distances.\n\nSpurred on by the success of long-range radio stations in the low countries, a group of exiled Scottish activists in Belfast have been raising funds for their own station: \"Radio Free Scotland\". Planning to purchase a transmitter with a range of roughly over one hundred and fifty miles, the station would be able to reach both Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as Liverpool in England. The group's stated aim is simple: To provide an alternative source of news and Scottish culture from the tightly controlled media in the Union of Britain.\n\nAlthough British radio already \"leaks\" into Ireland, this new station which is plainly planning to be subversive, may well be seen as a provocation by the British."
 ireland.1011.a: "It's free enterprise in a free country."

 ireland.1012.d: "It has come to the government's attention that radio receivers in Scotland, the north-west of England and the Isle of Man are picking up a signal from Belfast broadcasting as \"Radio Free Scotland\". While the station's musical content is of little concern, being mostly traditional Scottish songs, its selection of news and political discussion is decidedly biased against the British government.\n\nSeemingly being manned by Scottish nationalists who've departed to Ireland, much of their content is thinly-veiled, anti-socialist propaganda.  Whether the Irish Government has tacitly supported this venture, or simply turned a blind eye, is unknown, but nevertheless, the fact remains this station is operating right under their noses."

We can see plainly now what the attitude in Dublin is to the British."

 ireland.1016.t: "A Downward Spiral"
 ireland.1016.d.start: "Several months after the beginning of the protests, the situation in Ulster has only deteriorated further. The collapse in trust of the Gardaí among members of both communities, due to their ineffectiveness in quelling the July riots, has resulted in paramilitaries being increasingly relied on by locals to be community defenders, with supporters of the UPL announcing the reformation of the Ulster Volunteer Force, and marches by the NLCL seeing a growing Blueshirt presence.\n\nThe latter has led to internal conflicts within the NLCL, as chairman Cahir Healy's desire for peaceful protest has come into conflict with Blueshirt hardliner Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin's attempts to stir Catholic anger into confrontation with loyalists. Efforts were also made by the ICA to infiltrate the NLCL, but these have produced limited results owing to the organisation's wariness of syndicalist infiltration, well aware that being tarred with the red brush would be fatal for their movement."
 ireland.1016.d.sfcollins: "$ireland.1016.d.start$\n\nIn spite of his previous harshness on radicalism, Michael Collins has found himself unable to deal with the resurgence of paramilitarism, with an attempt to crack down on the Blueshirts and UVF being unenforceable for the overstretched northern Gardaí and only inflaming tempers in the province more. With the Catholic Church and many Sinn Féiners additionally sympathising with the Catholics' plight, Collins, realising the unsustainable nature of the current state of affairs, has attempted to persuade the UDP to accede to concessions, warning that should Sinn Féin lose the next election any new administration's reforms would likely be much more far-reaching and uncompromising.\n\nHowever, his endeavours so far have been met only with hostility from UDP leader Basil Brooke who, in addition to wishing to preserve Protestant power from Catholic encroachment, fears that any loyalist perception of weakness from the UDP would result in an additional loss of seats and influence to other loyalist parties."
 ireland.1016.d.sfmulcahy: "$ireland.1016.d.start$\n\nDespite increasing pressure from the Catholic Church and from many Sinn Féiners sympathetic to the Catholics' plight, Richard Mulcahy has continued to stand by the Ulster Privileges and his party's allies in the Ulster Democratic Party, contending that Sinn Féin had concluded an agreement with loyalists when all of Ulster was incorporated in the Irish Republic, and that to attempt to violate the terms of said deal would be a breach of faith.\n\nMulcahy, while claiming to wish to address the moderate concerns of protestors inside the framework of the Ulster Privileges, has blamed Blueshirt penetration of the NLCL for the recent rise in tensions in Ulster, and sought to try to crack down on their activities and corral protests. These initiatives, however have only served to whip up even more fury in the province, as Catholic Gardaí have proved lenient, while sending in Protestant Gardaí to police marches and prevent Blueshirt activity has provoked outbreaks of violence from enraged Catholics."
 ireland.1016.d.scndp: "$ireland.1016.d.start$\n\nAs it became more apparent that the protest marches were set to continue and stood in the way of economic recovery, the National Development Party's opposition to immediate negotiation on the issue of Ulster had begun to waver. Putting additional strain on the government, the Catholic hierarchy too has expressed its support for the protestors' demands. With pressure mounting but the NDP remaining committed to not provoking loyalist outrage, the coalition proposed a conference with the NLCL, the UDP and Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian religious leaders in hopes of working out a compromise.\n\nWhile all participants agreed to meet, and despite arguing with delegates that if Ireland's religious denominations couldn't work together, the result would be no denominations under syndicalist rule, the negotiations ultimately devolved into sectarian tirades from UDP represenatives and Catholic Archbishop Joseph MacRory, concluding in failure and becoming yet another setback for de Valera."
 ireland.1016.d.scan: "$ireland.1016.d.start$\n\nWith pressure mounting from his coalition partner, de Valera agreed to pass a bill in Dáil Éireann abolishing article C of the Ulster Privileges that forbide redrawing electoral boundaries in the six counties that formerly made up Northern Ireland. While the abolition of the article has been met with celebration by the NLCL and the northern Catholic community as a whole given the previous gerrymandering of said boundaries to favour Protestants, the loyalist reaction has been quite the opposite.\n\nFeeling threatened by an imminent loss of Protestant power and by fear that Catholics will take vengeance by engaging in gerrymandering of their own, Protestant communities have seen not only protests and riots but additionally threats issued by the re-established UVF promising insurrection if the government moves to reform the northern constituencies. While the bill has been a victory for the SC-AN coalition, the tension in Ulster seem only to have become more volatile."
 ireland.1016.d.labndp: "$ireland.1016.d.start$\n\nThe Labour Party has attempted to avoid the thorny issue of the Ulster Privileges, wishing to steer clear of anything that could promote further sectarian divisions between workers, and has intended focus on what they believe lies at the crux of northern Catholic resentment, the bread-and-butter issues of employment and access to social housing. However, one of their coalition partners, the National Development Party, popular with the upper class, is reluctant to agree to Labour's proposals for laws against discrimination in hiring, fearful of alienating businessmen.\n\nNonetheless, perceiving that the protest marches stand in the way of Ireland's economy recovery, the NDP agreed with Labour and Clann na Talmhan on the establishment of a council between trade unions and business owners to arrive at a compromise. Unfortunately, negotiations have been slow going, while violence throughout Ulster continue to rise, and fears have risen that circumstances may get out of hand before an arrangement is arrived at."
 ireland.1016.d.labplp: "$ireland.1016.d.start$\n\nThe Labour Party's coalition partner, the Progressive Labour Party, though hesitant to involve themselves in sectarian issues, agreed to support a bill in Dail Eireann addressing hiring discrimination. Ulster Protestant workers have not taken the news gracefully, regarding it as a method by the Catholic and crypto-syndicalist government in Dublin to harm their own employment. To appease Protestants in the bill's wake and lead them away from the lure of militant loyalism, the Labour Party has sought to crack down on the Blueshirts.\n\nUnfortunately, because of Catholic community protection and sympathetic Gardaí, these endeavours have largely failed. While Healy's moderates are grateful for the reforms and have considered a temporary halt to protest marches, many Catholics still continue to hold resentment over the existence of gerrymandering, and Labour's opposition to the Blueshirts has only encouraged bitterness. Although O'Brien wished to please both sides, he has ultimately satisfied neither."

Either way, this incident sparked a vicious days-long riot as Protestant rioters pushed into the Bogside, wrecking Catholic homes, only to be beaten back by an odd alliance of Blueshirt and ICA defenders.\n\nWith order among the northern Gardaí collapsing as the majority take the side of their own communities over enforcing the law, riots have spread throughout Ulster from Belfast to Dungannon, all seeing heavy paramilitary involvement, catching the government entirely off guard, and fears are rapidly rising that the state has lost total control of the province and a repeat of the odious Belfast pogroms of the 1920s may be in the offing."

With the army being deployed to prevent the marchers from reaching the pillar on which the effigy was to be burned, stones and shouts of \"Go on home, Irish soldiers\" were hurled by the angered crowed, and, under pressure the soldiers opened fire, killing several and wounding more.\n\nThis incident has quickly acquired the name \"Bloody Saturday\", and has unleashed a torrent of horror and outrage. Radical loyalists have announced the reformation of the Ulster Volunteer Force, and sworn to fight \"Papist tyranny\" through whatever means neccessary, and barricades have been set up blocking off Protestant districts from state control throughout the province.\n\nIn the matter of a day, the stability promised by O'Duffy's regime has been thrown into jeopardy."

While a military presence had been deemed essential to deal with the continued threat of radicals, its continuation became increasingly unpopular as the month dragged on. Outrage from loyalists accusing the armed forces of bias had not endeared Protestants to their patrols, while pro-integralist Blueshirts also denounced the army as traitors and attempted to stir up trouble between them and local Catholics.\n\nWith the government fearing that prolonging the deployment of Irish soldiers could risk once more heating up the anger that they had worked so hard to cool, the decision was made to bring the period of martial law to an end."

Fortunately in spite of some grumbling, no such event came to pass, with the Gardaí soon returning on the streets of Ulster as the province seemed to have returned to some form of normality, at least by northern standards.\n\nDespite this apparent calm, everyone had taken the point from the crisis. The status quo was untenable and this peace would not last without serious reform. Calls for adjustments to the Constitution of 1922 had existed since the north had been reincorporated into the nation and, in the eyes of reformers, the Ulster Privileges' problems were the result of the government awkwardly welding the reunified province onto the existing state. After so much upheaval, the cabinet had come to agree. Not only would reforms to the situation of Catholics be necessary to unify the Irish people, but additionally a total rethink of how the Irish Republic was to be structured, taking the wishes of all sections of the country into account."

As the nation marked the coup's anniversary, that promise seemed false to all, with loyalist and syndicalist terrorism on the rise while infighting gripped the regime. No longer was this dispute confined within shadowy governmental circles, as both factions publicly denounced each other in propaganda and began to fight over the occupation of key strategic locations. Everyone could feel the same apprehension building from that momentous time twelve months prior.\n\nIt would be General O'Duffy, seeking to strike the first blow before he could be stricken, who would light the powderkeg by inviting several local National Guard commanders known to be sympathetic to Ó Cuinneagáin to a meeting in Dublin, only for them to be placed under arrest upon arrival. For Ó Cuinneagáin and his followers, this would prove the final straw. Calling for a revolt against the \"traitor\" O'Duffy, the Blueshirts, mainly siding with Ó Cuinneagáin, rose up, capturing Dublin and other major Irish cities despite the resistance of the Gardaí, who had largely maintained their loyalty to their former Commissioner."

However, Ó Cuinneagáin's putsch would turn out to have a fatal failing, their failure to woo the military to their side. With the generals choosing to align with O'Duffy in spite of past disagreements, the army surrounded the cities under Blueshirt control, creating a siege situation not dissimilar from the fateful events of 1916. The rebellion would soon conclude a similar way, although with less bloodshed, as the Blueshirts were both reluctant to spill blood against the army and overwhelmed by their superior training and equipment. In the end, though Ó Cuinneagáin managed to successfully evade capture, going on the run, O'Duffy had emerged victorious over his enemies, both domestic and foreign."
 ireland.1050.d13.IRE: "$ireland.1050.d1.anstart$\n\nWith Dublin under the command of the rebels, O'Duffy was soon captured and branded with treason against the Gaelic race, his efforts having drastically backfired. And although the Old Guard had counted on the military standing with them in the event of a confrontation with the integralists, the generals, to their shock, would disappoint their expectations, throwing their lot in with Ó Cuinneagáin after becoming disenchanted with O'Duffy over the preceding year. As the Irish people were treated to the sight of Blueshirts and Irish soldiers marching and patrolling side by side, Ó Cuinneagáin proclaimed himself Ceannaire of Ireland atop the steps of the GPO in a speech that would be broadcast throughout the island.

With a stalemate established and unbreakable without a civil war, covert meetings took place between the army, old guard and Ó Cuinneagáin's wavering supporters, resulting in an agreement being reached.

Where once were silent mantles and kitchen countertops, a Marconi can be found in households across the length and breadth of the island.\n\nIn rural villages, people not only gather for the bothántaíocht, but to listen to commentary of Gaelic sports and news of the ever-changing world across the waves. In the urban centres, every pub and workplace can be heard playing the latest musical fads from America and Europe, and everyone tunes in to hear a new Céilí band get their chance on the airwaves.\n\nWhile there is always some grumbling from our opponents no matter what we broadcast, the new Raidió Éireann has been a net-positive for the government and the nation."
 ireland.1500.a: "The proper medium to express oneself!"

 ireland.1501.t: "The Returning Emigrants"
 ireland.1501.d.start: "Ever since England brought Ireland under their control, emigration became a common occurrence, as the Irish fled poverty and oppression under the English boot, initially to the Catholic powers of Europe, and then to the New World, particularly the United States of America, as the formers' stars fell and the latter's rose. As the Great Famine devastated the isle, leaving over a million dead and more than half again in exile, this trend was exacerbated, creating a culture of migration that resulted in the island's population continuing to decline decades after the event.\n\nOnly the British Revolution and a wave of instability in America would bring an end to this exodus, the main ports of call for Irish emigrants now appearing unattractive, in contrast to the modestly growing prosperity of the newly-independent republic. The powder keg of the failing American economy and rising political tensions has finally exploded, and for the second time in a century civil war has broken out in the United States, leading many Americans of Irish descent to seek to return to the homeland of their ancestors."
 ireland.1501.d1: "$ireland.1501.d.start$\n\nThe Irish Government is divided on its approach to this crisis. Some insist that Irish-Americans are still of our flesh-and-blood and that, having assisted Ireland in winning independence, \"we have a national duty to assist them in kind\", while other, more cynical, politicians and bureaucrats point out that due to our lack of resources, accepting a flood of refugees at the present moment may further destabilise a country already in the process of recovering from Black Monday."
 ireland.1501.d2: "$ireland.1501.d.start$\n\nThe revolution still exists in America, and despite the ongoing conflict, it turns out Ireland is not as attractive as destination as many may have imagined. A small number of CSA-supporting Irish-Americans dispossessed of their homes seem willing to seek new lives in Ireland, at least until the war is over, so the question still remains whether the government wishes to accept them or not."

 ireland.1501.d5: "$ireland.1501.d.start$\n\nThere is great willingness among much of the government to accept as many of the Irish-Americans as possible, with some insisting that the Irish-Americans are still of our flesh-and-blood and that, having assisted Ireland in winning independence, \"we have a national duty to assist them in kind\". However, the presence of Ireland in a military alliance has irrevocably damaged our potential designation as a peaceful haven. Nonetheless, a number of Irish-Americans dispossessed of their homes seem willing to seek new lives in Ireland, so the question still remains whether the government wishes to accept them or not."

 ireland.2000.d.GER1: "The Irish, while keeping full integration into our European Project at arm's length, have always kept close ties with previous German governments, with the doors of power largely remaining open for Irish diplomats. With the increasingly hostile global situation however, the Irish have begun to recognise that being a Reichspakt fellow-traveller is no longer sufficient protection.\n\nToday this tension culminated in the Irish Government approaching us, on their own accord, about becoming a full member of our military alliance. The question now is if we wish to accept them, or is their position next to Britain undefendable?"
 ireland.2000.d.GER2: "An urgent communiqué has been received from [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], containing a desperate plea from the [IRE.GetAdjective] government. It would appear that their choice of geopolitical alignment was a poor one, and following the collapse of the Entente, they wish to formally enter into the Reichspakt.\n\nThe German sphere had been seen as a likely home for Ireland following their resolution of the Northern Crisis, but they instead opted to join their former overlords in the Entente. However, despite doing so, they did remain members of Mitteleuropa, and as such many of their links with Germany remained during this time.\n\nAccess to their ports will always be useful, but the questions is if [GER.GetNameDef] wishes to reward those who stray from its path."

 ireland.2000.d.ENT.NI: "This does not come without complications. The status of Northern Ireland has remained spurious since the British Revolution, and while the Anglo-Irish Treaty did give Northern Ireland the right to join with the rest of the island on its own accord, such a move was never formally ratified by cabinet at the time. Forming this alliance with the Irish will be a tacit recognition of their ownership of the region, and should we retake the Home Isles, we will no longer be in a position to ask for it back.

 ireland.2002.d.ENT1: "It can be tough to move on from the past, particularly when it is with those who have wronged you time and time again. And yet, when Ireland decided to reach out to the Entente powers, it attempted to forget their role as the continuation of the British Empire, believing that they had been humbled by their expulsion from their homelands. The government assumed that the British would be eager to acquire a new ally located so close to their homelands, a potential jumping-off point for their envisioned homecomings.\n\n And yet, it appears that the Irish Government had placed too much faith in their ability to work for a better future, as the Entente leadership has seemingly rejected oits efforts to join their alliance.

Ireland had assumed that considering its rather precarious diplomatic situation, that perhaps it could find some common ground with the Entente, who have spent much of the past two decades in a near-constant state of existential crisis.\n\n Unfortunately it appears that these expectations were not to be long for this world, as the leadership of the Entente have largely dashed any hopes Ireland had of being admitted to their alliance. While their reasons were not given, many cannot help but feel that the Irish general apathy to their expulsions has played a part, which is a claim even the most anglophilic in the country have struggled to deny. Regardless of the reasons, the fact remains that Ireland is on its own."

Irish men and women of every political persuasion remember well the good turns afforded our ancestors by that nation, from which the ancestor of the Irish people, Míl Espáine, or Milesius, is said to have originated.\n\nTime and again, when Hibernia bled, Hispania sought to allay her troubles. The most famous of these episodes was during Ireland's Nine Years War, when the Spanish assisted Hugh O'Neill and Hugh Roe O'Donnell's rebel confederation of Irish nobles against Elizabeth I of England with arms and a landing at Kinsale in County Cork. Sadly, Ireland's greatest opportunity to achieve its liberty would turn into one of its worst disasters, as the resulting siege and Battle of Kinsale would tragically end in a disastrous defeat, marking the end of Gaelic civilisation. In the two centuries following its aftermath, when much of the Gaelic aristocracy fled to the continental Europe, many would settle in Spain, where the Irish in accordance with their Milesian heritage were legally treated as native Spaniards. The Irish integrated well and many Spaniards of Irish descent would come to play notable parts in the military and politics of their new homeland, such as the renowned supporter of Isabella II, Prime Minister and victor of the Battle of Tetuán, Leopoldo O'Donnell.\n\nIn light of that history, the ferocious Spanish passion that grips so many Irish should not be dismissed. \"Do something\", the ghosts of Ireland past wail, and the blood is thicker than water. Mainstream opinion favours the Kingdom of Spain, as maintaining stability against far-right and far-left extremism, however Aontas Náisiúnta, given their fervent religiosity and the connection of the party's extreme wing with Lusitanian integralism, have expressed their support for the Carlist cause, while syndicalists and radical left-wing republicans of course support the CNT-FAI.

While to many across Europe this seems like pointless ethnonationalist conflict, a significant portion of the Irish public have begun to develop a great sympathy for the Belgrade Pact's ambitions and have begun to call for Irish support in their struggle. To those across the nation sympathetic to the cause, they see the conflict as one familiar to the Irish, seeing it as Serbia's attempt to right the wrong of a partition of its people by a foreign imperialist power, and to ultimately unite their nation together under one banner regardless of religious or cultural differences foreign rule has brought to their lands.\n\nIt would be a mistake however to believe that this view is universal across Ireland, with a pro-Bulgarian viewpoint quickly proliferating across the nation for a multitude of reasons. Pro-German voices in the country would tend to support the Bulgarian cause, and others point out that Bulgaria also began its modern history through its own rebellion against imperialism. And, like those across the continent, there are many within the country who also view this conflict as a pointless effort that serves no purpose except to throw the Balkans into chaos.

Although they faced many issues integrating at first, they soon became a core part of American society and the Irish struggle would owe much to the efforts of Irish-Americans. A key turning point for this acceptance into the American nation was the American Civil War, where droves of Irishmen, including famed Irish revolutionaries, fought for the Union, and to a much lesser extent, the Confederacy.\n\nFor the second time in less than seventy-five years, no matter their colours, in each American trench Ireland's sons can be found. One side's Walsh guns down another's Kelly. It truly is a brother war. Where America once promised the Irish an end to their troubles, our people now feel compelled to offer Americans the same.

Even beneath the boot or nigh-felled by English bullets, the Irish wavered not. When Hugh O'Neill was forced to seek exile in Europe during the Flight of the Earls, it was to Rome he journeyed, where he lived under the protection of the Papacy until his death, and during the Risorgimento more than a thousand Irishmen would travel to defend the Pope's lands, performing with distinction against the forces of Victor Emmanuel II.\n\nIrish relations with Italian nationalism, on the other hand, have been historically more strained. Many Irish opposed the notion of Italian unity due to the Pope's opposition, and the Italians' dependence on British backing for their aims led to clashes between Irish nationalists and the likes of Mazzini, with Douglas Hyde once rhetorically asking \"What did Mazzini say?\" while condemning the loss of the Irish language. Despite this, the republican ideals of Young Italy would nonetheless serve as a source of inspiration for Young Ireland and the Fenians, and years later during the War of Independence some radical elements of Italian society would profess their sympathies for the Irish struggle and assist the IRA in obtaining arms.\n\nWhile much has changed since that time, the people still look to Italy with a certain fondness. With war looming over the peninsula, the Irish are coming. Though naturally the bulk of Irish public favour is for the Papacy and the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, holding reverence for the former as the nucleus of their faith and sympathy for the latter as an agricultural and formerly neglected region under the Piedmontese as Ireland was under the British,"

Owing to the Spanish-supported immigration of Gaelic aristocrats to South America, where they would achieve prominence as colonial administrators, the Irish have a long and storied history in the region. Perhaps the most well-known of them is Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of the Chilean nation, who valiantly took arms against the Spanish Crown and fought alongside José de San Martín until Chile was freed by the Army of the Andes.\n\nFor its part, Argentina counts Guillermo, or William, Brown among its heroes, a sailor from County Mayo who became the nation's first admiral, and beat impossible odds against superior Spaniard and Brazilian forces. These ties were only strengthened in the 19th century, when both nations received a significant portion of the Irishmen who left their homes in search of better fortunes.\n\nThe descent of the Southern Cone into a full-fledged war, not long after the start of the American Civil War, has seen another former haven for the Irish diaspora suddenly become a battleground. Opinions on the conflict have not escaped the political scene, and the Buenos Aires government,"

 ireland.2019.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap]'s [From.GetAdjective] allies have informed the government of a recent telegram that has been received from [IRE.Capital.GetName] earlier today. It would appear that the [IRE.GetAdjective] are interested in joining the [Root.GetFactionName], and given their geographical position, this unexpected offer is of no small significance.\n\nThe [From.GetAdjective]s, who took over as leaders of the faction, are keenly aware of the slightly uncertain status of [GetStateName_119], and wish to consider our views on admitting [IRE.GetAdjectiveDef] to the alliance. The potentially uncertain status of [GetStateName_119] lies in the fact that while it joined the Republic after the fall of the United Kingdom, as it had been permitted to do so in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, this was never given formal assent by the British government-in-exile.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the [IRE.GetAdjective] have included in their offer of an alliance, the requirement of a recognition of the constitutional status of [GetStateName_119], and that should the United Kingdom be restored once more, it will remain in the hands of the [IRE.Capital.GetName] government. So though this offer gives unrivalled access to the northwest Atlantic, let alone the Home Isles, [GetStateName_119] will be relinquished forever more."

Citing the uncertainty of particular interpretations of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and feeling that now is not the time to make such commitments on matters that may evolve over time.\n\nDespite the [Root.GetAdjective] leadership of the [Root.GetFactionName], a commitment was made to give [From.GetNameDef] the right of first refusal, and with this, the chance for a foothold in the northwest Atlantic has been lost."

Part of the terms of this treaty include the removal of all claims held by Reichspakt members on lands also claimed by the Entente. Of course, this includes Dál Riata, an area which holds great historical significance to the Gael.\n\nIn the name of maintaining the diplomatic status quo, it would be possible for the government to backtrack on this claim, and begin to describe it moreso as an overall liberation of the area from the syndicalists, rather than claiming it for Ireland itself. This way, [IRE.GetNameDef] would be able to remain in the Reichspakt while saving face with itself.\n\nThe option remains, however, to cut ties with the Germans entirely, and continue this war on Ireland's own terms. Such a move would be radical and leave the nation as an international pariah, but how else could all of Gaeldom's true destiny be secured for the generations to come?"

Though the Irish public is angered at the return to war after peace had been seemingly established in Europe with the fall of syndicalism, the resulting outrage is aimed not at the integralist establishment but at Perfidious Albion, and official propaganda has presented this renewed conflict as the final chapter in the centuries-long civilisational struggle between the pious Gaels and the degenerate Anglo-Saxons. After enduring hundreds of years of efforts to wipe out their noble culture and faith, it is time for the Gaels to claim their rightful vengeance and victory through the liberation of the Highlands and the Isle of Man, and for the English filth to rue the day they first stepped foot in Ireland."

Regardless of the centuries of grievances that have built up between the British Crown and the Irish people, the Ireland that [IRE_loc_leader_surname] represents while standing here today is one that is willing to move beyond them. It is an Ireland that was willing to offer a hand to Britain when it had fallen to its lowest point, and it is an Ireland that has subsequently helped pulled Britain back up onto its feet, so that they may now stand together on equal footing.\n\nAnd with such an effort made on their part, it isn't hard for even the most ardent British nationalist to admit that such a future where Ireland and Britain are equal partners is ultimately a desirable one for both nations, and one that they should strive to maintain."

Politicians and the populace from across the political spectrum have agreed that a brand new constitution, created through cooperation and careful consideration, is what the country needs to secure its political future.\n\nThis new Constitution, or Bunreacht, will be co-drafted in Irish and English with assistance from the writer and teacher Micheál Ó Gríobhtha, and Risteárd Ó Foghludha, renowned writer, editor, and founder of Craobh an Chéitinnigh, a branch of the Gaelic League.

 ireland.2601.t: "The Form of the Republic"
 ireland.2601.d: "The first question facing the drafters is of how the Republic is composed and how its governance shall function.\n\nThe first option, supported by SF, maintains a system similar to the current \"Ulster Privileges\", whereby the north-eastern county councils maintain greater autonomy, the President's Council of State has guaranteed loyalist representation, and loyalists have a permanent presence in cabinet in the form of the new official role of \"Minister for Ulster Affairs\". There is some apprehension with nationalists who wish to see change in the new Constitution rather than a status quo.\n\nThe UDP and NDP, however, are pushing even further, asking for full devolution for the north-eastern six counties codified into the Constitution.\n          - \"The north-eastern six counties of Ulster shall have the right to hold a devolved parliament with areas of competence as defined by law.\"\nThis would effectively turn those counties into an autonomous region, dominated by loyalists. There is fierce push-back from nationalists as they see this as akin to a return to partition, despite written assurances against open discrimination.\n\nOn the other side, AN, and interestingly the PLP, are pushing for a unitary Republic ruled directly from Dublin.\n          - \"The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.\"\nThis, along with sections emphasising the primacy of Dáil Éireann in Dublin, would certainly go far to unifying the country, removing the autonomy exception for the councils in the north. The PLP wish to give more concessions to loyalists, but as a compromise, both parties have agreed to maintaining Brooke's position and a limited guarantee of representation in the Dáil.\n\nA novel approach, favoured by SC, is to have each Province hold its own regional assembly.\n          - \"Each of the four Provinces shall have the right to hold a federal assembly with areas of competence as prescribed by law.\"\nThis American-inspired approach is one that has not been considered before, but it could allow each Province to tackle regional problems more effectively, particularly tensions regarding local populations of nationalists and loyalists."

The President would select and head the government and be the main leader of the country.\n\nThe opposing option, supported by SC, the UDP, and Labour, is a parliamentary system whereby the executive powers of the State are exercised by the government selected by the Dáil.\n          - \"The President shall, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann, appoint the Taoiseach and the government.\"\nThis system is quite similar to the old British system of government whereby the Prime Minister selects their government from the members of parliament and the Head of State, if one exists, has very limited, mostly ceremonial powers, only operable on the advice of the government. Additionally, following the adoption of this Constitution, a new President will be elected to be the ceremonial Head of State, and the current role of Príomh Aire will be renamed to Taoiseach, literally meaning \"Chieftain\", to better demonstrate its new executive powers.\n\nAn uncommon system, proposed by members of the PLP and NDP, is a mixed system whereby the President has some executive power, but selects their government from Dáil Éireann and shares executive power with the Dáil-selected Príomh Aire.

 ireland.2605.d: "The question of how the language of Ireland should be addressed is a mostly symbolic one, but one with great consequences for the character of Ireland. No one wishes to see Irish decline further, so the question is mainly around the status of the English language. Unfortunately, no matter how much hardline nationalists may wish it, English will have to have some place in Irish society.\n\nThe first option, supported strongly by SC and AN, is giving Irish the position of first official language, while accepting English if it must be used:\n          - \"1. The Irish language, as the national language, is recognised as the first official language.\"\n          - \"2. English will be accepted as another official language.\"\nThis would mean that Irish will always take precedent in law, and allow every citizen to conduct official business in Irish. More importantly, it sends a strong message that Ireland is and always will be Irish, and that the Irish language will not be left to extinction.\n\nThe second option, pushed for by SF, the UDP and the NDP, adds a third section to this Article:\n          - \"3. Recognising the special position and history of the north-eastern six counties of Ulster, provision may be made for the exclusive use of English as the official language within those counties.\"\nThis would give the counties in the north an opt-out to using Irish for official business if they so choose. The loyalists in particular are afraid of being forced to use Irish, and wish to protect their heritage as much as the rest of Ireland.\n\nThe third has broad support from across the Labour party and proposes a single section:\n          - \"The Irish language and the English language are recognised as the two co-equal official languages.\"\nThis would give equal recognition to Irish and English. The practical effects are that both the Irish and English text of a law are on equal footing, and issues of interpretation will be done on a multilingual basis. This option does not have broad support and is only begrudgingly accepted by loyalists. Many see it as an admission that an \"Irish Ireland\" is dead."

Some loyalists and wealthy land owners are kicking up a fuss about their peerages and are worried that their titles are under threat, which is not an unfounded fear. A sizeable portion of politicians wish to completely do away with the last vestiges of the British Empire and push the image that Ireland is a modern republic. Whatever the choice, only the most loyal of loyalists wish to see a system whereby those with titles are granted special privileges and representation.\n\nThe first option is simple — that there be no titles at all and no citizen can accept one. SC and PLP support this but it would undoubtedly cause some upset among the peers:\n          - \"1. Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.\"\n          - \"2. No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the government.\"\n\nThe second option, which is supported by the UDP and the NDP, is to recognise the existing titles of citizens:\n          - \"The State shall recognise any established titles held by citizens.\"\n\nAnother option is to ignore the titles granted under the British Crown and for the State to grant their own titles. A kick in the teeth to loyalists but one which AN seems intent on pursuing:\n          - \"The State shall have the power to confer special decorations upon meritable citizens.\"\n\nA compromise proposed by SF and Labour is to include both of those Articles and recognising the existing titles and allowing new ones to be created."

 ireland.2650.d.sfcollins: "There are moments in life which will cause even the most stoic individual to stop and fully consider the situation that has been presented to them. For Michael Collins, one of these moments came in the form of a question posed by one of the nation's many journalists; \"Mr. [IRE_loc_leader_title], many Irishmen have nearly forgotten what it is to have an Ireland without Michael Collins. All look to you as an example, for good or ill. When you think on the state of our country, is it conceivable to separate yourself from it, or does your legacy weigh on you? Does Ireland's future matter to you?\"\n\nFor a man who has spent most of his life living in the moment, the idea of being remembered as the [IRE_loc_leader_title] instead of a heroic soldier or revolutionary martyr is one that has only recently begun to dawn on Collins. Before he even reached his twenties he had already begun the fight for the Irish cause, and so too would he continue even after both independence and reunification. Where he once bounced from house to house to fight the Tans, he would instead bounce between them on the campaign trail to beat Labour and an tSaorstáit. Barely hanging on during Black Monday, and soldiering through the Northern Crisis, he was still energised by the same fighting spirit the entire time.\n\nAnd yet, for the first time in Collins' adult life, his survival through everything that has been thrown at him has left him with nothing more to fight. With the opposition struggling to even threaten his position, poll numbers sitting constantly at comfortable levels, and the extremist elements of Irish society thoroughly rooted out, the realisation that this chapter has ended has begun to finally hit home for Collins. But with the fight of today ended, the new battle is for the world of tomorrow. Where Collins had to be a fighter, it is his hope that the same will not have to be true for the next generation of Ireland's leaders. If they do truly look up to Collins, he hopes that they look up to his role as a man of politics rather than a soldier of war.\n\nSo, after a moment of thought and reflection, Collins simply smiled and answered \"Indeed, it does.\""
 ireland.2650.d.sfmulcahy: "For most in Dublin, the quiet morning of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] was no different than any other day of the year, save for the small crowd that had gathered outside of The Barracks at Arbour Hill. For it was at this location that a rather unassuming and lowkey speech to a crowd primarily composed of the local garrison was being held by none other than [IRE_loc_leader_title] Mulcahy, dressed in his army uniform that is instantly recognisable to almost all that have ever met him. While many leaders may wish for huge crowds to greet them, Mulcahy could wish for nothing better than a small crowd of his \"comrades in arms\" at the same barracks he had once oversaw.\n\n\"To many in the nation the army has often seemed to be as a thing apart and different from the people. Yet for all of our nation's free history, our army has been the people, it is the people and will be the people. Our green uniform does not make us less the people. It is a cloak of service, a curtailer of our weakness, and amplifier of our strength. When the tricolour first flew proudly high over Dublin Town, the free people of Ireland were not simply either soldiers or citizens, we were one and the same. It is on the foundation our great republic was built, and upon it that our nation has continued to prosper.\n\nWhen our national independence was first declared by Pádraig Pearse, the Proclamation not only set forth the rights of the Irish people but also made clear the vital role their military organisations serve in guaranteeing those rights. When I myself fought on that fateful day I was neither a soldier nor a citizen, as an Irishman I was both. And so to uphold the lasting legacy set forth by the forefathers of many of you in the room, and the contemporaries of those getting on in years like myself, it is my honour to declare that from this day forwards this fateful building will be known as Pearse Barracks, Dún an Phiarsaigh.\"\n\nAnd with that the speech ended, to a somewhat muted but respectful applause, the type of humble response that is all a man like Mulcahy truly wishes for in life."
 ireland.2650.d.sc: "Throughout his tenure Éamon de Valera has been no stranger to the radio, delivering regular speeches to the Irish people through it. While many of these speeches have quickly fallen out of the public consciousness, today's speech seems different. Whether it can be chalked up to An Saorstát Criostúil's cemented political dominance, de Valera's delivery, or simply just the speech's quality, few feel like they will ever forget these immortal words:\n\n\"The ideal Ireland that we would have, the Ireland that we dreamed of, would be the home of a people who valued material wealth only as a basis for right living, of a people who, satisfied with frugal comfort, devoted their leisure to the things of the spirit — a land whose countryside would be bright with cosy homesteads, whose fields and villages would be joyous with the sounds of industry, with the romping of sturdy children, the contest of athletic youths and the laughter of happy maidens, whose firesides would be forums for the wisdom of serene old age. The home, in short, of a people living the life that God desires that men should live.\n\nWith the tidings that make such an Ireland possible, St. Patrick came to our ancestors fifteen hundred years ago promising happiness here no less than happiness hereafter. It was the pursuit of such an Ireland that later made our country worthy to be called the island of saints and scholars. It was the idea of such an Ireland — happy, vigorous, spiritual — that fired the imagination of our poets; that made successive generations of patriotic men give their lives to win religious and political liberty; and that will urge men in our own and future generations to die, if need be, so that these liberties may be preserved.\n\nOne hundred years ago, the Young Irelanders, by holding up the vision of such an Ireland before the people, inspired and moved them spiritually as our people had hardly been moved since the Golden Age of Irish civilisation. Fifty years later, the founders of the Gaelic League similarly inspired and moved the people of their day. So, later, did the leaders of the Irish Volunteers, and those who continued their good fight until all of our nation had been freed. We of this time, if we have the will and active enthusiasm, have the opportunity to inspire and move our generation in like manner. We can do so by keeping this thought of a noble future for our country constantly before our eyes, ever seeking in action to bring that future into being, and ever remembering that it is for our nation as a whole that future must be sought.\""
 ireland.2650.d.labour: "The long-serving William O'Brien is a man of much experience in the world of Irish politics, being able to boast of his participation for a greater period than almost all of his opponents, stretching back to his membership of Easter Rising martyr James Connolly's Irish Socialist Republican Party as a young tailor at the dawn of the 20th century. Founding in 1912 the Labour Party alongside Connolly and who would soon come to be his most loathed rival, James Larkin, the road that has led him to power in Ireland has been arduous, through which he prevailed only through sheer determination, a willingness to compromise where others would find too alluring the temptation of extremism, and more than a bit of good fortune.\n\nUnlike his foes, such as Larkin or the fellow son of his Clonakilty hometown Michael Collins, O'Brien was not blessed with a wellspring of charisma through which he could naturally attract the masses to his banner alone, yet his hardworking nature allowed him to overcome this disadvantage as he established a firm grip on both the trade unions and later the Labour Party itself, striving to ensure both remained free from entryism. It is this industriousness that has won him the respect of the Irish people as he stepped in not only to correct the mistakes of his conservative predecessors, but to show the nation that Labour is not simply a syndicalist catspaw.\n\nLeading Ireland into a new era of social democracy based not only on the Democratic Programme of 1919, but also on the teachings of Christ, the previously existing stigma against anything remotely left-wing on the isle has been vanquished, as both the conditions of the working man rise and the economy flourishes, while the country has become more stable than ever, decisively proving the naysayers who would accuse O'Brien of bringing anarchy and tyranny wrong. Now and forever, it has been demonstrated that the cause of Labour, the cause of Ireland and the cause of Christianity are not in conflict, but in fact all one and the same."
 ireland.2650.d.cnat: "With the hectic nature of everyday life, it is often hard for one to stop and simply take in the world around them. Even when granted the opportunity to, many may still scoff at the mundanity of such an act, instead preferring to focus on the matters they view as much more serious. Yet, as far as [IRE_loc_leader_title] [IRE_loc_leader_name] and much of the government are concerned, the heart of Ireland is found nested within the land itself, and to not sit back and reflect upon it is to overlook the fundamentals of Irish life.\n\nFor it is this great land that so many have proudly called their home across countless generations, from the most humble of villages in Leitrim all the way to the busy and bustling heart of Dublin itself. Regardless whether it is the farmer reaping his yearly harvest, an accountant enjoying nature on their commute to work, or even a young couple watching the sun set over Galway Bay, each of their lives are shaped by the bounties that Ireland provides to its people. And it is ultimately these bounties, and the moments of joy or satisfaction they provide, that truly make the moments that make life worth living.\n\nIt is to this end, the pursuit of ensuring these worldly fundamentals, that the government's vision has ultimately been derived. No longer does the Irish worker have to worry about working from the break of dawn to the darkest reaches of the night, with even now the ability to take substantial amounts of time off work to enjoy life with their families as all should have the right to do. Nor does the farmer have to fear waking up to a nation where the rustic way of life is no longer possible to live, instead he may be confident in the government's support for the rural Irish countryside. And even the most vulnerable in society, who may have once collapsed into a pit of destitution, may rest easy knowing that there is a welfare system ready to help pull them back up out of it.\n\nAnd above all, when everyone, no matter their status, can live a life without these everyday worries getting in the way, what is better to do than to take in the beauties of this island that truly makes us whole?"
 ireland.2650.d.ndp: "To most of the NDP members that make up much of the government, most notably even [IRE_loc_leader_title] [IRE_loc_leader_name] himself, if asked to describe their vision of Ireland in one word that word would be \"Opportunity\". It has been this word that has acted as an unofficial slogan for the party, and now by extension the government itself, ever since it saw the party rise to its first successes and achieve its original place in the coalition.\n\nFor such a simple word, the exact meaning of \"Opportunity\" varies greatly depending on who you ask and when you actually ask it. At times it has meant the opportunity for every man and woman in Ireland to achieve their dreams, simply provided they put in enough hard work to see them to fruition. At other times, especially when levied against the restrictions of the old Sinn Féin government, it has meant the opportunity for anyone in the country to make their mark upon the nation, regardless of their background or heritage. Even more recently however, with Ireland's increased prominence on the financial world stage, some have gone so far to even declare that it is the opportunity to leave your mark upon the world as a whole.\n\nIf you were to ask [IRE_loc_leader_surname] however, he would gladly tell you that the meaning of the term encompasses all of the above and more. For him, \"Opportunity\" is at the heart of Irish culture and history. Whether it has been as grand as the opportunity the Irish people carved out for themselves to decide their own fate and destiny, or even down to the simple individual level of good education providing a student the opportunity to get into Trinity, it arises in all facets of Irish life. In the eyes of the [IRE_loc_leader_title], social and economic progress in a nation go hand in hand with each other, with the opportunities provided in one allow the opening of more in the other, and it has always been the NDP's goal to facilitate the growth of both.\n\nAnd ultimately as far as [IRE_loc_leader_surname] is concerned, every aspect that makes up this concept of \"Opportunity\" are those that truly describe what it means to be Irish."
 ireland.2650.d.plp: "For those who limit their worldview to the simplistic idea that violence always begets violence; the idea that a nation such as Ireland, who emerged onto the world stage through armed revolution, could ever bring about meaningful change for its people through peaceful measures would have previously seemed completely outlandish. And yet now, under the leadership of [IRE_loc_leader_title] [IRE_loc_leader_name], a leftist coalition has not only achieved power through the ballot box, but has managed to cement itself in the hearts of the Irish people.  The Irish nation now marches towards a red future, yet it marches not with a rifle, but with an olive branch.\n\nTo even the more open minded, many of the events of the last few years would have still been equally hard to imagine. When the rift between O'Brien and Sheehy-Skeffington first led to Labour splitting in two, few could picture a future where these two men would be willing to put aside their differences and work together on anything, let alone being the ones leading Ireland towards such a future. Yet now after so many eventful years of this red coalition being in power, there are scarcely any who can still hold doubt towards the success of the reformist approach of both branches of Labour.\n\nOf course there are still the detractors, both those on the right who still believe that the \"radical regime\" will collapse at the next real hurdle, and many of those on the left who reject any notion that one can simply reform towards a socialist system without the backing of a revolution. However, regardless of their naysaying the voice of the Irish people is clear, it is not violent revolution or conservative stagnation that they desire but a gradual and peaceful transition forward. Ireland's future is not one stuck trying to harken back to a idealised past, it is a future filled with liberty and progress. And if Ireland's future shall truly be a red one, it will be achieved by a people armed not with a sword, but with a ploughshare and a dream."
 ireland.2650.d.aneod: "While just a few short years ago the idea of an Aontas Náisiúnta government was seen as outlandish to most, the fear that one day Irish democracy could be completely swept away in a flash was one that still very much occupied a place in many a mind. Almost no one however, [IRE_loc_leader_surname] included, could have predicted that now with AN having at last consolidated their rule over the nation, Irish democracy has not only yet to breathe its last but has begun to stabilise once more under new leadership\n\nDespite great fearmongering by those in the opposition in regards to so called \"democratic backsliding\", when [IRE_loc_leader_name] directs the nation's policies he is not some supreme Ceannaire overseeing a National Council of loyal underlings, he is the nation's [IRE_loc_leader_title] addressing a Dáil still very much filled with many actual opposition members offering forth lively debate. Laws are not simply passed through diktat from on high, when the government puts forward a bill it is still subject to the same proper procedures and vetting that they always have under Ireland's democratic systems. While some within Aontas Náisiúnta are said to still privately hold disdain for being forced to deal with said systems, much of the party have slowly begun to grow rather comfortable with this new status quo.\n\nYet regardless one should not mistake the Dáil of today as being the same one it may have once been in yesteryear. Socialists, the most seditious democrats, and even some of the government's most radical former allies have rightfully been excised from government. No longer do the Irish people have to suffer a nation where their politics are decided by foreigners and Freemasons, rather than the native people of the land. No longer do they have to worry about the subversive threats of Internationalism and Syndicalism attempting to divide or break up the family. And no longer does the great Irish republic have to fear the chaos that these destructive elements may bring."
 ireland.2650.d.anjjok: "Of all the figures currently in Irish politics, few can claim to be as experienced or as devoted to the Irish Republic, language and the Catholic faith as John J. O'Kelly, also known, from his numerous writings over the years, by his pen name Sceilg. Joining Sinn Féin at their inaugural meeting, helping sway the Irish public to support the defeated rebels in the aftermath of the Easter Rising, and serving as a minister during the War of Independence, [IRE_loc_leader_title] ]O'Kelly has been around for every major Irish event of the century, and watching the Republic he swore his utmost loyalty to fall into corruption following the sellout that was the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it was his ironclad determination to set things right that brought him to the position of authority he now holds.\n\nAlthough a diehard republican, O'Kelly's ideals are not built upon the Godless influences of the French Revolution which he abhors, instead seeking inspiration from classical republicanism and rejecting liberal decadence which favours the selfish needs of the individual at the expense of the common good of the nation and the willingness to sacrifice for it. Though the state he has shaped is nominally democratic, its voting process and corporatist structures are designed to ensure that those elected are not Anglophilic, Jewish or Masonic elements wily enough to hoodwink the masses, but rather men and women of virtue.\n\nWith power consolidated securely in the hands of those who uphold patriotism, Christianity and Ireland's native tongue, Sceilg, as a strong chief akin to the Taoisigh of old at the country's helm, watches vigilantly over the Republic he rescued from those who sought to defile it and the sacrifices made by so many Irish martyrs. Like Daniel O'Connell, who he admired in spite of O'Connell's moderacy, it is certain that O'Kelly will go down in the history books as a great liberator, having fulfilled his lifelong mission to safeguard the isle and its ancient culture from the scourges of liberalism, imperialism and syndicalism alike."

 # Reactionary Events #
 ireland.3000.t: "Dawn of a New Order"
 ireland.3000.d: "After the chaos of the preceding few days, the inauguration of Eoin O'Duffy as President and the young upstart Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin as Príomh Aire was a relatively smooth affair, in spite of the efforts of urban strikers and protestors, who were met with harsh crackdowns from the authorities. Though the duo now sit atop a throne of the National Guard and Irish Republican Army's bayonets, the military have demanded a high price in exchange for their continued tacit backing of the regime. While the officer class generally share O'Duffy's dislike for the Ulster Privileges, they eye cautiously AN's anti-German economic stance, given their affinity with Berlin, and the extremism and thuggery common among the Blueshirts. As such, while they have offered AN their endorsement in lieu of the alternative, they have insisted that democracy remain \"unless circumstances should demand otherwise\", wary of the potential consequences of AN wielding absolute control over the country.\n\nResultingly, Aontas Náisiúnta remains dependent on other parties to hold a majority in the Dáil Éireann, an awkward structure held together via the endeavours of AN vice-president John J. O'Kelly, who, as one of the founders of Sinn Féin in 1906, has done wonders to convince opposition TDs, particularly within An Saorstát Criostúil, of the need to grant AN their support \"for the sake of national stability\". While O'Duffy's old guard are well pleased that the party at last wields the ability to sway the course of the Irish nation, Ó Cuinneagáin's faction, their half-hearted abstentionist beliefs hastily abandoned with his ascension to government, are less satisfied with the arrangement, noting the unlikelihood that the Dáil would approve their radical integralist agenda, and feeling insufficiently rewarded in spite of being primarily responsible for the prior administration's overthrow.\n\nBehind closed doors, the knives are swiftly being unsheathed, and it would seem that what is touted as the beginning of orderly and stable governance may prove to be anything but."
 ireland.3000.a: "The first item on the agenda of any Irish organisation is the split."
 ireland.3000.a.tt: "A §YBalance of Power§! begins in Aontas Náisiúnta between the §POld Guard§! and the §NNew Guard§!"

 ireland.3001.t: "A Trip to the Polls"
 ireland.3001.d: "Under pressure to nominally maintain the democratic process, Aontas Náisiúnta is currently dependent on cooperation from other political parties in the Dáil, particularly from members of An Saorstát Criostúil. Eoin O'Duffy's wing of the party are somewhat content with this situation, as in spite of its restrictions they still retain a degree of power through their control of the presidency, and the social programme of SC shares enough with their views for most to find common ground. However, Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin and his followers are less satisfied, and have called on O'Duffy to dissolve the Dáil Éireann and call parliamentary elections.\n\nThey argue that circumstances have been altered dramatically since the last election, and the Irish people ought to have their say. Of course, the National Guard will be on hand to \"assist\" the populace in ensuring they make the correct choice and are not intimidated by \"agents of Anglo-Syndicalism\" into voting against the interests of the Irish nation.\n\nFor the President, yielding to this request comes with its upsides and downsides. On one hand, the return of a higher number of AN TDs would minimise the risk of attempts to enact legislation being stymied by objections from SC moderates. On the other hand, as Ó Cuinneagáin's radicalism finds its most fertile ideological soil among the angry young men of the Blueshirts, their efforts to \"persuade\" voters would likely be focused on constituencies where integralist TDs are running, granting Ó Cuinneagáin's faction a larger sway over Irish domestic policy."

 ireland.3001.b: "We can't let other parties throw a spanner in the works, call for elections."

 ireland.3002.t: "Privileges Unearned"
 ireland.3002.d: "Since Aontas Náisiúnta's foundation, the party's primary grievance and rallying cry has been the existence of the Ulster Privileges. During the British Revolution, O'Duffy was a chief detractor of the government's negotiation with Ulster loyalists on the incorporation of Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic, proposing instead to invade the province to forcibly reunify the island, protect the Catholic population, and prevent the establishment of a syndicalist outpost in Ireland.\n\nIn the following years, the ex-general remained a prominent opponent of the concessions that emerged from those negotiations, resulting in his dismissal as Garda Commissioner by his former friend Michael Collins, and the party subsequently formed by the betrayed and embittered O'Duffy becoming the vanguard of the northern Catholics who felt equally cast aside by their fellow countrymen.\n\nNow with AN in power, they have at last in their hands the opportunity to dispense with the loathed privileges. However, O'Duffy's cautious instincts have found themselves at odds with the bold Ó Cuinneagáin on how best to go about it. O'Duffy is of the belief that the Ulster Privileges should be slowly dismantled one by one in order to keep AN supporters contented, and at the same time minimise loyalist resistance while the regime is in the process of consolidating its control.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin, by contrast, wishes for the Ulster Privileges to be immediately declared null and void, and his position has much support within the Blueshirts and the northern Catholic community. Although this audacious approach would mark the beginning of a new state and be greeted with elation among AN's northern followers, it would also lead to immediate outrage from loyalists, endangering the country's stability, though there is no doubt in governmental circles that a confrontation with loyalism is ultimately inevitable."

 ireland.3003.t: "Le Gean ar Ghaeil"
 ireland.3003.d: "When Aontas Náisiúnta was established, it brought together several fringe factions in Irish political life who found themselves unable to affect the course of the nation alone, from Eoin O'Duffy and his right-wing acolytes inside Sinn Féin who felt betrayed by Michael Collins' liberal direction, to far-right anti-treatyite remnants under John J. O'Kelly. However, from within AN, originating from dissident intellectuals and radical Blueshirts, arose another faction with militant views far exceeding those of the party's founders, coalescing around the charismatic Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin.\n\nWhereas the vision of AN's old guard, dictatorial as it is, remains rooted in their belief to be the inheritors of the republican tradition which the men and women of 1916 had fought for, Ó Cuinneagáin and his followers aim for nothing less than the total resurrection of Gaelic Ireland, complete with the restriction of English and the restoration of the O'Neill family as not only a symbolic undoing of the Battle of Kinsale, but also a means by which the Irish language would regain its former prestige, becoming once again a tongue of kings and scholars, no longer stigmatised by associations of poverty and backwardness.\n\nAlthough republicanism has been deeply ingrained in Ireland since the Easter Rising, the ascendance of Ó Cuinneagáin to the position of Príomh Aire and his increased hold over the Blueshirts has given the new guard the perfect platform to promote their beliefs to the populace, and, in spite of the regime's campaign against German economic influence, the integralists have sought to utilise the Irish public's generally positive image of the Kaiser to remove the negative British association from the idea of monarchism. As O'Duffy and his supporters emphasise their connection to the legacy of 1916 in turn, an internal propaganda war has begun to be waged."

Beginning with riots in the streets of Ulster and no-go areas being established throughout Protestant districts of Belfast and Derry under the protection of the Ulster Volunteer Force, these incidents turned bloodier as the army was sent in to dismantle the barricades and retake the rebelling Protestant neighbourhoods, with tens of people being killed in the process.\n\nFollowing the army's reoccupation, the UVF began a series of attacks on Irish security forces and bombings of businesses, buildings and often innocent civilians, assisted by the Irish Citizen Army, who although ideologically disagreeing with Ulster loyalists, were also keen to take advantage of the government's troubles and achieve their dream of a socialist Ireland.\n\nWith the junta's promises of stability torn asunder by this recent course of events, many both within and outside of the regime are looking for someone to blame, and the factional rivalries between the Old Guard and the New Guard have come to the fore yet again, as they both point the finger at the other for being the underlying cause of the country's problems. The former has denounced the violence of Ó Cuinneagáin's followers as causing the public to regard the administration not as bringers of order but instead as petty thugs, while the latter has mocked O'Duffy, branding him with the derogatory nickname \"O'Scruffy\", as a doddering drunkard who lacks the spine to adequately stamp out the Irish nation's enemies.\n\nWith civil servants, policemen, soldiers, and Blueshirts alike weighing up their options as the two factions continue to castigate each other for their failings, it remains to be seen which will take the fall in the eyes of the regime's functionaries."

 ireland.3005.t: "Passing the Torch"
 ireland.3005.d: "As the factional conflicts tearing apart the Aontas Náisiúnta regime from within escalate, the Blueshirts, having assumed the role of a national milita following the March on Dublin, have largely sided with Ó Cuinneagáin, intensifying their training and recruitment in the knowledge that it is only a matter of time before the old guard and the new come to blows. O'Duffy, too, is aware that a final clash is in the offing, and in response he has sought to weaken the influence of the paramilitary organisation he once sponsored, seizing Blueshirt weapons caches and safehouses, further heightening tensions in the process. Both sides have, however, arrived at the realisation that the army, possessing the most manpower and weaponry in the country at their disposal, will ultimately play the part of kingmaker.\n\nThis fact is a setback for the integralist leader, as the ability to demonstrate a connection to Ireland's revolution is an important factor for the officers, and one which Ó Cuinneagáin lacks, having been only a child during the revolutionary period. Though the fact of his youth is not insurmountable given Michael Collins' relatively young age during the war, and Ó Cuinneagáin sharing the military's more Europhile tendencies, it represents a considerable obstacle to gaining their respect.\n\nSeeking to rectify this, Ó Cuinneagáin has reached out to multiple supporters of Aontas Náisiúnta with significant links to the past struggle in order to seek their endorsement. Most notable of these is Dan Breen, one of Ireland's most illustrious war heroes, in addition to several relatives of reknowned Irish martyrs, namely George Noble Plunkett, a Papal count and father of Joseph Plunkett, Kathleen Clarke, the widow of Tom Clarke and Nora Ashe, the sister of hunger striker Thomas Ashe. Should Ó Cuinneagáin be successful in persuading these high-profile men and women to grant him their backing, it would go a long way to winning the army's loyalty and undermining O'Duffy's position."

 ireland.3050.d: "Newly emboldened by the growing influence of Aontas Náisiúnta over Irish society, the voice of the Catholic priest Fr. Denis Fahey has only become louder and louder in recent months. Fahey, who is based in [GetVictoryPointName_11293], was already a prolific writer of books, pamphlets and letters, but now has also begun to write articles in various AN-aligned publications. Fahey is a fanatical believer in the idea that Jews are the Satan-like enemies of Christ and Syndicalism is their weapon against him. Fahey is also a total opponent of Liberalism, both socially and economically, and is enthralled by the concept of Integralism.\n\nAlthough Fahey is not a particularly high-ranking member of the clergy, it is always a boon to any political movement in Ireland to have visible supporters amongst the Priesthood, and AN have been keen to exploit the presence of Fahey amongst their ranks. This development, alongside Fahey's raging anti-Semitism, has been a cause of great discomfort amongst the Catholic hierarchy in Ireland, even hardline conservatives.\n\nFahey, fluent in French, German, and Italian and in contact with many Integralist groups on the continent, has been able to help provide somewhat of an intellectual underpinning to the Ó Cuinneagáin wing of AN. Almost all of Fahey's arguments inevitably accuse Jews of being the root problem, and in turn, Fahey's open and proud anti-Semitism has spread amongst the ranks of AN supporters.\n\nFor opponents of AN, the addition of Fahey is yet more evidence of their unhinged and conspiratorial ultra-Catholic zealotry."

But now, with preparations for a new and truly republican Constitution, unlike the previous one crafted by the sell-out Collins, completed, a semblance of majority rule has been restored, albeit with the levers of power firmly under the grip of AN so as to inhibit the anti-national elements who would seek to deceive the Irish people for their unpatriotic ends.\n\nLooking back with regret on their past embrace of authoritarian measures, and perceiving the formation of a broad alliance against the government as the only way of effectively opposing it, Sinn Féin have moderated on their previously strict law-and-order stance and merged with the National Development Party, many of whose members had been Sinn Féin TDs before leaving in response to Collins' increasingly iron fist. Were it up to the tyranny of the mob common to most democratic governments, the reunited Sinn Féin along with their loyalist cohorts could prove a serious contender to the AN-SC coalition, but fortunately the establishment's safeguards will make certain that the Irish Republic remains in the right hands."

O'Duffy now governs the Republic by decree, akin to the absolute monarchies of old. However, even in the modern age no man can truly rule alone, and as such he has made the decision to select a second-in-command to serve as his top advisor and potential successor. Two figures have emerged as the main contenders for the position, one coming from the party, and the other from those Blueshirts who have remained loyal to the general.\n\nThe first is John J. O'Kelly, the deputy leader of AN, who has played a key role in Irish politics for decades since Sinn Féin's establishment. A fervent Catholic and advocate for Ireland's native culture and language with many connections to other parties, he has proved essential in keeping the regime afloat through his able politicking. The other, Ned Cronin, is a former officer who left the military to co-found the National Guard, designing their iconic azure-shirted uniform. Though side-lined as their ranks fell sway to radicalism, through his loyalty during Ó Cuinneagáin's rebellion he managed to assert his control over the paramilitary in the aftermath. What Cronin lacks in ideals he makes up for with his straight-forward, soldierly mindset, concerning himself not with grand schemes but with organisation and discipline."

 ireland.3200.t: "Trial of the General"
 ireland.3200.d: "From the moment the integralist rising against O'Duffy had begun, Ó Cuinneagáin had intended to dispose of the former general for standing in the way of his ambitions. Although the IRA had sided with Ó Cuinneagáin, to them O'Duffy was still held in high esteem as a war hero, even if they had come agree that he was not fit for government. To immediately execute O'Duffy would turn the Ceannaire's military backers against him. It was fortunate that rumours of sodomy came up as they readied for his trial, with investigators not only finding proof of O'Duffy attending the notorious parties of Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards (a known homophilic couple) but also uncovering several men prepared to testify that the general had made sexual advances towards them.\n\nThe key witness was Mac Liammóir (born Alfred Willmore in London, before assuming an Irish identity) who was taken into questioning and threatened with the death penalty. If Mac Liammóir and Edwards did not testify against O'Duffy, they were told they would be tried on suspicion of being sodomites and British spies. Under such pressure, he agreed to provide evidence and anonymous testimony against O'Duffy, and in exchange, the authorities allowed the two to be released, with their practicing of buggery and Mac Liammóir's English birth allowed to remain secret in light of his contributions to the revival of the Irish language.\n\nO'Duffy's remaining supporters denounced the accusations as slander designed to denigrate an Irish patriot and justify his execution, likening them to the infamous Black Diaries that legitimised the demise of Roger Casement at the hands of the British. Nonetheless, the revelations had the desired effect in weakening the army's sympathy for the general. As such, after a swift court case Eoin O'Duffy was convicted of sodomy, and most important of all, treason against the Irish nation, and sentenced to death by firing squad, with little objection."

 ireland.3210.t: "Ríocht nó Leasríocht?"
 ireland.3210.d: "For millenia, the natural form of government of the Gaels was not the foreign import of republicanism, but rather rule by kings, who answered to a High King. The O'Neills, descended from the legendary Niall of the Nine Hostages and among the oldest and most noble dynasties in Europe, were one of the greatest Irish royal houses to hold the title, and following the English invasion were at the helm of many uprisings against their rule. Most notable of these was the Nine Years' War, which though close-run tragically ended with defeat at Kinsale, and Hugh O'Neill's exile to continental Europe in the Flight of the Earls, leading to the establishment of England's total control over the island for the ruinous centuries to follow.\n\nDespite generations having passed, the heirs to this illustrious lineage still live on as nobility in the Kingdom of Portugal, where the grandfather of current claimant Jorge Maria O'Neill was recognised as the Count of Tyrone and head of the House of O'Neill by the Pope, along with the Spanish and Portuguese crowns. The combination of the connection with Lusitanian integralism and the dynasty's glorious history makes them an ideal choice for restoration, symbolising the great resurgence of the rightful Gaelic order in Ireland after hundreds of years of tyranny.\n\nOn the other hand, in spite of the populace's somewhat favourable image of the Kaiser and the fall of Britain's royalty, republican ideals remain influential. Even inside Aontas Náisiúnta there exist some who are devoted to the revival of Irish civilisation but are nonetheless sceptical of monarchy. Furthermore, it could not be guaranteed that O'Neill would see eye-to-eye with AN on all matters. As such, Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin, an autocratic micromanager at heart, has pondered the idea of continuing to govern as regent while slowly de-republicanising public attitudes and readying the ground for the coronation of a true Gaelic sovereign."

 ireland.3220.t: "I Lár na Tíre"
 ireland.3220.d: "For centuries Ireland's biggest city has been Dublin, or Baile Átha Cliath in Irish, situated on the halfway down the east coast of the island at the mouth of the River Liffey. Originating from two settlements, one the Gaelic settlement of Áth Cliath, from which its Irish name is derived, and the other the Viking settlement of Dyflin, it remained for long periods under Norse-Gael rule, but gradually came under the suzerainty of the Irish kings, and by the late 11th century was considered a de-facto Irish capital. Following the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1169, it became a stronghold of English and later British imperial control in Ireland, gaining the moniker \"The Pale\".\n\nThe negative association of this latter period has stuck around, both in jest and often in earnest, with many regarding the city as a hive of Anglophiles and feeling resentment towards its percieved economic and political dominance over the rest of the country, and with the integralists' top priority being the deanglicisation and decentralisation of the state, Ó Cuinneagáin has sought to move the capital to a location more worthy of being the beating heart of the nation.\n\nAccordingly, several plans were drawn up to achieve this. The first, promoted by AN's mainstream factions, would seek to develop Baile Átha Luain, or Athlone, a town in the very centre of the island, which began as a fort built by a former High King, into the national seat of government. The second, a more radical proposal from the young architect Daithí Ó hÁinle, advocated building a new city at the Hill of Tara. However, due to Ó hÁinle's youth, the stretched resources of the regime given their already ambitious schemes to modernise the country, and a desire by traditionalists to prevent the ancient heritage of Tara from being desecrated by urbanisation, the moderates' plan won out. Baile Átha Luain would be the capital of the resurrected Irish kingdom, uniting the four provinces of the Emerald Isle."

Although previous administrations had paid lip service to the native tongue of the Gael, they went little further than that, and Ó Cuinneagáin is determined to change this to ensure the return of Ireland's distinct culture to its former glory. Already the government has commenced measures gaelicising the names of all citizens, place names and streets on the island, overhauling teaching, and promoting the language in media and the military.\n\nNonetheless, Irish faces stiff competition with the dominance of English and the rising lingua franca of German, and so, noting that English was forced on the Irish people through coercion, and that the same is needed if Irish is to be revived, the government has introduced incentives and positive discrimination to reward those who demonstrate fluency in the language, while penalising those who refuse to acquire it. This is only the beginning of the regime's plans, and long-terms have been drawn up that would see all official business transitioning purely to Irish, the removal over time of all civil servants still not fluent, and even an eventual ban on using English in public altogether.\n\nWhile effective in motivating learning among AN's diehard followers who have begun to form a new elite, these decrees have been met with protests by many members of the populace. However, Ó Cuinneagáin has no intention whatsoever of backing down under any circumstances, redoubling on his propaganda efforts encouraging the citizenry to learn the language and taking advantage of the red scare to brand those opposed to the strict revival programme as West Britons and syndicalists. Though it may take much effort, in time it will pay off, as Ireland shall once again be able to stand with pride alongside its brothers in the family of European nations, no longer a country without a soul."

 ireland.3240.t: "Closing the Ports"
 ireland.3240.d: "For as long as the Gaels have existed, so has migration. The very forefathers of the Gaelic race originated from Iberia, and Hibernian monks carried out their holy endeavours across Europe at the height of Irish civilisation. After the English conquest, many nobles and commoners alike sought refuge on the continent during the 16th and 17th centuries. But it was the so-called famine of the 1840s that did the most damage, halving the Irish population through a combination of mass death and exile, and creating a culture of emigration that would see the island's demographics unremittingly decrease for nearly a century afterwards.\n\nIt would take the improvement of Ireland's economic situation following the nation's entry into Mitteleuropa, and the fall of America and Britain into chaos and revolution respectively to bring this lengthy decline to an end, though some would continue to emigrate to the likes of Canada and Germany. The flow of people leaving the isle would lessen further during Black Monday, due to the global nature of the crisis. However, as a result of dissatisfaction with the integralist government and recovering financial circumstances elsewhere, Ireland now faces another wave of emigrants.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin has denounced such exiles as "péistí", meaning "worms" in English, accusing them of deserting their native land and harbouring syndicalist sympathies. Acting to stem the tide of migrants, the coast guard has been placed on patrol to halt any illegal rafts fleeing the island, and a series of harsh decrees proclaimed requiring Irish citizens to seek approval from the state before departing from the country or returning from abroad. Said permission is only to be granted under stringent conditions, and a severe sentence is to be imposed for unauthorised travel. Through these decisive measures, the authorities hope to prevent a brain drain and ensure that Irish demographics will soon rise back to their pre-famine heights."

 ireland.3250.d: "In the months since the integralists opted to close the ports in response to increasing numbers of emigrants, they had come to learn the hard way why previous governments, Irish and British alike, had been willing to endorse the \"safety valve\" of emigration, as it was known, as a means of dealing with dissent and unemployment. Not only has a lack of opportunities at home for the unemployed, with no ability to seek employment abroad, resulted in a reported rise of antisocial behaviour, but cases of protest, sabotage and even murder by opponents of the regime are additionally on the upswing, in spite of the special powers afforded to the Gardaí and secret services to firmly clamp down on such traitorous activities. Worse yet, occasionally those attempting to flee the island have resorted to seeking refuge in the embassies of other European nations, harming Irish international relations by bringing foreign attention to government repression.\n\nWishing to contain the situation and avoid further destabilisation, Ó Cuinneagáin has reluctantly made the decision, after much heated debate with his cabinet, to compromise on his harsh decrees restricting migration by loosening the requirements, while making sure the state would still retain the power to decide who specifically they wished to permit to leave. This would allow for the explusion of social undesirables via boatlift to Great Britain or continental Europe, reducing crime and political opposition, while continuing to limit leaving for the more valuable members of the nation, ensuring that a brain drain or another decline in Irish demographics is averted. Nonetheless, this undeniably represents a setback for the administration and its ambition of raising Ireland's population back to its pre-famine heights."

But not anymore.\n\nNow, however, with a truly nationally-minded government in power, that all looks set to change. Many of the loudest voices calling for a restoration of the games come from within the party, and Ó Cuinneagáin himself is highly sympathetic to the idea. Rather than just restore the games, however, Ó Cuinneagáin wishes to pursue the thorough restructuring of Irish sport.\n\nFrom henceforth, all imported degenerate sports, or \"Garrison Games\" (so not just \"soccer\", but also rugby and cricket) are to be banned, to allow the increased thriving of Gaelic games of all kinds. As well as this, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) will be expanded in scope, with a formal event finalising these changes to be held in the coming weeks."

His models for an independent Brittany include the revolutionary zeal of the Irish and the discipline of Prussian militarism, and so he regards Ó Cuinneagáin's integralist administration highly for managing to combine both in his eyes.\n\nAlthough a few are somewhat hesitant to accept this offer given the potential implications for relations with the French government-in-exile and the long history of positive Franco-Irish bonds, even if the two nations found themselves on opposite sides of the Weltkrieg, the majority are more than happy to welcome the assistance of a fellow Celtic patriot."

Following the announcement, crowds of tens of thousands would throng the Hill of Tara in astonishment at the momentous occasion that was the first inauguration of an Irish sovereign at the sacred Lia Fáil in centuries, though tight security was also deployed to ward off any would-be assassination attempts.\n\nThe ceremony began as King Aodh, having taken the Irish translation of his father's name as his regnal name, and his wife Josefina Luísa Roquette Ricciardi, or Queen Seosaimhín, arrived alongside Ó Cuinneagáin and an entourage of ministers, clergy, military men, Gaelic nobles, and other notables. Standing at the Lia Fáil, the King delivered a speech in the Irish he had learned in the time since his arrival on the isle, if in a marked Portuguese accent, swearing to uphold the Christian faith and values of Ireland's ancient Gaelic culture held by his valiant ancestors.\n\nAfter this address, Aodh was anointed by Archbishop Mac Ruaidhrí, while Psalms and hymns in honour of Christ and St. Colmcille were sung for the success of the Kingdom. Finally, he was awarded the slat na ríghe, a white sceptre symbolising the purity and straightness of justice, and crowned by the Archbishop. As the ceremony came to a close and the new King and Queen left Tara along with their retinue, an army band triumphantly played the national anthem and the Marcshlua Uí Néill, while the sun shone bright in the distance as if representing the civilisation of the Gael taking its place in the glow of day once more."

The Aontas Náisiúnta regime has decided to incorporate these territories into a unified Gaelic nation, no longer to be culturally persecuted by the English or the Lowland Scots."

 ireland.3400.d: "Although the ranks of the once internally fractured Aontas Náisiúnta establishment have been stabilised via the decisive end of its inner conflicts, the consequences of the Bloody Saturday massacre and its violent aftermath still continue to reverberate throughout Ulster, particularly in the six counties, as the Ulster Volunteer Force grows increasingly strong among Protestants outraged at what they perceive as the regime's cruel and repressive actions against their community.\n\nUnfortunately, the distraction of the integralist rising had severe repercussions for the situation in the north, as loyalist militants eagerly took advantage of the military's turned backs to take control of their local communities and weaken the state's command over the province. Complicating matters further is the fact that some northern Catholics also sadly remain wary of [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], given their betrayal by liberal democratic West British governments prior to AN's ascendance, and within the community many also sympathise with the traitors rooted out from AN rather than the victors.\n\nIf the administration is not only to live up to its promises of ensuring stability but to truly consolidate its power and be recognised internationally as Ireland's legitimate government without question, then restoring order in the north will be beyond essential. By the carrot and the stick, loyalist insurgents must be subdued, and Ulster's Catholics won over and reassured that AN is looking out for their interests, lest the continuing deterioration of national authority in the province lead to a loyalist rebellion, whose potential success would have devastating results for not only the regime but Ireland as a whole."

As Pádraig Pearse once said, \"always it is the many who fight for the evil thing, and the few who fight for the good thing.\"\n\nHowever, although only few can be great, General Eoin O'Duffy has shown that the great can emerge from anywhere, having risen to heights well above what one familiar with his origins would expect, with his cult of personality spreading as he has become revered as a hero on the level of Ireland's revolutionary martyrs. Even when attending a GAA match, keeping in touch with his old sporting passion before the days of the War of Independence, the general's mere presence is met with excitement and acclaim by players and spectators alike, no more true than in O'Duffy's home province of Ulster, and the same holds true among the Gardaí and military men whom he once had direct command over.\n\nWhere once the Irish were depicted as a disorderly and undisciplined rabble by sneering British propagandists, the falsehood of that view has been revealed as crime and foreign degeneracy is mercilessly stamped out, the love of faith and fatherland instilled in the populace, and those anti-national elements, whether imperialist or syndicalist, whose allegiances still lie with Britain are put in their rightful place. As O'Duffy himself matches his mastery of the country with self-mastery as he works to moderate his drinking habit, devoting his time instead to fulfilling Ireland's august destiny, the Irish people can rest assured that so long as the General is at the helm, the fate of Ireland is without doubt in as good hands as it has ever been throughout the island's long and turbulent history."

 ireland.3525.d: "Although Irish workers and small farmers triumphed over the reactionary military coup, and sent its organisers fleeing with their tail between their legs to their masters in Berlin, they have not yet reached the end of their troubles with the forces of reaction. Ireland has long been a particularly conservative and anti-socialist nation, with socialism having little following and facing much hostility despite James Connolly's famous involvement in the Easter Rising, and while the aftermath of Black Monday and British influence managed to change that to a degree, there still exists deeply entrenched antipathy to syndicalism across the island among all sections of Irish society.\n\nThe new government has already received reports of attacks on the Irish Citizen Army in rural areas from Blueshirts who claim to be fighting a \"second War of Independence against the British\", along with major resistance and denunciation from established institutions such as the civil service and the Catholic Church. Such opposition has naturally been especially severe in the province of Ulster, where not only are loyalists who previously acquiesced to Irish reunification only out of anti-syndicalism appalled by this turn of events, now sympathising with the UVF, but Catholics too are by-and-large very suspicious of syndicalism, having been courted prior largely by the right.\n\nThis state of affairs has not been helped by the regime's current dependence on the Union of Britain, which has been eagerly used in anti-syndicalist propaganda by the state's bourgeois foes, but if it is to survive in the long-term it must be able to stand on its own feet, independent of its neighbour's aid by building up its legitimacy in the eyes of the Irish people while rooting out counter-revolutionary elements both north and south. However some note that achieving the latter may alienate the former, and a question increasingly being asked is, how far are they willing to go to bring about those ends?"

This resistance took the form of larger scale unrest in the urban areas, and more localised pockets dotted throughout rural areas across the island.\n\nThe actions of the ICA in dampening down the larger-scale elements of resistance, in the more urban areas in particular, are beginning to show dividends. The more overtly violent resistance has been quashed, and even the more insidious forms of passive resistance are showing signs of beginning to falter.\n\nThe people are finally beginning to realise, even if they do not admit it, that the new government is here to stay, and is one and only government of Ireland. Through force of arms and force of words, the larger-scale resistance has been reduced down to almost nothing, and once the final decisive blow has been dealt, the more smaller-scale localised opposition will scatter away like dust in the wind."

The integralist bandits have been hunted down, but non-armed opposition to the regime has been met with a more measured response. The aims of his party remain the same — the complete control of the state and its people — but the initial methods employed have proved more difficult for his opponents to counter than anticipated. Little-by-little, much of the apparatus of state, the media and the clergy has been quietly replaced, coerced and controlled, contrary to the expectations of the party's enemies, who expected a more forceful affair.\n\n$ireland.3600.d.mid$ despite being $ireland.3600.d.midlate$ the veteran trade unionist Jim Larkin, the ageing leader gave a blustering speech on the potential dangers of $ireland.3600.d.end$, and did not truly have the interests of the Irish people at heart. In a damning but almost droll indictment to the Irish Trades Union Congress, O'Donnell thoroughly discredited Larkin, and how detrimental and alienating his massive industrialisation policies would be to the Irish working class. With his position secure, the Cathaoirleach intends now to put his master plan in motion, and harness nationalist sentiment to steadily centralise the power of the party, bringing along the people without them even realising."
 ireland.3600.d2: "$ireland.3600.d.start$ Peadar O'Donnell's decisive actions have resulted in such reactionary activities being harshly cracked down upon. The integralist bandits have been hunted down, hostile newspapers muzzled, the civil service newly staffed with a cadre of loyal socialists, and only the most outspoken and fervent anti-syndicalists even among the clergy dare to speak against the regime. However, these authoritarian measures have unfortunately managed to alienate the opinions of the Irish working class, who, having opposed and overthrown one autocratic dictatorship already, have no desire to bow down to another.\n\n$ireland.3600.d.mid$ although previously $ireland.3600.d.midlate$ the renowned Jim Larkin, the long-serving trade unionist utilised his still powerful speeches to rally the populace and the unions against $ireland.3600.d.end$, but to no avail as the Irish Trades Union Congress issued a vote of no confidence against O'Donnell's chairmanship, bringing the Cathaoirleach down in favour of Larkin and the ISP. Breaking from SÉ's hardline policies and love-hate relationship with Britain, Larkin, having studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, intends to follow not only the inspiration of the French as the United Irishmen did, but also the true vision of the fallen martyr James Connolly."
 ireland.3600.d3: "$ireland.3600.d.start$ the new regime found itself under fire from all directions, particularly in rural Ireland. These conservative heartlands were shocked to see Labour's original coalition elected in the first instance, and if O'Brien's original government could only barely be tolerated, then its more radical offspring was surely a step too far.\n\nThough pockets of resistance remain in these areas, what has ameliorated the situation in the rest of the country has been the more parliamentary character of the new regime in question. What was once the Progressive Labour Party, now dissolved back into what could be called the \"mainstream\" Labour Party, has its image etched into the new regime, and it is a regime that would seek to unite rather than to divide. The new government has been open with the people, acknowledging the reality of Ireland's new geopolitical alignment, but within reason it has made every effort so far to maintain as many aspects of the old administration as is practicable.\n\nRuling through consensus, the party has negotiated with the ICA, the unions, and old coalition members, including the rump dissidents of the Labour Party, attempting to build tolerance, if not yet support for the new regime. Their immediate aim is to form a new governmental system that works, and that lasts, within the obvious constraint that Ireland is in the Third Internationale.\n\nIn place of nationalist rhetoric and dogmatic ideology, Ireland will attempt to retain the old as well as introduce the new. The more hardline reactionaries must be dealt with decisively, but leniency and discourse with other political opponents will do more than violence could to bring them alongside. Pragmatism is the order of the day, for if the Republic is to become a Socialist one, let it be done with as little fuss as possible."

O'Donnell, initially willing and eager to accept foreign aid to help declare the socialist republic, nonetheless has now entirely secured the rule of his party using only Irish arms and Irish words.\n\nSaor Éire's beliefs are that the land, power, wealth and entirety of Ireland itself must belong solely to the Irish people. To achieve this, the party is a necessary organ of the people, and through the party, the people can begin to control their destinies. The state, the party, and the people must each unite, and be armed and ready to defend Ireland's freedom at all costs. Critics would decry the completely undue control of the lives of the republic's citizens that Saor Éire demands, but such voices are now silenced and marginalised.\n\nThe impassioned but understated O'Donnell speaks with a thick Donegal accent, more at home conversing in Irish than in English, and is quite content with his title of Cathaoirleach, or Chairman. His upbringing in one of the most impoverished and remote parts of the island shaped his desire for its utter transformation, particularly for the benefit of the rural poor. As a leader, despite the massive control afforded to the party, he serves more of a figurehead to the senior party members than an autocrat. But nonetheless he now leads the state and the party, and embodies its intense and fervent desire for the formation of a truly Free Ireland."
 ireland.3625.d2: "At the centre of the new regime stands the imposing figure of Jim Larkin, the closest thing that Ireland has to charisma personified. Larkin, who is already considered something of an icon to syndicalist movements worldwide, has been involved in industrial syndicalism itself for decades, even at a time long before the Weltkrieg when it was not the predominant form of socialism, starting from when he studied De Leonism in his youth.\n\nThe title of Cathaoirleach, or Chairman, in some ways suits him poorly, as Larkin scarcely has time to sit, with his unceasing moving, agitating and organising. Belying his thick Liverpudlian accent, Larkin is a diehard Irish nationalist, and came to the fore first in Ireland over thirty years ago for his decision to split his union from its British equivalent as \"Irish workers need Irish unions.\" He later magnified his reputation with the Dublin Lockout of 1913, one of the largest and longest strikes in Europe at the time.\n\nBig Jim's presence is more experienced than observed, with his considerable stature and the theatricality of his thundering speeches going far in stirring up the people, and building him something of a personality cult, something that he does little to discourage.\n\nThe shadow of Connolly will forever lie over the syndicalist movement in Ireland, but Larkin is eager to prove himself in his remaining years, and leave a lasting legacy that will never be upstaged."
 ireland.3625.d3: "The President, William O'Brien, has had a difficult few months. From ruling as the elected leader of the country in a time of national crisis, to being overthrown in a military coup, and to being put back in a position of the same name by the Union of Britain, even if an entirely different and lesser role, it has been a time of radical change for a moderate-minded trade unionist. However, rather than struggling to come to terms with what was likely to be his complete political humiliation, O'Brien has used all his powers to ensure that the fate intended for him shall not come to pass.\n\nO'Brien has made himself indispensible to RN Tweedy, and other former entryists into the Progressive Labour Party, who had plotted the Second Revolution from within government. He acts as a link to those outside of the party or even the left, as they are aware of his initially unwilling participation in the British-sponsored regime, and see him as far more favourable to work with than the likes of O'Donnell or Larkin.\n\nIn exchange for opening up these channels of communication and very slowly building acknowledgement of the new regime across the political sphere, O'Brien has begun to ever so subtly influence the ruling cadre's policies. He is eager to ensure that even though Ireland's revolution was built on British arms, it will not remain so that way. And if Ireland is to be socialist, he must do what he can to ensure it is on its own terms."

He has emerged as a key figure in the aftermath of the Second Irish Revolution, and one who has been crucial in the underground work of the ICA for many years.\n\nWhite comes from a privileged military background that is typical of the upper class of Ulster Protestants. He was educated in the prestigious military academy at Sandhurst, describing it as the place where he learned most of \"fortification and fornication\". The Second Boer War was his crucible, where he took part in many battles, was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order, but it is also where he developed his loathing of the British establishment.\n\nAfter the war, he served as aide-de-camp to his father who was Governor of Gibraltar, during which time he met both the King and Kaiser. But in the end, it would be Ireland that he served, as his eventual return home resulted in him abandoning the usual beliefs of his background, going from unionist, to Home Ruler, to republican and finally to socialist.\n\nWhite left the ICA just before the Rising due to disagreements in its organisation, and spent the War of Independence in the political wilderness. However, the revolutions occurring since the Weltkrieg have inspired him to once more take up arms in the name of Ireland. With his aristocratic background, dapper appearance, and flamboyant air, combined with anti-authoritarian, anti-clerical semi-anarchistic Christian socialist ideals, this misfit is crucial to the consolidation and continuation of the socialist republic."

With the dust settling in Ireland, and a friendly socialist government in Dublin, Dorman-Smith has taken the opportunity to propose that he serve with the Irish army as a commanding officer and \"advisor\" on military strategy, bringing them up to scratch with the modern methods of warfare employed by our own army. But it has been quickly speculated that Dorman-Smith's intentions are hardly out of international solidarity, but rather a desire to return his ancestral home of County Cavan in Ulster, Ireland. Likewise, Dorman-Smith has allegedly ruffled feathers within the army owing to his \"sin\" of simply being too clever, and being intolerant of those not on his intellectual calibre, a fact he is prone to show. Such antagonism has not made Dorman-Smith many friends, and he perhaps sees a fresh start abroad as a \"sink or swim\" moment.\n\nThe proposal has garnered a mixed reaction in the military, with some officers being suspiciously supportive of the move, though dissent has emerged. Edmund Ironside, commander of the RTC, and leading military theorist, Basil Liddell-Hart, have both commented that it would be a \"waste\" to send Dorman-Smith to serve in an army with significantly less resources, and a likely inability to make full use of Dorman-Smith's expertise. Still, the proposal has gained a political edge, with it being put forward that agreeing to the secondment would be both a show of trust to Ireland, and a welcome acknowlegement of them as partners rather than subordinants. We could of course block the proposal if we feel Dorman-Smith would be more useful at his post in the British Army. The prospect of promotion will likely tide him over."

Given that this would not have been possible without the assistance from [ENG.GetNameDef], it is no surprise that correspondence has been frequent. Today's message brings good news — the British Army has decided to send one of their eminient generals on secondment to its Irish namesake, a man none other than County Cavan native, Eric Dorman Smith.\n\nDorman-Smith, who has stated his intention to adopt the Irish form of his name, is seen as a rising star in the British Army. His Anglo-Irish background meant that his chosen career comes as no surprise, in contrast to his extremely modern and unorthodox views on the future of direction of warfare. Prior to the British revolution, his outspoken critique of the tactics associated with the old establishment rubbed up much of the top brass the wrong way, but the past few years has seen his theories gain more traction and renown.\n\nWith Britain and Ireland now in firm alliance, he can combine his support of Irish republicanism with his position in the British Army, and personally requested this temporary secondment to his native country. He is well aware that his theorems on the greater use of technology and mobilisation in warfare may be easier put into practice with a larger armed force, but for Dorman O'Gowan, the newly re-energised revolutionary atmosphere in Ireland was just too much to say no to."

 ireland.3900.t: "Tear It Down!"
 ireland.3900.d1: "With Ireland now a part of the Internationale - and a partner to Britain - an unusual political issue has emerged: Oliver Cromwell. Thankfully the infamous general has not returned from the grave, but Irish politicians at home have raised the hypocrisy of Britain pledging its support to Ireland on the world stage yet glorifying a butcher of the Irish people at home. Since their revolution in 1925, the new British republic has drawn many a connection between its own polity and the Commonwealth of old with Cromwell entering a revered place that was once occupied by Kings and Queens of old. Naturally, this has caused notable resentment in Ireland and considerable embarrassment to John Maffey, the long-running British ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAs the issue has grown in notoriety, particular ire has been levelled at the so-called \"Five Great Statues\" of Cromwell, spread around the country, which have long since become places of display for admiration Cromwell. Popular demands have called on the British to tear them down at last, and end their veneration of a glorified military dictator who massacred innocents in the name of conquest. With the issue becoming increasingly to large to ignore, Maffey has assured the government that he will raise the issue back in London, but has warned that there will likely be considerable resistance from the British government that will have a tough time spinning the issue but may, hopefully, appreciate the international propaganda victory here."
 ireland.3900.d2: "A curious request has been forwarded to Whitehall from our ambassador in Ireland, John Maffey: the bringing down of the Five Statues of Oliver Cromwell that dot the nation. Wythenshawe of Manchester; Warrington of Cheshire; Bradford city Hall; St. Ives of Cambridge and Westminster Palace are all home to a statue of the former Lord Protector, a figure of considerable veneration in modern British lore and propaganda. Seen as a spiritual predecessor to the modern republic, and long an object of praise by the Labour Party for the Regicide and his \"clearing\" of the Lords, Cromwell is admired and often invoked by many British politicians while holding a special place as a sort of pseudo-folk hero among the populace. But while in Britain it is a national habit to focus on the glorious Commonwealth founded upon his labours, the British discourse often glosses over his actions in Ireland which can not be seen as anything other than murderous.\n\nSuch veneration, and the supposed hypocrisy of venerating Cromwell at home while pledging our support and solidarity to Ireland abroad, has finally become too much to bear for the Irish government, and they have made a formal request that we remove the statues of Cromwell and look to idolise someone else. While there's certainly no shortage of radical British heroes to sit on Cromwell's plinth outside Congressional Hall, the proposal has nevertheless sparked consternation among the political class with some ministers balking at such a proposal, and pledging they will not feel \"guilty\" for Britain's past. But in the end, cooler heads will take the lead and it has been proposed that rather than topple all the statues, we simply remove some. The Westminster statue has been deemed totally off limits due to its architectural and political importance, but the others are of less concern. Still, while this will certainly appease the Irish and boost our image in their eyes, native Britons will hardly be happy at seeing their Lord Protector toppled."
 ireland.3900.a: "Down with the Murderer!"
 ireland.3900.b: "Unfortunately, we can't change the past..."
 ireland.3900.c: "Make arrangements to remove the surplus statues, they're better served in a museum."

 ireland.3950.t.isp: "The Successor of Connolly"
 ireland.3950.t.plp: "The Irish Road to Socialism"
 ireland.3950.d: "[IRE_loc_capstone_event_desc]"
 ireland.3950.d.se: "Since Irish republicanism's earliest days, when its father Wolfe Tone favoured the Jacobins in Revolutionary France and sided with the men of no property against the men of property, the struggle for the rights of the common labourer and farmer has always been a core part of the Irish cause alongside the national struggle. The Fenians and the Irish workers who established Soviets across the island during War of Independence carried on this tradition, yet so quick were bourgeois nationalists to turn their back on the proletariat the moment they saw the opportunity despite the promises of the Democratic Programme, leaving the isle, as James Connolly predicted, still bound by the institutions of capital to foreign powers.\n\nThe true ideals of the Irish revolutionary spirit could not be denied for long, and with Peadar O'Donnell, the organiser of the Monaghan Soviet and now the organiser of the Irish Socialist Republic, at the helm, Ireland has become a land in which all are equal and unified by their fervent love for both socialism and their fatherland. For O'Donnell and his followers, socialism and nationalism are inextriciably linked rather than, as some have tried to claim, intrinsically opposed, for even if often corrupted by reactionaries, it is at heart a progressive force born in opposition to the empires who sought to erase all cultures and nations not their own.\n\nWhile the Cathaoirleach, although vested with great authority, acts not as a despot but as a guide for the country, his influence over the party and thus the state is undeniable. A cultured man known for his novels regarding the plight of his home county's rural poor, O'Donnell sees culture, including the revival of the Irish language, as a battlefield against capitalism, and just as his writings emphasised the power of local communities to stand up against those who would tyrannise them, the broader community of the Irish nation are united under the Red Trinity and willing to sacrifice all to ensure the horrors of Ireland's past shall never again be repeated."
 ireland.3950.d.isp: "If the last century of Ireland's past has proven anything, it is that the Irish people look for charisma in those they revere as their leaders. From Daniel O'Connell to Charles Stewart Parnell to Pádraig Pearse to Michael Collins, their silver tongues stood out as key reasons that the masses flocked to their banner. Yet none of those men with their moderate natures could hope to match the throngs of crowds that turn out for the electrifying speeches of Jim Larkin, who since the time of the Dublin Lockout has worked to protect the Irish proletariat from not only the evils of capitalism and imperialism, but in the aftermath of the Second Irish Revolution from O'Donnell and his totalitarian lackeys.\n\nDefying the false claims of right-wing propagandists who portrayed the isle's syndicalists as atheistic British puppets who would usher in an era of utter tyranny, Jim Larkin has strived to ensure nothing less than the freedom of the Irish worker to live a life that is their own under the syndicalist structures of the new Republic, as he both theorised having been a syndicalist long before the Weltkrieg, and later saw first hand in France studying at the Sorbonne. Accusations of godlessness could also not be more untrue, as for Larkin the Christian faith and socialist beliefs have no contradiction, with the man proudly stating that for him the Bible and Das Kapital are both Holy books.\n\nHaving fulfilled the vision of his fallen friend, James Connolly, of a socialist Ireland, Larkin has done much to elevate his place in Irish historiography. Whereas the role of James Connolly and the Irish Citizen Army had been downplayed in the history books during the anti-syndicalist atmosphere of post-independence Ireland, now the opposite has occurred, with Connolly's legacy overshadowing all other Irish revolutionaries, with the exception, of course, of the Cathaoirleach who made the dream of an Ireland liberated from colonialism and capital a reality."
 ireland.3950.d.plp: "The Irish state which has emerged from what some describe as the \"Second Irish Revolution\", though whether such a term is an accurate depiction is hotly debated, finds itself in an odd position in comparison to many of the syndicalist revolutions elsewhere, having coming about in defence of an existing parliamentary order and still maintaining continuity in its structures from the previous regime. More than a few would argue that this unique Irish state of affairs is only natural, for the events were in truth simply a re-assertion of the Irish Republic's socialist promises in the Democratic Programme which had been hitherto abandoned by counter-revolutionaries.\n\nThe end result of these twists and turns has been the establishment of a socialist republic based not on the dominance of one particular faction, but rather on a consensus arrived at between the island's various left-wing forces. Although detractors would attack the government as being too middle-of-the-road, supporters would counter that the implementation of socialism should adapt to local conditions, and this compromise suits the desires of Irish workers better than a system where the path to syndicalism is forced by a vanguard imposing their will on the populace.\n\nThese compromises have demanded much of William O'Brien, a moderate socialist who has only with deep reluctance accepted his country's alignment with the syndicalist bloc, and Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, who too in light of his pacifist views has regretted Irish military involvement in the Second Weltkrieg, despite its necessity. However, both reformists can agree that as Ireland makes leaps and bounds of progress both economically and socially that a decade ago were impossible in a hopelessly conservative nation compared to its European peers, these trade-offs have proven more than worth it as the isle advances into a future where none shall ever again know the horrors of war or capitalist exploitation, while retaining the parliamentary democracy envisioned by the founders of the Republic."

 ireland.4500.d1: "An interesting proposal has been received this morning from the small nation of Ireland, requesting an economic investment from our nation. With many investors still shaken by the aftermath of Black Monday and the conflict in America, the Irish wish to present Dublin as a new stable home for international business and commerce.\n\nIf this promise of stability holds true, establishing new branches of [Root.GetAdjective] businesses in Ireland's capital may prove to be a mutually beneficial endeavour for all involved parties. It is important however to take into consideration that this upfront cost may not pay off in the long run, and so an informed decision be made as to how we should respond."
 ireland.4500.d2: "A very unusual proposal has arrived this morning through the medium of diplomats sent by the small nation of Ireland. Despite the obvious conflict between the capitalist nature of their regime and the socialist vision of [Root.GetNameDef] they still have chosen to request [Root.GetAdjective] investment in Dublin as part of their attempts to build an international hub of business and investment.\n\nWhile involvement in a capitalist scheme such as this would normally be alien to a socialist nation, a state ran trading corporation could still be established to facilitate business with the Irish and improve relations with them. The decision on if this is worth the trouble however must now be made."

The Irish economy will particularly benefit from another competitor in the ever-growing automotive industry."
 ireland.4550.d.BEL: "The trade delegation sent to [BEL.GetNameDef] has come back successful with a deal from the chemical and pharmaceutical company \"Solvay\". Ireland's economy is lacking in this area and Solvay's Dublin office will be a great addition to Ireland's growing business portfolio and could perhaps be the start to a massive expansion of pharmaceutical manufacturing in Ireland. This office will particularly be of great benefit to the growing number of university graduates with qualifications in the pharmacological and chemical sciences."

Following a round of talks, the state owned armaments factory \"VMZ Sopot\" has agreed to open a branch in Dublin to help facilitate trade and shipping routes to Western and Central Europe. With conflict never being far away, the armaments industry is often a stable one, and this should bring another source of steady employment for Irish workers for years to come."

In fact, they were rather quick in agreeing to establish a subsidiary in Dublin, the reasons for which are irrelevant as long as the Irish economy can reap the benefits. This large investment will have benefits all across Ireland from consumers, to workers, to business owners and more."
 ireland.4550.d.ENG: "Many have been sceptical of the move to send a trade delegation to the Union of Britain, but they may change their minds following the success of the negotiations.\n\nThough their economic system does not allow for such private enterprise, Ireland has benefited from relations with their \"trading corporation\" in the past. \"Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company\", having previously established the first transatlantic telegraph from Ireland, has expressed an interest in expanding their operations and they have committed to the establishment of a new office in Dublin, under the watchful eye of the Anglo-Irish Trading Corporation of course. While the new investment is welcome, a close eye must be kept on any syndicalist influence seeping out and into the rest of Ireland."
 ireland.4550.d.FRA: "The trade delegation sent to the Communards in France has attracted much suspicion from the Irish public, but their fears will soon disappear as the benefits from this trip begin to show.\n\nThe steel mill \"Société Métallurgique de Normandie\", known for being a large exporter to Britain, Spain, and Italy, has expressed an interest in expanding into Ireland. The economic system in France does not allow for private enterprise like this, but the Communard's \"trading corporation\" that handles foreign trading relations in Western Europe has made a statement saying they will provide support to SMN's expansion. Their Dublin office will both expand their market and expand the options in steel production in Ireland. While a close eye will of course have to be kept on the Communards, this arrangement seems like it will be mutually beneficial for both nations."
 ireland.4550.d.GER: "The trade delegates have returned from Germany, and it is no surprise that their negotiations went very well. Due to the history of good trade relations with Germany, the delegates had no issue in securing a substantial commitment from the famous arms manufacturer Krupp.\n\nTheir new Dublin office will act as their hub for operations in Ireland, Britain, and as a first port of call for investors travelling from America. The world is increasingly becoming more hostile, and having a strong domestic armaments industry will help Ireland stay prepared should it need to defend itself. This significant investment will go a long way to making Dublin a global financial centre and Ireland a global finance competitor."
 ireland.4550.d.HOL: "The trade delegation sent to the Netherlands has come back with good news. Despite their diminished scope since the British revolution, \"Royal Dutch Shell\" has committed to the establishment of an office in Dublin. These new jobs will compliment the ever-growing demand for oil and its derivatives, as well as facilitating the expansion of Shell petrol stations across Ireland as automotive ownership increases. This Dutch gold will be a great boon to the Irish people."
 ireland.4550.d.italian: "The delegates returning from Italy bring with them an investment from the automotive giant \"FIAT\". They have announced plans to open an office in Dublin, and there have been discussions about a future manufacturing plant in Ireland. FIAT has dominated the Italian automotive market for decades and wasn't shaken at all by the syndicalist presence in their home of Turin. Their support in the Irish market will push Ireland's automotive industry forward and provide employment opportunities for a wide range of skilled and unskilled workers."
 ireland.4550.d.JAP: "Convincing the historically isolated Japanese to expand into new markets was difficult, but the delegates sent to Japan have come back successful. They have secured a commitment from the broad conglomerate \"Mitsubishi\" as they look to further diversify their company.\n\nTheir new Dublin office will be their first major investment into the European market and will allow to them to bring their services to millions of new customers. Their varied area of business will also bring a wide variety of jobs, benefiting all kinds of qualified workers. This investment will be particularly important in painting Dublin as a global financial hub."
 ireland.4550.d.SPA: "While some thought the trade delegates sent to Spain were merely getting a free holiday, the fruits of their labours prove otherwise.\n\nThe telecommunications company \"Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España\", or CTNE, has agreed to fund a subsidiary office in Dublin to facilitate the expansion of their network. They are particularly eager to make use of the transatlantic telecommunication cables stemming from the Irish coast.\n\nAs telephones become more common place in Irish households, CTNE's support will ensure a functioning and wide-reaching network. In addition, their Dublin office will provide a brand-new area of employment to the people and allow a further diversification of the Ireland's new financial capital."
 ireland.4550.d.american: "The delegation sent to America has been very successful in their negotiations, and secured an investment from the consumer electronics giant \"General Electric\". They plan to open an office in Dublin as they look to expand their operations throughout Ireland. As their business expands their scope, the benefits will be seen all across Ireland from consumers, to workers, to business owners and more."
 ireland.4550.d.POL: "The trade delegation sent to Radom in [POL.GetNameDef] brings wonderful news. \"Fabryka Broni Radom\", or the Armaments Factory in Radom would gladly invest into opening a new office in Dublin, which could allow them to export Polish arms across the ocean. With funds previously secured from German and Austrian businessmen, they will surely flourish on the Emerald Isle and provide new jobs to the Irish citizens!"
 ireland.4550.d.GBPGBR: "Following the restoration of a syndicalism-free [From.GetName], the Irish Government was quick to re-establish good trade relations, not least to prevent any potential trade war from the new competing parties in Europe.\n\nIn particular, the recently reorganised \"RSAF Enfield\" has expressed an interest in constructing an office in Dublin. Whether they are worried about instability in [126.Owner.GetNameDef], or simply want to expand their business, the benefits to the Irish economy will be self-evident. A large English-speaking company like this will be particularly attractive to Irish workers and will certainly continue to display Dublin as the best place for finance investment."
 ireland.4550.d.FRPNFA: "Following the ousting of the Communards from Paris, many businesses have been looking to take advantage of their restored economic freedom and expand their reach.\n\nThe trade delegation sent to France secured a commitment from one such company, \"Renault\", who have been waiting patiently for an opportunity just like this. The major automotive and tank manufacturer has always been eager to expand its already large market share, and their new Dublin office will be a perfect chance to secure a new market. This office will provide new opportunities in employment as Ireland's automotive infrastructure continue to expand and will also secure Dublin as a new financial centre."
 ireland.4550.d.gen: "The trade delegation sent to [From.GetNameDef] has returned with fantastic news. Following a round of talks, they have managed to secure a commitment from a local company to open a subsidiary office in Dublin, with hopes that this will lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties. For Ireland this new office will hopefully in time bring jobs to the nation's people, tax income for the government, and will help build up the image of Dublin as a world financial capital."

 ireland.4600.d.mc: "$ireland.4600.d.start$\"When I was just simply a young man looking for my place in the world, one man stood above all others as an inspiration to both myself and countless others. In Arthur Griffith there was a mighty force in Ireland. He had none of the wildness of some I could name. Instead there was an abundance of wisdom and an awareness of things which are Ireland. When I grew old enough to begin serving our people, Griffith would become both an important mentor and friend, a man whose party I am proud to still lead to this day. Without Griffith's leadership and vision the entire existence of our great nation would be in doubt, and so we shall strive to never forget the legacy left to us by the father of our republic.\""
 ireland.4600.d.rm: "$ireland.4600.d.start$\"When our brave nation fought for its independence, there was one man who served as our guiding light, the great Arthur Griffith. It was Griffith who most fully painted in his weekly writings for us the traditions and the resources of Ireland, portrayed its mission and gave us for practical purposes our dream, our sense of work. When I fought for our nation's freedom, Griffith was always there to help in every way he could. When the Tans attempted to hunt down my men and I, Griffith could always be counted on to find us refuge. Without Griffith's leadership and vision the entire existence of our great nation would be in doubt, and so we shall strive to never forget the legacy left to us by the father of our republic.\""
 ireland.4600.d.start: "When discussing the great heroes of the Irish cause, there is one name that will often be conspicuously absent from the discussion, that of Sinn Féin's founder Arthur Griffith. Much like a modern-day Parnell, Griffith was at one point the de facto leader of Irish nationalism, fundamentally advancing the cause of freedom. Also much like Parnell, Griffith suffered from being sidelined in life, a life cut tragically all too short. While Parnell faded from relevance due to his impropriety, Griffith simply found himself a place in the sidelines as the Irish cause developed beyond him. His advocacy for the reversal of the Act of Union and the formation of a Dual Monarchy, inspired by Austria-Hungary, fell out of favour after the events of 1916, but seeing republicanism's rising tide and popular support, Griffith, the eternal pragamatist, had no problem in his party being used as a vehicle for independence. Always more an agitator than a leader, his role in the Treaty negotiations outshone his brief time as President, before his untimely death.\n\nWith time, as Parnell has come to be regarded as one of the greatest Irishmen in history, [IRE_loc_leader_name] has made it his mission to ensure that the same shall hold true for Griffith. Inviting many this morning to the front of Leinster House, where the statue of Queen Victoria once sat, [IRE_loc_leader_surname] unveiled a grand statue of Griffith in its place. Sculpted by Leo Broe, known for his Northside monument to the Irish Volunteers and his bust of Pádraig Pearse, the intention of elevating Griffith's memory alongside them is clear to most. Taking the stage following the reveal, [IRE_loc_leader_surname]'s speech left no room for doubt.\n\n"

 ireland.6500.d.start: "To the surprise of few, the presence of British soldiers in Ireland's streets once again has not been met with the warmest of receptions. Resistance groups have already sprung up, formed primarily from the remnants of the IRA seeking to expel Britain's troops from their island once more"
 ireland.6500.d.end: "These groups have already begun issuing threats of attacks against the "occupiers", and if a move is not soon made to restore local goverance to Ireland it seems very likely that they will quickly show that these threats are far from empty bluffs."
 ireland.6500.a: "Not them again..."

 ireland.6501.t: "Riots in Ireland"
 ireland.6501.d: "In protest of what the Irish perceive as our \"unjust occupation\" of their island, thousands gathered today to take part in a demonstration demanding their independence once more from Britain. Almost inevitably, these protestors immediately began clashing with policing units sent to contain them, quickly devolving into full blown riots. While officers have at least now managed to quash the upstarts, it seems likely that we will face similar problems as long as we continue our current approach towards Ireland."
 ireland.6501.a: "They'll give up soon enough."

 ireland.6502.t: "Irish Ambushes"
 ireland.6502.d: "Seemingly back to their old tricks once again, an Irish resistance group has carried out a series of coordinated ambushes against our units deployed to maintain peace on the island. While the official reports have of course maintained that our men managed to defeat the rebels with ease, most have seemingly managed to escape unscathed after these attacks."
 ireland.6502.a: "Someone catch the bastards already!"

 ireland.6503.t: "The Sabotage Campaign"
 ireland.6503.d: "As part of their so called \"Sabotage Campaign\" the Irish rebels have carried out a series of attacks on important infrastructure in their continued attempt to force our withdrawal from Ireland. A series of bombings, attacks on security guards, and even an almost baffling attack with an incendiary balloon have all thus far taken place, with little indication of an end to this extreme vandalism coming any time soon."

 ireland.6504.t: "Factories Bombed by the IRA"
 ireland.6504.d: "In a futile effort to force us out of Ireland, the reorganised IRA rebels have decided to resort to sabotage, and have carried out a bombing attack against vital factories to disrupt production.

 # Flavour #
 irelandflavour.361.t: "An Olympic Endeavour"
 irelandflavour.361.d: "As the immediate commotion following the fallout of Black Monday and the LÉ Macha incident has died down to an extent, the government is starting to take stock of another extremely significant occasion that recently occurred, despite its complete overshadowing.\n\nFour weeks ago, the eleventh Olympic Games came to a close in their host city, which was of course none other than Dublin. Ireland's bid to host the Games in the first place was seen as a shot in the dark, but the young republic's relatively neutral international positioning was deemed palatable by the powers that be, and to the government's incredulity if not worry, their bid won the day.\n\nThere were some calls for the Games to be cancelled, or at least spending to be drastically cut in the run-up to the Games due to budgetary concerns, but the government was consistent in their statements that the money to host the Games had already been spent, and the Games would go ahead as planned.\n\nOnce this had been made clear, the people gradually but enthusiastically took on their roles as hosts, with sporting pursuits and physical feats being held in particularly high regard by more conservative members of the nationalist movement. The government was especially eager to showcase Ireland as an independent and modern nation, in this, the most prominent of ways possible, while still attempting to deal with ongoing domestic crises.\n\nAfter a rousing opening ceremony, almost on par with the festivities of the Easter Rising anniversary earlier in the year, the Games proved to be a complete success. Particular pride was taken for the Irish sportsmen, who won far more medals than expected for a small nation. The hosting of the modern Olympics was eventually deemed a worthwhile undertaking, but not a feat that the government is looking to repeat any time soon, given the scale of the efforts involved."
 irelandflavour.361.a: "Our lads did us proud!"

 irelandflavour.362.t: "The Death of French Liberty"
 irelandflavour.362.d: "This morning in Ireland we have awoken to grave news coming from Algiers, the capital of the remnants of what many here consider the legitimate government of France, that has left many in our young republic shaken. General Charles de Gaulle, who seized control of the state after a brief civil conflict, officially addressed the French parliament yesterday to announce his intentions to restore the House of Orléans to the French throne and abolish the Third Republic once and for all. Prince Jean, the Orléanist pretender to the crown, quickly accepted de Gaulle's invitation and although he is yet to be coronated it is clear to all that French republicanism is finally dead.\n\nIt is no secret that most republican movements in Europe were greatly inspired by France, and in Ireland this rings especially true. Wolfe Tone, the father of Irish republicanism, was both heavily inspired and directly supported by French republicans in his uprisings against the British crown. Even the most fundamental symbol of our state, the Irish tricolour, was created by French republican women celebrating the ousting of Louis Philippe I, great-grandfather of the new king, as a symbol of our common struggle for liberty and freedom.\n\nThis news has greatly emboldened the extremists on both the left and right in Ireland, who have already begun with their doomsaying predictions as to the future of Irish democracy. Those on the extreme right have declared this to be definitive proof that liberalism and democracy are too flawed to combat the threat posed by syndicalist forces, advocating for the creation of a modern Irish monarchy to protect our nation. Likewise those on the extreme left have interpreted this news as a sign that bourgeois democracy cannot stop the rise of reactionary authoritarianism, and see socialism as the only way to guarantee Irish liberty. We can only hope that both are equally deluded."
 irelandflavour.362.a: "Ireland will forge its own destiny, the French\nbe damned!"

 irelandflavour.371.t: "Mary Lavelle"
 irelandflavour.371.d: "The Irish novelist and playwright Kate O'Brien was already an author of some note in the public's mind in years past, but her latest work \"Mary Lavelle\" must surely be now her most notorious.\n\nO'Brien has found her niche in typically writing romances about British and Anglo-Irish bourgeoisie characters trying to find their place in the world, following the British and Irish revolutions. Despite her fascination with the upper class, the committed anglophile O'Brien has spent much of the last decade in the Union of Britain where she relished the revolutionary atmosphere. Her lifestyle over there is much remarked upon in Ireland, as it's reported she crops her hair short, is known to wear men's clothing, and there are even rumours that she is intimate with other women.\n\nHer new book does little to dispel that innuendo, as \"Mary Lavelle\" features an older Irish lesbian professing her love for the female protagonist. This salaciousness is on top of the main thread of the story featuring the protagonist falling in love with a married man."
 irelandflavour.371.d1: "$irelandflavour.371.d$\n\nBetween the scandalous nature of both the author and the work itself, there are calls in some quarters for the book to be banned in this country, while others say the comparatively more laissez-faire social attitude of Sinn Féin should stand."
 irelandflavour.371.d2: "$irelandflavour.371.d$\n\nWhatever their growing political divergences, O'Duffy and Ó Cuinneagáin share a mutual distaste for the scandalous nature of both the author and the work itself, though disagree on what course of action need be taken.\nO'Duffy is of the opinion that the novel ought to be simply banned and forgotten lest it influence others, while Ó Cuinneagáin believes that it and its author should be held up as prime examples of the corruption, immorality and perversion of Anglo-Syndicalism, from which the new regime strives to protect the Irish people."
 irelandflavour.371.a: "It's a weak mind that cannot survive some mild titillation; let the prudes grumble."

 irelandflavour.371.e: "Let all of Ireland witness the deviant nature of the Saxon foe!"

 irelandflavour.372.t: "The Tailteann Games"
 irelandflavour.372.d: "\"Do again for the Gaels what you have done for the Greeks\" — such were the slogans that littered the pamphlets that have been distributed around Leinster House for the past number of weeks. The relatively successful hosting of the modern Olympic Games in Dublin last year has led a small but influential group of Irish sports enthusiasts to put pressure on the government to re-host the Tailteann Games.\n\nThe Tailteann Games, in their original form, were played in the centuries preceding the Norman invasions of 1169-1171, and as far back as over a millennium before the birth of Christ, if legends are true. Tradition holds that they were first held to mark the funeral of the harvest deity Tailtiu, who died of exhaustion after clearing the dense, expansive forests of County Meath, to form the rich farmland for which it is now known. These games were declared a time of truce, with great tests of wits, skill and strength on display, and a time for celebration and the arranging of marriages.\n\nShortly before the onset of the British Revolution in 1924, the Sinn Féin administration of the day hosted a modern day equivalent, to great success. Held a few weeks after and largely modelled on the Olympic Games in Berlin, the games brought together hundreds of people of Irish descent from all over the world, as well as some guest competitors invited to come and add to the spectacle.\n\nTo the chagrin of those petitioning the government, however, these games did not become a regular fixture. Security concerns and spending issues became too much for successive governments of the day to justify, particularly when the insular nature of the games would mean there would be little international interest to invest in increasing the security involved. Even the hosting of the Olympics themselves had been a tough call to make, and had only been accepted on the back of the international recognition it would bring, assumed to outweigh the initial costs.\n\nBut with the world engulfed in further conflict, particularly in America where so much of the diaspora lies, let alone an even larger sporting event being held locally only in recent memory, there was little appetite in the government to pay heed to these petitions."
 irelandflavour.372.a: "It can wait a few more years."

 irelandflavour.373.t: "Old Friends in New England"
 irelandflavour.373.d: "When the republic was in its infancy, looking for allies and international recognition, it found stalwart support in the people of New England, one of the largest homes of the Irish diaspora. During the War of Independence, when Cathal Brugha visited Boston and gave his great speech in Fenway Park, thousands of people attended and cried out for Irish freedom. And with the recent crisis in America devolving into all out civil war, a provisional government has been established in New England following intervention by the Canadians to shelter it from the war.\n\nWhile some in the government refuse to openly support anything backed by the British exiles, many have called for Ireland to recognise the New England government and invite [NEE.GetLeader] to give his own speech symbolising Irish-American friendship and cooperation."
 irelandflavour.373.a: "We never forget a friend, send the invitation."
 irelandflavour.373.b: "We can't support British imperialism, no matter who leads their state."

 irelandflavour.381.t: "Down with Jazz"
 irelandflavour.381.d: "Low ranking clergy from Ireland's least populated county are not usually a matter of interest to either the nation's media or politicians, but Father Peter Conefrey from Leitrim is an exception. An arch-traditional nationalist, Conefrey advocates for the population to support the Irish language and traditional Irish music over foreign influences.\n\nViews such as those are ten-a-penny and indeed, such well trodden ground that the liberals of Ireland are well used to riposting them. However, Conefrey has found a somewhat bold new line of attack, denouncing Jazz as \"borrowed from Central Africa by a gang of wealthy syndicalists in the USA to strike at Christian civilisation throughout the world\" and branding listeners as outright \"traitors\" to Ireland, with particular venom spit towards Anglo-Irish and German residents for their indulgence of the genre.\n\nConefrey's angst-ridden views that strike at all things foreign and metropolitan saw him able to amass reportedly \"several thousand\" supporters at a recent anti-Jazz protest in south Leitrim. Letters of support from Éamon de Valera and Archbishop Joseph MacRory were read from a platform, and verbal attacks were made on politicians espousing cultural pluralist views. It would be difficult to imagine such galvanisation a decade ago but its clear that recent economic and political events have added fuel to this fire."

 irelandflavour.382.t: "Redmond Remembered"
 irelandflavour.382.d: "Another anniversary has come and gone, with a recent commemoration taking place marking the 20th year since the passing of John Redmond.\n\nIt was a muted affair. For many, he is remembered as a man on the wrong side of history, whose actions led to the death of thousands of young Irishmen. For others, a man whose one main mistake came to define his entire political career. Redmond, during his own lifetime however, was much more than that.\n\nAs the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he was de facto leader of Irish nationalism at the beginning of the 1910s. His goal of Home Rule was on the brink of being made a reality by Westminster, making a civil war in Ireland between the Ulster Volunteer Force and Irish Volunteers of the day seem inevitable. The outbreak of the Weltkrieg put an end to both these certainties, with Redmond making the fateful decision to urge all able-bodied Volunteers to enlist in the British war effort, in an attempt to ensure the enactment of Home Rule after what was sure to be another brief war...\n\nHe was a man for whom Home Rule was the end goal, and would have been content with an autonomous Ireland at the heart of the British Empire. This is when most others, even within his party, saw it as just a step towards greater independence. His legacy is one that is looked upon more favourably by those who would have had more personal ties with Britain, and the few more moderate republicans with Entente sympathies.\n\nIn his native Wexford where he had been interred, a modest and respectful ceremony took place at his family mausoleum, with attendees including several NDP politicians and party officials, as well as some Irish veterans of the Weltkrieg. Those present were urged to reconsider his legacy, and remember him for the times he lived in, before the Republic could have become a reality. This message was of course meant for those not in attendance, and by-and-large fell on deaf ears."
 irelandflavour.382.a: "He was a man of his time."

 irelandflavour.383.t: "Bliain na bhFrancach"
 irelandflavour.383.d.start: "No matter the political or economic climate in a nation, people will rarely pass up an opportunity to celebrate their heritage, and Ireland is no exception to this. Throughout the country many have made the journey to [IRE_loc_sallins] in [IRE_loc_county] [IRE_loc_kildare] to take part in the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at [IRE_loc_bodenstown] Graveyard that happened on Sunday. Being regarded as the \"Father of Irish Republicanism\" it is no surprise to see a sea of Irish flags waved by the processioners, but the less informed observer may be surprised to see them waving side by side with the tricolour of France.\n\nIf there is one nation that Ireland has been able to continuously count on throughout history to come to its aid, it has been France. United initially by faith, the French sent soldiers to help Irish Catholics in their fight against William of Orange in an attempt to establish an independent Ireland, albeit one still ruled by a British king. It was with the French revolution that France's relationship with Ireland moved beyond faith, and so one hundred and forty years ago they would send brave men to fight alongside Wolfe Tone, irrespective of him being a Protestant rather than a Catholic. This event made the year 1798 become known in Ireland as \"Bliain na bhFrancach\", the \"Year of the French\", and it has permanently defined Ireland's relationship with France to this day."

Before the English invasion, the island was, like most of the continent, a monarchical society, and all its early rebellions too were of a monarchist nature. While a republic was mooted for the first time in 1627 as a compromise between rival contenders for the Irish throne, it would take until 1791 for the idea to truly rise to prominence as Theobald Wolfe Tone, inspired by the French Revolution, formed the Society of United Irishmen with the aim of establishing an Irish Republic free from the British crown.\n\nThough supported by the French, due to unfortunate circumstances the uprisings of the United Irishmen in 1798 and 1803 would end in failure, but the revolutionaries' vision would resonate with the hearts of the Irish people, inspiring them for years to come. Through the darkness of the bleak 19th century, the Young Irelanders and the Fenians would carry on the torch of republicanism handed down to them, rising up in 1848 and 1867 respectively.\n\nMost significant of all however, were the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret society which was key in organising the fateful Easter Rising which ignited the spirit of Irish liberty once again and, although proposals of crowning a German prince were thrown around, ultimately the republican aspirations passed from generation to generation would emerge triumphant as the Irish Republican Army fought its war of independence to drive out the British."

 irelandflavour.385.d.start: "Ireland are the so-called \"Big Houses\", country manors dotted all along rural Ireland. Although primarily homes, these houses have the dual purpose of acting as the nexus of agricultural complexes. Typically, dozens and dozens of farm hands will work out of a courtyard adjacent to the house, with the owner acting as their boss. The origin of this system is mediaeval, and in truth has not advanced much in concept since that time.\n\nIn Ireland, these manors were and are controlled by Anglo-Irish families, installed in the 17th and 18th centuries as the preceding Catholic nobility was stripped of power and influence. Owing their wealth and status to the British state that installed them, these families were loyal servants of Imperialism, acting to uphold the status quo not only locally, but also internationally, as the non-inheriting sons of these families frequently acted as colonial bureaucrats across the British Empire. Following the revolution in Britain, the \"big houses\" were often the last refuge for these \"servants of the Empire\"."

 irelandflavour.386.t: "The Gaelic Athletic Association"
 irelandflavour.386.d.start: "The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was founded in 1884 during the so-called \"Gaelic Revival\" to protect and promote traditional Irish sports. In achieving that goal, the GAA succeeded remarkably. Whereas before the advent of the GAA, the \"Gaelic\" games of football, hurling, handball, and rounders were largely moribund, come Irish independence GAA-affiliated clubs could be found in every Irish parish. Though its influence was more strongly felt in rural areas, come independence \"Football\" meant the Gaelic sort to nearly any Irishman. The GAA continues to organise and govern those sports both at home and abroad, and GAA clubs and events often draw massive crowds of spectators.\n\nUnsurpisingly, for an organisation dedicated to cultural revivalism, in the political sphere the GAA was and is strongly associated with Irish nationalism. Notably, the group counted prominent Fenians and Home Rulers among its founding members and first patrons, and local GAA clubs were early foci of recruitment for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. It was a massacre perpetrated by Crown Forces on civilian spectators at a Gaelic Football match in the GAA's flagship Croke Park stadium, \"Bloody Sunday\", that became a potent symbol of British tyranny during the War of Independence."
 irelandflavour.386.d1: "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nThe GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally until the foundation of the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) in mid-1922. At that time, Ireland had recently signed the Anglo-Irish treaty with the United Kingdom and support for the GAA by the newly independent Ireland was understood to potentially undermine unity in sport. That bifurcation remained in place even after the end of British rule in the north and has continued through until the present. Though the Gaelic Games (and thus the GAA) receive substantial patronage from the government in Dublin, in the interests of maintaining social harmony, the present government of the republic seems certain to continue to uphold that state of affairs."
 irelandflavour.386.d2: "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nThough not keen on micromanaging the governance of athletics, Eoin O'Duffy cut his teeth politically in the Ulster GAA organising body, and has always been deeply personally committed to matters of sport and the GAA in particular. While some Gaelicists still grumble about his supposed betrayal of Gaelic athletics — it was under his direction that the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was created in mid-1922 to assume authority for non-Gaelic sport — government patronage of the GAA has seen a notable uptick since his rise to unchallenged political authority."
 irelandflavour.386.d3: "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nWhile the fight for political sovereignty was won years ago, the enemy continues to dominate Ireland and its people: foreign games remain popular across the country and even hold a more prestigious place in the minds of many. This sad state of affairs necessitates action and it is apparent that the GAA will be both sword and shield in the struggle for national liberation in athletics. Already, the state has begun to carry out that struggle arm-in-arm with the GAA. Though drastic action has not yet been taken, praise for the GAA and the Gaelic Games has become a common feature of AN rallies and Ó Cuinneagáin's public statements.\n\nA common theme has been frustration with the state of governance of Irish sport. Though the GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally, the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was founded in mid-1922 and maintains authority over many areas of athletics, including those foreign games which ought to be driven from Ireland to begin with. Clearly, a sweeping reorganisation, including the empowerment of the GAA, is long overdue."
 irelandflavour.386.d4: "$irelandflavour.386.d.start$\n\nIn light of the GAA's nationalist pedigree and general popularity, an uneasiness initially existed between the organisation and the government since the light of socialism shone upon the Irish Government. In effect, an unspoken agreement came into force between the GAA and [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] whereby each left the other alone to the extent possible. For its part, the Irish Government has continued to lean upon Gaelic sport for legitimacy, eliciting only unofficial grumbling from the organisation's leadership, while the GAA remained independent. However, the GAA seems to have further reconciled itself to the socialist government in recent months, with socialists accepted and elected into various association leadership positions. Ranking GAA members have even appeared alongside government officials at a number of high-profile events, indicating that the GAA is slowly turning a bit pink, if not yet entirely red."

Trained in the art of combat in Scotland, he soon became Ulster's strongest warrior, most famously defending the kingdom against the armies of Queen Medb of Connacht in the mythological epic, the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\".\n\nA well-regarded bronze statue designed by Oliver Sheppard, a sculptor who competed in art competitions during the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, depicts Cú Chulainn's ultimate death in battle, having tied himself to a stone, according to some tellings with his own intestines, to die on his feet, leaving his foes unaware of his demise for three days until a raven perched upon his shoulder. Although a Protestant born in [IRE_loc_county] [IRE_loc_tyrone], Sheppard is nonetheless an Irish nationalist who in his own words stated that \"my politics are simple.

While access to this source for ourselves seems steady, for now, cautious whispers determined that it would be unwise to solely rely on it, should the trade be disrupted in the future.\n\nAs such, a small group of Irish diplomats had spent the last few months travelling the world, visiting plantations and negotiating importation deals, finally determining that mixing some Indian Assam tea with the darker, stronger tea available in German-held Kenya, would produce an excellent robust brew, suitable for the domestic market. By decreasing the country's reliance on potentially unreliable solely Indian sources, and diversifying the blends used, the results have meant both a better tasting tea, and more secure access to imports for the years to come."

Among the Irish Citizen Army, he became recognised for his talent as a recruiting officer, an organisation of which his membership would lead to him being sacked from his teaching job.\n\nNow in a position to promote his dearly-held views after the Second Irish Revolution, he has become the pioneer of a concept known as \"Athghabháil na hÉireann\", or the \"Reconquest of Ireland\", which regards both English and the growing lingua franca of German as tools of capitalism, and advances that only through socialism will the tongue of the Irish people be saved and the nation fully decolonised. Through this theory, he has sought win the support of Irish speakers for the new Republic, including former supporters of Aontas Náísiúnta who he argues were led astray by the forces of reaction, but that their cultural nationalism is at heart well-intentioned and harnessable for positive ends should they learn the error of their ways."

Given her own background, this subject matter came of no surprise.\n\nThe book argues the irrefutability that since 1798, the Anglo-Irish have played a crucial role in the development of Irish nationalism and republicanism. Anglo-Irish and Protestants never made up more than 15% of the population, and while they would have been overwhelmingly loyalist historically, those who took up the nationalist cause made a disproportionate impact in nationalism as a whole.\n\nFrom the founders of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the movement's leadership has included Protestants, helped by the greater status and education that was afforded to them for centuries. Robert Emmet led his rebellion in 1803, and Charles Stewart Parnell was de facto leader of nationalism in the 1880s. Outside politics, literary greats Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats are also known for their nationalist ideals. The involvement of Protestants in nationalism, it argues, was key in separating the Catholic identity from the Irish one in the late 1700s, a time when they were entwined.\n\nThe book goes as far as contemporary Ireland, focusing on the fringes of politics, such as socialist academic Benjamin Farrington, or integralism proponent Ernest Blythe, and commenting on how the British Revolution may have influenced the popularity of different political groups among this population."

Officially, All Saints' Day is the 1st of November, and is recognised by the Catholic Church as a Holy Day of Obligation, with all Catholics expected to attend Mass, and with All Souls' Day the day after. But this is only the Church taking advantage of the more ancient, arcane and local pre-Christian beliefs of the population.\n\nGhoulish faces are carved into turnips, with candles fitted and lit inside to give them an otherworldly aura. People roam the countryside between distant homesteads, clad in imitation of the very beings also said to be present that night, themselves expecting to be placated with food and drink in exchange for song or verse. The dead are remembered and toasts held in their honour.\n\nSimilar customs exist elsewhere, but in particular the Gaelic traditions have taken root in the United States, following the mass exodus that has occurred over the last century. There they have taken up many of their own forms, which themselves have travelled back to Ireland via returning immigrants.\n\nCelebrations this year themselves have taken an even more macabre turn, with tensions rising around the world, and with the United States, the new home of many Irish people and the land of opportunity, up in flames. Some new traditions have come back to Ireland with previous returning emigrants and new refugees — but war would not be one that would be welcome."

 irelandflavour.3812.t: "The Star Turns Red"
 irelandflavour.3812.d1: "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, and especially in recent years, as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Political violence has unfortunately also been a major part of the nation's history, and last night at the Abbey Theatre these two worlds collided after riots broke out at the debut of a new overtly political play known as \"The Star Turns Red\".\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and this recent play is no different. One of O'Casey's previous plays \"The Plough and the Stars\" has often been interpreted as criticism of overvaluing Irish nationalism at the expense of the working class, leading initially to calls for it to be censored, and ultimately a riot broke out at a performance over the perceived insult to Irish identity. Likewise, \"The Star Turns Red\" has been interpreted by some as an attack against the fundamentals of Irish identity, the Catholic Church, and modern Irish politics. The protagonist of the play, \"Red Jim\", who is very clearly inspired by Irish socialist leader Jim Larkin, leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts.\n\nAlthough police are still compiling a full picture of the events of last night, it appears that several members of the Blueshirts were in attendance, resulting in a brawl breaking out which quickly escalated into a riot. Like with O'Casey's last play to cause this level of unrest, there are calls to ban his play to keep the peace, with those aligned with O'Duffy going as far to call for O'Casey's arrest for producing \"a blasphemous piece of syndicalist propaganda\".\n\nWhile there is little reason to escalate matters this far, banning performances of the play may protect us from further incidents and the spread of syndicalist views. This degree of government censorship may however be seen by the public as a move towards further authoritarianism, and it may make sense to approach this situation more carefully by only having a few ministers officially condemn the play instead."
 irelandflavour.3812.d2: "Ever since the dust settled on the corpse of the old order in Britain, Ireland has had to deal with jumped-up syndicalist playwrights and poets from across the Sea producing propaganda, in the hopes it will one day lead to a socialist revolution here as well. While it is easy to ignore all of these plays written by British authors, the same cannot be said about a betrayal of a play produced by one of our own.\n\nSeán O'Casey, a noted Irish playwright who has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, recently debuted his new play \"The Star Turns Red\" at the Apollo Theatre in London, after being rightfully blocked from having it performed at the Abbey Theatre in [GetVictoryPointName_11293]. The central conflict of the play revolves around the protagonist \"Red Jim\", a stand-in for Irish socialist leader Jim Larkin, leading his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", a clear parallel for the Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the \"brave workers\" of Ireland, who they claim \"will soon be freed from reactionary oppression\".\n\nDespite being shown only in London, news of this blatant attack by a traitorous syndicalist quickly reached the office of a furious [IRE_loc_leader_surname] in Leinster House. Not long afterwards, a statement was officially released denouncing O'Casey's play as \"an indecent and blasphemous piece of syndicalist propaganda\", labelling the man himself as a traitor, and banning all of his works from being performed again in Ireland. Despite it still being unclear if the British government supported O'Casey in any way, an arrest warrant has still been issued against him for conspiring with the British state to overthrow the organs of the Irish Government, effectively exiling him from the country. With [IRE_loc_leader_surname]'s continued anger over the incident, O'Casey should consider himself lucky that he has gotten off so \"lightly\"."
 irelandflavour.3812.d3: "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, especially in recent years as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Even those in government need a break from it all every now and then, especially with their ongoing arduous task of reshaping the political landscape of the country. The recent debut of an exciting new play entitled \"The Star Turns Red\" has been the perfect excuse for such a break, with multiple prominent members of the new government attending the performance at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and the recent revolution in Ireland has clearly been an inspiration for his latest work, with many noticing obvious parallels between its plot and the events of recent months. The central conflict of the play revolves around a general strike orchestrated by the protagonist of the play \"Red Jim\", who leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling against the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the brave workers who took part in the Second Irish Revolution, and many are widely regarding the production as a shining example of syndicalist performance art.\n\nAmong those praising the contents of the new play was one Jim Larkin, who O'Casey has known for decades now and is proud to call a friend. Following the production he was heard expressing his enjoyment of the new play to the other members of government present, especially praising the performance given by the lead actor who he described as \"truly portrayed the socialist spirit of Ireland\". Following such high praise and positive reviews, it can only be hoped that this is just the beginning of a new exciting era of Irish theatre."

 irelandflavour.391.t: "Sailing to Byzantium"
 irelandflavour.391.d: "Ireland is in mourning today as it learnt of the death of William Butler Yeats, a giant of modern Irish culture over the course of several decades.\n\nYeats had helped spearhead the Irish Literary Revival in literature starting in the 1890s, while founding a bedrock of Irish theatre, the Abbey Theatre, in 1904. Throughout his working life, he had promoted Irish culture and mythology, and stressed an Irish identity that was completely separate from a British one. His greatest personal achievement was winning a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for his poetry; coming at a heady time for Yeats, who had just witnessed the birth of an independent Ireland, something he had long supported. In 1922 he was appointed a member of the Senate, and spent the next several years experiencing first-hand the politics of the new state. Although during his time as senator Yeats was not affiliated with any party, not even Sinn Féin, he was not afraid to make his political views known, and was firm in the Senate in voicing his opinion on cultural and educational matters. Yeats offered a unique perspective, as he not only spoke as an artist, but also as someone who was both a Protestant and a nationalist.\n\nIn the final years of his life, Yeats became an informal supporter of Aontas Náisiúnta, drawn both to the firm paternalistic stances of Eoin O'Duffy and the mystic nationalism of Gearoid Ó Cuinneagáin. Yeats had always grated against individualism and liberalism, and the increasing influence of both upon Sinn Féin greatly displeased him. While AN were greatly pleased to learn of a supporter of Yeats' calibre, they were disappointed that they were never able to truly utilise his presence outside of Yeats creating three marching songs for the organisation.\n\nAlthough Yeats is now gone, his legacy will be long-lasting and regardless of his political views, most can acknowledge his sizable contributions to Irish cultural life."

 irelandflavour.392.t: "Amhrán na bhFiann"
 irelandflavour.392.d: "It has been more than fifteen years since \"Amhrán na bhFiann\", or \"A Soldier's Song\" was officially adopted as the national anthem. The song, with words written by Peadar Kearney, and music by him and Patrick Heaney, first emerged in 1910, with the now-widespread lyrics in Irish being published by Liam Ó Rinn in 1923. It follows a long tradition of emotive patriotic songs, speaking of an Ireland from long ago that now calls again to be defended against her enemies and oppressors. Making the composition all the more meaningful however, was its popularity among the Irish Volunteers leading up to 1916, and later in the Frongoch prison camp where many were interned afterwards, to the extent that it was unofficially known as the \"Sinn Féin anthem\".\n\nWhat began life as a jaunty marching song has been reconstructed into a stirring national anthem. This has been helped in no small part by the reworking of the song for full orchestra, and also for marching band, as well as chorus, transforming the song and adding an appropriate amount of gravitas, depending on the occasion.\n\nYet, as with all things in a relatively newly independent country such as Ireland, there are questions which overhang it. As a piece of music that is profoundly and unashamedly associated with the nationalist tradition, some have doubted its ability to act as an olive branch to those who may have originally been, or remain, loyalists. Others feel that the official status of the Irish language translation, despite the song being originally written in English, is off-putting to poor speakers of the language, or that the melody is suitable but the lyrics lacklustre. Yet others agree with all of the sentiment of the song, but feel that there are older, potentially more legitimate anthems to be found in the plethora of pieces that make up the Irish musical tradition.\n\nThe obvious answer would be to leave it unchanged, but it is up to the government to decide the final decision."

 irelandflavour.393.d1: "Amidst all the political news in this country, one could be forgiven for thinking that sectarianism is as rife as ever. One area, however, where sectarianism seems to be slipping away is in the area of sport, Association Football (\"soccer\") specifically.\n\nAt the start of the century, soccer lagged considerably behind Gaelic football in popularity, as the Gaelic Athletics Association steered the sport to a meteoric rise, at least with the Catholic population of Ireland. With Gaelic football's ties to Irish nationalism, many Ulster Protestants instead veered towards soccer, and indeed, upon the foundation of the League of Ireland, all the teams were from Ulster and only one team, \"Belfast Celtic\", was associated with Catholics. However, this stark divide has been dissolving over the decades, with the glamour and prestige of the World Cup helping to draw a more diverse base into the game. Not only have new teams emerged from Dublin and Cork but also smaller Irish towns such as Dundalk, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo, with the \"Sligo Rovers\" becoming the first team outside of Leinster or Ulster to win the league this year.\n\nThe popularity of the league was also boosted by a small influx of players arriving from Britain, particularly from Scotland and the Liverpool area, as professional teams in the Union were scrapped and reorganised on a large scale, to reflect a nominally more egalitarian makeup with the rise of \"work teams\" and other amateur clubs. Now featuring a healthy mix of players from around the Isles and a range of teams from across Ireland, the League of Ireland has become an avenue for football supporters from different parts of the country to intermingle. Indeed, some supporters from Dublin are now travelling to Belfast for certain games, and vice versa." # Dems

 irelandflavour.393.d4: "One of the most important teachings of Marx is that class is more important than culture or religion — for example, Protestant and Catholic workers share much more in common than a poor Catholic and a rich Catholic do. An area where this phenomenon becomes apparent is in sports.\n\nAlthough our island has been plagued by sectarianism for centuries, in recent decades both Protestants and Catholics of the working class found common ground by playing and watching Association Football, or \"Soccer\", together. Although the inherent good of athleticism and community-building was apparent, the capitalists sought to commodify it. Instead of taking a wholesome amateur approach like in Gaelic Games, the British-aligned bourgeois encouraged \"professionalism\" in Irish soccer. While players were paid a salary (which was acceptable), they were also treated as commodities who could be bought and sold between teams like cattle at marts. Instead of teams of locals, who could be proudly supported by friends and neighbours, the ranks of soccer teams became those of strangers and mercenaries.\n\nNow that we have a socialist leadership in this country, the time has come to follow the example set in Britain and France and to re-organise soccer. Teams will be based around workplaces or professions, not owners. With soccer organised in this way, not only can it be a tool to encourage fitness, but it can help destroy sectarianism as well." # Socialists

Although Fionn and most of his valiant followers would be tragically slain in the Battle of Gabhra by the forces of the High King Cairbre Lifechair, who himself would also fall in the fighting at the hand of Fionn's grandson Oscar, and a rival Fianna clan led by Goll mac Morna, their gallant legacy has lived on in Irish culture.\n\nAs the Irish people regained their pride in their ancient heritage during the Gaelic Revival, the valour and martial prowess of the Fianna became inspirational for countless Irish revolutionaries, with nationalist organisations such as the Fenian Brotherhood and Fianna Éireann taking them as their namesake, and Amhrán na bhFiann and the IRA's cap badge referring to Ireland's soldiery as the \"Fianna Fáil\", meaning the Warriors of Inis Fáil, an old poetic name for the island.\n\nHowever, while the Irish Republican Army can trace their roots to this warrior-band tradition, it additionally finds expression in the form of paramilitarism."

 irelandflavour.399.t: "My Fair Fabian"
 irelandflavour.399.d: "The last few decades has seen untold change in the literary world, with romanticism eclipsed by realism and then modernism. This artistic upheaval has replaced the old with the new, and rate of change seems to be unceasing. Different writers have fit into this in various ways, but the distinct nature of the writings of George Bernard Shaw have necessitated the coining of the eponymous neologism \"Shavian\".\n\nBorn in 1856 into a family of Anglo-Irish Protestant Dubliners, a background usually associated with privilege, his father's drinking meant his own family was of fairly modest means. He moved to London at 19, following his mother after his parent's separation, and began his life anew. There he began writing novels, plays, music critique and newspaper columns, but also became involved with what would become the Fabian Society, writing as a political polemicist.\n\nBoth his writings and political views evolved and progressed over the coming decades, with the latter shifting from Marxism to Fabianism to his own idiosyncratic socialist perspectives that have been described as outspoken as they are self-contradictory. He has at different times castigated vaccination, organised religion and anti-semitism, and espoused support for vegetarianism, the Maximists in the Union of Britain, and the actions of Michael Collins in particular.\n\nShaw continues to write prolifically, and is considered a pre-eminent pro-Irish voice in the Union of Britain's intellectual sphere, where he has lived almost all of his professional life. His more gradualist socialist leanings withered away at the advent of the British Revolution, after his moderate Home Ruler views on Ireland shifted after the 1916 Rising. Despite his only occasional visits, he has maintained mutual admiration and close working relationships with the likes of WB Yeats and Seán O'Casey, both closely associated with the Irish nationalist movement.\n\nIn previous years, his unconventional views, let alone place of residence, made him one of Ireland's most notorious emigrés for the media and political establishment. But time, and his Nobel Prize, have softened opinions of him even from his political opposites. He remains a son of Éire, who remained true to his country as he sees it, and one whose eagerly awaited works bring no lack of discussion and intrigue."

 irelandflavour.3910.t1: "The Green, White and Orange"
 irelandflavour.3910.t2: "The Starry Plough"
 irelandflavour.3910.d1: "It is known simply as the tricolour, or, \"an trídhathach\", and is the national flag of Ireland, or \"bratach na hÉireann\". First flown in 1848 by Thomas Francis Meagher in [GetVictoryPointName_11237] City, Irish republican and later governor of Montana, it was sewn for him by a group of French women sympathetic to the Irish nationalist cause, at a time of revolution in France itself.\n\nMeagher's intended symbolism, and its inspiration from the French Tricolore, has remained unchanged in interpretation. Green for the Gaelic tradition and Roman Catholics, and orange for those Protestant followers of William of Orange, famed victor of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which lead to the entrenchment of the Protestant Ascendency. And white, representing the everlasting hope of peace and unity between both traditions. The tricoloured pattern of the flag being of course rich in association with the ideals of republicanism, liberty and revolution.\n\nDespite existing for almost eighty years, it held familiarity, but was in the background of the public consciousness for the majority of existence, only growing in stature rapidly after it was flown above the GPO in 1916. Since then it has come to represent, at first, Irish republicanism, and shortly afterwards, Ireland itself.\n\nIts critics are few. Some would point out the futility in representing a group of people, that is loyalist Protestants, on the flag of a Republic that they under normal circumstances would want no part of. More hardline nationalist critics would point out that loyalists make up one-third of the flag, despite their numbers being closer to one-sixth of the population. For the vast majority of people however, the government included, it is a symbol of Ireland, however aspirational it may be, and one of the few political matters that almost everyone can agree on."
 irelandflavour.3910.d2: "Just as the harp was once replaced by the tricolour as the symbol of Ireland, so too has that old rag, with its religious connotations, been torn down in favour of one truly capable of uniting the Irish people, the Starry Plough. Designed by the Irish Citizen Army in the months after the great Dublin lockout, the original version depicted a golden plough with a sword for a coulter and seven silver stars forming the Big Dipper, also known as the Plough, several bright stars of the constellation Ursa Major, against a green background.\n\nThe flag would see its first use being flown over the Imperial Hotel in Dublin during the Easter Rising by the ICA, and although it was once thought to have gone up in flames along with the building it flew atop as British crown forces took the city, it was in reality retrieved by T.A. Williams, a British soldier who kept it as a trophy, and after the Second Irish Revolution located and handed over as a token of the rekindled friendship between the two nations. It presently sits proudly on display at the National Museum.\n\nIn the aftermath of the British Revolution, as Irish syndicalists, stabbed in the back by bourgeois nationalists from both the pro-treaty and anti-treaty wings of Sinn Féin, got together to reorganise the Irish Citizen Army so as to someday topple the false inheritors of Irish republicanism and bring to fruition the true ideals of the Irish revolution, a new design was adopted based on the recollections of ICA veterans, in blue and more minimalistic. This goal has now been achieved and though the banner may differ from its origins, the timeless meaning accorded to it by James Connolly himself has remained the same; a free Ireland shall control its destiny from the plough to the stars."

For over a century, the only extant translation was the Bedell-O'Donnell bible, undertaken by the Protestant Church of Ireland, resulting in its denunciation at the pulpit as \"An Bíobla Gallda\", or \"the foreign bible\". Despite this troubled legacy, officially recognising this Bible would serve as a gesture of religious unity, though the Catholic Church would with no doubt disapprove.\n\nAlternatively, lest we provoke the ire of the Church and devoted Catholics, we have the option of releasing the unpublished manuscripts of Peadar Ua Laoghaire, a Catholic priest and Irish language scholar who strove in the later years of his life to translate the Bible into Munster Irish. Or, taking a third course, we could commission Earnán de Siúnta, an executive of Conradh na Gaeilge and a translator, to retranslate the Bible into modern Irish, in the hope that via presenting de Siúnta's new translation as a government-approved Bible intended for all Christian denominations, we may minimise the risk of igniting sectarian tensions and alienating sections of the Irish nation who might otherwise support our national revival."

 irelandflavour.3912.d.body: "Born on the Irish-speaking Aran Islands off the west coast, Tom spent most of his early years at home, before going to America in 1912, taking up work as a journalist. His younger brother Liam had sought to become a priest, and in 1908 headed to the mainland, where he eventually became a militant member of the Irish Volunteers.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg came, Tom had begun organising Irish labourers on the docks of Boston and New York to join the International Workers of the World, far away from the war. Liam on the other hand saw the war as an opportunity, recognising that Irishmen would need military experience to throw off the British yoke, so he enlisted in the oppressor's army under a false name. He returned home after the war, wounded and shell-shocked, but immensely proud of the news he would soon hear of the Irish War of Independence and of the French Proletarian Revolution. The horrors of the war had made him a socialist, just as the suffering of the American proletariat had motivated his brother. Both were initially partisans of Sinn Féin, but now became founding members of Roddy Connolly's Irish Syndicalist Party.\n\nIn 1920, the brothers reconnected in Boston and began developing strong passions for writing. Tom already dabbled in proletarian literature, whilst Liam was drawn to the typewriter to have something to help him cope with the war and to record stories of his travels. Though he was younger and newer to the art, Liam soon made a career out of it. His stories dealt more with the worlds of symbolism, metaphor and satire, whereas Tom's writing remained grounded in blunt political rhetoric and, after his own return to Ireland in 1934, mundane observations of rural life. Tom only managed to get a few stories published before his eventual death in 1936, leaving Liam to now carry on his older brother's struggle, both in the world of writing and in the world revolution."

 irelandflavour.3913.t: "Living on the Edge"
 irelandflavour.3913.d: "Today the government received calls to make an official statement regarding the upcoming Pan-Celtic Congress, taking place shortly on the Isle of Man. The Pan-Celtic movement could be described as a fringe position at best, calling for enhanced cooperation, cultural exchange and mutual understanding among the \"Celtic\" peoples, namely those from Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. The idea of the \"Celts\" as a separate race, as opposed to different groups of people who spoke a related group of languages, took root in the 1800s with advancements in the field of linguistics, but remains a matter of scholarly debate.\n\nWhile de facto apolitical, it is unsurprising that many of the participants in the Congress would advocate for independence, or at least autonomy, for their respective nations. They would hold the view that the Celts are an ancient race, and share solidarity with each other in their belief of their literal marginalisation by the French and English by forcing them to live on the edge of their respective landmasses, pushed up against the wild North Atlantic, and also of the severe discrimination experienced by their languages, driven almost to extinction in some cases. For most attendees of Congress however, the occasion is a light-hearted one, full of songs and stories. The evening is punctuated with the display of each nations' respective musical styles and traditions, with songs often sharing common origins, coming together in varied concurrent arrangements like some form of Celtic symphony.\n\nEven the most radical of Irish nationalists never aimed for a unified Celtic state, let alone an Irish-led one, as regardless of the debate as to where it would begin or end, or the relative lack of a shared identity, the struggle of independence alone was deemed enough. Nonetheless, the idea of some form of Celtic kinship, however tenuous, holds a certain romanticised appeal across the political spectrum, and the state's official delegation was well-received as it said as much to the attendees of the Congress."

 irelandflavour.3914.t: "Scoop of the Century"
 irelandflavour.3914.d.start: "On this day one hundred and eighty years ago, Arthur Guinness famously signed the nine thousand year lease for the premises that would become St. James's Gate brewery in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], now the largest in the world. His brand has been closely associated with Ireland for many years now, not least because of the similarity of the Guinness logo with Ireland's coat of arms, but the reputation of synonymity over the past decade has reached the extent that many writers have come to describe it as being almost emblematic of Ireland in the modern era.\n\nThe Guinness family, or originally, Mac Aonghusa and then Magennis, were an old Gaelic clan, and one of the very few which converted to Anglicanism at the time of the Reformation. They benefited from this in kind, with the wealth and prestige that came with fully integrating themselves into the Anglo-Irish cohort that ruled Ireland for most of the last few hundred years.\n\nFor a time their success was a symbol of Anglo-Irish prosperity and industry, and their dark beer became popular throughout Ireland but also the British Empire in its entirety. Profiting from this relationship, unlike most in Ireland, the Guinnesses became prominent unionists, eager to maintain and expand their commercial success into the future.\n\nThough the British revolution came as a shock to their main clientele, the company somehow seamlessly expanded its market into Mitteleuropa, where Ireland's place away from the old British and closer to the greater German sphere of influence has taken the beer to become somewhat trendy, or even chic on the continent. This change has been taken by many to be a symbol of Ireland's place in the world as an independent nation — one that has replaced the old with the new, but essentially maintained much of itself."
 irelandflavour.3914.d1: "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nThe beer continues to enjoy great success, at home and abroad. Despite its newfound popularity on the continent, some Anglophile tendencies of its owners remain, even if softened, to the extent that the beer is still in good demand for shipments to what remains of the British Empire, in some ways linking Ireland's past with its present and future."
 irelandflavour.3914.d2: "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nThe beer's ongoing popularity at home and abroad is recognised to the extent that, despite allegations of the Protestant workers being heavily favoured over their Catholic colleagues in St. James's Gate, and the family's former links to loyalism, the company is tolerated by [IRE_loc_leader_surname] and his government. To censure the company or limit production would cost Ireland in its international reputation, and the display of some amount of tolerance towards them can be shown by the new government as a sign of benevolence and assured continuity. The fondness that O'Duffy is known to have for it, of course, is besides the point."
 irelandflavour.3914.d3: "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nThe brand is one that is known throughout the world, but is one of conflicting thoughts for the government. The Guinness family did originally have Gaelic roots, and even if their conversion to Anglicanism can be tolerated, their former loyalty to Britain and ongoing Anglophilic sympathies are considered a nuisance at best, if not quite so apparent as the name of the brand itself. The act of the antecedents of the company's owners to adopt an anglicised version of their surname is one that has personally bothered Ó Cuinnegáin, who has publicly declared his consideration for forcing the company to rename itself or face nationalisation. For the moment though, they are free to call themselves as they wish, but within a few years it may be a distinct possibility."
 irelandflavour.3914.d4: "$irelandflavour.3914.d.start$\n\nThe popularity of the drink among the workers of Britain never faded, and Ireland's joining of the Internationale has been met with a rekindled interest in the beer in its neighbouring island. The highly-publicised, and fairly successful, transfer of ownership of the company from the Guinness family to its workers is one that has been held extensively by the government as evidence of both their organisationsal competence, but also non-discriminatory outlook, considering the workers at St. James's Gate are by far majority Protestant, despite the denomination being held by a minority of Dubliners. Regardless of ownership however, the name of the brand remains, and as it travelled across the British Empire, so shall it travel to workers on all corners of the globe."

Presented in fifteen-minute segments, the presenter attempts to lay down his thoughts on topics such as morality and existence, exploring ideas like \"right and wrong\", and \"human nature\", while tying the theme discussed into how it is explored in Christian teaching.\n\nThe presenter, a lecturer in Queen's University Belfast named C.S.

 irelandflavour.1.t: "Independence Day"
 irelandflavour.1.d: "On Monday, the 24th of April 1916, members of the Irish Volunteers, Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan seized key locations in Dublin and declared a free Irish republic. Vastly outmanned and outgunned by the British Army, Ireland's sons fought on for six days until nearly all were captured or killed. The execution without trial of most of the remaining leaders had a massive impact on Irish politics, and the level of popular support it brought to Irish independence was profound.\n\nThough free Ireland did not initially commemorate the Rising in a governmental capacity, that changed after the British Revolution and its subsequent repercussions on several aspects of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Now, the Irish Government recognises the Easter Rising as the first battle of the armed struggle for independence that culminated in the end of seven hundred years of British rule.\n\nConcomitant with that, the cities and towns of Ireland now swell with Independence Day festivities on each 24th of April, and the President gives an official address outside of the General Post Office in Dublin where Pádraig Pearse first proclaimed the Irish Republic."

 irelandflavour.2.d2: "With the new military-backed administration seeking to shore up its legitimacy amidst accusations of having transformed the nation into a puppet state on behalf of the Kaiser, it was decided as Easter approached once again to use the commemoration to celebrate the ties between the two nations.\n\n$irelandflavour.2.d.middle$\n\nWhile the opposition has boycotted the event, claiming the martyrs of 1916 would be disgusted at their legacy being used to promote German vassaldom, the celebration seems to achieved its purpose in easing popular unreset at the government's Germanophile allegiances."
 irelandflavour.2.d.middle: "In the lead-up to the Easter Rising, the German ship SS Libau, under the disguise of a Norwegian vessel known as the Aud, attempted to land weapons in Ireland, however it would ultimately be scuttled upon being cornered by the British in Tralee. Though a failure that would be dwarfed by more substantial arms shipments during the War of Independence, the fateful events of 1916 still hold a key place in the hearts of the Irish public.\n\nWith German diplomatic and military representatives in attendance, the captain of the Libau on that day, Karl Spindler, along with the surviving members of his crew, were greeted by enthusiastic crowds. The captain stepped onto the podium in Dublin and made speech expressing his pride in his role in the fight for Irish freedom and lauded the growing relations between the [IRE_loc_country_name] and his fatherland. After the ceremony, Spindler was awarded a medal of pure gold, and his crewmates bronze medals for their heroic deed."

She cannot see any contradiction between remembering her fallen dead, and her current geopolitical alignment, for the important thing is that Ireland chose her allies of her own accord, and now stands with them as equals rather than subjects.\n\nToday, a military parade was held to commemorate the Easter Rising of 1916, where brave Irishmen made a stand for independence and the right of Ireland to choose its own path in the world. Though now Ireland stands on the side of those it once fought, it sees itself no less for it."

 irelandflavour.4.d2: "$irelandflavour.4.d.start$\n\nThere in the midst of the chaos of that week stood tall Scottish-Irish syndicalist James Connolly, leading the forces of the Irish Citizen Army. Connolly fought for the Irish people to be free of capitalism and imperialism, a struggle all too often conflated with the idea he fought against the British people. Connolly fought against the system, not any people, as for him it wasn't about what flag that flew over Dublin Castle, but if socialism existed under it.\n\nToday, both the Irish and the British peoples fight side-by-side in that struggle against capitalism and imperialism, both having been cleansed by revolution. If Connolly could see Britain and Ireland now, participating together as members of the Internationale, he would no doubt be proud." # puppet

Today, Ireland must ensure that no syndicalists, of British or any other shade, may divide its people or take its identity from them.

 irelandflavour.6.d.start: "Armed with German guns, the Irish had ended their war of independence largely in their favour, but not totally, with six counties still under British rule and Ireland itself bound to the Empire via association with the Commonwealth. As Irish leaders looked for a way to sever the remaining ties with Britain, the initial stirrings of unrest that would lead to the British Revolution were greeted with welcome, heeding the old adage that \"England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity\". Yet as it became apparent that Britain's fall to socialism was imminent, attitudes quickly turned to alarm, for history had shown that British revolutionaries were often no friends of the Irish people.\n\nWhile the Anglo-Irish Treaty was dismantled with independence declared from the Commonwealth and the reunification of the island, the latter was only acquiescenced to by loyalists as a temporary measure against the greater evil until the \"true\" British government was restored. However, with the immediate threat of the syndicalists across the Irish Sea more pressing at the time, the possible implications of the Windsors' return to London was pushed to the back of the Irish public's minds.\n\nNow, the elephant in the living room can no longer be avoided as the Royalists who sought refuge in Canada have returned to Great Britain after two decades of exile."

 IRE_suppress_northern_industrial_action_desc: "In times such as these it is perhaps understandable that people would be swayed by ideologies promising all the answers, particularly given our proximity to one of Europe's leading syndicalist powers. Given the tense economic and social climate, these cancers cannot be allowed to develop; something that the leadership both north and south agree on. With UDP support, steps will be taken to shut down and break up potential subversive activities and keep the north working."
 IRE_allay_northern_nationalists: "Allay Northern Nationalists"
 IRE_allay_northern_nationalists_desc: "In the wake of our attempts to keep the largely loyalist establishment in Ulster on side, many nationalists in the region have felt a growing unease that the measures put in place serve little purpose other than to keep one group on top. We cannot let such an idea gain root, and should try reaching out to northern nationalists to reassure them personally, whilst also ensuring relief measures see some benefit for their communities."
 IRE_support_northern_businesses: "Support Northern Businesses"
 IRE_support_northern_businesses_desc: "While many may complain about the focus the north has received since the crash, it is simply a fact that it is the most economically important region on the island. Supporting it is essentially in the national interest, as we will not be able to fund our further growth and recovery without the economic boost that it provides."
 IRE_stabilise_punt: "Stabilise the Punt"
 IRE_stabilise_punt_desc: "With the economic uncertainty, the value of our currency has begun to fluctuate rapidly, and such a situation is untenable if we want to have any chance at recovery. By taking steps to re-stabilise the punt, we can ensure our citizenry a degree of certainty which will go a long way to ensuring their support for our recovery programme."
 IRE_empower_central_bank: "Empower the Central Bank"
 IRE_empower_central_bank_desc: "While the country has begun the first steps to stabilise the national currency and finances, if we wish to truly begin on the road to recovery we must entrust the central bank to take any steps necessary. While some of their decisions will likely be unpopular, it would project an image of responsibility to the markets and potentially ease the process of securing foreign loans."
 IRE_protect_southern_industries: "Protect Southern Industries"
 IRE_protect_southern_industries_desc: "While most associate Irish industry with the north, it would be remiss to ignore those which have managed to establish themselves outside of the north-east. It would be ridiculous to put all our eggs in one basket, to the detriment of the rest of the country. Therefore, we must work to support southern factories during this difficult period. Even if some in the north complain, they should remember the other five-sixths of Ireland exist too."
 IRE_emergency_agricultural_bailout: "Emergency Agricultural Bailouts"
 IRE_emergency_agricultural_bailout_desc: "For many Irish farmers who already struggled before Black Monday, this depression has pushed them over the edge. Threatened with having to give up this way of life forever, it is vital that the government step in to prevent a complete collapse of rural society. While the costs may be great, the risks of standing aside are still etched into the landscape from 1845."
 IRE_purchase_surplus_dairy: "Purchase Surplus Dairy Products"
 IRE_purchase_surplus_dairy_desc: "As global and domestic trade has slowed, many dairy producers have struggled to sell their stock as they previously did. This threatens to fuel a vicious cycling of downsizing operations and terminating contracts with farmers. To prevent such a situation, the government will temporarily step in and purchase extra dairy stocks. What to do with this \"government cheese\" remains to be seen, with one idea to potentially distribute it to struggling households."
 IRE_promote_beef_exports: "Promote Beef and Cattle Exports"
 IRE_promote_beef_exports_desc: "The fact is that the Irish internal market alone is not enough to support our significant cattle sector, with any profitability always maintaining an export component. While many countries are struggling in the wake of Black Monday, we must attempt to convince other nations in the merits of the Irish beef sector to keep even a fraction of the exports going."
 IRE_organise_rural_relief_work: "Organise Rural Relief Work"
 IRE_organise_rural_relief_work_desc: "While the measures implemented so far will go some ways to blunt the impact of the crash in the South, realistically it is only a bandage and will not help a significant portion of the population. Therefore we must provide for those who have lost their livelihood with a programme of rural works, allowing them to maintain income and potentially prepare themselves to get back on their feet once the situation improves."

 # Eco / Development Foci #
 IRE_renovate_rail_line: "Renovate the [GetVictoryPointName_7394]-[GetVictoryPointName_3379] Line"
 IRE_renovate_rail_line_desc: "Our aim as a government is to unify and modernise the island. An effective demonstration of this would be to expand the existing train networks linking our three largest cities, which are in need of some upgrading to meet current standards. The infrastructural benefits to our citizens are obvious, but over time this will also improve the economic and political integration in all parts of the country."
 IRE_highway_rail_maintenance_board: "The Highway and Rail Maintenance Board"
 IRE_highway_rail_maintenance_board_desc: "With our railways renovated and our tools modernised, now we need an organisation to manage our transport infrastructure and support its continued growth into the future. The Highway and Rail Maintenance Board will allow for a more coordinated and efficient approach to infrastructure development."
 IRE_raidio_eireann: "Launch Raidió Éireann"
 IRE_raidio_eireann_desc: "Our closest thing to a national radio broadcaster is a station known as Radio [GetVictoryPointName_369] run by the post office. Its broadcast is subject to regular interference and reception issues owing to its weak and outdated transmitter. With the right investment, we can revitalise this radio station as \"Raidió Éireann\", a true public broadcaster for Ireland that will reach listeners all over the island with consistency and clarity."
 IRE_ore_institute: "Form the Irish Mineral & Ore Institute"
 IRE_ore_institute_desc: "Our natural resources may not be as vast as those found on the continent, but Ireland's few coal fields are famously easy to exploit, and our limited deposits of bauxite are in high demand to construct the new aluminium-based war machines. We are in need of a centrally-run board to manage and effectively extract these resources for the continued prosperity of the nation."
 IRE_modernised_equipment: "Modernised Machine Tools & Equipment"
 IRE_modernised_equipment_desc: "Following independence, Ireland has had to support its industry on its own and this had led to us progressing slower than we would like and certainly slower than we need. It is time we modernise and invest in the latest machinery and equipment to kick-start our factories into a truly 20th century industrial mindset."
 IRE_urban_electrification: "Complete Urban Electrification"
 IRE_urban_electrification_desc: "Electricity first came to Ireland in 1880 with the first electric street lamp. Since then, the urban centres of Ireland have slowly been \"going on the electric\". This process is nearly complete, and soon we will have a fully-connected urban population, with rural electrification not being long off."
 IRE_support_aer_lingus: "Support Aer Lingus"
 IRE_support_aer_lingus_desc: "The newly founded national airline will need strong government support to expand and prosper. Operating out of Casement Aerodrome, Aer Lingus requires a robust fleet of aircraft to support travel around Ireland and across the Irish sea. Our air force will also benefit from this increased investment in air travel through modernised facilities and improved production lines."
 IRE_harland_wolff_loans: "Loans to Harland & Wolff"
 IRE_harland_wolff_loans_desc: "Harland & Wolff are world-renowned shipbuilders and have been a major employer in [GetVictoryPointName_3379] since their founding in 1861. However, since the disasters of the Olympic-class ships and the forced sale of their shipyards in Scotland they have been in a period of decline. Our generous loan will help revitalise the company and give Ireland a strong naval industry of its own."
 IRE_advanced_studies: "The [IRE_loc_dublin_abbreviation] Institute of Advanced Studies"
 IRE_advanced_studies_desc: "The idea of a dedicated research institute for Ireland has been floated on and off ever since the decline of [IRE_dunsink_gaelicised] Observatory. Modelled after the institutes for advanced studies in America, this new institute in the capital would be Ireland's premier research institution for a variety of subjects ranging from astrophysics to Celtic studies. The founding of this institute will help Ireland stand alongside the intellectuals of Europe."
 IRE_breweries_distilleries: "Support Irish Distilleries and Breweries"
 IRE_breweries_distilleries_desc: "Irish beer and whiskey is enjoyed the world over and is arguably Ireland's most famous export. The Guinness Brewery and [IRE_loc_midleton] Distillery, most famous for Guinness stout and Jameson whiskey respectively, are as import to the national character as our language or music. The pints are calling, and we shall answer with strong support now and into the future."
 IRE_mf_kent: "Expand MF Kent Chemical Operations"
 IRE_mf_kent_desc: "MF Kent, founded in [IRE_loc_clonmel], [IRE_loc_county] [IRE_loc_tipperary], has been at the forefront of Ireland's petrochemical industry with its growing contracting business. We plan to invest heavily in this company to help feed our ever-expanding dependence on oil and gas."

 IRE_industrialisation: "Pursue Industrialisation"
 IRE_industrialisation_desc: "Ireland has historically depended on agrarianism, but this is simply not enough to compete in the modern world. We will pursue a line of extensive industrialisation schemes to expand Ireland's manufacturing potential, and bring it up to speed with the industrial hubs of Europe and the world."
 IRE_urbanisation: "Urban Expansion & Modernisation"
 IRE_urbanisation_desc: "Our urban centres are one of our greatest assets, and while they are the industrial centres of Ireland, they are falling behind the rapidly expanding cities of the continent. With massive investment in new housing, shops, and industries, the cities of [GetVictoryPointName_11293] and [GetVictoryPointName_3379] will stand alongside the great cities of Europe."
 IRE_development_bank: "The Éireann Development Bank"
 IRE_development_bank_desc: "The purpose of a development bank is to have a store of funds to invest in developing businesses, or assisting those in hard times. Black Monday has shown that Ireland needs her own safety net for businesses facing hardship and the Éireann Development Bank will be just that. With these additional funds, many struggling businesses across the island can get back on their feet, stronger than ever before."
 IRE_food_processing: "Develop a Food Processing Industry"
 IRE_food_processing_desc: "Currently we export a lot of our food raw and unprocessed, often to be packaged and sold abroad. Developing our own food processing industry will allow use to export higher value products that stay fresh longer, as well as lowering costs for our trade partners."
 IRE_woolen_mills: "Expand [IRE_loc_blarney]'s Textile Mills"
 IRE_woolen_mills_desc: "Mahony's Mills located in [IRE_loc_blarney], [IRE_loc_county] [GetVictoryPointName_7394], is a large producer of high-quality Irish knitwear such as woollen throws, decorative linen and every bit of clothing vital to traditional Irish fashion. These mills have the potential to become a luxury producer and exporter of premium Irish goods and bring many new jobs to the surrounding area."
 IRE_cork_ford_factory: "Expand the [GetVictoryPointName_7394] Ford Complex"
 IRE_cork_ford_factory_desc: "The first Ford factory outside America, Henry Ford & Sons' [GetVictoryPointName_7394] plant is one of, if not the biggest employers in [GetVictoryPointName_7394]. The thriving tractor and automobile assembly lines are the main supplier of Ford vehicles in Europe and with the right investment, they can become a hub for Ford production worldwide."
 IRE_ferguson_tractors_focus: "Subsidise Ferguson Tractors"
 IRE_ferguson_tractors_focus_desc: "Ferguson-Brown Company has been looking to re-enter the European market ever since they were forced out of Britain. Ireland, as a highly agrarian nation and top importer of Ferguson tractors, would benefit hugely from more local production and someone to compete with Ford's tractor production in [GetVictoryPointName_7394]. We can subsidise construction as an investment in our future partnership."
 IRE_mclaughlin_harvey: "Support McLaughlin & Harvey"
 IRE_mclaughlin_harvey_desc: "Established in 1853 just north of [GetVictoryPointName_3379], McLaughlin & Harvey have long been the premier builders and contractors of the north. Their construction of the storehouse at St. James's Gate Brewery was well received and benefited Guinness greatly. Now being solely based in Ireland, we must support their enterprise to keep our construction projects running smoothly and efficiently."
 IRE_irish_american_investment: "Attract Irish-American Investment"
 IRE_irish_american_investment_desc: "The main appeal for Henry Ford's investment in his [GetVictoryPointName_7394] plant was his ancestral links to Ireland. Many more businesses are filled with Irish-Americans in positions of power and employment. It is possible we can leverage this Irish-American population to attract investment from these companies."
 IRE_entrepreneurs: "Foster Homegrown Entrepreneurship"
 IRE_entrepreneurs_desc: "While we have benefited greatly from foreign investment, many wish to see Ireland develop its own entrepreneurship both for economic independence and security. Focusing our attention inwards will help new businesses grow faster and allow profits to remain in Irish economy."

 IRE_agrarianism: "Maintain Agrarianism"
 IRE_agrarianism_desc: "Ireland's agrarian sector is known across the world for its resilience and quality. Despite the devastation of the Great Famine, Ireland has remained a prime agricultural exporter with high-quality beef and dairy produce. It only makes sense that we should support the expansion, modernisation, and growth of our agricultural sector to capitalise on our existing strengths."
 IRE_further_mechanisation: "Further Mechanisation Schemes"
 IRE_further_mechanisation_desc: "Since the arrival of the first diesel tractors in the 1920s, our farming efficiency has grown exponentially. With new subsidy schemes, we can expand the use of machinery greatly and free up manpower that can contribute to the other sectors of the economy or bolster the military."
 IRE_decentralise_public_services: "Decentralise Rural Public Services"
 IRE_decentralise_public_services_desc: "It may not seem like it, but Ireland is quite the diverse island in geography, culture, and demographics. Imposing a centralised, standardised provision of public services often does not meet the needs of these varied communities. Decentralisation of our public services in rural areas will allow them to better provide for communities in the way they need rather than the way we want."
 IRE_forestry: "Expand Commercial Forestry"
 IRE_forestry_desc: "Ireland was once a heavily forested island, but over the centuries this has dropped to only 10% of the land being forested. The lands that are less suitable for pastures and fields are perfectly suited to commercial forestry operations. Expansion of this fledgling industry will have a variety of benefits such as allowing local sourcing of timber and bringing a new option for export to our economy."
 IRE_sugar_beet: "Support Sugar Beet Growers"
 IRE_sugar_beet_desc: "Sugar beet has been grown and processed in Ireland since the 1840s, in places such as [IRE_loc_carlow], [IRE_loc_mallow], [IRE_loc_thurles] and [IRE_loc_tuam]. Irish men and women's love of sugar in their tea means that development of this industry will be of great benefit to our internal market, with even talks of sugar processing becoming a nationalised industry."
 IRE_fishing: "Support Local Fishing Potential"
 IRE_fishing_desc: "Ireland has a long and proud history of fishing, with many of the coastal islands depending on it entirely. From the naomhóga of the south and the hookers of the west, to the famous fishmonger Molly Malone, to the folk tales of \"An Bradán Feasa\", or the Salmon of Knowledge, fishing is ingrained in Irish culture. It only makes sense that we support and expand these fishing communities throughout Ireland and make them one of our key industries."
 IRE_rural_electrification: "Accelerate Rural Electrification"
 IRE_rural_electrification_desc: "The electrification of Ireland's urban areas has been a great success, but many rural areas still remain off the grid. It is time we accelerate the rural electrification plans to fully connect every part of our country to the phone, telegraph, and mains electric lines."
 IRE_rural_maintenance_council: "The Rural Maintenance Council"
 IRE_rural_maintenance_council_desc: "Thousands of properties in rural Ireland lie derelict or totally ruined since the famine, whether through reluctant relocation into the cities, or violent evictions perpetuated by the British forces. Many more properties are at risk of falling to the same fate if they are not maintained, which is why a unified council to maintain rural properties is vital for the survival of rural life."
 IRE_merge_smallholdings: "Merge Failing Smallholdings"
 IRE_merge_smallholdings_desc: "Irish farms were traditionally split between sons upon the owner's death, leading to small tracts of land that are often inefficient and subject to disuse. If we merge these smallholdings, taking care not to repeat the destruction caused by the Encumbered Estates Act, they can become productive modern farms and ensure our food security long into the future."
 IRE_redistribute_land: "Redistribute Underused Land"
 IRE_redistribute_land_desc: "Due to traditional and often complicated systems of inheritance, many areas of land have been in disuse for decades with the previous owners' heirs having died out or the land simply being abandoned for being unprofitable. This prime farmland will be redistributed to those that can best make use of it and hopefully increase production all across the island."

 # Gateway Foci #
 IRE_gateway: "Gateway to the Atlantic"
 IRE_gateway_desc: "Ireland's location at the meeting of the Atlantic and Europe makes it a very desirable partner for any interested party. As Germany and Britain compete for influence over our government and trade, we must play them off each other, making the most of their advances while maintaining our independence."
 IRE_gift_of_the_gab: "The Gift of the Gab"
 IRE_gift_of_the_gab_desc: "Ireland has a history of famous writers and fiery orators, and our friendliness is revered worldwide. If we can find the right people who have kissed the Blarney Stone, the meetings with German and British diplomats will go much smoother."

 IRE_new_aud: "The New Aud"
 IRE_new_aud_desc: "Ever since the ill-fated arms shipment of the Aud, and even the Asgard beforehand, Germany has been a strong partner in funding and supporting the IRA. Their support was instrumental in driving the British out of Ireland for good. We may be able to renew these arrangements to secure new arms shipments, as they continue to stave off British influence in Ireland."
 IRE_staff_college: "Lessons at the\nPrussian Staff College"
 IRE_staff_college_desc: "Prussia, and later Germany, have been long renowned for their military prowess, and this can be attributed to their highly professional army and skilled officers. As we continue to court Germany, our officers have been afforded the opportunity to study at the prestigious Prussian Staff College and get arguably the best education in military management and modern warfare."
 IRE_krupp_deal: "The Krupp Deal"
 IRE_krupp_deal_desc: "As Germany's influence grows, so too does their desire to maintain their position. They have offered a very lucrative contract with the arms manufacturer Krupp to produce whatever arms we require. This opportunity is too good to pass up, even if it will give Germany more of an oversight on our military industry than some would like."
 IRE_kws_observership: "Observership in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
 IRE_kws_observership_desc: "Since its foundation in 1911, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society has allowed for a massive expansion in the sharing of knowledge, research, and education amongst Germany and its allies. In an ever growing need to court our favour, Germany has offered us a special observer role in the society which will give our scientists and engineers full access to the forefront of military research."

 IRE_engineering_advisors: "British Engineering Advisors"
 IRE_engineering_advisors_desc: "British engineers are world renowned for the marvels they have created from steam engines, to impressive bridges, to tunnelling machines. As Britain continues its efforts to win over Ireland, they have offered to provide some advisors to oversee our construction projects. A welcome proposal, but these advisors may lead to Britain having undue influence in our construction sector."
 IRE_industrial_techniques: "Study Industrial Techniques"
 IRE_industrial_techniques_desc: "While you would be hard pressed to hear the government admit this publicly, the advantages of some syndicalist industry standards are impossible to deny. With our increasing diplomacy with Britain, now may be a good time to study these techniques and see how we can implement them in our own workplaces to improve our output."
 IRE_overlook_exports: "[IRE_loc_overlook_exports]"
 IRE_overlook_exports_desc: "[IRE_loc_overlook_exports_desc]"
 IRE_overlook_exports_main: "Overlook Unregistered Exports"
 IRE_overlook_exports_main_desc: "While in the past Britain was Ireland's biggest trading partner, they have been almost entirely replaced by Germany. While some level of trade has been maintained through the Anglo-Irish Trading Corporation, if we overlook some of the paperwork, we may be able to increase our exports massively. This is a risky manoeuvre however and would give Britain an unwanted opportunity to blackmail our government."
 IRE_overlook_exports_alt: "Increase Exports to Britain"
 IRE_overlook_exports_alt_desc: "Now that we have re-aligned with Great Britain, regardless of our new forms of government, they remain our closest neighbours and an easy trading partner. It is time that we resume exportation of Irish agricultural and light industrial goods, as there is plenty of opportunity to benefit from the demand for Irish dairy produce and beer in particular."
 IRE_inexpensive_credit: "Utilise Inexpensive British Credit"
 IRE_inexpensive_credit_desc: "The effects of Black Monday still weigh heavy on our economy and recovery has been slow. Following this, Britain has made us a generous offer to help alleviate these problems. They will give us a large loan with a low interest rate to help our economy recover. While we do need the help, giving Britain such a hold on our finances is risky."

 IRE_foreign_know_how: "Procuring Foreign Know-How"
 IRE_foreign_know_how_desc: "While our diplomats are on their trips overseas flirting with Germany and Britain, they might as well take the opportunity to visit the most modern engineers and industrialists of today and see how their experience can benefit Ireland."
 IRE_playing_with_fire: "Playing with Fire"
 IRE_playing_with_fire_desc: "As Britain's influence continues to grow, they are expressing interest in funding Ireland's industrial sector directly. While this would certainly benefit our economy, it may be giving the British too much leverage and draw us further into their sphere of influence."
 IRE_heed_hegemon: "Heeding the Hegemon"
 IRE_heed_hegemon_desc: "Germany's influence continues to grow and they are well aware of it. As they attempt to keep Ireland well within their sphere of influence, they have made an offer to directly finance the construction of some new factories, in exchange for some diplomatic concessions."
 IRE_contracts_with_rheinmetall: "Contracts with Rheinmetall"
 IRE_contracts_with_rheinmetall_desc: "As the Germans attempt to maintain their level of influence, they continue to make more offers. As part of these, they have promised a favourable contract with the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall. This would greatly benefit our army but bring with it increased German oversight."
 IRE_resource_deficit: "Solving the Deficit"
 IRE_resource_deficit_desc: "The increased foreign influence in Ireland has given us enough diplomatic nous and clout to try to seek favourable and necessary trade deals worldwide for crucial natural resources that we unfortunately have in short supply domestically — the likes of coal, oil, and steel. By finding secure and diverse import partners for these resources, we can have a small, if steady supply for years to come."
 IRE_flying_with_hawker: "Flying with Hawker"
 IRE_flying_with_hawker_desc: "Britain is eager to maintain influence in Ireland and is offering increasingly favourable terms in exchange for diplomatic favour. They promised a shipment of new fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft Limited and a free licence to produce our own, with their oversight of course."
 IRE_liffey_hydro: "Liffey Hydroelectric Scheme"
 IRE_liffey_hydro_desc: "Since building Ardnacrusha power plant with German expertise in the 20s, Ireland is no stranger to the benefits of hydroelectricity, creating what became the largest station of its kind in the world at the time. We cannot rest on our laurels however, as the demand for power has risen sharply with our ongoing modernisation. With more help from our partners abroad, we are well-placed to repeat this success and utilise the power of the river Liffey in the Wicklow mountains."
 IRE_greenest_fields: "The Greenest Fields in Europe"
 IRE_greenest_fields_desc: "Ireland's dominant position in the Atlantic compared with the rest of Europe brings with it another quality of sorts, though one often not recognised — the rain. Despite the frequent misgivings of the population, Ireland's consistent level of rainfall and temperate climate make its pastures unsurpassed for livestock, in particular cattle. The demand for Irish farm produce abroad has only grown, given the level of foreign involvement here, and we had best capitalise on it."

 IRE_foreign_meddling: "Tackle Foreign Meddling"
 IRE_foreign_meddling_desc: "The European powers are eyeing up our country, and waiting for an opportunity to draw us into their sphere of influence. They have been doing everything in the power to control our economy and our government. It is about time that we address this unwanted meddling in our country, and focus on keeping Ireland strong as an independent country."
 IRE_import_quotas: "Introduce Import Quotas"
 IRE_import_quotas_desc: "It is true that Ireland benefits greatly from cheap imports both from the economic hegemon Germany and the British ever-competing to maintain their influence, but they are undercutting our local Irish-owned businesses. We must introduce limits on what can be imported so our own businesses have a fair chance to compete, grow, and flourish."
 IRE_higher_tariffs: "Apply Higher Tariffs"
 IRE_higher_tariffs_desc: "Ireland has allowed itself to be overrun with foreign products with unfamiliar names and this can be attributed to our criminally low import duties. If we want to have full control over our economy, we must introduce new taxes on these products to discourage their purchase and profit from the ones that still enter the country."
 IRE_subsidiaries: "Authorise Establishment of Subsidiaries"
 IRE_subsidiaries_desc: "We may not be able to totally stop foreign interference in Ireland, but we can certainly take measures to control it. When the British and Germans come knocking, we will encourage them to fund an Irish subsidiary rather than set up their own directly controlled business. This will allow us to oversee and manage their economic activity, as well as reap more of the profits and keep employment up."
 IRE_target_british_goods: "Target British Industrial Imports"
 IRE_target_british_goods_desc: "Britain remains an industrial powerhouse despite their revolution, and Irish business owners have always been eager to purchase their products despite official restrictions. This, however, has led to a lack of investment in homegrown industrial enterprises. We need to put our foot down and stem the flow of these imports to allow Irish businesses to take their place."
 IRE_homegrown_ingenuity: "Harness Homegrown Ingenuity"
 IRE_homegrown_ingenuity_desc: "The best universities of Ireland can easily rival universities in America, Britain or the continent, and top-level students regularly graduate from our most prestigious institutions. Despite this, we see little benefit from these intellectuals, as the lack of opportunities in Ireland pushes them to emigrate. If we open new employment opportunities for highly-qualified scholars, we will surely see a great boost to our science base."
 IRE_unpeg_punt: "Unpeg the Punt"
 IRE_unpeg_punt_desc: "The Irish Punt has been pegged to the Reichsmark since its creation following our independence. This ties our economy to that of Germany in an unnecessary fashion and has led to significantly more hardship than we deserved after Black Monday. It is time we unpeg the Punt and become fully economically independent."
 IRE_diversify_doctrines: "Diversify the Doctrines"
 IRE_diversify_doctrines_desc: "Though our guerrilla warfare famously challenged the British army, many of our traditional military tactics are very much based on those taught to us by Germany, and are Weltkrieg-era tactics at that. If we are to maintain our independence, our military needs doctrines fit for Ireland's geostrategic situation, taken from varied international sources, in order to outmanoeuvre and outperform any threat to our island."
 IRE_compulsory_purchase: "Compulsory Purchase Orders"
 IRE_compulsory_purchase_desc: "Many British businesses still linger in Ireland, and Germany has established many more since independence. Though we appreciate the commerce, these businesses run by absentee executives give us less control over our economic affairs than we would like. We can utilise a mechanism called a \"compulsory purchase order\" to seize control of these businesses and allow them to operate under Irish owners."

 # Mil Foci #
 IRE_le_macha_incident: "The LÉ Macha Incident"
 IRE_le_macha_incident_desc: "The news of a confrontation between LÉ Macha and British naval forces in the Irish Sea has left many stunned. Some are angry and many more are afraid, wondering what the British will do next. Public fears of finding British soldiers moving through their gardens any day now may be somewhat unfounded, but the government will have to take steps to address this national shock. And perhaps this is a much needed wakeup call."

 IRE_combined_mil_idea_tt: "§COur existing military reforms will be combined into a single§! §YNational Spirit:§!"

 IRE_professional_army: "A Professional Army"
 IRE_professional_army_desc: "In the current global climate, it would be foolish to consider anything but heavy military spending, and a modern, properly-armed defence forces, as to do so would greatly weaken our capabilities to protect our independence. While the funding will be greatly increased, we will take great care to ensure it is being allocated to strengthen the nation, rather than go into the pockets of administrators."
 IRE_limited_motorisation: "Pursue Limited Motorisation"
 IRE_limited_motorisation_desc: "Developments in vehicle technology during the Weltkrieg and the years that followed have shown that motorisation is an immensely powerful resource when utilised, allowing armies to move faster than they ever could before. While motorisation efforts are expensive we can begin a small scale motorisation effort to allow us to adapt and to prepare for the wars of the future."
 IRE_learn_from_best: "Learn from the Best"
 IRE_learn_from_best_desc: "As a young army, one which has never fought in a \"true\" war, there will be many who will sneer at the Irish army. As we analyse and modify the tactics used by the great modern armed forces the world over, we must show our deriders that we are just as professional and just as capable as any continental force, that an Irish unit will fight just as well as one of the Heer. Our enemies will know when they fight us, as we send them fleeing from our troops."
 IRE_centralisation_high_command: "Centralisation of the High Command"
 IRE_centralisation_high_command_desc: "In a time of crisis, we must ensure that decisions are made effectively and in a coordinated manner, as miscommunications, mistakes or disagreements cannot be afforded when fighting potentially superior opponents. The high command must become the nerve centre for our entire military, capable of receiving information and acting on it as quickly as possible. Our staff will become a model of modern military high command, like the Prussians of yesterday."
 IRE_modernise_officer_training: "Modernise Officer Training Courses"
 IRE_modernise_officer_training_desc: "Our officers and general staff may be relatively inexperienced in the intricacies of modern warfare, but they can still be better prepared than their counterparts. We will take take steps to ensure they are kept abreast of all developments in military theory and practise, possibly even utilising our diplomatic connections to get sources straight from the horse's mouth."
 IRE_mass_adopt_radio_technology: "Mass Adopt Radio Technology"
 IRE_mass_adopt_radio_technology_desc: "Radio, when utilised effectively, has the potential to be one of the most transformative weapons of the 20th century, removing the need for unreliable networks of cables, runners or carrier pigeons. Units can receive updates in real time, even if cut off or under fire, while reconnaissance from the air or ground could prove to be invaluable against our enemies."
 IRE_enhanced_army_training_regimes: "Enhanced Army Training Regimes"
 IRE_enhanced_army_training_regimes_desc: "As an army that transitioned from an originally guerrilla force, there are discrepancies between the standards held between different units, depending on the training levels of their officers. We shall create new scale of intensive standards that every soldier in the IRA must find their place on, to ensure that when the time comes we will have no weakest links, but also to form a cadre of the best of the best."
 IRE_expand_engineer_corps: "Expand the Corps of Engineers"
 IRE_expand_engineer_corps_desc: "To fight a modern war we do not simply need men with guns, as fortifications, bridging and repairs are the difference between victory and defeat. The first Weltkrieg was won on the basis of such lessons, lessons which we can ill afford not to learn."
 IRE_na_fianoglaigh: "Na Fianóglaigh"
 IRE_na_fianoglaigh_desc: "While each soldier counts in combat, there are always units which rise above the call of duty; capable of transforming the course of battle on their own. From Napoleon's Garde Impériale to the Stoßtruppen of the Weltkrieg, units which not only perform extraordinary feats, but inspire those who stand with them. For the coming struggle we shall need such soldiers, a modern Fianna to be the heroes of this dark and uncertain age."

 IRE_people_army: "A People's Army"
 IRE_people_army_desc: "While some may disagree, the reality is that we cannot justify such high military spending in times like this. We are better suited to adopting a more cost-effective, asymmetrical style of warfare, like that which won us our freedom. Expensive over-engineered modern equipment and inflated bureaucracy would be the only result of greatly increasing funding, so let us stick with a homegrown fighting force, and improve what we are already good at."
 IRE_prepare_local_weapon_caches: "Prepare Improvised Weapon Caches"
 IRE_prepare_local_weapon_caches_desc: "Assuming supply lines were to break down, centrally distributing weapons and ammunition would be impossible. Therefore we must establish multiple channels to receive, store and produce our own weaponry. While this might add to inefficiencies and a lack of compatibility, it will ensure our supply chain is virtually unbreakable and any soldiers in the field will never be too far from a resupply."
 IRE_advanced_guerrilla_warfare: "Perfected Guerrilla Warfare"
 IRE_advanced_guerrilla_warfare_desc: "There may come a time when foreign boots march in our streets, when another flag tries to fly itself above our island. They will not be the first to think they can win, that they can stamp us out. We will begin preparing for a ceaseless guerrilla war, so that should the worst happen, we will be able to drive any invader from our island."
 IRE_revive_flying_columns: "Revive the Flying Columns"
 IRE_revive_flying_columns_desc: "The Flying Columns, small units of locals who knew the land better than any scouts, supplied by other supportive locals and free of supply issues facing a normal army, won Ireland her independence and set the standard for an effective guerrilla campaign against a more powerful force. We will revive the concept of a flying column as a official tactic, ensuring there are caches and hideouts capable of supplying rapidly mobile troops in a nationwide campaign, one even greater than 1920."
 IRE_lessons_war_independence: "Lessons of the War of Independence"
 IRE_lessons_war_independence_desc: "In many cases, the transition between the IRA flying columns and the official army of the Irish state was often little more than the addition of uniforms. Many of our officers owe their position to service in our struggle for independence, and while they are transitioning out of fighting age, those that follow them were often closely connected. We should strive to maintain this legacy of a popular patriotic force, rather than imposing a soulless continental structure."
 IRE_fortify_shannon: "Fortify the Shannon"
 IRE_fortify_shannon_desc: "Running through the centre of Ireland, the Shannon has long been an immensely important body of water. Its position running through the middle of our country has made it strategic throughout history, and it is still a rare element of natural defence to this day. We can expand on this natural defensiveness through the construction of fortifications along the shannon, turning it into a formidable obstacle to any invader trying to cross it."
 IRE_irregular_recon: "Irregular Reconnaissance Networks"
 IRE_irregular_recon_desc: "In any modern conflict, getting the best intelligence is half the battle. The leaders of the war of Independence knew this and built a network capable of outsmarting the numerically superior English forces. By replicating this strategy with modern equipment, we can turn every village, bóithrín or hilltop into a potential lookout, and ensure our enemies never have the advantage."
 IRE_consolidate_reserve_forces: "Consolidate Reserve Forces"
 IRE_consolidate_reserve_forces_desc: "Support from the greater population was the key in winning the War of Independence, if we want to win any future conflict, we must ensure that the population are similarly engaged and inspired to support a similar effort in the future. We will ensure people are trained in the tactics of guerrilla warfare, be that in supplies, intel or actual fighting. This will allow us to strengthen reserves for fighting an effective campaign."
 IRE_na_cosantoiri: "Na Cosantóirí"
 IRE_na_cosantoiri_desc: "Our history has shown the hardship and setbacks that can come from fighting numerically superior forces. Each and every time it has always come down to the bravery of those who refused to give up, who rallied and outlasted their foes. Our enemies are mortal, but our nation is eternal, holding firm like a rock to break any waves that beset it."

 IRE_refurbish_curragh_camp: "Refurbish the Curragh Camp"
 IRE_refurbish_curragh_camp_desc: "The army base in the Curragh has a long history of use, going back to the days of British rule. Over the past few years however, the facilities in the camp have begun showing their age, and the list of repair requests has been allowed to grow. We will earmark funding to refurbish and modernise the Curragh, bringing it up to modern military standards."
 IRE_adopt_new_rifle: "Adopt a New Standard Rifle"
 IRE_adopt_new_rifle_desc: "Much of our army still makes use of German or British equipment from the First Weltkrieg, some of which is even older. While these are undoubtedly reliable weapons, developments in firearms have shown that a major shift is coming towards a new generation of even more effective tools. If we fail to keep abreast of these shifts now, we may as well still be using muskets."
 IRE_comraind_legis: "Comraind Legis"
 IRE_comraind_legis_desc: "A soldier killed on the battlefield is the fault of the enemy, one who dies in the days after was killed by his own army. Creating an efficient medical corps for our army is vital to ensure that men are not unnecessarily incapacitated. More importantly than that, it might mean one more gets to come home."
 IRE_volunteer_brigades: "Promote the Volunteer Brigades"
 IRE_volunteer_brigades_desc: "While the engulfment of many of the worlds' nations in conflict has been an unquestionable tragedy, it has also shown that countless men are willing to fight and die for what they believe in, whatever the cost. As these individuals begin to return home, we should attempt to persuade them to continue that fight under their own flag, and use their experience for the greater good."
 IRE_artillery_licenses: "Purchase Artillery Licenses"
 IRE_artillery_licenses_desc: "Much of our military still uses old British and German surplus, and even that is beginning to run out. We will endeavour to acquire licenses to allow us to produce more modern artillery pieces ourselves, making us both more self reliant and modern as a fighting force. Artillery will always serve as a major component of warfare, we should not let it slip past us."
 IRE_reinforce_dmi: "Reinforce the DMI"
 IRE_reinforce_dmi_desc: "The Directorate of Military Intelligence is our first line of defence from threats both within and without, guarding against subversion and providing \"active intelligence\" on other nations. With the rise of new technologies, particularly in cryptographic computing, we risk losing our edge, this cannot be allowed to happen."
 IRE_subsidise_domestic_arms: "Subsidise Domestic Arms Workshops"
 IRE_subsidise_domestic_arms_desc: "An army that cannot supply itself will eventually lose, no matter their fighting skill. Since the decline and closure of the Royal Gunpowder Mills, once one of Europe's largest gunpowder manufacturers, we have failed to develop the weapons manufacturing of most European nations. To ensure what limited manufacturing we have alive, we must provide them with state support to keep them on their feet."

 IRE_reactivate_balla_eireannach_desc: "An Balla Éireannach, or, "The Irish Wall", was a series of fortifications began along the Irish coast, when fears of a British invasion were high. These plans were put on the back burner however, as the threat posed by the Union seemed less great than it was once feared. With the new fear prompted by the recent incident however, many are calling for these plans to be completed, giving us some much-needed fortifications facing the British."
 IRE_renovate_balla_eireannach: "Renovate An Balla Éireannach"
 IRE_renovate_balla_eireannach_desc: "With the successful completion of the original fortifications plan, many now feel secure. However the original plan shows its age, being created in a time of different military beliefs and when Ireland had less funds available for construction. With this in mind, there are plans being thought up for a new Balla Éireannach, which will be far more modern and far greater in scale than the existing elements."

 IRE_training_exercises: "Aero-nautical Training Exercises"
 IRE_training_exercises_desc: "As an island, the best defence we have is geography, as if we can keep the enemy off our shores, we will be better defended than we would be with any fortifications. In the three decades since the first powered flight, air tactics have evolved indescribably, we must ensure our pilots do not grow complacent when the time comes, as they will likely be the key which separates survival from invasion."
 IRE_support_air_corps: "Support the Irish Air Corps"
 IRE_support_air_corps_desc: "Developments across the world show us that air power will dictate the conflicts of the future, and because of this many proponents of air war in the Irish armed forces believe the time is now to reinforce and expand the fledgling Irish Air Corps. While we may not be able to go properly toe to toe with the RAF, we cannot simply give up the field to them either. By taking the fight to the skies, we can show any foe that Ireland will not simply back down from a fight."
 IRE_develop_casement_aerodrome: "Develop Casement Aerodrome"
 IRE_develop_casement_aerodrome_desc: "The air base in Baldonnel may have been sufficient for the long time, as our air capabilities grow, we are finding it increasingly at capacity and lacking of facilities. A large expansion programme, to both the training and air corps facilities, will be undertaken which will make the base capable of facilitating a number of future operations."
 IRE_expand_civil_air_defence: "Expand Civil Air Defence"
 IRE_expand_civil_air_defence_desc: "Preparation is one of the most important elements in mounting a proper anti-air defence. We will begin the creation of a connected network of air observers along our coasts, ready to update us of any incoming attacks and giving us the maximum time to prepare for the enemies arrival, or even scramble our own air units in response."
 IRE_mobile_heavy_artillery_experiments: "Mobile Heavy Artillery Experiments"
 IRE_mobile_heavy_artillery_experiments_desc: "The further expansion of our island's structural defences, as well as the renovation of our main railway lines, has led some in the military to the idea of combining the two. We will construct a single railway gun, well-suited to our large rail gauge, and name it \"An Casúr\", or \"The Hammer\", which can then traverse the new railways running along the coasts, and provide bombardment on any invaders who dare trespass, where-ever they may land."
 IRE_rotational_training_sessions: "Rotational Training Sessions"
 IRE_rotational_training_sessions_desc: "No matter how much we develop, the fact is that any enemy we face will likely be able to face us with overwhelming numbers of aircraft, we must therefore prepare for an almost round the clock assault as they attempt to rob us of air supremacy. Pilots will be \"stress-tested\" for such round the clock operations, to ensure one is ready to hop into the air as another stumbles out."
 IRE_purchase_surplus_fighters: "License Fighter Schematics"
 IRE_purchase_surplus_fighters_desc: "The spotlight will always be placed in the flashiest new designs coming out of Britain or Germany, but there are many perfectly decent fighters out there which are far more affordable for a country like Ireland, and would allow us to expand out air capabilities faster without bankrupting ourselves. We will contact other air services to ask about purchasing their surplus airframes and designs."
 IRE_maintain_army_air_support_primacy: "Maintain Army-Air Support Primacy"
 IRE_maintain_army_air_support_primacy_desc: "Air power has an important role in modern warfare, but it will be ground operations that will still be what ultimately wins wars. We must ensure that our air force is prepared to support such manoeuvres, maximising efficiency rather than some futile hope to bomb our enemies into submission."
 IRE_independent_air_operations: "Independent Air Operations"
 IRE_independent_air_operations_desc: "While accepting the fact that air power is as important as the army or the fleet will be hard for many in our high command to accept, we must show them the effects that an independent air arm has had in foreign militaries, before we find our home under assault from an enemy we have no defence against."
 IRE_coastal_bombing_exercises: "Coastal Bombing Exercises"
 IRE_coastal_bombing_exercises_desc: "Building ships is prohibitively expensive, and the new technology of aircraft has proven itself to be a far more cost effective addition to naval strategy. We could use this technology to level the playing field. Patrolling and defending our massive waters with a modern fleet of naval aircraft, to do this though we must first train pilots for such an endeavour."
 IRE_bolster_coast_guard: "Bolster the Coast Guard"
 IRE_bolster_coast_guard_desc: "Currently the Irish maritime force is very weak, and this weakness was highlighted by the Incident with the LÉ Macha. We must invest more heavily into this area in order to ensure that such an incident does not happen again. While this will likely take some time, it will finally give our island the ability to defend its shores."
 IRE_naval_college: "Establish the [GetVictoryPointName_7394] Naval College"
 IRE_naval_college_desc: "Currently many of our officers receive training overseas, and even then it is rather rudimentary. In order to train officers properly versed in naval warfare, we will create a naval college near our main naval base in [GetVictoryPointName_7394]. This will begin turning out graduates who are well versed in the realities of combat at sea, and are able to lead the sailors under their command properly."
 IRE_submarine_focus: "Strike Under the Waves"
 IRE_submarine_focus_desc: "There is no real way for us to compete with Britain in surface warfare, as their advantages in resources and time make it virtually impossible to alter that balance. Submarines however, are another matter. German U-Boats were able to effectively wreak havoc with the British trade network during the Weltkrieg, as we saw ourselves off Kinsale. With the far more advanced submarines of today, we are well-positioned to strike fear into any British sailor within range."
 IRE_as_warfare: "A/S Warfare Exercises"
 IRE_as_warfare_desc: "Our island has its natural advantages, but there is a danger that we could simply be cut off from the resources we need to survive. The perils of being unprepared to combat such tactics was shown to us during the first Weltkrieg, unless we wish to suffer the same fate the British did, we must be prepared to fight undersea threats."

However, unlike the German puppet states carved out of the East or the Frankenstinian unions given life by British Revolution; we can boast ourselves as being able to choose our own destiny and course. While our island lacks industrial or military might, our location makes us an invaluable asset. We will choose allies who recognise this, allies whom we can stand with as equals."

 IRE_cogadh_deiridh: "An Cogadh Deiridh"
 IRE_cogadh_deiridh_desc: "In our struggle against imperialism and occupation, an Cogadh na Saoirse, or the War of Independence, represented part of the global effort of the common people to overthrow the old oppressive order, and while we may have drifted from the path in the intervening years, we are no longer blind to our common cause with those who fight for the liberation of all mankind.

 IRE_exalt_republicanism: "Exalt Republicanism"
 IRE_exalt_republicanism_desc: "Since 1798, the fight for a republican system of government has been a core part of our national identity. Unlike others we have not felt the need to define ourselves around some distant monarch, we have always known that this country belongs to her people. We should display this history proudly as we now stand alongside our fellow republics in London and Paris; we have carried the torch of republicanism for so long, never wavering until all nations are free."
 IRE_workers_solidarity: "Workers' Solidarity"
 IRE_workers_solidarity_desc: "In truth, there is no such thing as an Irish, British or French struggle, there is only one struggle; between the common people and those who stand against them. Throughout our history, we have been stepped on time after time, constantly engaged in a battle to choose our own destiny. We must recognise that we are not alone in suffering such abuses, abuses which many are not yet free from. \"Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine — We live in each others shadows.\""
 IRE_hoches_return: "General Hoche's Return"
 IRE_hoches_return_desc: "In 1796, the young French Republic aimed to send an expedition to Ireland in order to assist in our ultimately failed attempt at revolution. While it may have failed, it demonstrates the continuous friendship and common cause which the people of Ireland and France have held for each other. We now find ourselves standing together once again, and finally Irishmen and Frenchmen can fight together in the name of liberty, with the spirit of General Hoche leading them to victory."
 IRE_red_washington: "A Red Washington"
 IRE_red_washington_desc: "Ireland's bond with America is a strong and deep rooted one, and is now even more ingrained now that we have both fully embraced the future that is socialism. And due to this bond, despite America's devastation in their civil war, we can count on their assistance in better preparing our nation for the inevitable conflicts against the reactionaries who wish to deprive us of such a future."
 IRE_liberation_of_europe: "The Liberation of Europe"
 IRE_liberation_of_europe_desc: "Through the arduous effort of all those who have fought for the revolution, especially those from our humble little isle, we have at last slayed the German menace and rid the world of the greatest threat to the socialist cause. The people of the nation may now rest easy knowing that no matter what is thrown against us, Ireland and it socialist cause shall weather it with ease."

 IRE_gallant_allies: "Gallant Allies in Europe"
 IRE_gallant_allies_desc: "It was the Germans who aided Pearse, Connolly and the heroes of 1916, and they have continually shown us respect and friendship since independence. In many ways the Ireland we have built for ourselves could not exist without the order which the Germans have forged since the collapse of the British and French Empires. It is not so much a repayment as a recognition of the fact that we are stronger together, and that together we can make a better, more prosperous future."
 IRE_expand_coastal_batteries: "Expand Coastal Batteries"
 IRE_expand_coastal_batteries_desc: "While we may be firmly a part of the Mitteleuropa, geographically we are situated on the continent's westernmost edge, blocked from our allies by the mighty fleets of the syndicalist powers. Therefore it is necessary that we prepare to defend ourselves from seaborne attack by expanding pre-existing coastal defence networks, turning ourselves into an impenetrable rock on Europe's Atlantic flank."
 IRE_joint_exercises: "IRA-Heer Joint Training Exercises"
 IRE_joint_exercises_desc: "The Heer and IRA are very different forces, one rooted in tradition, the other largely composed of men brought to the fore by a popular uprising. Despite this, both have proved capable of working together. In light of our increased friendship, many in our high command have proposed that this be expanded to full joint exercises, allowing our troops to learn from the most effective army on the continent, while also publically demonstrating the strength of our friendship."
 IRE_host_germans: "Host German Leadership"
 IRE_host_germans_desc: "As part of their new continental order, keeping on the good side of the Germans has proved an important skill for every member of the Mittteleuropan Bloc, with the fate of entire nations being forged based on the skill of individual diplomats at pleasing the egos of Berlin's representatives. Ireland, as a more distant member of the group, must work particularly hard to stay relevant, and ensure we can find an relationships which suits both of us perfectly."

 IRE_better_the_devil: "Better the Devil You Know..."
 IRE_better_the_devil_desc: "To many in Irish society, and even within our government, there is some discomfort around the idea of closer cooperation with the British exiles in Canada. The legacy of the Black and Tans is fresh in the minds of many, not to mention the awkward fact that many Conservative exiles continually insist that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. However we cannot let our troubled past blind us to the future. We should aim to build a common future, together."
 IRE_anglo_irish_connections: "Anglo-Irish Connections"

While these Anglo-Irish are typically associated with the elite in our society, they exist at all levels, reflecting the close ties which existed between our islands prior to the independence and the revolution. In spite of all that has happened, many of these Anglo-Irish exiles maintain strong connections with Ireland; and could potentially be a valuable ally at the court in Ottawa."

Yet times have dramatically changed from a king last ruled Britain, and the Irish nation has emerged as a full fledged independent nation on the global stage.

 IRE_new_triple_alliance_desc: "Japan, America, and Ireland. Three nations, across three continents. Yet, each has shown a firm commitment to the cause of democracy, in a time when so many have not. When America fell into disarray, democracy held firm in Japan and Ireland, aiding its followers in America who eventually triumphed.

 IRE_forced_autarky_desc: "For a nation that has been so firmly tied to Mitteleuropa for much of its existence since independence, the sudden shockwave of its collapse is something that was impossible to truly prepare for. Yet we do not have time to dwell on the past, and we must now prepare the nation for a future in which the only industry Ireland can truly rely on is one that we ourselves have full control over, and immediately set out to produce as many armaments as possible to ensure our continued survival."
 IRE_post_german_world: "The Post-German World"
 IRE_post_german_world_desc: "It is hard to remember a world that was not guided by the German hegemony, even for the many old enough to have experienced such a time first-hand. Yet with the sundering of their once great empire, we have been forced back into such a world once more, and so we must ensure that our state is ready to step forth into it, lest we too fall victim to such injustice."

 IRE_aontacht_na_gceilteach: "Aontacht na gCeilteach"
 IRE_aontacht_na_gceilteach_desc: "Against all odds, the spirit of the Gaels has achieved what many doubted could ever be possible: the liberation of the Celtic people under our nation's banner. Yet if we wish to one day see our newly established confederation evolve into a truly unified Celtic nation, we must first see about establishing a unified governing body for the confederation under Irish guidance to set forth a unified agenda for all its members."
 IRE_oglaigh_na_gceilteach: "Óglaigh na gCeilteach"
 IRE_oglaigh_na_gceilteach_desc: "While they may certainly be eager to fight for the Celtic conception of life, many of the military leaders of our fellow member states are certainly rough around the edges when it comes to their actual prowess, to put it lightly. Although it will certainly take time to properly hone their skills, we can easily put them on the right track by arranging unified Celtic military exercises, something even our own generals are bound to learn a few new tricks from."
 IRE_constructing_confederal_market: "Constructing a Confederal Market"
 IRE_constructing_confederal_market_desc: "A nation is not truly sovereign if it must rely on the economic capabilities of its peers to function. To that end, it is vital that we immediately begin work on the formation of a much more interconnected Celtic market, so that one day the economy of a unified Celtic nation may stand on its own two feet, free from foreign domination."
 IRE_forged_united_by_blood: "Forged by Blood, United by Blood"
 IRE_forged_united_by_blood_desc: "A nation is not born overnight, and few among us will likely see the day where an integral and undivided Celtic state is finally a reality, but the seeds of tomorrow must be planted today. If we wish to ensure that these seeds are properly nurtured into a shared Celtic identity, there is no better fertiliser than the spilled blood of our people in honour of the nation, and no better farmland than the fields of war."
 IRE_king_of_celts_focus: "King of the Celts"
 IRE_king_of_celts_focus_desc: "Although the scourge of republicanism and decadent concepts of a modern nation have blinded many to a monarch's true role, we see it clearly. For no matter what clan or tribe one may belong to, a King stands above all as a beacon for his subjects, uniting even the most discordant of people. And thus, to help unify all of our race, we shall declare our King the ruler of all the Celtic nations within our great confederation and King of all Celts."

 IRE_elections_focus: "The 1937 Election Campaign"
 IRE_elections_focus_desc: "As Ireland prepares to go to the polls, the 1937 elections looks set to be one of the most consequential elections since Independence. Threats of political violence and the northern question loom large in the public mind, with many feeling like the recent crash has destroyed the consensus of Irish politics. With radicals demanding an overhaul of the entire system, this vote has the potential to reshape Ireland."

 IRE_combined_pol_idea_tt: "§COur existing political reforms will be combined into a single§! §YNational Spirit:§!"

 IRE_labour: "The Cause of Labour"
 IRE_labour_desc: "When Ireland first gained her independence, her people were promised the equality and standard of living which they had been denied for so long. The nation was given a chance to right the damage wrought by centuries of colonial rule. As James Connolly said, the cause of labour has always been the cause of Ireland. If the Labour party can succeed in implementing his vision, Ireland will finally achieve true freedom."
 IRE_workers_rights: "Codify Workers' Rights"
 IRE_workers_rights_desc: "In the decades since independence, the Irish state has largely viewed Unions with suspicion, believing them to be some form of fifth column within our ranks, and that any activism was effectively treason. Any demands for change, no matter how moderate, were largely rejected due to a fear of \"feeding the crocodile\". It is time to change this, as making reasonable concessions to Unions not only keeps them happy, but would also improve the health and happiness of our people."
 IRE_workers_rights_tt: "Unlocks £decision_icon_small §YRelief Works§! decisions, which can be used to eventually remove §YBlack Monday§!."
 IRE_democratic_programme: "Reiterate the Democratic Programme"
 IRE_democratic_programme_desc: "An Clár Oibre Poblacánaighe, was created by the first Dáil in the heady days of our revolution as a statement of values. It declared that the new Irish state would be one where all would have equal access to opportunities. It promised public ownership of production as well as the provision of welfare to the most vulnerable in society. Ultimately, Sinn Féin left these promises to the wayside, and it is time for the Labour party to take up this torch once again."
 IRE_reassure_clergy: "Reassure the Clergy"
 IRE_reassure_clergy_desc: "In the previous status-quo of Irish politics, a working relationship developed between the government and the Catholic Church. Given the central role the clergy plays in most Irish villages, damaging these ties is not an option. We must assure the church that despite our different approach to politics, we have no interest in waging a war on the church as socialists have done elsewhere. Friendly church ties will not only increase support for our reforms, but also aid in their implementation."
 IRE_coop_businesses: "Facilitate Cooperative Businesses"
 IRE_coop_businesses_desc: "One of the great problems with the Irish economy is that it is dominated by small enterprises and farmers which will never have the necessary scale to be innovative. One way we can begin to change this is by encouraging the growth of cooperatives. These could finally allow us to break the stagnation afflicting many Irish towns, while demonstrating the benefits in a more public ownership of wealth."
 IRE_student_exchanges: "Expand Student Exchange Programmes"
 IRE_student_exchanges_desc: "As a small nation, our universities struggle to compete against the great institutions of Europe, limiting the potential for innovation. By expanding ties and exchanges with our fellow colleges all across the continent, the students we send can return home inspired by the technological and social progress made elsewhere, eager to implement their ideas at home."
 IRE_harbingers_equality: "Harbingers of Equality"
 IRE_harbingers_equality_desc: "When our first Republic was declared, the signatories promised that all citizens would have access to equal rights and opportunities. During these revolutionary years, women played a core role in the struggle, proving many outdated notions for the idiocy they were. And yet in the years since independence, we have forgotten our part in the feminist struggle. We must take up this banner once again, and give the women of Ireland the voice and power they deserve."
 IRE_affordable_housing: "Provide Affordable Housing"
 IRE_affordable_housing_desc: "Shelter is one of the core human needs, without it it is impossible to have any quality of life. Across our island, particularly in the cities, many have been consigned to unsafe and unhygienic tenements. We should speed up existing rehousing projects, replacing the slums and tenements with new modern apartments; preserving urban cores while also allowing us to expand services."
 IRE_consolidate_coalition: "Consolidate the Coalition"
 IRE_consolidate_coalition_desc: "While our government was somewhat shaky, the hard work of governing has shown all members what their colleagues are truly made of. Eventually a tentative respect began to grow between ministers, as they realised they would need to get used to the new order. By sitting down with our partners, we can hopefully work out the last few kinks in the arrangement; providing the people of Ireland with the stable and effective government they deserve."
 IRE_welfare: "The Foundations of a Welfare State"
 IRE_welfare_desc: "More than almost any other people, the Irish have seen the trauma and pain which can be inflicted by a government that does not care. With this experience, we must guard ourselves against repeating it on ourselves. By creating a state which looks after its most vulnerable citizens, we can provide our people with hope that tomorrow will be better than today and give them a nation they can be proud of."
 IRE_loans_small_farmers: "Loans for Small Farmers"
 IRE_loans_small_farmers_desc: "While the campaigns of land reform have seen a significant democratisation of land ownership, it has also come with downsides. The most obvious among these is the fact that many small farms have failed to innovate due to a lack of capital. By easing access to funds, we can help rural areas from slipping back into a cycle of stagnation and emigration."
 IRE_tillage_farming: "Promote Tillage Farming"
 IRE_tillage_farming_desc: "Since the days of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, livestock has dominated the Irish psyche. They were the measure of wealth in Gaelic society, while later landlords focused on turning farmland to pasture to maximise profit. This model has largely continued since their departure. We should aim to reverse this trend and encourage the planting of crops, particularly in the East where the climate and soil are ideally suited."
 IRE_voice_rural: "The Voice of Rural Ireland"
 IRE_voice_rural_desc: "For much of modern Irish history, the rural areas have typically been seen as being secondary to the pace of political life. On the other side, many in these areas felt neglected and forgotten by the political class; particularly given a lack of significant improvements since independence. With our recent reforms, we have shown these areas that their voices do matter, and their government works for them too."
 IRE_reform_banking_sector: "Reform the Banking Sector"
 IRE_reform_banking_sector_desc: "Rather than staking our future on questionable new models, we should work on improving the one we already have. By working with the banking sector to address weaknesses and encourage lending; we can ensure our people receive the maximum benefit."
 IRE_moderating_influence: "The Moderating Influence"
 IRE_moderating_influence_desc: "Many, especially among the upper class and Protestant communities, are sceptical of change, arguably for good reason, as many of the most recent Irish political upheavals have left them on the backfoot. We will aim to show that this time, they have a party which at least understands their concerns, and will prevent any radical excesses."
 IRE_agri_mechanisation: "Grants for Agricultural Mechanisation"
 IRE_agri_mechanisation_desc: "On most Irish farms, it is still common to see animals performing the brunt of the hard work, with modern machinery typically remaining a rarity. The labour saving which these can provide arguably outweigh any initial capital costs, however these are often too high for the average farmer to afford. By providing low-interest grants to cover part of the cost, we could allow many farmers to dramatically improve their output almost overnight."

 IRE_sinn_fein: "Sinn Féin Amháin"
 IRE_sinn_fein_desc: "In spite of recent challenges, Sinn Féin have held on to power following the recent elections. With their mandate reaffirmed, they can now turn to addressing perceived challenges to state stability. Most expect closer ties to Mitteleuropa and a general unwillingness to tamper with the consensus which has dominated Irish society under Collins."
 IRE_special_criminal_court: "Establish the Special Criminal Court"
 IRE_special_criminal_court_desc: "As a nation born from crisis, the founders of the modern Irish state were conscious that the state required mechanisms to deal with threats which regular courts could not. Under our Constitution, special courts can be established to protect the rule of law, ruling in secret and composed of non-judicial panels. While many criticise it as an affront to basic rights of fair trial, those rights are meaningless without our state to preserve them."
 IRE_crackdown_propaganda: "Crackdown on Extremist Propaganda"
 IRE_crackdown_propaganda_desc: "With our newly empowered courts, we can turn them towards the many threats to the stability of our republic. Extremists on the left and right, many of whom have direct ties to foreign governments, cannot be allowed to lurk in the shadows any more. Few will miss these radicals and even fewer will rush to defend them. Once the ringleaders are removed, the threat itself should hopefully enough to scare others."
 IRE_intelligence_networks: "Revitalise Intelligence Networks"
 IRE_intelligence_networks_desc: "With the most concrete threats now eliminated or sidelined, efforts must be made to ensure more weeds cannot sprout. Dusting off his old spying networks and skills from the War of Independence, the Big Fellow will oversee the expansion and modernisation of our domestic and foreign intelligence services to preserve constant vigilance and perhaps remind potential dissidents that it would be in their best interest to find a new hobby."
 IRE_united_behind_president: "United Behind the President"
 IRE_united_behind_president_desc: "Division is perhaps the word which defines our generation; from the collapse of great empires to the political questions tearing nations apart, it increasingly feels as if the centre cannot hold. We create a society free of divisions, where all stand united behind our president. \"Ní neart go cur le cheile\" — There is no strength without unity."
 IRE_delegate_responsibilites: "Delegate Executive Responsibilities"
 IRE_delegate_responsibilites_desc: "Under Collins, Ireland has seen power increasingly centralised around the president, to perhaps the detriment of the rest of government. This has been thrown into sharp release by his recent ousting from power with few if any genuine contenders to fill his appropriately large shoes. In order to ensure smooth functioning of government, some of these must be returned back to the various Aireachtaí."
 IRE_relax_requirements: "Soften Irish Language Requirements"
 IRE_relax_requirements_desc: "For many, Irish nationalism is inseparably tied to our language and its revitalisation. That is why since independence, proficiency in the Irish language has been a requirement to hold most positions in the public service. These requirements have been continually criticised by members of our British community, who regard it as discriminatory. In an effort to keep them on side, we will relax requirements for public jobs operating in the north."
 IRE_party_cooperation: "Encourage Inter-Party Cooperation"
 IRE_party_cooperation_desc: "Given wide ideological differences that exist in the Dáil, it can be forgotten that many parties still believe in common-sense policies. By consulting in advance, we can make sure that votes in the Dáil don't simply turn into a clash of the government vs the opposition; preserving it as a body which actually works for the people."

 IRE_civilian_military: "Reinforce Civilian & Military Ties"
 IRE_civilian_military_desc: "In many ways, independent Irish society is inseparably tied to martial ideas. Almost anyone can name somebody who served in the armed struggle for our freedom. A willingness to fight and die for Ireland like the heroes of 1916 is a belief professed by schoolboys. We should aim preserve this connection, so that people never forgets that we as a people, have and must always fight for our culture and values."
 IRE_balance_budget: "Balance the Budget"
 IRE_balance_budget_desc: "In spite of the claims made by some bleeding hearts, the only way out of this crisis is basic economics. Spending must be cut, and revenues must be raised. While obviously it will be unpopular, and hard for many in the short term. They will learn to be grateful when we return to prosperity at a faster pace."

 IRE_uphold_privileges_IRE: "Uphold the Ulster Privileges"
 IRE_uphold_privileges_IRE_desc: "In light of recent instability, many expected that the set of political arrangements known as the \"Ulster Privileges\" would no longer be fit for purpose. In reality however, despite their many issues, the privileges have managed to largely preserve a relative peace and stability in the region, one where many understandably do not wish to be a part of our nation."
 IRE_uphold_privileges_GER: "Preserve Northern Liberties"
 IRE_uphold_privileges_GER_desc: "Though Sinn Féin viewed political arrangements with loyalism as the key to peace on the isle, their new military backers regard such concessions with detestation, and with martial law in place throughout the north control the province with an iron and often discriminatory fist. Nonetheless, the President's past service to the nation still counts highly in their eyes, and this could be leveraged to persuade the top brass to relax their grip."
 IRE_natural_party: "The Natural Party of Government"
 IRE_natural_party_desc: "The fact that our party survived this crisis demonstrates that many within our nation rightfully see us as the most effective part to rule this nation, as they have since the days of An Chéad Dáil. While opposition will obviously continue to exist, and perhaps even occasionally govern, they will always be remembered as temporary intermissions. Irish politics will be defined by us, and cannot exist without us."
 IRE_law_order: "Maintain Law & Order"
 IRE_law_order_desc: "If we do not have stability, we functionally have nothing, and the people of Ireland support us because they know we are the only ones who can guard against the sickness of crime and chaos. With the growth in crime and extremism following the crash, we must make it clear such behaviour will not be tolerated in our state."
 IRE_advanced_technology: "Develop Advanced Technological Areas"
 IRE_advanced_technology_desc: "While the image Ireland traditionally conjures up is that of a traditional rural society, the reality is that many eastern cities have achieved a level of development closer to that of the continent. By focusing future development here, it should hopefully trickle the benefits down to rural areas, and provide incentive for increased urbanisation."

 IRE_benefits_mitteleuropa_me_desc: "Our membership to Mitteleuropa is often unappreciated for the benefits it provides, allowing our export-focused economy to participate in the largest economic bloc in the world. By expanding profitable export routes to the German sphere, our finances can hopefully benefit massively."
 IRE_benefits_mitteleuropa_not_me: "Mitteleuropan Rapprochement"
 IRE_benefits_mitteleuropa_not_me_desc: "We may no longer be members of Mitteleuropa, but that has done nothing to change our geography. We are still an island off the coast of a continent, and it is with this continent that we continue to form trade links with, as the countries that we previously worked with can be approached once more, and perhaps business can resume as normal."
 IRE_religious_pluralism: "Promote Religious Pluralism"
 IRE_religious_pluralism_desc: "While Irish and Catholic are often seen as being one and the same, it conceals the levels of religious diversity that exist in this Island. Across this Island, from Derry to Cork, communities of Catholics and Protestants live side by side, with varying levels of suspicion and peace. We should aim to stress our common brotherhood as Irishmen and women, as the signatories of the proclamation envisioned."
 IRE_espouse_cosmopolitanism: "Espouse Cosmopolitanism"
 IRE_espouse_cosmopolitanism_desc: "As an extremely patriotic society, the \"Irishness\" of our population is frequently stressed both officially and unofficially. Considering this, it can be easy to forget how many different communities call this island home. From Ulster-Scots in Antrim, to Jews in Dublin, to the recent arrivals from Germany and allies providing technical expertise. We should stress this modern, tolerant ideal for our nation, to highlight that we are not some insular, distrustful backwater."

 IRE_saorstat_criostuil: "The Christian Republic"

 IRE_memory_of_sixteen: "The Memory of 1916"
 IRE_memory_of_sixteen_desc: "Though many tie Collins to the armed struggle for our independence, they should not forget that it was De Valera who was a leader during that fateful week in 1916 where in some ways it all began, and that he only escaped the firing squad by chance.

 IRE_special_position_desc: "Denying that the Catholic Church holds a special position in Irish society and identity would be akin to denying that the sky is blue. It is not zealotry or superstition, it is a fact. This of course does not mean we discriminate against other faiths, but even they cannot deny there is one faith separate from the rest."
 IRE_catholic_social_teaching: "Uphold Catholic Social Teaching"
 IRE_catholic_social_teaching_desc: "Through various papal encyclicals, the Catholic Church has created a wide range of statements on the ways in which Catholics and Catholic societies should aim to government themselves. Encouraging a respect for all, and to aid in the betterment of the conditions experienced by the weakest in society. While some may dislike this focus on explicitly Catholic principles, the social good in favour would make it a crime not to."

 IRE_not_houses_but_homes_desc: "While those on the left wish to solve the problem of urban squalor through flats and blocs, they ignore how soulless these places are for their inhabitants. What those in poverty need are places which improve their souls as well as their health, with greenery and space to provide peace of mind. New estates springing up on the edge of cities provide an example to replicate."
 IRE_northern_conservatives: "Appeal to Northern Conservatives"
 IRE_northern_conservatives_desc: "While many in the north do not look particularly favourably on our emphasis on Catholic teachings, there are many who have at least some agreement with our more common-sense politics and willingness to avoid moving in lock-step with the Germans. By elevating these less extreme voices, we can win ourselves some new allies in the northern part of this island."
 IRE_small_manufacturers: "Subsidise Small Manufacturers"
 IRE_small_manufacturers_desc: "While Collins and co. may have been allies of big industry, they have left smaller producers outside the cities by the wayside.

 IRE_promote_exports: "Promote Exports Abroad"
 IRE_promote_exports_desc: "The small size of our population and the relative poverty in many regions means that our producers cannot really sustain themselves on the domestic markets alone. We have to therefore make an effort to promote the quality of Irish products abroad, through advertising campaigns akin to those pioneered by Guinness."
 IRE_rural_work_schemes: "Expand Rural Work Schemes"
 IRE_rural_work_schemes_desc: "For many in rural areas, there are vast periods of time spent without any real work beyond farming and fishing; particularly those which do not directly inherit land. This is one of the primary reasons that our rural areas suffer such stagnation and emigration.

 IRE_protectionism: "Protect Irish Industries"
 IRE_protectionism_desc: "In an increasingly globalised world, it is easy for smaller economies to be overwhelmed by the great manufacturers which can match and surpass them on cost and quality.

 IRE_empower_county_councils: "Empower the County Councils"
 IRE_empower_county_councils_desc: "The centralisation seen during the Collins era is an extremely foolish path, considering the regional disparities which exist in Ireland.

 IRE_gaeltacht_monopolies_desc: "The Gaeltacht areas of our country arguably exist outside of modern capitalism, where the levels of poverty and opportunity have resulted in barter remaining an effective part of life. For many, they see no jobs and no future beyond emigration. If we do not help them, our language is doomed to extinction. As artisan, high-value crafts are one of the few potential industries that can be fostered here, we must provide specific protections to products produced in the Gaeltachtaí."
 IRE_price_controls: "Implement Price Controls"
 IRE_price_controls_desc: "While supply and demand are an obvious core part to basic economic theory, our own history has shown the dangers of allowing people to profit from times of intense scarcity.

 IRE_shared_future_desc: "For the first time in years, there is some hope building in the people of Ulster that things are about to get better. This is not to deny that there are huge amounts of work that lie ahead, or even that the actions of the past have been forgotten. But together we can try to build the nation embodied by our flag, two distinct communities, building a future as promising as our past is proud."
 IRE_economic_integration: "Mitteleuropean Economic Integration"
 IRE_economic_integration_desc: "While many are likely not particularly happy about it, the geopolitical reality is that our economy and foreign policy is becoming increasingly aligned with Germany. While we can try to fight it, eventually it would be akin to fighting the tide. By working to integrate ourselves now, we can find an early niche within the German bloc."
 IRE_guardian_of_atlantic: "Guardian of the Atlantic"
 IRE_guardian_of_atlantic_desc: "Situated on the Western Approaches to Europe, our island is a crucial requirement for control of the Atlantic and its vital trade routes. Through investment in maritime and aerial expansion, we can effectively turn ourselves into an unsinkable aircraft carrier; capable of striking all the way out into the mid-Atlantic, while also becoming nearly immune to invasion."
 IRE_restoration_sovereignty: "Restoration of Sovereignty"
 IRE_restoration_sovereignty_desc: "While recent events have seen us become increasingly tied to Germany, we should never forget who we are. We are not some artificial client state sliced from a dying empire; filled with people who feel no connection to their own flag. We are a proud people, who have never knelt for anyone, that is not about to change now. They should remember that in Irish, there are no submissive greetings, there is only \"A Chara\" — Friend."

 IRE_aontas_naisiunta: "God Save Ireland"
 IRE_aontas_naisiunta_desc: "For over a decade, slavish parliamentarian governments have failed their duty to Ireland, allowing loyalists and syndicalists to trample over the dignity of the Irish people unopposed. With their incompetence having nearly driven the nation to catastrophe, true Irish patriots have finally wrested control from their hands, to avert disaster and return the country to its rightful glory."
 IRE_silence_opposition: "Silence the Opposition"
 IRE_silence_opposition_desc: "The West Britons and crypto-syndicalists we deposed for their treasonous acts continue to agitate against our government, seeking to poison the populace with their lies. It is time we shut these agitators and their relentless calumnies up, and make firewood out of all their newspapers and political propaganda."
 IRE_martial_law: "Declare Martial Law"
 IRE_martial_law_desc: "With the country in a state of such upheaval and the loyalties of the civil authorities potentially uncertain, there is no alternative but to introduce martial law. None are more fit to restore order to the streets, and judge those who would do the nation and its people harm, than the men in arms who have sworn to defend Ireland with their life's blood if need be."
 IRE_arm_gardai: "Arm the Gardaí"
 IRE_arm_gardai_desc: "So far the Gardaí have been left unarmed by the state, critically handicapping law enforcement's ability to deal with criminal and subversive elements. Mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent, and so no longer will we be soft on crime and hold back against the low-lifes who would prey on decent law-abiding Irish men and women."
 IRE_northern_catholics: "Empower Northern Catholics"
 IRE_northern_catholics_desc: "During the British Revolution, we had the chance to militarily reclaim the six counties, yet it was by selling out to loyalism that Collins' government achieved reunification, turning a blind eye to their discrimination against the Catholics of Ulster, our own flesh-and-blood, in the name of \"peace\". Unlike those traitors, we will no longer stand idly by as our northern brethren are oppressed."
 IRE_clergy_support: "Gain Ecclesiastical Support"
 IRE_clergy_support_desc: "Despite the pious nature of the Irish people, our relationship with the Church's hierarchy is a complex one, with the latter being often overly moderate on the national question. Nonetheless, by courting the friendship of the Primate of All-Ireland, Joseph MacRory, an Ulster Catholic who like us holds a fervent dislike of loyalism and syndicalism, we can ensure the Church takes a favourable view of our regime."
 IRE_red_scare: "The Second Irish Red Scare"
 IRE_red_scare_desc: "While the British Revolution caused much alarm, the Irish people over the following years have taken the status quo for granted, growing complacent to the threat of invasion by our age-old enemy to the east, or of subversion at home by red traitors on their payroll. We must renew our crackdown on all signs of syndicalist infiltration in our midst, from the unions to the universities."
 IRE_legitimise_blueshirts: "Legitimise the Blueshirts"
 IRE_legitimise_blueshirts_desc: "The National Guard, popularly known as the Blueshirts, have quite the mixed reputation among the people, ranging from hired political thugs to heroic defenders of the northern Catholic community. We shall build upon the latter view and lessen the former, by elevating the organisation to the status of a semi-official militia, who will serve as Ireland's vanguard against the nation's foes."
 IRE_end_class_war: "End the Class War"
 IRE_end_class_war_desc: "We have no qualms about bringing under our control the enterprises of corrupt businessmen and bankers who show more fidelity to money or foreign nations than to Ireland, but neither do we have patience for layabouts undermining Irish industries with strikes. Under our new order, cooperation, not infighting, between classes for the sake of national prosperity is paramount. Those who defy this can only be considered enemies of their fatherland."

 IRE_partisan_divide: "End the Partisan Divide"
 IRE_partisan_divide_desc: "With the indefinite dissolution of Dáil Éireann, Ireland's disastrous experiment with the British-imported system of parliamentary democracy comes to a close. Now free of the corruption and internal divisions that come with party politics, with the aid of the army, the Irish Republic shall become what generations of republicans gave their lives for, a prosperous nation united by devout faith and love of country."
 IRE_gospel_national_virility: "The Gospel of National Virility"
 IRE_gospel_national_virility_desc: "Under the liberal auspices of previous governments, every form of vice was allowed to flourish in Ireland unimpeded. With O'Duffy at the helm, the degeneration of the nation shall be tolerated no more, and the encouragement of athletics, mountaineering, discipline and healthy living will preserve the strength and virility of the Irish race in the face of modern decadence."
 IRE_cor_deantais: "An Cór Déantais"
 IRE_cor_deantais_desc: "The inner cities of Ireland have been wracked with unemployment even before Black Monday, leading to an endemic issue of petty crime and social irresponsibility. The establishment of a public works programme attached to the military will work to resolve these issues, by both providing the unemployed an occupation of benefit to the country and instilling within them a sense of discipline."
 IRE_chinsealacht_gaelach: "An Chinsealacht Gaelach"
 IRE_chinsealacht_gaelach_desc: "In the darkest days of British rule, Irish society came under the total domination of the Anglo-Irish minority, or the \"Protestant Ascendancy\". It is time we returned the favour. Our aim shall be to ensure all positions of importance are held by republicans and Gaelic revivalists, driving out the infestation of West Britonism. Patriotism, rather than the lack of it, will become a necessity for social advancement."
 IRE_true_spirit_gael: "The True Spirit of the Gael"
 IRE_true_spirit_gael_desc: "Having cast off the degenerate parliamentary system, our regime shall revitalise the athletic and warrior spirit of the Gael with an energy and discipline that would put even the Spartans to shame.

 IRE_rerum_novarum_desc: "Though we have clamped down on unions under the sway of the reds, the well-being of the working man is of great importance to the faithful, as outlined in the Papal encyclical Rerum Novarum. It is our Christian duty to ensure the representation of workers on corporate councils, and that employers pay their employees sufficient wages and maintain humane conditions."
 IRE_executive_decree: "Rule by Executive Decree"
 IRE_executive_decree_desc: "With Eoin O'Duffy wielding absolute authority following the dissolution of the Dáil, the era of bickering and consensus being required to pass legislation is over. Through ruling by executive decree, corrupt party politicians or the short-sighted public will no longer be allowed to impede the introduction of laws and policies necessary to rebuild Ireland after centuries of British rule."
 IRE_army_council: "Collaborate with the Army Council"
 IRE_army_council_desc: "Though O'Duffy may not share the Germanophilia of the IRA's top brass, they nonetheless have in common a martial background, alarm at the rising threat of syndicalism, and disdain for loyalism and parliamentary politics. There is much more to gain than lose from working together to ensure order and stability while preparing the Republic both have sworn to defend for the eventuality of war."
 IRE_integrate_blueshirts: "Integrate the Blueshirt Apparatus"
 IRE_integrate_blueshirts_desc: "While the National Guard have proven most useful in protecting the state from its syndicalist and loyalist enemies, its extra-governmental, paramilitary nature has made the organisation unfortunately susceptible to being taken over from within by charismatic radicals. To neutralise this potential threat, we must integrate the Blueshirts as a gendarmerie under official oversight."

 IRE_integralism: "Implement Maurassian Principles"
 IRE_integralism_desc: "Our movement's key source of inspiration is the writings of the great French political philosopher Charles Maurras, who called for the rejection of the decadent societies created by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution in favour of a decentralised, traditional nation unified by a national sovereign and Church. What Friedrich List was for the Irish republicans of old, Maurras shall be for us."
 IRE_gan_anam: "Tír Gan Teanga,\nTír Gan Anam"
 IRE_gan_anam_desc: "No British crime has scarred us more than the destruction of the Irish language, cutting the Gael adrift from our culture and leaving us with the humiliation of being merely accented Britons by comparison to other nations, and its revival is our top priority. For now we sadly cannot outlaw English, but with carrot-and-stick measures we can reward those who make the effort to speak their own tongue, while punishing the indolent and unpatriotic."
 IRE_european_rechristianisation: "The Rechristianisation of Europe"
 IRE_european_rechristianisation_desc: "After the fall of Rome, the efforts of Irish monks played a vital role in re-christianising Europe, and preserving much knowledge that otherwise would have been forever lost. With the continent afflicted by syndicalism and parliamentarism, we will again fulfil our sacred destiny and duty to God by helping free the European people from paganism, and in doing so spread our national influence."
 IRE_saints_scholars: "The Land of Saints and Scholars"
 IRE_saints_scholars_desc: "We must never forget the halcyon era, before the English turned the land of saints and scholars into the poorhouse of Europe, when Irish scholarly and missionary undertakings of were admired across the continent, and our intellectuals such as Eriugena were at the cutting edge of European life. Through the development of our education, we shall make those days a reality once more."
 IRE_ecumenism: "Tolerate Moderate Ecumenism"
 IRE_ecumenism_desc: "Though our movement is primarily Catholic, as are the inspirations for our corporatist ideals, we regard all Christians who show loyalty to Ireland and speak the Irish language, no matter their denomination, to be Gaels, in spite of past dissensions. Nevertheless, should the loyalists spit on our kindness and decide their allegiances still lie with Britain, then we will show them no mercy."

 IRE_the_restoration: "The Restoration"
 IRE_the_restoration_desc: "It has been over seven centuries since the High Kingship was usurped by the English invasion, yet we shall not allow generations of foreign rule to change the nature of the Gael. The House of O'Neill, the greatest of Ireland's noble families, and leaders of many risings against the Saxons, can at last end their long exile since the Flight of the Earls and reclaim the Irish crown."
 IRE_never_another_kinsale: "Never Another Kinsale"
 IRE_never_another_kinsale_desc: "Kinsale was the climactic battle of Ireland's Nine Years' War, upon which the isle's fate rested. Sadly, due to tactical mistakes by the Irish and the Spanish it ended in victory for the English, marking the fall of Gaelic civilisation to the Saxons. We must solemnly commemorate this day every year, and instil in the people that such a catastrophe can never be allowed to happen again."
 IRE_old_nobility: "Recognise the Gaelic Nobility"
 IRE_old_nobility_desc: "Ireland's native aristocracy, largely displaced to continental Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, have achieved much abroad while still holding the land of their origin dear.

Only under the guidance of our great regent and Ceannaire will the Emerald Isle first be rebuilt from the ruins left behind by hundreds of years of tyranny into the exemplar of Christianity it once was a millennia ago, free of all Saxon, Jewish and Masonic influence."
 IRE_the_regency_alt: "An Phoblacht Gaelach"
 IRE_the_regency_alt_desc: "With the evolution of the European order, Ireland has embraced republicanism once more. This time, the Irish Republic is not the pathetic Saorstát of the past which kowtowed to loyalism and the mediocrity of the masses, but rather the true successor of An Poblacht na hÉireann proclaimed in 1916. As the signatories asserted their noble will over the nation, leading the Gael to freedom, so shall the Ceannaire."
 IRE_executive_interventions: "Normalise Executive Interventions"
 IRE_executive_interventions_desc: "Though a principle of integralism is decentralised government via corporatism, there are nonetheless still moments when the Ceannaire, with his broader view of national affairs in light of his position, knows best. Local people may make local decisions, but if those decisions should be detrimental, then it is the role of the state, as a neutral arbitrar, to step in for the good of the nation."

 IRE_scarlet_dawn: "Scarlet Dawn"
 IRE_scarlet_dawn_desc: "What was once thought impossible has come to pass: the Irish people have awoken from their slumber and overthrown the reactionary governments which claimed they could have liberty, while still keeping the same institutions and systems as the British before them. Fortunately, their lies did not last and now liberty, true liberty, has come to Ireland. While this is a great day, there is still much to be done to ensure our progress is just the beginning."
 IRE_suppress_paramilitaries: "Suppress Reactionary Paramilitaries"
 IRE_suppress_paramilitaries_desc: "A single battle does not win the war, and the reactionaries are a persistent foe. Even with the destruction of the regime that allowed them to fester, the Blueshirts have yet to concede to the wave of progress and continue their violent opposition to the new government. We must see to it that their movement is quickly eliminated, before it can entrench itself any further."
 IRE_protection_of_revolution: "Protection of the Revolution"
 IRE_protection_of_revolution_desc: "As the successful revolutions of the world have taught, and even moreso the unsuccessful, a revolution cannot survive without the defence of an armed proletariat. Those who have fought thus far and those who are willing to do so shall be a perfect basis for the formation of our own form of red guards to guarantee the permanent protection of the revolution."
 IRE_secure_countryside: "Secure the Countryside"
 IRE_secure_countryside_desc: "As our nation once taught the British, he who controls the countryside controls Ireland. When the British withdrew from it, the collapse of their occupation swiftly followed. Ensuring our full authority over the countryside, from the everyday local Garda to even the courts themselves, must be one of our primary priorities lest we wish to suffer a similar collapse."

 IRE_saor_eire: "The Atlantic Vanguard"
 IRE_saor_eire_desc: "Thanks to the efforts of Saor Éire, the powers which once held sway over our Island have been broken and scattered and the challenges to our new state knocked back. Despite what some may call for, the victory won here is too fragile and beautiful to be wasted through carelessness. A total transformation of Irish society must begin to ensure reactionary thought can never return to our shores. A new nation will be born on the forefront of Europe, one which works for all."
 IRE_land_for_people: "Land for the People"
 IRE_land_for_people_desc: "Landlords, the robber barons of capitalism, have been the enemy of the Irish people for centuries. Whether it be the absentee landlords who exploited Ireland's people from their homes in Britain, or the unfortunately non-absent ones of the modern day, their existence has contributed nothing to society except suffering. Their practices must be completely rooted out, and their lands must be given to the actual people they truly belong to."
 IRE_athghabhail_na_heireann: "Athghabháil na hÉireann"
 IRE_athghabhail_na_heireann_desc: "The revolution cannot simply be one which is economic in nature, and must also ensure we break the structures which kept our people in mental prisons. Key among these is taking a firm stance in the revival of Gaelic language and culture, undoing years of damage carried out by imperial governments to stop the very idea of liberty forming in the minds of Irish people."
 IRE_new_foe: "The New Foe"
 IRE_new_foe_desc: "It seems laughable to ever consider that the decaying husks that make up the Entente alliance could ever pose a serious threat to the international revolution. Our focus should instead be on helping to crush the real enemy of the revolutionary cause, the German menace itself, and liberate its people from the Kaiser's oppression."
 IRE_old_oppressor: "The Old Oppressor"
 IRE_old_oppressor_desc: "One should never underestimate the bite of a wounded dog, for it has little left to lose and much more to gain. Even after their great defeat in the revolution, the revanchist exiles in Canada will not rest until both us and our neighbouring isle are once more under their boot, or they have breathed their last. With enough perseverance, we can ensure it is the latter."
 IRE_breaking_croziers: "Breaking the Croziers"
 IRE_breaking_croziers_desc: "The so-called shepherds of the Church have done nothing but fatten themselves up at the expense of their flock. If Ireland is to be truly free of oppression, we cannot simply ignore the clergy's role in it irrespective of tradition. Their role in society must be stamped out, and eliminating their stranglehold over our institutions must be one of our primary priorities"
 IRE_centralise_trade_union_functions: "Centralise Trade Union Functions"
 IRE_centralise_trade_union_functions_desc: "While important for representing the interests of workers, the unions also pose the danger of becoming a centre of inefficiency and inaction for our new republic, insisting on deliberating and debating any minor issue. In a bid to prevent this happening in future, Saor Éire will begin reorganising the unions to be led by appointees sent from the Committee, who will take the place of the old councils and allow us to stop the unions from hurting themselves like children."
 IRE_consolidate_party_state: "Consolidation of the Party-State"
 IRE_consolidate_party_state_desc: "A true revolutionary state is not one that falls back into the monarchic folly of concentrating power into a single leader, it is one where the party itself reigns supreme in guiding the nation forwards. Every aspect of the state must be intertwined with the party, and every aspect of the party must be similarly intertwined with the state."
 IRE_reorganise_ica: "Reorganise the ICA"
 IRE_reorganise_ica_desc: "Now that the revolution has succeeded, the shape of the ICA has come into question, as now it must transform from a mere paramilitary force into one tasked with protecting the revolution. To ensure this mass expansion and transition does not hamper the makeup of the force, the ICA must become an ideological as well as military force, ensuring all members are taught to appreciate the goal they are fighting for."
 IRE_red_trinity: "The Red Trinity"
 IRE_red_trinity_desc: "Our island will be transformed to our vision, our cult of the nation. Unity will be achieved by the expansion of our perfect trifecta, for every citizen will be mandated to be member of Saor Éire, an IRA volunteer, and a union member. The state, the party and the country will, and must, be all-encompassing in the lives of the citizens, to keep the success of our revolution burning in their hearts, and to maintain it at all cost."

 IRE_irish_syndicalist: "One Big Union"
 IRE_irish_syndicalist_desc: "With the ascension of the syndicalist wing of the Irish left, Ireland is set to embark on a transition to the democratic and socialist nation that Connolly envisioned. The ISP envisions the creation of a syndicalist system where all have a say, replacing the old sham democracy of the past with one that truly works for the working men and women of the island. It will not be an easy path, but true progress rarely is."
 IRE_red_jesus: "Socialism in His Light"
 IRE_red_jesus_desc: "While many fear socialism due to an incorrect belief that it is incompatible with the religions they hold dear, we must show them just how wrong this belief is. The beliefs of charity and compassion are ones which are just as central to the struggle for equality as they are to biblical teachings. Rather than replacing the Church, the emphasis must be placed on a correct understanding of its teachings."
 IRE_entrenching_orthodoxy: "Entrenching the Orthodoxy"
 IRE_entrenching_orthodoxy_desc: "No matter how hard Labour may try, true socialism will never be reached through compromises with reactionaries and anyone who believes it can be is a threat to the revolution. All those who wish to be part of the party must outright reject this flawed belief, and if they do not they shall be ostracised from it regardless of who they are or how sincere their other beliefs may be."
 IRE_connollys_legacy: "Connolly's Legacy"
 IRE_connollys_legacy_desc: "The shadow of James Connolly looms large over the entire socialist movement in Ireland. He died a martyr both for the cause of Irish liberty and for socialism, and it is up to us to build the nation he envisioned. While we have a long way to go, the idea of a republic which protects the weak as well as preserving our culture is being forged, by further promoting Connolly as a national hero, we will show that republicanism and socialism are not separate goals, but one dream."
 IRE_mass_urbanisation: "Encourage Mass Urbanisation"
 IRE_mass_urbanisation_desc: "The lifeblood of syndicalism is the urban proletariat, not the rural peasant, yet Ireland suffers from a severe lack of the former and an overabundance of the latter. We however cannot expect this to change when our cities lack the houses needed to facilitate any growth. Using cheap materials like prestressed concrete we will be able to build mass blocks of urban housing, which should bring with it the urban migration we will need."
 IRE_breakneck_industrialisation: "Breakneck Industrialisation"
 IRE_breakneck_industrialisation_desc: "While Ireland may have lagged behind industrially compared to the French and the British, with the help of our allies we now have the perfect opportunity to change this. The radical changes required to achieve this over such a short amount of time may of course be hard for some of the population to adjust to, but it is ultimately necessary for the universal uplifting of the nation."
 IRE_enshrine_ITUC_primacy: "Enshrine ITUC Primacy"
 IRE_enshrine_ITUC_primacy_desc: "Unions have served the nation as the collective voice of its people, and the ITUC has helped focus these voices together into one united message. Without the ITUC we would have never unshackled the nation from its reactionary chains, and so we must ensure that the ITUC continues to play its vital role in the nation's politics by enshrining its political primacy on the national level."
 IRE_liberate_slaves_of_slaves: "Liberate the Slaves of Slaves"
 IRE_liberate_slaves_of_slaves_desc: "It is tragic that given the crucial role women played in Ireland's struggle for independence, they were still forced into the bonds of a society which did not see them as equal. While changing attitudes will be hard, many in the party believe that by promoting women into positions of influence we will demonstrate they wish for the same liberty as men, to live free from the bonds of the past."

 IRE_ostracise_opposition: "Ostracise the Opposition"
 IRE_ostracise_opposition_desc: "Contrary to what some of those on the left may claim, we do not need to violently crush those who still oppose the new government. Through simply the power of words and a few well placed actions we can thoroughly encourage the ostracisation of those who support a return to the old regime, ensuring that most fall in line and that those who do not become nothing but a toothless minority."
 IRE_allies_on_left: "Allies on the Left"
 IRE_allies_on_left_desc: "Despite our many differences, most of the Irish left can ultimately find agreement in the idea of a socialist Ireland even if we may not agree on the road to it. Instead of letting these differences tear us apart and give the reactionaries an opportunity to strike back, we should seek to create a broad popular front across all those on the left who are also willing to join together with us."
 IRE_control_narrative: "Control the Narrative"
 IRE_control_narrative_desc: "The press in Ireland has often been simply the propaganda arm of the reactionary cause, but with much of the nation now under our control the shoe is now on the other foot. We have the perfect opportunity to not only fight against the reactionary messaging of those still opposed to the government, but also openly present our vision without the misrepresentative filtering it has been often forced through."
 IRE_progressive_labour: "Revolution from Within"
 IRE_progressive_labour_desc: "While other nations may have had to violently crush their opposition and radically transform society to achieve socialism, our nation does not need to go through such hardship. Ireland's unique position of having been born as a nation with many of the pitfalls of reactionary society already removed shall allow us to achieve a much more peaceful and gradual transition to a truly free socialist society."
 IRE_institutionalise_meitheal: "Institutionalise Meitheal"
 IRE_institutionalise_meitheal_desc: "Meitheal is a term used by our forebears which describes the willingness of farmers to work together, to ensure they all prospered. Under the purposely divisive system of land division, this practice is not as central as it once was. Using our cooperatives as a model, we will remind our rural areas how to care, that by pooling their abilities, they will all be better off."
 IRE_workplace_democracy: "Implement Workplace Democracy"
 IRE_workplace_democracy_desc: "The oppressive hierarchies that still dictate many of the nation's workplaces do little but detract from the lives of their workers and hold back the companies themselves to simply enrich and empower a few select individuals. By shifting the power in the workplace to its workers, rather than the bosses, we shall both eliminate these unjust hierarchies and make work more efficient in one fell swoop."
 IRE_defend_parliamentarism: "Defend Parliamentarism"
 IRE_defend_parliamentarism_desc: "A state where the people are not allowed to have their voices heard is nothing but a dictatorship, regardless of how red you paint it. The right for the Irish people to engage with the parliamentary process should never be infringed, and we will guarantee that our party will uphold the principle of parliamentarism."
 IRE_reconcile_old_guard: "Reconcile with the Old Guard"
 IRE_reconcile_old_guard_desc: "Even with the betrayal of the socialist cause shown by the Labour party during the 20s and 30s, many of those within the party are still committed to achieving socialism in Ireland. Now that the new government has solidified itself, it seems pointless and petty to still maintain grudges against the old guard of Labour. We should extend out an olive branch, and put aside any remaining differences with those willing to accept it."
 IRE_compensated_transfer: "Compensated Transfer of Assets"
 IRE_compensated_transfer_desc: "While the control the Church has over many of the nation's institutions must be tackled, simply forcefully dismantling the Church and nationalising their property like radical Protestants will do nothing but tear apart society and galvanise people towards reactionary ideologies. The simple act of negotiation will be a much more effective tool to achieve this goal, and one few will find solid grounds to oppose."
 IRE_defang_paramilitaries: "Defang Paramilitaries"
 IRE_defang_paramilitaries_desc: "A free nation cannot prosper with radical and violent militias patrolling its streets, regardless of which side of the political discourse they claim to represent. Laws should be introduced to tackle the harmful practices that these groups carry out, with careful wording to ensure that peaceful individuals are not affected while casting a wide enough net to snuff out as many paramilitary groups as possible."
 IRE_protecting_our_freedom: "Protecting our Freedom"
 IRE_protecting_our_freedom_desc: "We do not seek war, but we cannot stop it from seeking us. Many forces in the world wish to extinguish every beacon of revolution, no matter how bright it may shine, and if presented the opportunity they will not pass up the opportunity to extinguish ours. We must be sure that if this day ever comes, we will be ready for it."

 IRE_ruby_isle: "The Ruby Isle"
 IRE_ruby_isle_desc: "When the first day after the revolution dawned, even the most optimistic socialists would not have dreamed of what was to follow. Through our efforts, we have begun building a new society on our island, one where all have a chance to work for their comrades and create a better future. It is perhaps fitting that Ireland, a nation so abused in the past, now stands ready to fight for a brighter future not just for its people, but for all mankind."
 IRE_invite_phalanstere_experts: "Invite Phalanstère Experts"
 IRE_invite_phalanstere_experts_desc: "Cooperation for mutual benefit is the key to success in life, and our allies in the Internationale have clearly shown how true this is in the fields of science and technology with their Phalanstère organisation. By inviting experts from the organisation to help identify the weaknesses in our existing research methods, and help educate a new generation of Irish researchers, our nation can easily become a new hub for scientific advancement."
 IRE_needs_of_many: "The Needs of the Many"
 IRE_needs_of_many_desc: "The constant drive for profit above morals has deprived much of our nation of basic services, with many towns lacking proper access to proper healthcare facilities, transport services, and even basic schooling materials. Now that we are no longer hamstrung by the shortcomings of the capitalist system, we should seek to remedy these inadequacies and ensure that all the needs of all Irish people are properly provided for."

 # 1941 Election Foci #
 IRE_second_election: "1941 Elections"
 IRE_second_election_desc: "Ireland's democracy has overcome the challenges to its existence, but the never-ending rattle of the ballot box only awaits the government that helped it do so. It is the people who must choose who will continue to lead them into the next term of the Dáil, and nothing is guaranteed on election day."

 IRE_later_plp: "Revolution From the Ballot Box"
 IRE_later_plp_desc: "Few thought it possible for true socialism to ever succeed in electoral politics, often citing government oppression and how easily reactionaries can manipulate the average voter. With the Progressive Labour Party emerging as victors of the most recent elections, the doubters have been proved wrong. It is now time for Ireland to return to the socialist future it was always destined to have."
 IRE_coop_farming: "Cooperative Farming"
 IRE_coop_farming_desc: "Even to this day farms in the nation are run in an archaic and almost feudal fashion, to the detriment of Ireland and its people. To address these outdated practices the farmers of Ireland should be encouraged to collectivise together and begin operating their farms together, hopefully improving their efficiency and cutting out any capitalist middlemen who seek to profit from their labour."
 IRE_nationalise_church_institutions: "Nationalisation of Church-run Institutions"
 IRE_nationalise_church_institutions_desc: "It is a disgrace that the clergy who have sat idly by while the nation's destitute suffer have such a stranglehold on many of the country's institutions. It is vital that we nationalise these institutions and hand them back to the Irish people, to whom they truly belong."
 IRE_decay_of_landlordism: "Decay of Landlordism"
 IRE_decay_of_landlordism_desc: "Despite the growth of socialism in Ireland there are still many who defend the practice of landlordism, arguing that \"one person's rent is another person's income.\" While the radical step of outlawing the practice completely and seizing landlord owned properties is often tempting, a more soft handed approach of a gradual increase in regulations will be received a lot better by the voting public."
 IRE_widow_pensions: "Protecting Those Society Forgot"
 IRE_widow_pensions_desc: "Irish society is filled with those that have been forgotten by it, in many cases intentionally so. The grieving widow, the lonely orphan, the suffering veteran, all thus far abandoned by successive Irish governments. The laws that we will now introduce to protect these vulnerable members of society, providing them access to their family pensions and additional care benefits, will hopefully one day be one of our most fondly remembered achievements."

 IRE_red_future_desc: "[IRE_loc_red_future_desc]"
 IRE_radsoc_capstone_focus: "The Red Future"
 IRE_radsoc_capstone_focus_desc: "For years the green flag has flown over Dublin Castle, with the foreign invaders already driven back across the sea, and yet only now has Ireland begun to truly free itself from the inequalities that persisted. While Ireland has not yet fully blossomed into the socialist republic Connolly envisioned, it seems clear to many that it has been set firmly on the course of socialism and the moderately red future it will bring."
 IRE_socdem_capstone_focus: "Labour Waits No More"
 IRE_socdem_capstone_focus_desc: "During the War of Independence, Labour was told by Sinn Féin \"Labour must wait\". To their later regret, they heeded this demand like an obedient dog, allowing conservative nationalists to take credit for Irish freedom, with the contributions of Irish unions erased. The party will no longer allow itself to be the third wheel of Irish politics, held back by red-baiting from bringing social democracy to Ireland. Labour is here to stay."

 IRE_later_labour: "The Continued March of Labour"
 IRE_later_labour_desc: "Having received a mandate from the people once more, it is now time for Labour to focus on implementing the many policies that had to be deprioritised in favour of resolving the Black Monday Crisis. Through a wide berth of social and economic reforms the lives of Ireland's people shall hopefully be greatly improved, and the gradual march towards a socialist future can be continued."
 IRE_collaborate_with_ITUC: "Collaborating with the ITUC"
 IRE_collaborate_with_ITUC_desc: "Despite sections of the ITUC abandoning the Labour Party in favour of more radical members of the socialist opposition, the ties between it and Labour are impossible to truly break. Through cooperation with the less radical members of the ITUC and supporting their plans to aid the Irish worker we can boost the nation's industrial capacity, something from which the entire country can prosper."
 IRE_state_education: "State Education"
 IRE_state_education_desc: "For centuries the task of educating Ireland's children has normally fallen to their parents or the local priests and nuns, often to less than stellar results. To ensure the youth are educated to a modern standard the duty to do so must be taken out of the hands of the clergy, to instead be handled by the state, with the goal of providing free education from secular teachers to the children of the nation."
 IRE_industrial_development: "Promote Industrial Development"
 IRE_industrial_development_desc: "New industrial developments are always a reliable way to ensure continued work for the people of Ireland, and with government involvement in the projects we can make sure that said work is also fair. By prioritising new and growing industries for this development, the jobs created should hopefully also be long lasting and be in much better positions to weather the storms of time."
 IRE_modern_roads_modern_nation: "Modern Roads, Modern Nation"
 IRE_modern_roads_modern_nation_desc: "These days there are two places the average Irish worker spends most of their life, the first is their bed and the second is the road on their commute to and from work. Yet still, despite their fundamental role in Irish society, many of our roads are still untarred macadam while the rest of the world has moved on to tarmacadam and asphalt. It is economically vital that this issue is addressed and our outdated roads are quickly modernised."

 IRE_later_cnat: "The Cause of the Countryside"
 IRE_later_cnat_desc: "The impression left on the voting public from Clann na Talmhan's role in the coalition has propelled them to being now the largest party in government. Now leading a coalition of its own, it is time for CnaT to fulfil the promises of their election campaign and bring forth a much more agrarian focused political vision for the nation."
 IRE_drain_boglands: "Draining the Boglands"
 IRE_drain_boglands_desc: "The creation of new farmland should always be a priority for any government, and in Ireland the many widespread tracts of bogland are perfect places to establish these new farms. By working hard to drain these boglands and reclaim the land they sit on, we can create a great deal of land perfect for crop farming and animal grazing."
 IRE_sustainable_forestry: "Sustainable Forestry"
 IRE_sustainable_forestry_desc: "Ireland is one of the few places in Europe still home to the beautiful temperate rainforests that once dotted much of the landscape. Centuries of deforestation has however depleted much of the nation's tree coverage, and if action is not taken they may be destroyed for good. To help prevent this grants should be issued to logging companies who practice sustainable forestry and afforestation, protecting existing forests and growing new ones as well."
 IRE_minerals_development_act: "Minerals Development Act of [IRE_loc_at_least_41]"
 IRE_minerals_development_act_desc: "Our great land has many untapped bounties buried beneath its surface, and it is important for our economic growth that we make use of them in a well thought out way. To aid with this an act should be passed establishing the exact legal framework on how mines should operate, how government leases should be given out, and all other details that must be addressed regarding mineral extraction and subsequent processing operations."
 IRE_date_early: "1941"
 IRE_date_late: "[GetYear]"
 IRE_paving_boreens: "Paving the Boreens"
 IRE_paving_boreens_desc: "Despite humble country roads being the arteries that connect the many villages and farms scattered across the country, most of these roads are little more than well trodden dirt paths. With the introduction of a rural focused infrastructure bill we can help ensure that within time these roads will be properly paved, and truly fit for their constant usage."
 IRE_progressive_land_rates: "Progressive Land Rates"
 IRE_progressive_land_rates_desc: "If one were to ask the many farmers across the nation what is the hardest thing to deal with in their line of work, the answer of harsh land rates would almost certainly be one of the most common responses. Through a progressive reformation of the land rate system we can ensure that the burden placed upon the common farmer is lessened, helping us win support and weaken the strength of alternative proposals by the nation's radical elements."
 IRE_golden_moderation: "[IRE_loc_golden_moderation]"
 IRE_golden_moderation_desc: "[IRE_loc_golden_moderation_desc]"
 IRE_soclib_capstone_focus: "Golden Moderation"
 IRE_soclib_capstone_focus_desc: "With most things in life reserved moderation is often the best approach, and nowhere has this proved more true than Irish politics. Rejecting the extremes that have been advocated by people like Larkin and O'Duffy we have carved out a stable future for the nation free of the many troubles that plague the world's extremist regimes. While work is never truly done, the achievements of our moderate leadership will almost certainly leave a permanent mark upon Ireland."

 IRE_later_sf: "The Straight Road is Shortest"
 IRE_later_sf_desc: "Few parties can maintain their rule after already having eight years in office, but it seems that Sinn Féin's great resurgence over the past few years has not only allowed them to win once more at the polls, they have done so with an even larger share of the vote. While this new term is very much expected to be little more than business as usual, the Irish public have decided that is exactly what is needed in today's chaotic world."
 IRE_father_of_republic: "Father of the Republic"
 IRE_father_of_republic_desc: "While people may credit Wolfe Tone as originator of Irish republicanism, and Pádraig Pearse for its revitalisation, without the great Arthur Griffith it is hard to imagine how the modern Irish state could exist. The impact this Irish hero has had on the nation has often been discounted, but to ensure his recognition it is time for the government to lead the charge on commemorating his accomplishments."
 IRE_international_port_belfast: "International Port of Belfast"
 IRE_international_port_belfast_desc: "When Britain's empire collapsed and reunification was achieved, Belfast and its great shipbuilders suffered greatly. In this time companies like Harland & Wolff survived by shifting almost entirely towards commerical work, earning Belfast a global reputation for commerce. Even with times becoming less desperate for shipbuilders, Belfast has cemented itself as one of the most important commercial ports, and with government support it could soon outshine all others."
 IRE_sidestep_church: "Sidestep the Church"
 IRE_sidestep_church_desc: "The vital role the Church plays in Irish society is of course something that few wish to directly challenge. At the same time, there are many duties to which the Church taking a less direct role would clearly be to the benefit of both the Church itself and the government. Through the delicate shifting of responsibilities we can help ensure that those roles best left to the government are actually left to it, rather than left in the busy hands of the clergy."
 IRE_adopt_bismarck_model: "Adopt the Bismarck Model"
 IRE_adopt_bismarck_model_desc: "One of Otto von Bismarck's finest accomplishments was the introduction of his health insurance model that has since helped provide care to millions of Germans who would have otherwise been without, cutting off a vital avenue for the most radical socialists to gather support. With such a strong example set by the Germans in this field, it would be imperative for us to introduce a similar healthcare system for Ireland and its people."
 IRE_eternal_vigilance_of_big_mick: "Eternal Vigilance of the Big Fellow"
 IRE_eternal_vigilance_of_big_mick_desc: "For as long as Ireland has been free, there has been one man who has ever presently guided it through thick and thin, in official positions of power and even from the sidelines. Whether people choose to refer to him as Ireland's Architect, the Tinpot Tyrant, or simply just the Big Fellow, it is clear to all that the future of the Irish state will always be irrevocably tied to the legacy of Michael Collins."
 IRE_representative_national_government: "Representative National Government"
 IRE_representative_national_government_desc: "In 1916 Ireland's martyrs laid out their grand promises of a permanent national government, \"representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women.\", to guarantee liberty and freedom for all of the nation's peoples. While these freedoms may have slowly begun to lapse in the recent years, it is time for the new leadership of Sinn Féin to once and for all guarantee these immutable rights first proclaimed so many years ago."

 IRE_later_ndp: "A Fair Deal For All"
 IRE_later_ndp_desc: "The results of the election are clear, Seán Lemass and his National Development Party have emerged as the largest party in the Dáil. With much of the Irish public attributing most of the past few year's worth of economic developments to the NDP, and a campaign based around improving the lives of all Irish men and women through financial growth, the NDP seem set to deliver on a strong capitalist message for the Irish nation."
 IRE_international_investment_hub: "International Investment Hub"
 IRE_international_investment_hub_desc: "With many investors still shaken by the aftermath of Black Monday and the conflict in America, an ample opportunity has been presented to us to fill the void this has left. Through negotiations with foreign businesses and a diplomatic outreach campaign advertising Dublin as a stable home for international business, we may one day see our quaint little city become a true capital of global finance."
 IRE_villages_to_towns: "From Villages to Towns"
 IRE_villages_to_towns_desc: "While Ireland's great cities serve a vital role in the economy, economic growth cannot come from just a few major urban centres lest we wish to accept the consequences of their eventual stagnation. Instead government policy should be based around supporting the growth of promising rural areas in the nation, growing many of these small settlements into well developed and respectable towns capable of proper commerce."
 IRE_nation_two_peoples: "Nation of Two Peoples"
 IRE_nation_two_peoples_desc: "Like all nations Ireland is not a perfect nation, and suffers from many unfortunate flaws. The gravest of these flaws is how much of the nation views many of their Anglo-Irish and Ulster-Scots countrymen as little more than foreign invaders, when many of them have never known any land but our great isle as their home. It is time for the government to truly recognise these men and women as our brothers and sisters, and help finally shatter this flawed perception of them."
 IRE_educated_workforce: "Educated Workforce"
 IRE_educated_workforce_desc: "Investing in a nation's education is one of the strongest avenues for economic growth, and one often overlooked by those blinded with a short sighted approach to finance. By providing free secondary level education to every child in the nation we can help ensure that tomorrow's workforce will be ready for anything that faces them."
 IRE_noble_middle_class: "A Noble Middle Class"
 IRE_noble_middle_class_desc: "Gone are the days of the feudal elite and the peasants stuck beneath them, in our modern nation any man or woman who truly puts in enough work will be fairly rewarded with a comfortable life for themselves and their family. Many of the nation's hardest workers have already risen up to become part of our strong middle class, and the example they have set should be one promoted to all of Ireland's citizens."
 IRE_global_centre_finance: "A New Global Centre of Finance"
 IRE_global_centre_finance_desc: "Compared to the economic giants of the world, the Germanys, the Austrias, and even the Japans, Ireland has always been the underdog that few could have expected much from. Yet with a strong economic vision and an expertly curated government approach, Ireland under the guidance of the NDP has slowly been transformed into a nation ready to compete against any of these behemoths on the financial stage."

 IRE_later_sc: "Ensuring the Life That God Desires"
 IRE_later_sc_desc: "Campaigning on a message of continued social reform for the nation, An Saorstát Críostúil has received a majority of seats in the Dáil. With most of the nation's economic troubles solved, it seems now is the perfect time for the party to switch its focus primarily towards implementing their promised Christian and conservative social policies."
 IRE_social_welfare_schemes: "Social Welfare Schemes"
 IRE_social_welfare_schemes_desc: "Many too caught up in modern politics often forget that providing care for the downtrodden is not a socialist idea, it is at its heart a pure Christian policy through and through. It should therefore be government policy to extend unemployment insurance and child care allowances, so that we can provide care for our fellow countrymen to get through their hardships."
 IRE_arrows_adversity: "Ward Off the Arrows of Adversity"
 IRE_arrows_adversity_desc: "With An Saorstát Críostúil's position secure it is time for the government to lay out the plans for fighting back against the threats to the nation. Ireland must be safe from undemocratic dictatorships, from the dictated constitutions of socialist states, and from corrupt politicians who wish to profit while their people suffer. Only an Ireland free from these scourges can truly prosper."
 IRE_people_tradition_faith: "People of Tradition and Faith"
 IRE_people_tradition_faith_desc: "The Catholic faith is one of the strongest pillars of Irish identity, and the Church itself has occupied a role in our society that has been fundamentally irreplaceable since its first establishment on our isle. Yet there is still more the Church can do for the nation, and the duties that come with their privileged position must be further expanded for the good of the nation."
 IRE_rights_family: "Legislate the Rights of Family"
 IRE_rights_family_desc: "Many in the world have a warped idea of what success means, viewing it through an exclusively worldly lens focused on mundane riches or status in society. The truest form of success in life is the one most overlooked, the establishment and development of a large and devout family. Aiding our people in achieving this joy should be a government priority, and codifying the sacred right of these families will be a vital step towards doing so."
 IRE_nation_small_farmers: "Nation of Small Farmers"
 IRE_nation_small_farmers_desc: "The roots of Irish identity is found in its farms, those owned by the common Gael to provide for himself and his community. Mass urbanisation and industrialisation has caused many of these farmers to be left behind economically, and efforts must be made to aid these common people. Full government support should be provided to them so that they can continue the practice of their wonderful and traditional lifestyle."
 IRE_ireland_we_dream_of: "The Ireland That We Dreamed Of"
 IRE_ireland_we_dream_of_desc: "As so many previous generations have done, An Saorstát Críostúil has fought to create an Ireland where its people live a life that God desires that men should live. The party has truly committed itself to strengthening the Christian heart and soul of the nation, freeing its peoples from hardship, and protecting that which we hold dear. Work like this is however never done, but it is clear that Ireland is now back onto the right path for a noble future."

 IRE_later_an: "Voice of the True Gaels"
 IRE_later_an_desc: "Championing a message few other parties dared to speak, the parliamentarian wing of Aontas Náisiúnta has managed to climb up from being a junior coalition member to now being the largest party in government. While most expect this new government to be less radical compared to the more extreme abstentionists of AN, it seems apparent that the nation is now set on a path towards intense traditionalism and the gradual teardown of the democratic system."
 IRE_gaelic_state: "Stát na nGaedheal"
 IRE_gaelic_state_desc: "The Gaelic identity is the heart of the Irish nation, and despite the best efforts of foreign rulers there are those who have maintained our wonderful culture up to the modern day. Aiding the people in the Gaeltacht and upping funding for Irish-language initiatives will be vital for keeping our ethno-cultural identity alive and spreading it back to the rest of the nation, thus it should be one of the new government's greatest priorities."
 IRE_pious_republic: "The Pious Republic"
 IRE_pious_republic_desc: "The Catholic faith is the only true faith of the nation, and attempts to recognise foreign religions by previous governments have left a great stain on the country's legacy. With full control over government apparatus we now have the opportunity to officially decree the immutable position of Catholicism as the singular faith of our people, and help ensure its spread once more throughout all of Irish society."
 IRE_managed_democracy: "Managed Democracy"
 IRE_managed_democracy_desc: "While a healthy democracy can be good for a nation, allowing those who wish to destroy our nation to run in elections will lead to nothing but ruin and national decay. Just as a tree will grow sick if not properly pruned, so too will the electoral system. To ensure this does not happen, these radical destructive elements must be barred from taking part in future elections on both the national and local level."

 IRE_an_capstone_focus_desc: "[IRE_loc_an_capstone_focus_desc]"
 IRE_republic_free_from_chaos: "A Republic Free\nFrom Chaos"
 IRE_republic_free_from_chaos_desc: "While there are many elements that make up the policy of Aontas Náisiúnta there is one simple message at the heart of their rule, order. If there is one message that now reverberates across the nation, it is this message of order. An order free from divisive democracy, an order free from destructive heresy, and an orderly republic free from the chaos that the government has said that these vices bring."
 IRE_rialtas_measctha: "An Rialtas Measctha"
 IRE_rialtas_measctha_desc: "Aristotle theorised that a form of government metaphorically combining monarchy, aristocracy and democracy was necessary to prevent their degeneration, an ideal that would inspire classical republicans. By also taking inspiration from this great mind we will ensure that the Irish Republic shall never fall into decadence again, but rather remain a nation where patriotic virtues and Christianity flourish forevermore."

 IRE_german_eco_dominance_light: "German Economic Dominance"
 IRE_german_eco_dominance_light_desc: "Ireland's economy is heavily tied to Germany. The nation's agriculture is geared towards providing beef and dairy products for the European market, the Irish punt is pegged to the German mark, and ownership of several of our industries is in Teutonic hands. While access to foreign markets for Irish goods through Mitteleuropa has benefited Ireland, if economic crisis were to strike Europe, the Emerald Isle would be hit severely..."

 IRE_black_monday: "Black Monday in Ireland"
 IRE_black_monday_desc: "Black Monday has devastated the Irish economy, particularly due to the level of German investment in Ireland, but also the collapse of the demand for much of our exports in the European market. With unemployment growing and public unrest against the government becoming more widespread, repairing any damage caused by this collapse will be a huge task."

 IRE_emergency_taxes_idea: "Emergency Taxes"
 IRE_emergency_taxes_idea_desc: "In an effort to right state finances, the Irish Government has dramatically increased taxes across the board, hitting many citizens hard in this time."

 IRE_austerity_idea: "Public Sector Salary Cutbacks"
 IRE_austerity_idea_desc: "In a continuing attempt to achieve a balanced budget, state employees have seen their paychecks slashed or paused across the board. This move is unlikely to be popular among the traditionally supportive public sector."

 IRE_initial_eco_measures_idea: "Initial Economic Measures"
 IRE_initial_eco_measures_desc: "While the measures implemented by the government were unpopular with many, they have begun to make a positive difference; with the initial economic trauma of the crisis beginning to fade. While there is a long way to go, the overworked civil servants can at least enjoy a minor victory."

 IRE_northern_industrial_support: "Northern Industrial Support"
 IRE_northern_industrial_support_desc: "With the excessive industrialisation of north-eastern Ireland compared to the rest of the country, subsidies have been allocated to keep industries up here afloat, somewhat to the grumbling of industrialists in the rest of the country."

 IRE_northern_relief_work: "Northern Relief Work"
 IRE_northern_relief_work_desc: "In the face of continued demands from political leaders in the north, the government has established public works projects with the aim of providing jobs to those left aimless in the crash."

 IRE_northern_syndie_suppression: "Northern Syndicalist Suppression"
 IRE_northern_syndie_suppression_desc: "In addition to keeping the public on side with relief works, the government has also taken more direct steps against syndicalist agitators, aiming to disrupt their activities wherever possible."

 IRE_allay_northern_nationalists_idea: "Northern Nationalists Placated"
 IRE_allay_northern_nationalists_idea_desc: "Conscious of the nationalist grumbling caused by the increased support to the largely loyalist concerns in the region, the government in Dublin is making extra effort to listen to nationalist concerns and keep them on side."

 IRE_balanced_budget_1: "Austerity"
 IRE_balanced_budget_1_desc: "It is a difficult call to make, but for us to get out of the current economic situation, the books need to be balanced, and short term pain will mean long term gain. After we rationalise expenditure, the wheat can be separated from the chaff, without the risk of dangerous financial practices like costly international loans or unnecessarily nationalising private enterprises. This can be used as an opportunity to rebuild the whole system from the ground up, targeting spending where it will do the most good to create a revitalised state."

 IRE_raidio_eireann_on_air: "Raidió Éireann"
 IRE_raidio_eireann_on_air_desc: "The launch of Raidió Éireann has been a success, and has garnered listeners all across Ireland, leading to a public more informed on current affairs than ever before. With continued oversight from the Irish Government, they have been able to better project their influence across the island."
 IRE_industrial_expansion: "Economic Expansion & Development"
 IRE_industrial_expansion_desc: "The campaign of economic expansion and development is progressing nicely and the effects are being seen across Ireland.

The shipyard is abuzz with workers, and the gantry crane is operating smoothly day and night. When these renovations are complete, the Harland & Wolff Shipyard will be a world-class shipbuilders once again."

 IRE_industrialisation_idea: "Industrialisation"
 IRE_industrialisation_idea_desc: "A modern nation needs a modern industrialised economy and the government's focus on industrialisation reflects that. As factories pop up around the nation, the strength of the economy improves, and Ireland's burgeoning industry will become a strong competitor and rival to its continental fellows."

 IRE_cork_ford: "Expanded Automobile Production"
 IRE_cork_ford_desc: "A growing demand for automobiles necessitated an expansion in the production capacity of the [GetVictoryPointName_7394] Ford plant.

 IRE_agrarianism_idea: "Agrarianism"
 IRE_agrarianism_idea_desc: "Farms across the country are reaping the benefits of the government's decision to focus on agrarianism, the true heart of the nation.

Ireland's waters are being exploited to their fullest potential."

 IRE_finished_bm_idea: "Invigorated Economy"
 IRE_finished_bm_idea_desc: "The recovery from Black Monday has been managed better than expected. The consistent investment in businesses, both struggling and new, has brought with it a rise in consumer confidence and commercial ambitions, leading to a post-crisis economic miracle of sorts that no doubt has less successful economies jealous."

 IRE_arms_licences: "German Arms Licences"
 IRE_arms_licences_desc: "The lucrative arms contract with Krupp has been finalised, and Ireland has free reign to acquire made-to-order military equipment. This six-month contract allows Ireland to greatly boost its military stockpile with the efficiency of German factories. Whether it is small arms, artillery, trucks, tanks, or planes, Germany has guaranteed that Krupp will produce them to the highest standards of quality."
 IRE_staff_college_idea: "Officer Exchange Programmes"
 IRE_staff_college_idea_desc: "Following their lessons at the prestigious Prussian Staff College, Ireland's military officers have immediately began applying their new knowledge. Military management has already been reshuffled to be more efficient and new doctrines are being introduced to the troops, based on what the top German officers are using and developing.

 IRE_kws_observership_idea_desc: "The scientists of Ireland are learning of the newest breakthroughs in military research as they happen, and they have already applied their knowledge to boost industry research at home. While they cannot participate, they have been received well by the German researchers and are taking full advantage of the access to research, just as regular member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society would."

 IRE_industrial_techniques_idea: "Advanced Industrial Techniques"
 IRE_industrial_techniques_idea_desc: "On their return from Britain, Irish industrialists have begun to introduce the workplace practices they studied on a trial basis. Early reports are promising and show that production and employee satisfaction is increasing. Syndicalist influence is ever present however, and these changes are not permanent. After the trial period these changes will be reverted, regardless of how much workers may want to keep them."
 IRE_greenest_fields_idea: "Increased Agricultural Exports"
 IRE_greenest_fields_idea_desc: "Irish agricultural produce, particularly top-quality Irish beef, is in high demand.

 IRE_overlook_exports_main_idea_desc: "The increased unregulated exports to Britain have been a massive success, perhaps too much so. The British are eager to tap into the Irish market once again, and right under Germany's nose, but vigilance must be maintained and the untaxed profits must be hidden from Germany who would be none too pleased with Mitteleuropa's trading regulations being ignored. These exports will be reduced in time, before too much attention is drawn."
 IRE_overlook_exports_alt_idea: "Increased British Exports"
 IRE_overlook_exports_alt_idea_desc: "Trading with Germany held its allure, but the Irish Sea makes for a much shorter and cheaper journey for all our goods on their way to our new allies and old trading partners, especially now that it no longer is so restricted or covert. Now that our traditional market has been restored, and in a much more equal relationship, the benefits to our producers will show the population at large that there is still plenty of opportunity to be found in our new system of government."

 IRE_import_quotas_idea_desc: "Irish businesses have long been undercut by continental competitors, and the new import quotas are working to stop that. The effects are being seen immediately, with the Irish market share increasing and homegrown enterprises seeing higher usage. This has cost Ireland political favour with the rest of Europe, but what is that in the face of a stronger and more independent Ireland?"
 IRE_higher_tariffs_idea: "Increased Tariffs"
 IRE_higher_tariffs_idea_desc: "After the introduction of higher tariffs, many foreign brands and businesses pulled out of Ireland, exactly as intended. This has led to a noticeable amount of disruption to the domestic market but Irish businesses have begun to see the benefits of less competition. The tariffs from the few remaining foreign imports are being directly invested in Irish businesses, making up for their loss of some products."
 IRE_quotas_and_tariffs: "Trade Control Measures"
 IRE_quotas_and_tariffs_desc: "Through combining our new measures of import quotas, and also increasing tariffs on imported goods, we have set the groundwork for a more vibrant, and more importantly, more locally-controlled economy. Undue foreign control of our economy must be curtailed, so that our own industries and people can prosper."
 IRE_subsidiaries_idea: "Foreign Business Restrictions"
 IRE_subsidiaries_idea_desc: "Britain and Germany were not deterred by Ireland's recommendations of establishing subsidiaries rather than foreign-owned enterprises, and have continued their competition over Ireland's independence. When this back-and-forth ends, Ireland will keep control over these businesses and stop money being funnelled abroad."

 IRE_defence_idea_desc: "After seven hundred years of British rule, the Irish people have finally secured their independence. However, should the unthinkable occur and Ireland be attacked, the Irish people will be prepared to fight using their superior knowledge of the terrain and determination to protect their freedom."

 IRE_professionalism: "Unparalleled Professionalism"
 IRE_professionalism_desc: "The [IRE_loc_ira_name] is being supported by a proportionally large budget designed to fund an army capable of fighting on equal footing with conventional forces, with a strong emphasis on quality and professionalism."

 IRE_guerilla: "Guerrilla Warfare"
 IRE_guerilla_desc: "In lieu of a more conventional armed force, Irish military doctrine has aimed to create a synthesis between guerilla tactics practised during the War of Independence and more orthodox military thought. The result has been a lighter and cheaper force, oriented towards a protracted defence over purely symmetrical warfare."

 IRE_curragh_camp: "An tArm Nua"
 IRE_curragh_camp_desc: "For the first time in years, the famed mustering point at the Curragh in Kildare is once again seeing the construction of a new Irish army — with fears of war returning to the hearts of Ireland, the focus of politicians and generals has moved to the rapid modernisation of the military."

 IRE_professionalism_final: "Óglaigh na hÉireann"
 IRE_professionalism_final_desc: "The new [IRE_loc_ira_name] is a well-oiled machine: armed with the best weapons, trained to the highest standards, and taught in the finest schools of European warfare. The mission given to them is to be an equal to any who would set foot in Ireland — or to die trying."

 IRE_guerilla_final: "Óglaigh na hÉireann"
 IRE_guerilla_final_desc: "The new [IRE_loc_ira_name] resembles something pulled out of a soldier's nightmare: a force designed not to fight in a trench or on a battle line, but in the hills, brushes, and back alleys. The aim of these soldiers is not to keep their foes from victories — but rather to make them regret every one of them."

 IRE_air: "Irish Air Corps"
 IRE_air_desc: "In their mission to protect their island, the young Irish military have set out to pioneer the equally young field of aviation. In a discipline of warfare with no established tradition, Ireland hopes to find itself an equal to the other great powers of Europe, where it might carve itself a place in which it is truly on the cutting edge."

 IRE_navy: "Renewed Naval Preparations"
 IRE_navy_desc: "The Irish Sea is increasingly home to Irish warships, performing patrols and exercises in anticipation of a future invasion through the passage. While most defensive contingencies concern operations on land, the Irish are just as determined to stop any invader at sea, through any means available."

 IRE_navy_bombing: "Air and Sea"
 IRE_navy_bombing_desc: "Ireland is holding nothing back in its hunt for an impervious defence — in an effort to make the most of its resources, the Irish military have relentlessly pursued innovation in the fields of naval and air warfare, embracing radical ideas such as air-naval coordination only even contemplated in the war rooms of militaries twice the size of Ireland's. The nation is slowly, but surely gaining a reputation as a centre of the growing revolution in military thought."

 IRE_returning_emigrants_desc: "We're not made for leaving, and yet in spite of this we as a people have long been forced to take to the waves to search for a life they couldn't find at home. But our exiles never forgot their home, they never stopped thinking about when they would go home. Now, with the situation seeming as dark as the days of the drochshaol many have now felt that day has come. For the first time the ports of Ireland are filled with ships unloading, new accents fill the streets, on the Droichead na nDeoir, people are marching west."

 IRE_new_wild_geese_idea: "The New Wild Geese"
 IRE_new_wild_geese_idea_desc: "The failed attempts at liberty in the past produced a generation of men who, robbed of a chance to take up arms for their homeland; found themselves under the multitude of different banners. Now, in these times when ideology is motivating people like never before, many feel the need to continue this legacy, and remind the world that the Irish fought for what they believe in, wherever that might be."

 IRE_cogadh_deiridh_idea_desc: "There is no \"leader\" of the international struggle, all nations, all peoples are simply brothers.

 IRE_gallant_allies_idea: "Gallant Allies"
 IRE_gallant_allies_idea_desc: "Throughout history, scholars and diplomats have talked about the \"special relationships\" which exist between countries. It is likely that when the books of tomorrow are written, they will describe the friendship between Ireland and Germany in such terms. Even before our independence, the Germans have shown interest in our culture and history, through to the aid they sent to the heroes of 1916, a gesture we have never, and will never forget. Our two nations are tied together until the end."

 IRE_better_the_devil_idea: "The Devil You Know"
 IRE_better_the_devil_idea_desc: "There will always be those that criticise the pragmatists, saying they lack spine or principles; we in Ireland show the flaws in such arguments. We have not forgotten our history, or who we are, we simply chose to make it part of our future. We have long fought to see our island freed, and having achieved that, we will fight to help others reclaim their home."

 IRE_erin_go_bragh: "Erin go Bragh!"
 IRE_erin_go_bragh_desc: "In difficult times it can be tempting to take the easy road, to abandon core tenets for the illusion of safety, to hold firm and persevere requires grit. In spite of everything, we have managed to resist being made a pawn in somebody else's war, we have our home, and we will not lose that for anything. We have no duty to the King, the Kaiser or to the revolution, we only have a sacred duty to Ireland."

Ireland's history has often been intertwined with the Spanish, and it seems that one day the history books will record the victories they have achieved for them in this war."

 IRE_SER_volunteers: "The Vavarin Brigade"
 IRE_SER_volunteers_desc: "To show solidarity with the Serbian cause, an Irish brigade has been deployed to aid in the battle against Bulgaria. In a tribute to their united struggle for freedom, these Irish soldiers have chosen to call themselves the \"Vavarin Brigade\" as a nod to Joseph O'Rourke, the Russian general of Irish descent. O'Rourke played a pivotal role in leading the outnumbered Serbians to a triumphant victory at Vavarin, and it is hoped the same will be achieved once again."

 IRE_BUL_volunteers: "The Bourchier Brigade"
 IRE_BUL_volunteers_desc: "Ireland has dispatched a volunteer brigade to support Bulgaria in their battle against the Belgrade Pact. This brigade proudly bears the name of James Bourchier, an Irish journalist renowned for his passionate advocacy for Bulgaria.

 IRE_IRA_UVF_resistance_idea_desc: "While in principle the British government purports to support an independent unified Ireland, they have made it clear that they believe the Emerald Isle is not truly ready for the full liberation that socialism brings, and so have decided to place it under the temporary joint occupation of RA and CIC until a suitable leader is found. Yet, the people of Ireland do not see it the same way, and so the British government is now facing steep resistance from not only the popular Irish Republican Army, primarily located in the Munster countryside, but also the royalist Ulster Volunteer Force that is active throughout the north-east."
 IRE_IRA_resistance_idea: "Reorganised IRA Resistance"
 IRE_IRA_resistance_idea_desc: "To the surprise of few, the decision by the British government to restore direct rule over Ireland has not gone over well with the island's non-Loyalist population.

 IRE_sf_idea: "The Heavy Hand of Progress"
 IRE_sf_idea_desc: "While some may favour simply relying on the "invisible hand" of the market to bring progress and prosperity to the nation, the Sinn Féin government has chosen to favour the "heavy hand" approach of more direct and focused economic development to bring all aspects of Ireland's economy forwards."
 IRE_sf_idea_4: "$IRE_natural_party$"
 IRE_sf_idea_4_desc: "While it has not directly ruled Ireland for all of its independent history, the years Sinn Féin has been in power and its recent response to the Black Monday crisis has left the impression upon many of Ireland's people that the party is the "safe" and "default" option. While other parties still remain an important part of the system, to most the perception is that when the going gets tough it'll be Sinn Féin that'll be the ones that get going."
 IRE_sf_end_idea: "The Party of Law and Order"
 IRE_sf_end_idea_desc: "It is the view of many of Ireland's people that liberty cannot exist against the backdrop of chaos, and so the Sinn Féin government has carved itself out a winning identity as the \"Party of Law and Order\". While the appeals to the workers from Labour or those to Christian values from SC may be looked upon fondly, when it comes down to it the stability Sinn Féin has brought to the nation is a hard thing for any other party to contest."

While these freedoms may have slowly begun to lapse in the recent years, the new leadership of Sinn Féin has made clear their intentions to ensure the upholding of these immutable rights first proclaimed so many years ago."
 IRE_church_sf_idea: "Religious Pluralism"
 IRE_church_sf_idea_desc: "While it has long been the perception to those looking in that Catholicism and Irishness are inseparably linked, Sinn Féin have made it their mission to ensure that all of Ireland's people no matter their faith or denomination are represented. This is of course more easier said than done, something the government has quickly begun to experience, but it is hoped that this pluralistic approach will pay off in the long run once the teething pains have been endured."
 IRE_international_port: "International Port of Belfast"
 IRE_international_port_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the old order in Britain, Belfast has slowly become one of the most important ports in the world when it comes to shipmaking. Having provided ship construction and repairs for countless nations and groups already, the shipyards of Belfast have significantly grown as a result of support from the government and many have begun to regard Belfast as one of the most important ports in the world."

 IRE_dublin_international_hub_desc: "With the collapse of the Berlin stock market and the American Civil War leaving investors across the world shaken, an opportunity has been presented for the creation of a new hub of international finance and business. With the support of the Irish Government, the nation's capital of Dublin has begun to present itself as this new hub, attracting investments from across the globe."

 IRE_sc_idea_1: "Homes for the Poor"
 IRE_sc_idea_1_desc: "While some may see the construction of cheap affordable houses and flats as the best solution to the deficiency of housing in Ireland, the An Saorstát Críostúil government has instead adopted the approach of focusing on building \"proper\" homes for its peoples. To those in SC, a life in a small flat with nothing green in sight is not a life worth living."
 IRE_sc_idea_2: "Catholic Social Teaching"
 IRE_sc_idea_2_desc: "Rejecting the more secular position of previous governments, An Saorstát Críostúil have made clear that it will uphold Catholic social teachings throughout all aspects of Irish life. While this has of course appealed to many Catholics across Ireland, it has not been the most well received by many of the non-Catholics in the nation, especially in Ulster."
 IRE_sc_idea_3: "Protectionism"
 IRE_sc_idea_3_desc: "Shying away from the more open markets of Mitteleuropa, Ireland has begun pursuing protectionist policies to avoid many native ran businesses from going under when put against the cheap goods that flow in from the continent."
 IRE_sc_idea_4: "Decentralised Governance"
 IRE_sc_idea_4_desc: "Reversing course from the centralisation pursued by Sinn Féin, the Irish Government has opted to further empower local councils across the nation. It is hope that by allowing these councils to make local decisions for local people, it will be their needs met rather than just the needs of those in Dublin and other urban centres."
 IRE_sc_ndp_idea: "Working with Businesses"
 IRE_sc_ndp_idea_desc: "Aiming to bring about significant economic growth the Irish Government has begun introducing many business friendly policies, with generous tax breaks being primary amongst them. It is hoped that this will allow them to much more easily compete with their continental competitors, and that the effects will be felt along term across the entire nation."
 IRE_sc_ndp_end_idea: "The Coalition of the Centre"
 IRE_sc_ndp_end_idea_desc: "In spite of many on both ends of the political spectrum wishing to drag Ireland firmly towards their direction, the Irish Government has instead sought a firm middle ground with a strong and stable coalition in the centre. While this approach has certainly had its detractors, it is impossible to deny the popularity of the stability it has achieved."
 IRE_sc_an_idea: "Corporatism"
 IRE_sc_an_idea_desc: "Seeking an alternative to both capitalism and socialism, the Irish Government has pursued a \"third way\" approach of Corporatism, inspired especially by the perceived success of similar policies in Portugal and other parts of the continent. While of course primarily an economic system, it is hoped that in time it will permeate all levels of Irish society and reshape it into one strong unified body that all the nation's people contribute to."
 IRE_sc_an_end_idea: "Moral Governance"
 IRE_sc_an_end_idea_desc: "To those on Ireland's right, the idea that a government can truly serve its people without a strong foundation of Catholic morals is a laughable one. To them without this foundation a nation will inevitably collapse into chaos, and to these ends they have carved out a future for the nation according to their interpretation of these principles and morals."
 IRE_church_sc_idea: "Primus Inter Pares"
 IRE_church_sc_idea_desc: "While Ireland may be a land of many faiths and denominations, with the declaration of Catholicism as \"Primus Inter Pares\", or \"First Among Equals\", the Irish Government has made clear as to which it views as the true faith of the nation while still maintaining some level of respect for the other faiths. The perception of many of Ireland's Protestants however has made it clear that to them this \"respect\" is nowhere to be seen."
 IRE_church_sc_an_idea: "Unica Ecclesia Existit"
 IRE_church_sc_an_idea_desc: "Not content with simply recognising the Catholic Church as \"First Among Equals\", the Irish Government has taken the further step of declaring Catholicism the sole religion of the Irish nation. While this has certainly alienated the large minority of those in the nation who subscribe to different beliefs, especially the Protestants of the north, it has been a very popular policy among the strongly Catholic conservative part of the population."
 IRE_anglo_irish_heritage: "Anglo-Irish Heritage"
 IRE_anglo_irish_heritage_desc: "Ireland, especially Ulster in particular, has for centuries been a place that both those of Irish and British descent have called home. While to many across the nation Ireland is foremost the home of the Irish people, the Irish Government has embarked on a campaign to change this view. With a focus on promoting the shared history and heritage of both of these major groups that call the nation home, the government hopes that in time many will begin to see these men and women as nothing more than their fellow countrymen."

 IRE_reinforce_the_gaeltachtai_desc: "The Irish Government has instituted a wide range of policies aimed at supporting the development of the primarily Irish speaking areas of the nation.

Instead, it has been a more gradual, but still revolutionary, transition towards the socialist vision.\n\nWhile this approach has received criticism from more radical elements, the Irish government has made clear that to them Ireland's destiny has always been a socialist one, and that it only needs a steady hand to guide it towards it, rather than an iron fist."

 murphy_radio_desc: "The Murphy company, better known as \"Murphy Radios\", is a popular electronics company based in Islandbridge, Dublin. Focusing on quality and durability, expensive premium Murphy Radios became a hit not just in Ireland, but also a coveted luxury black market item in the Union of Britain, where they are considered \"bourgeois\" compared to mass produced rivals. With their high standards in the field of electronics, Murphy would be an excellent partner in developing electronics for the Irish military."
 mcmullan_bros: "McMullan Bros. Ltd."
 mcmullan_bros_desc: "McMullan Bros, also trading as \"Maxol\" and \"Mex\", are the primary chemical traders in Ireland. Coming to prominence in the era of rationing during the Weltkrieg, the McMullan brothers managed to secure a deal which saw them importing Mexican oil into the country. As Ireland broke its connection to Britain, this deal instantaneously became of vital importance to the new state and propelled the McMullan Bros. company into high profitability. Now with over three decades of experience in dealing with petrochemicals, they are experts in their field."

 harland_wolff_3: "$harland_wolff$"
 harland_wolff_start: "Although Harland & Wolff are by far and away best known as a ship-building company, such is its size that subsections of the company can branch out into other areas. With a workforce already long experienced in the construction of military weapons, Harland & Wolff can be easily deployed to construct weaponry outside of the naval variety,"
 harland_wolff_3_desc: "$harland_wolff_start$ though given their familiarity with naval gun turrets, the production of land-based artillery pieces would be far from outside the realms of possibility."
 james_mackie_sons: "James Mackie & Sons"
 james_mackie_sons_desc: "Founded in the mid-19th century, \"Mackie's\" (as they're known locally) is an engineering textile machinery engineering plant in Belfast. However, during the Weltkrieg, the company converted to manufacturing war supplies such as munitions, and can do so again if called upon. Mackies' workforce, numbering in the thousands, has historically been near-exclusively Protestant, and is reluctant to change..."
 john_rigby: "John Rigby & Company"
 john_rigby_desc: "John Rigby & Company is an Anglo-Irish gunmaking firm that has switched locations between Ireland and England several times in its history, but for the moment seems firmly rooted back its original founding location of Dublin. Since the 1910s, the Rigby company has been intertwined with Mauser, and since fleeing the Union of Britain in the 1920s, has developed this connection even further with help from blossoming German-Irish relations."
 o_gorman: "O'Gorman Ltd."
 o_gorman_desc: "O'Gorman Ltd is an automobile construction company specialising in buses. Unusually for a national company, its primary headquarters is not located in any city, but the rural town of Clonmel, County Tipperary in the south of the country. Spurred into creation by the opening of the Ford factory in Cork, O'Gorman is willing to place itself in the national service if called upon."

 coras_iompair_eireann: "Great Southern"
 coras_iompair_eireann_desc: "Great Southern Railways is the Irish successor company to the various British controlled railway companies that preceded it in the era before independence. Suddenly thrust into possession of the entire Irish railway infrastructure, but without much of the institutional knowledge from the British era, GSR has struggled at times. However, militarisation and further input from state apparatus' may actually prove beneficial to the long term success of the company."

 aer_lingus: "Aer Lingus"
 aer_lingus_desc: "Aer Lingus is Ireland's state-controlled national commercial airfleet. As a small island nation, air travel was necessary but prohibitively costly to set up, something that disencouraged most private ventures. In order to ensure Ireland did not fall behind the rest of Europe, the state stepped in and created its own airline. With the multiple international civilian, military and industrial contacts made during its formation, the idea had been mooted of the small-scale domestic production of some modified imported designs, an idea the government may re-visit in the future."
 iona: "Iona Airways"
 iona_desc: "Somewhat the outlaws of Irish aviation, Iona Airways was started in 1931 by a second-hand car salesman Hugh Cahill on an airfield near his garage in Dublin, without help from the government. The company was not started with the intention of providing commercial travel, but moreso to provide aircraft for aerial enthusiasts and sightseers. Early flights saw the company perform illegal landings in fields and on beaches, much to the authorities chagrin, but to the public's amusement. Although the company now provides some flights from Ireland to Germany, the opportunity to earn a cash injection from a government contract woud be quickly welcomed."
 short_brothers: "Short Brothers"
 short_brothers_desc: "The Short Brothers company, originally based in England, was one of the first in the world to design and produce aircraft, and even before that created military balloons. During the Weltkrieg, Short Brothers provided the fledging British air force with its first armed biplanes. The Short Brothers did not immediately leave Britain following the revolution, but as the economy was radically altered along syndicalist lines, eventually the founders relocated to Belfast, alongside many other exiles. Although they have diversified their business to include creating buses and trams, they would welcome the opportunity to produce military aircraft once again."

 harland_wolff: "Harland & Wolff"
 harland_wolff_desc: "The undisputed largest shipbuilding company in Belfast, Harland & Wolff was responsible for constructing some of the biggest commercial and military ships ever to come out of the former United Kingdom. Rocked the collapse of the UK, the company avoided being sunk too in the 1920s by building ships for many and varied navies all over the world. As the largest employer in Ireland, their workforce numbers in the dozens of thousands, and in a country dominated by agriculture and light industries, the size and scale of Harland & Wolff's heavy industry cannot be underestimated."

 workman_clark_company_desc: "At one time the fourth-largest ship-building company in the former United Kingdom, Workman, Clark & Company remains in operation in Belfast, although at a much reduced capacity. The opportunity to work with the government will be welcomed, as not only will it provide them to increase production again, but to use their expertise from years past."
