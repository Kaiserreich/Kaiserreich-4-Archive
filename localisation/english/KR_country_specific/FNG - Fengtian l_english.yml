#Unused Loc:
#Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Rehe, to the Southwest of Liaoning Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south.

#The 'Huanghanhui', or 'Imperial Han Society', have been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."

#"The Imperial Han Society, a secret society with a Han-chauvinistic ideology and uncompromising hate of other ethnicities, is believed to be behind a number of killings in Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."

#Xiehehui (Concordia Association)\n§LA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly. Their actual ideological positions vary, some using the Japanese to counter Zhang's power for their own gain, with others subscribing to Pan-Asian principles.§!\n

### Ideas ###
 FNG_Regionalist_Sentiment: "Regionalist Sentiment"
 FNG_Regionalist_Sentiment_desc: "Our government's national goals have always clashed with more localised regionalist messages, which hold greater appeal among the broadly apolitical majority than high-minded republican ideals. Although Zhang Zuolin once rode regionalist sentiment to his current position as ruler, it now threatens to derail his plans to again go south of the Great Wall, conquer Beijing, and reclaim all of China."
 FNG_Regionalist_Resentment: "Regionalist Resentment"
 FNG_Regionalist_Resentment_desc: "Triggered by rumours, anger simmers quietly in some portions of the public, while others have begun to take to the streets in protest."
 FNG_Regionalist_Outrage: "Regionalist Outrage"
 FNG_Regionalist_Outrage_desc: "The government's attempts to suppress the so-called 'Dongbei Party' have, at least temporarily, backfired as protests have rapidly evolved into riots in some urban centres. The violence is not yet extreme, but it doesn't need to be. The government now has the justification it needs to crack down and suppress this subversive movement once and for all."
 FNG_Backward_Industry: "Backward Industry"
 FNG_Backward_Industry_desc: "While Fengtian may contain the second largest industrial base in East Asia, its size conceals obsolete machinery, inefficient practices, and severe mismanagement. Only extensive reforms, backed by a great deal of investment can overcome these challenges."
 FNG_factionalism_modifier: "Divided Governance"
 FNG_factionalism_modifier_desc: "Despite its claims to the contrary, the Fengtian Government is plagued by endemic corruption, infighting, and abuse of power. While this is nothing out of the ordinary for China, it impedes the proper functioning of government and limits support for the regime. Should any of the governing factions gain too much influence, disastrous consequences are sure to follow."
 FNG_Investment_Dearth: "Investment Dearth"
 FNG_Investment_Dearth_desc: "The economic collapse that followed Fengtian's entry into the last Zhifeng War severely damaged its fiscal base and financial credibility, leaving the government with few creditors, and private businesses with severely limited options. Few have the confidence to invest in Fengtian, either at home or abroad."
 FNG_Limited_Investment: "Limited Investment"
 FNG_Limited_Investment_desc: "Thanks to government incentives investment has grown, but there is still an overall shortage. We must look to other sources to provide the funds we need."
 FNG_Intel_Leak: "Intelligence Leak"
 FNG_Intel_Leak_desc: "Through gross incompetence, or even more questionable reasons, a minister has leaked vital intelligence to Fengtian's enemies."
 FNG_Year_of_Righteous_Effort: "The Year of Righteous Effort"
 FNG_Year_of_Righteous_Effort_desc: "With the Grand Marshal's Proclamation, the nation is united in a strenuous effort to prepare for the rigours of war."
 FNG_Japanese_Aid_Cut: "Japanese Aid Cut"
 FNG_Japanese_Aid_Cut_desc: "Japan has cut all aid to the government as a means of punishment for what it sees as insubordination."
 FNG_Buying_Silver: "Buying Silver"
 FNG_Buying_Silver_desc: "Silver, by definition, is expensive and the government is presently buying a great deal of it. Once the reserve is full, however, it will have a reliable basis for currency and credit."
 FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse: "Central Bank Collapse"
 FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse_desc: "The Central Bank seems to have misplaced millions of taels worth of silver precisely as Japanese banks called for their loans to be repaid. How could this have happened?"
 FNG_The_Kwantung_Army: "The Kwantung Army"
 FNG_The_Kwantung_Army_desc: "The Kwantung Army has been in Manchuria for decades, but their crucial role during Guo Songling's revolt in 1925 gave all the leverage they needed to move their headquarters to Shenyang, greatly increasing their influence over the government. Now they operate as a de-facto military mission and occupational force, protecting the railroads, providing material aid, and giving 'advice'. Unfortunately, ignoring this advice can have dire consequences."
 FNG_Educational_Vacuum: "Educational Vacuum"
 FNG_Educational_Vacuum_desc: "The sudden absence of certain teachers, professors, and scientists has left a troublesome educational vacuum. Foreign and domestic replacements can be found, but at a cost, and not without great inconvenience."
 FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1: "Post-Colonial Chaos"
 FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1_desc: "Even at its most limited, Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's economy and infrastructure was tight, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is crippled. It will take time to rebuild and reorganise, but if Mantetsu's influence was greater, it could have been far worse."
 FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2: "Post-Colonial Chaos"
 FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2_desc: "Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's politics, economy, and infrastructure was tight, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is crippled. It will take time to rebuild and reorganise, but if Mantetsu's influence was even greater, it could have been worse."
 FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3: "Post-Colonial Chaos"
 FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3_desc: "Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's politics, economy and infrastructure was choking, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is utterly crippled. It will take a very long time to rebuild and reorganise."
 FNG_Disastrous_Governance: "Disastrous Governance"
 FNG_Disastrous_Governance_desc: "The Recovery League's thorough grip on power has begun to fray the state's already tenuous grasp on legitimacy."
 FNG_Army_Dominance: "Army Dominance"
 FNG_Army_Dominance_desc: "The Zhang Clique and the Army have a thorough grip on government, causing the other political factions to turn to unconventional means to limit their control. Unfortunately, these means and the Zhang Clique's abuses of power have dire consequences."
 FNG_Plutocratic_Exploitation: "Plutocratic Exploitation"
 FNG_Plutocratic_Exploitation_desc: "The Communications Clique's iron grip on the nation's government has allowed it to engage in an entirely new level of exploitation and greed, reducing the state's legitimacy and attracting unprecedented Japanese political pressure."
 FNG_the_heilongjiang_defection_idea: "The Heilongjiang Defection"
 FNG_the_heilongjiang_defection_idea_desc: "Having long been a rival and opponent of Yang Yuting under the guise of the late Zhang Zuolin's tenure in the Three Northeastern Provinces, Ma Zhanshan and Zhang's close allies from his days as a bandit, the Heilongjiang Clique, have defected following Yuting's assumption as Grand Marshal of the Fengtian Government. Taking with them the equivalent of 3 million silver dollars from the reserve, it has had a sordid effect on the administration's financial capacity."
 FNG_ma_insurgency_idea: "The Heilongjiang Insurgency"
 FNG_ma_insurgency_idea_desc: "Denied their offering of service to the enemy, the Heilongjiang Clique of Ma Zhanshan, Wan Fulin, and Wu Junsheng have decided to take matters into their own hands. Staging a call for national resistance across radio channels in the Northeast, they have begun to sap potential recruits to their cause, and attack various garrisons all across Dongbei. Whilst unlikely to transform into a full-scale revolt against the new Fengtian authorities, it is nonetheless a pressing matter that requires considerable government attention, much of which could be directed towards the interior."

 FNG_Legations_Deal: "The Legations Deal"
 FNG_Legations_Deal_desc: "Through some clever politicking, and perhaps some backroom 'negotiation', the Economic Minister has secured a valuable trade deal with the Legation Cities."

 FNG_Suppressed_Labour_Movement: "Suppressed Labour Movement"
 FNG_Suppressed_Labour_Movement_desc: "Although labourers have become a crucial part of Chinese society, they have also become a hotbed for the burgeoning Chinese socialist movement. Such ideals have always been and shall continue to be the disease of the heart, and the Anguojun shall provide the necessary cure to such an ailment."

 FNG_Worker_Loyalty: "Worker Loyalty"
 FNG_Worker_Loyalty_desc: "If our nation shall one day achieve anything close to the power of the Great Dynasties of old, then our nation must be of one mind. Talk of class warfare only divides the people when national success brings prosperity to all walks of life. Just as the Grand Marshal must have the people's best interests at heart, so too must all classes have the nation's best interests at heart. Only then shall the Chinese people reap the rewards of faith, and surpass even the greatest empires of the West."

 FNG_Centralized_Provincial_Revenues: "Centralised Provincial Revenues"
 FNG_Centralized_Provincial_Revenues_desc: "During the Heights of the Warlord Era, any warlord could claim Beijing or Guangzhou on their own and concurrently become the President of the Republic. As such, the provinces zealously guarded their wealth from being taxed by rivals on the Republican throne, instead opting to utilise provincial revenues to fund their own armies and local economies.\n\nSuch a time of disunity has come to an end now, with the triumph of the Anguojun over its greatest rivals. If China is to become strong once more, then the entire nation must operate under a singular vision, just as a symphony must follow the whims of one sole conductor. Parallel tax codes and legal systems must be abolished, and all shall bend the knee to China's true government."

 FNG_primacy_of_the_loyalists: "Primacy of the Loyalists"
 FNG_primacy_of_the_loyalists_desc: "Unlike the pompous Wu Peifu who attended the great Baoding Academy and the liberal intellectuals of the south who scoff at the Fengtian Government, our Marshal Zhang came from nothing. He was born into abject poverty, and became a bandit in his youth. It was during this time that Zhang met many like him, and forged with them a brotherhood of steel. These bands of brothers were collectively absorbed into the Qing military following the Russo-Japanese War, and sided with the Imperial Government and Beiyang Army during the Xinhai Revolution.\n\nZhang and his brothers came to form the nucleus of the Fengtian Clique, and this tight-knit assortment of bandits-turned-warlords were able to achieve political dominance over China for a time. Even though Marshal Zhang's government ended up losing Beijing in 1927, the Fengtian Clique's cohesive structure allowed them to once again claim control over the Forbidden City. It was through friends and family that Marshal Zhang was able to achieve final victory over his rivals, and his allies will continue to serve as the core of the Anguojun military force."

 FNG_Command_Reforms: "Thorough Command Reforms"
 FNG_Command_Reforms_desc: "Every military clique in China has its centre, but it is not the centre that often leads to victory. No, it is the efforts and sacrifice of its most diligent, those who dare to dream of greatness and those who are not afraid to take it. While the Japanese military has adopted meritorious reforms, it seems that China and the Fengtian Clique continue to lag behind on such measures. The Grand Marshal must see to it that the Chinese military is not purely structured around his friends and family, but also the best and brightest young stars who emerge from the haystack, who shall continue to perform great deeds in service to the nation, and perhaps lead it one day."

 FNG_triumph_of_the_model_officers: "Triumph of the Model Officers"
 FNG_triumph_of_the_model_officers_desc: "In Japan, many promising young Chinese students learned how to conduct war in the Japanese fashion. Upon returning home, they brought their knowledge with them, and transformed the military around themselves. Sun Chuanfang rose to become not just a petty warlord, but master of Eastern China. Chiang Kai-shek became the military director of the Kuomintang, and was responsible for the training of Whampoa students. Meanwhile in the Fengtian Clique, the Shikan Clique has been responsible for many of Marshal Zhang's victories. The Marshal has recognised the achievements of the meritorious, and has allowed their methods to be the guiding force of the new Chinese military."

 FNG_beiyang_popular_support_intro: "The popular image of a warlord is that of an arbitrary tyrant: a cruel, uneducated autocrat with little regard to human life, ceaseless avarice, and surrounded by a decadent court of vice and yesmen. The reality is much more nuanced. Many warlords were well-educated and kept up to date with international political trends, and while most had a ruthless streak, that was hardly uncommon in China. Furthermore, while most were autocrats, they hardly ruled alone: they were backed by a complex web of politicians, generals, economic elites, social figures, and intellectuals."

 FNG_popular_support_twin_dragons_taming_the_water_desc: "The modern Chinese Federalist rose and fell across the first half of the 1920s. A coalition of constitutionalists, democrats, and regionalists - they banded together amid the continued North-South stalemate at the peak of the warlord era. Their calls for the various provinces to work towards implementing local self-government and then peacefully unite together into a federal republic achieved some traction, but after a promising start it was rejected by both northern and southern governments, with further discrediting by the Zhili's successful unification by force.\n\nIn what almost seems like a cruel joke, it would appear that the final attempt to bridge the North-South divide as of recent has proved its most fruitful; finally, after decades, the nation is united in somewhat amiable terms. Albeit, the situation is far from genuine. With Zhang Junmai thrust into the position of compromise Premier for a President who would rather surf the delights of hedonism than heed governance, the government has found itself miraculously inefficient at even the most basic conducts of Governance. United on the surface, it takes but one glance beneath to witness all the cracks manifesting in the Republic's hastily composed structures."

Anyone who is anyone, or wants to be, must grease the wheels of Communication's political machine, and in return be rewarded handsomely for their efforts.

Once a motley crew of exiled politicians and failures, the Recovery League has managed to bolster its numbers with undeniable expertise under the guise of the Five Races, and through the efforts of men such as Pan Fu, Gu Weijun, and Wang Yitang, the Old Marshal appears to have had his wish granted; a state utterly subservient to him and his family, staffed by wise scholars akin to the days of old."

Without having bend to the whims of of autocrats or superiors, bar Tokyo, Wang has been granted the full capacities of his position to implement his desired social policies reminiscent of his time during the heyday of the Anfu Club.

Our erstwhile \"ally\", the Japanese Empire, glances only to the Fengtian Government as pawns in a greater game. And thus, in any impending war of national salvation, the student body, sitting idly, must be prepared. For whilst they must not be forced into warfare, war may arive to their doorstep all the same. Through paramilitary drilling, indoctrination in the nation's principles, and a resolute belief in China, every able-bodied soul will rise up to defend the nation."

 FNG_reviving_chinese_financial_stability: "Reviving Chinese Financial Stability"
 FNG_reviving_chinese_financial_stability_desc: "Suffice to say, China's financial situation has been less than ideal. With the majority of its banking wealth absorbed into coastal cities such as Tianjin, Hong Kong, or Shanghai, the stability of the nation's finance lies much outside its own control. Similarly, decades of warfare and the lack of a true, strong, resilient Central Government has resulted both in a distrust for Chinese credit, an influx in inordinate local currencies, and even the hoarding of assets in times of great struggle. It will take a monumental effort, but the government can at least work towards rebuilding China's commerce."

 FNG_pacification_by_chinese_might: "Pacification by Chinese Might"
 FNG_pacification_by_chinese_might_desc: "Like in the days of the Jin Dynasty, President Yuan Shikai was unable to maintain order across the Middle Kingdom and the Central State once again plunged into chaos, as two governments emerged, each claiming to represent all of China. Marshal [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government inherits the legacy of the Beiyang Army, the most righteous and modernising force across all China.\n\nMeanwhile, the ignoble Guangzhou Government claims succession from the vile Sun Yat-sen who in his derangement brought the scourge of marxism into our sacred nation's heart. Against liberals who foolishly call themselves humane and socialist bandits who steal from rich and poor alike, the Anguojun Government marches forward to restore not just order, but spiritual restoration to a nation suffering from the sickness of imperialism."

 FNG_maximising_production_line_efficiency_idea: "Maximising Production Line Efficiency"
 FNG_maximising_production_line_efficiency_idea_desc: "In the West, superior manufacturing has resulted in the shifting of borders and the toppling of Empires. While Fengtian boasts the greatest industrial base in all of China, such industrial might is useless if it isn't harnessed to its fullest potential. The Empire of Japan to the East and the Russian Bear to the North wield far superior manufacturing methods to our own, and if China is to freed by itself, then the Anguojun Government must institute much-needed production regulations and organisation in order to produce enough military equipment to ensure the Anguojun remains the best supplied force in the nation."

 FNG_intolerable_political_realities: "Intolerable Political Realities"
 FNG_intolerable_political_realities_desc: "Although the Fengtian Government stands once more as the true Central Government based in Beijing, a Government of Tradition and Order seems to continue to elude the Chinese people. The Anguojun continue to support such lofty ideals, but the provisional government, which previously only ruled in Shenyang, is currently unsuitable to administer provinces south of the Great Wall with great effectiveness. Governance barely extends beyond city walls, and many administrative posts remain vacant as [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration scrambles to fill in all the posts."

 FNG_endemic_economic_malaise: "Endemic Economic Malaise"
 FNG_endemic_economic_malaise_desc: "In 1926, Zhang Zuolin found the Fengtian Dollar struggling to maintain value and hoped to secure foreign loans to sustain the ailing economy. The Northern Expedition only served to exacerbate the fragile economy, and the Fengtian Dollar suffered collapse after Wu's Zhili Clique pushed Zhang back across the Great Wall. Such was the state of the Northeastern economy that the Russian opportunists attempted to encroach on Chinese land, which was only stopped by capitulation to the Japanese.\n\nAlthough Japanese aid largely restabilised Anguojun finances, it would seem that the National Reclamation War has once again rendered the Fengtian economy on the brink. Many foreign businesses find themselves unwilling to operate in our lands so long as banditry and violence remains prevalent in urban centres, and many Chinese businesses which operated based on the Zhili order have now found themselves displaced in the New China. Marshal [ROOT.GetLeader] must see the economic woes patched or risk losing the support of the people."

 FNG_crippling_army_rivalries: "Crippling Army Rivalries"
 FNG_crippling_army_rivalries_desc: "Although the Fengtian Clique remains one of the more cohesive military cliques operating in China, it too has also been prone to division. While Marshal Zhang Zuolin and his sworn-brothers formed the nucleus of the army initially, the Fengtian Army developed its own assortment of Young Guard factions in the coming years. Zhang's oldest son Zhang Xueliang upon graduating from the Fengtian Military Academy established his own inner circle within the Fengtian Military, which came to be known as the Shaoshuai Clique. When Zhang welcomed Yang Yuting and other Japanese-trained NCOs into the Fengtian military, these officers formed the Shikan Clique, which called for Japanese-inspired military reforms.\n\nA third progressive Young Guard faction was established by the rising Fengtian officer Guo Songling, who utterly despised Yang and his Shikan Clique. Ultimately, Guo would lead a rebellion following the 2nd Zhifeng War which resulted in his death and the destruction of his posse, but the scars of the Anti-Fengtian revolt continue to reverberate in the Anguojun Army. Zhang Xueliang never forgave Yang's execution of his old friend and mentor, and this second Fengtian victory has once again led to increased ambitions and heightened tensions. Should [ROOT.GetLeader] hope to maintain an orderly regime, he must see to it that a Anti-Fengtian revolt does not occur under his watch."

Such is a question that looms large and with longevitiy in the minds of many of the Heping Jianguojun's common soldiers. Money is an incentive, of course, but it cannot cleanse one's own soul. Those few men of military talent that opted for collaboration remain sparce and scattered, whilst the army itself is incredibly reliant upon Japanese arms and materiel to support even the most basic of garrison efforts."

 FNG_hollowed_out_economy_desc: "An occupation authority transformed into a new state, few would have had high hopes for the Reformed Government's economic situation upon the arrival of \"independence\", and yet the situation is far worse than any previous economic downfall China has ever experienced. A nation brutalised by its new overseers, entire cities have been laid to waste, with factories and communities demolished. Furthermore, the only areas of feasible economic productivity remain in the hands of the Japanese, or their compradors, and they hardly seem pliable to willing relenquishing their spoils."

But collaboration is a complex construct, and the various individuals gathered under the halls of the new Chinese administration have all reached the embrace of Tokyo for various reasons. Numbering among them: genuine sympathy, material conditions, dissonance with the previous power structures, and so on. Yet not all collaborators are equal, especially those unwilling or otherwise forced. Nonetheless, the sin they have committed is great, and the nation will not soon forget it."

In the West, it was the plutocratic class and industrious businessmen who brought about economic modernisation, and the Chinese people must learn from their successes whilst avoiding their mistakes. Yesterday's China was the Great Empire of the Past, Today's China is the sleeping tiger, and Tomorrow's China is the Dragon Reborn."

Coining such an ideology as National Statism, it became the pillar of the Young China Party. China will be reborn not through the death of the Old China, but a celebration of both Old and New China to truly honour the dream of 1911, and establish a Nationalistic, Corporatist, and Confucian China."

Unfortunately, the project met serious delays due to the eruption of war in the south, and Japanese attempts to stall construction. The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incapable of fulfilling its true purpose; providing a Chinese-controlled strategic alternative to the main line of the South Manchuria Railway.

Nearing completion in late 1927, any further construction was halted due to turmoil in the south and the need for funds elsewhere. While Mantetsu still holds significant control over the line at the moment, finishing the line should give us the edge needed to control it. However, most significantly, its completion would allow us to bypass the South Manchuria Railway when moving troops north towards Heilongjiang, thus decreasing Japan's control over our strategic decisions. Furthermore, an upgrade to the Pingqi line should also bring some much needed economic development to the relatively undeveloped northern reaches of Fengtian province."

 FNG_japanese_patience_runs_thin_mission: "Japanese Patience Runs Thin"
 FNG_japanese_patience_runs_thin_mission_desc: "The Imperial Court, at behest of the Tianjin Army, has begrudgingly offered their support for our War of National Reclamation. But we are on a short leash - the Kwantung Army and others fear the possibility of losing control of Manchuria and doubt our ability to achieve definitive results. Should we fail to take key objectives, most notably Beijing, in time or worse should we be driven back - the Kwantung Army may seize the moment to install one of the puppets into power."

 FNG_buy_time_with_emperor_decision: "Buy Time with the Emperor"
 FNG_buy_time_with_emperor_decision_desc: "Zhang has always been careful about his relationship with Japan, never wanting to appear submissive to avoid offending Chinese nationalists but also maintaining a friendly appearance to ensure the steady flow of Japanese aid. It is well known by now that the Imperial Court does not have total control over its armies, but that does not mean we can ignore them either. Pleading our case with Japanese Officials, with the Tianjin Army faction as our intermediaries, will help keep a lid on Japanese pressure."

 FNG_crack_down_on_sedition_decision: "Crack Down on Sedition"
 FNG_crack_down_on_sedition_decision_desc: "Various Japanese agents have sought to penetrate major organs in our government, bribing and corrupting our officials and commanders. They have sought to expand Japanese influence in civilian affairs, pulling figures from the various Fengtian Clique factions into their sphere. All of this has undermined Zhang's control over his own government, and making an example out of a few ringleaders will send a proper message about loyalty across Dongbei."

 FNG_curtail_the_shikan_clique_decision: "Curtail the Shikan Clique"
 FNG_curtail_the_shikan_clique_decision_desc: "In the military realm, Japanese Advisors have courted various officers up and down the command hierarchy to promote their influence with the army. The Shikan Clique in particular have been favourites of the Kwantung Army, many of them cultivated during their early military studies in Japan. Reassigning them from prominent positions, purging any open malcontents, and breaking up their networks will minimise their influence even if it disrupts the war effort and validates their beliefs that this war is debilitating."

 FNG_concessions_to_concordia_decision: "Concessions to Concordia"
 FNG_concessions_to_concordia_decision_desc: "The Concordia Association is the civilian front of Japanese imperialism, a group of bureaucrats, businessmen, and politicians ostensibly standing for promoting Pan-Asianism and Sino-Japanese trade ties. An extension of Japanese control over our railways, they have branched quickly into mining and government. Though ultimately a threat to our independence, we may need to work with them to check their more radical Kwantung Army peers."

 FNG_empower_japanese_advisors_decision: "Empower Japanese Advisors"
 FNG_empower_japanese_advisors_decision_desc: "Japan has deployed extensive \"advisors\" to support our military, helping us keep up with our German-backed Zhili rivals. But their ultimate goal is not to help us, but to ensure Japanese dominance on the continent. Allowing them further say in our decision-making will help calm them down but also give them further power down the line. They are sure to use it to expand the reach of their favourites in our government and consolidate their power over us."

 JAP_faith_in_zhang_runs_out_mission_desc: "We have backed Zhang Zuolin and the Fengtian Clique for several decades now, but he is an unreliable partner at best. His War of National Reclamation is a risky one and we can only afford a short leash - many in the Kwantung fear his latest gamble risks losing us control over Manchuria. The Tianjin Army promises definitive results in short order, but should they fail to assist Zhang in taking key objectives (most notably Beijing) in time or worse are driven back, the Kwantung Army may try to force our hand and drag us directly into the conflict."

 FNG_JAP_search_for_helpful_collaborators: "Search for Helpful Collaborators"
 FNG_JAP_search_for_helpful_collaborators_desc: "With faith in the over-ambitious \"Grand Marshal\" Zhang Zuolin's ability to win his war of National Reclamation waning, elements within our forces deployed in China have begun to search for alternatives. There are pro-Japanese elements within all the major cliques within the Fengtian Clique, ranging from eager Pan-Asianists to reluctant pragmatists to defeatist \"Pacifists\" who seek peace and stability only we can provide. Recruiting these civilians through proxies such as the Concordia Association in Manchuria, the \"New People's Society\" in Tianjin, and other agents will help increase our grip on the Fengtian government."

 FNG_JAP_rein_in_the_extremists: "Rein in the Extremists"
 FNG_JAP_rein_in_the_extremists_desc: "The Imperial Government's control over its men on the ground in China has always been limited by both geographic distance, the political need for plausible deniability, and the growing autonomous - sometimes bordering on rebellious - attitudes of its officers. There is a growing fear in Tokyo that our officers may be plotting something far beyond what has been authorised - unending decades of carefully laid out policy. We must sideline the worst offenders to forestall a crisis."

 FNG_JAP_deploy_emergency_economic_aid: "Deploy Emergency Economic Aid"
 FNG_JAP_deploy_emergency_economic_aid_desc: "Though Manchuria was once the most industrialised part of China, economic malaise and a determined effort to catch up by the Zhili has closed the gap. The Fengtian Government is struggling heavily to maintain its war footing and with our interests so heavily intertwined with their economy, it is up to us to provide an emergency injection of financial aid to prop up their war effort. We shall funnel money, technical experts, and machines through the Concordia Association, and with any luck they will survive long enough to repay us for what they owe."

 FNG_JAP_send_emergency_arms_shipment_desc: "Supplying a force capable of fighting a major war such as the Fengtian Army is no easy task and it is rapidly outstripping their military industrial base's capacity to do so. Our planners have proposed sending a massive shipment of rifles, artillery, and other supplies to keep the Fengtian Army in the field (especially units sympathetic to us), and hopefully keep the tide of the war in our favour."

 FNG_JAP_reinforce_our_armies_in_china: "Reinforce Our Armies in China"
 FNG_JAP_reinforce_our_armies_in_china_desc: "The reality of the situation is that Zhang Zuolin, for all of his pretences, is but a pawn in our games. The Fengtian Army is a pale imitation of our own, and are struggling on the battlefield against their rivals. Only the support of our \"advisors\" has kept them from routing, but we have received worrying reports suggesting that their current numbers is not enough. We need to send more men into the fray, which is bound to draw us deeper into the quagmire. But what choice do we have?"

Naturally of course, such efforts are most stringent within the Southern Provinces, wherein the Federalist movement found itself most easily settled, and entrenched. Although few believe such an arrangement can remain in-place forever, many of the influential figures of the South will at least continue to benefit for the time-being."

Foreseeing capitalist economic development as the way forward, it is hoped that the boons and benefits that the Capitalists themselves receive will be re-invested into the strengthening of the nation."

### Parties ###
 FNG_totalist_party: "Radicals"
 FNG_totalist_party_long: "Independent Radicals and Revolutionaries\n§LThe revolutionary strain of radicalism within China has a fascinating history emanating from the timeless struggle of martyrs and heroes in the struggle against perceived injustices. Mobilising the fury of the masses, various revolutionaries have come and went, either peacefully or through fire and war. Largely coalescing into various parties such as the Kuomintang, or Young China Party, the revolutionary strain of thought is largely in contention with that of the reformists.\n\nThe allure of radicalism extends all across China however, from the steppe of the Northwest Frontier to the bustling streets of Shanghai, many cling to the ideals of a radically transformed China, either in the socialist egalitarian ideal, or in the strong nationalist flavour. Operating either under the radical elements of the Kuomintang, Young China Party, or Chinese Syndicalist party, the extremist groups refuse to partake in the Chinese Parliamentary system; seeing the newly proclaimed Central Government as merely a betrayal of the socialist revolution.§!\n"
 FNG_syndicalist_party: "CSP"
 FNG_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party (Zhongguo Gongtuandang)\n§LLargely confined to urban centres or port cities, the Chinese Syndicalist Party for years remained merely a fragmented junior party of the Chinese Kuomintang. Considered to be milquetoast radicals espousing a foreign ideology in a nation without the large worker support base akin to that in Europe or the Americas, the Chinese Syndicalist Party still maintained significant successes in its political history. With key action in historical events such as the Hong Kong-Canton strikes in 1925, which resulted in the founding of the League of Chinese Syndicalists, or the Shanghai Uprising in 1932 which resulted in broad national mass action.\n\nWith its inherently pluralistic nature, the Chinese Syndicalist Party has found itself fragmented with a series of disparate cliques. Within the Northeast however, they are largely confined to a band of guerrillas led by Guan Xiangying, a stark divergence from their interior reliance on the urban working population; albeit they are little more than a political boogeyman.§!\n"
 FNG_radical_socialist_party: "KMT"
 FNG_radical_socialist_party_long: "Chinese Kuomintang (Zhongguo Guomindang)\n§LThe Chinese Nationalist Party has taken on many forms in its marred history. Founded as the parliamentary organisation of the Tongmenghui in 1912 by Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, and Song Jiaoren, the Kuomintang would endeavour itself to faithfully serve as a parliamentary party within the early Beiyang Republic. After Song's assassination and Sun's subsequent multiple exiles however, the Party would be reorganised into the Chinese Gemingang, and later revived as the Guomindang on October 10th 1919. Dedicated to the Three Principles of the People as espoused by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Kuomintang aspires for the implementation of the Party-State, or Dangguo, and implement the Three-Stage National Revolution. Through the aspiration for the Three Principles of Minzu, Minquan, and Minsheng (Nationalism, Democracy, and Welfare respectively), they hope to see a new revolutionary republic.\n\nDriven underground in 1927, their limited influence within pockets of revolutionary utopias and fluffy exiles scant make any difference within the Northeast, with the largest cell of sympathisers known as the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Directorate under Reorganised Comrades Association cadre Zhu Jiqing.§!\n"
 FNG_social_democrat_party: "NPSHA"
 FNG_social_democrat_party_long: "Northeast People's Self-Help Association (Dongbei minzhong zijiu hui)\n§LFormed from the brief liberalisation period of the late 1920s and early 1930s, the United National Construction League would ultimately be banned, but as a result opened the doors to the formation of the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties. A national movement spanning from North to South, the FCDP sought to unite all those parties seeking Constitutionalism and Liberal Democracy under one banner. With their efforts, they would champion the cause of true freedom for the Chinese people, and inevitably force even the mightiest warlord to bow to the fury of intellectuals and the masses.\n\nWhilst the Constitutionalists, and especially Zhang Junmai's National Renaissance Society, are persona non grata across the Great Wall, various members of Zhang Junmai's clique have setup shop within the Northeast, generally surrounding around Zhou Jngwen. In 1933 he organised the Northeast People's Self-Help Association as an extension of the Leftist strain of the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, in response to the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, acting as an orbiting faction within the CCP.§!\n"
 FNG_social_liberal_party: "Republicans"
 FNG_social_liberal_party_long: "Independent Republicans\n§LThe Beiyang government included many political independents, a tradition upheld in the Fengtian assembly. While perhaps united in a common desire for a constitutionalist, civilian ruled future, their unwillingness (or inability) to organise at a higher level has limited their options. Indeed, for a given issue they rarely vote as a united bloc, with legislators either swayed or bribed or threatened into a side.\n\nNevertheless, they are still a potent establishment force and provide hope for a constitutionalist, civilian ruled future. Their dreams of democratic reforms however are bound to be tempered by the realities they find themselves in. Few dare to speak out, though those that do clearly dream of a much more democratic republic.§!\n"
 FNG_market_liberal_party: "Restoration Society"
 FNG_market_liberal_party_long: "Restoration Society (Guangfuhui)\n§LOriginally founded in 1904 as the Military National Education Association by Tao Chengzhang, Zhang Taiyan, Cai Yuanpei, Gong Baoquan and Wei Lan, the future Restoraion Society was a Shanghai based revolutionary organisation that spanned into Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Fiercely anti-Manchu, the Restoration Society used various institutions such as Xu Xilin's Datong School to create a paramilitary bloc of revolutionary cadres ready to \"restore the Han people, return our mountains and rivers, dedicate ourselves to the country, and retire after success.\"\n\nWith the Tongmenghui's founding, most of the Restoration Society merged itself with the new Revolutionary Party, albeit some such as Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin continued to operate independently, dying in successive uprising attempts. In 1908 Tao would restart party operations due to disagreeing with Sun Yat-sen, and in 1910 Zhang Taiyan would help Tao officially split from Sun. Fighting in Xinhai, the organisation would be disbanded in 1912 after Tao was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nHowever, the Restoration Society as an icon and organisation has recently been revived by two of its lower-ranked members, Zhou Yawei and his wife Yin Ruizhi. Committed revolutionaries to some degree, the new Restoration Society advocates a vague form of nationalist republicanist liberalism, retaining old friends within Zhejiang.§!\n"
 FNG_social_conservative_party: "Communications Clique"
 FNG_social_conservative_party_long: "Communications Clique (Jiaotongxi)\n§LThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique was founded on the cusp of the Xinhai Revolution by Tang Shaoyi, albeit it is most largely associated with the likes of Liang Shiyi, its long-term leader and one of its most high profile members. Centred around the Ministry of Posts and Communications, responsible for railways, postal services, shipping, telephones, and the Bank of Communications, the Communications Clique was crucial in the old Beiyang Government for its immense amount of wealth and revenues.\n\nStrongly supporting Yuan Shikai's restoration of the monarchy, somewhat out of conviction and somewhat out of self-servitude, the \"Old\" Communications Clique would be exiled following Yuan's defeat in 1915, granting rise to the \"New\" Communications Clique. Centred around Liang's replacements in the Bank of Communications, it was founded by Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu, and was closely tied to the Anhui Clique. With Liang and Zhou Zhiqi's return in 1918, the old clique became powerful enough that it ran akin to a political party in the National Assembly on a platform of modernisation.\n\nThe New Communications Clique, staffed by Japanophiles and pragmatists, would politically collapse after their conduct during the Post-Weltkrieg Peace Talks in regards to Japanese demands. With Liang becoming premier in 1921, he would be removed by Wu Peifu despite Zhang Zuolin's staunch opposition, resulting in the First ZhiFeng War. Once having held the Premiership and Presidency, the surviving iteration of the Old and New Communications Cliques now focus more on squabbling with the Japanese over infrastructure development projects.§!\n"
 FNG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Recovery League"
 FNG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Recovery League (Guangfuxi)\n§LA loose association of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians without any strong ideological affiliation, most of whom find themselves in Fengtian because there are few other places where they might hold any semblance of power. Easily bribed and tempted, they often serve to promote the interests of whoever is willing to pay, and consequently the \"league\" is highly splintered despite controlling a large portion of the Assembly, lacking the political will to act decisively.\n\nHowever, their informal leader, Wang Yitang, long retains larger political ambitions than that of being Zuolin's accomplice. Having brought together a large amount of ex-Anhui Clique into the League, he has transformed the organisation into something of a revival of their former friend's political machine, albeit, reliant upon Fengtian to supplement its military arm.§!\n"
 FNG_paternal_autocrat_party: "Zhang Clique"
 FNG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Zhang Clique (Zhanghui)\n§LRooted in the foundations of Zhang Zuolin's early career as a bandit and soldier, the Zhang Clique is but the largest overarching composite collection of various smaller organisations and factions, staffed by loyalists and generals. Whilst ideology is present within the statesmanship decisions of those within the Zhang Clique, it is secondary to loyalty towards Zhang Zuolin. Hardly capable of continuing to rule as mere military strongmen, the Zhang Clique's pretences to democracy and lack of general commitment to true ideology leaves it open and malleable to many interpretations of Chinese republicanism.\n\nWith smaller regional cliques all-throughout Dongbei, they function as interest groups within Zhang Zuolin's inner circle; the Heilongjiang Clique of Wan Fulin, Wu Junsheng, and Ma Zhanshan, or the Shaoshuai Clique of Zhang Xueliang, the Shikan Clique of Yang Yuting, or Jilin Clique of Zhang Zuoxiang, to name a few. Considered to have the greatest sway on Zuolin's political outlook, the Zhang Clique itself is ripe with infighting and squabbling as ideological convictions and loyalties mature, and wane.§!\n"
 FNG_national_populist_party: "Young China Party"
 FNG_national_populist_party_long: "Young China Party (Zhongguo Qingniandang)\n§LBorn from the student \"Young China Society\", the Young China Party would be one of the society's successors, as it split into \"nationalist\", \"socialist\" and \"idealist\" factions, led by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, Li Dazhao, and Wang Guangqi respectively. Travelling to France to study, Zeng Qi and Li Huang and the other members of their nationalist faction would engage in spats with other students in France such as Zhou Enlai, Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng.\n\nSometimes becoming violent, the amassment of support for the Chinese Syndicalist Party would result in Zeng and Li forming their own party, announcing the formation of the Young China Party in 1923, outside Paris. Developing rapidly amongst Chinese student organisations, the Young China Party would stand in concrete opposition towards the Kuomintang's cooperation with the CSP, and the YCP would return to Shanghai founding a series of political societies and newspapers in 1924.\n\nWhilst largely confined to developments south of the Great Wall, the Young China Party carries some modicum of sway within the Northeast. Through contacts in various educational institutions such as Feng Yong's academies, or the Northeast Army Academy, Wang Shizeng has managed to win over individuals such as Wang Jiexia and Huo Weizhou, granting a foothold in the Fengtian Clique.§!\n"

 FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order: "Preservation of the Xinhai Revolution"
 FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc: "Ironically, Fengtian is the sole national government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although its republican commitments are questionable, and Southern reclamation is currently unrealistic, the government has loudly advocated both goals, as they foster domestic legitimacy."

 FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing: "Fuguo Qiangbing"
 FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing_desc: "Translating roughly to 'Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army', this proverb dates back to ancient legalist philosophers, but has been used more recently to inspire reforms in both Guangxu Era China and Meiji Era Japan. Now it is applied again in Fengtian, as the government seeks to modernise and eventually strike South against the resurgent Zhili Clique, and from there establish control over all China."

#Suppress Regionalist Sentiment Branch
 FNG_Suppress_Regionalist_Sentiment: "Suppress Regionalist Sentiment"
 FNG_Suppress_Regionalist_Sentiment_desc: "For many years, Zhang Zuolin's primary political slogan was 'The Northeast for the Northeast', but when his ambitions turned toward Beijing, this regionalist message had to be set aside. Ever since, it has proven a thorn in the Grand Marshal's side, and many still espouse these old sentiments. The time has come to put the matter to rest once and for all."

 FNG_Silence_Targeted_Subversives: "Silence Targeted Subversives"
 FNG_Silence_Targeted_Subversives_desc: "The regionalist movement has never been organised, but it has received support from the local gentry, school teachers, and government bureaucrats. Some of these figures have become increasingly prominent, and by silencing them we may cut the head from the regionalist snake. Some can be bribed, and others can be threatened or fired - to say nothing of other persuasive methods."

 FNG_Justify_Mass_Arrests: "Justify Mass Arrests"
 FNG_Justify_Mass_Arrests_desc: "So long as the regionalist movement remains peaceful, we lack the institutional and public support to crush it decisively. By dispatching agents disguised as protestors we can push the movement toward violent means, cost them their public support, and then justify mass arrests."

#Mantetsu Collaboration Section
 FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration: "Mantetsu Collaboration"
 FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration_desc: "Mantetsu, also known as the 'South Manchuria Railway Company', exerts an enormous amount of control over our economy, with numerous subsidiaries ranging from flour mills to hospitals. Its aid will unfortunately be essential to developing most aspects of our economy that require Japanese technical expertise."

 FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses: "Yamato Hotel Licences"
 FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses_desc: "One of Mantetsu's most successful ventures in Manchuria is its Yamato Hotel franchise, which serves the countless Japanese businessmen who make their way to and from the Home Islands every day. Despite the unwelcome influence they bear, their skills and capital are crucial. We must decide their future."

 FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise: "Japanese Electrical Expertise"
 FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise_desc: "Thanks to China's backwardness over the past century, and the chaos of the past two decades, the country has few native engineers. Japanese assistance will be essential in bringing modernity to the Northeast."

 FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing: "Mantetsu Research Wing"
 FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing_desc: "Mantetsu's Research Wing, known as 'Mantetsu Chōsabu', serves as the centrepiece of Japan's colonial programme, and pursues a wide variety of scientific goals. Its massive funding and talent pool could be of great use to us in our own efforts."

 FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects: "Mantetsu Civil Engineering Projects"
 FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects_desc: "While the Japanese have much to benefit directly from large civil engineering projects in Fengtian, they also do so indirectly by helping to present our regime as successful at improving the everyday lives of citizens. In this respect, our interests are mutually aligned."

#Crossover Section
 FNG_Develop_the_Northern_Frontier: "Develop the Northern Frontier"
 FNG_Develop_the_Northern_Frontier_desc: "The northern reaches of Heilongjiang and Xing'an have been dominated by mountainous boreal forests since time immemorial, swept by bitter Siberian winds and inhabited only by passing nomads. Modern technologies could allow settlers to penetrate this hostile environment and pursue rumours of coal, gold, and graphite in the Khingan Mountains."

 FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals: "Fengtian Society for Light Metals"
 FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals_desc: "Significant deposits of Bauxite and Alunite have been known to exist in Fengtian province for many years, but recent advances by Mantetsu sponsored laboratories in Fushun and Tokyo have enabled Aluminium production via a number of electro-chemical processes."

 FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity: "Yalu and Songhua Hydroelectricity"
 FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc: "Manchuria's abundant coal deposits make for an excellent power source, but the strong currents of the Yalu and Songhua rivers could provide additional power at minimal expense. With Japanese expertise, we might harness these mighty rivers to power more homes and industry."

 FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods: "Japanese Coal Gasification Methods"
 FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc: "Japan's quest for crucial oil lead it to Manchuria, but now with disappointing results from prospecting, coal gasification seems the only logical path forward. Though energy intensive, Fushun's enormous coal deposits could make the complex processes worthwhile."

 FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities: "Manchurian Model Cities"
 FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities_desc: "Japan sometimes goes to surprising lengths to portray its role in Fengtian as one of benevolent paternalism, to which end Mantetsu plans to install state of the art electrical, sewer, and tram systems in the major cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin."

#Industrial Development Committee Section
 FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC: "Found the Northeast IDC"
 FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC_desc: "At Japanese recommendation, a proposal has been put forth to organise several influential businessmen and politicians into a body called the 'Northeastern Industrial Development Commission' that might guide Fengtian's industrial development."

 FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines: "Expand the Anshan Mines"
 FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines_desc: "The enormous iron deposits in Anshan have been described as being of 'world class significance', and churn out nearly 7 million tonnes of iron, with the potential to triple output by 1942. This expansion seems likely to propel Anshan toward becoming one of East Asia's largest industrial centres."

 FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone: "Establish the Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
 FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone_desc: "Jinzhou's docks and strategic position in the 'Liaoxi Corridor', which connects land transportation between North and Northeast China, make it a prime target for government incentivised development. It remains to be seen whether special rules will be applied to this zone favouring Chinese or Japanese companies."

 FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines: "Expand the Fushun Mines"
 FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines_desc: "The mines around Fushun churn out nearly 11 million tons of coal per year, with deposits promising to produce over 4.5 billion tonnes total. While some modern trains and ships in the West use oil, the Japanese Empire runs on coal, and the strategic significance of these mines cannot be understated."

 FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development: "Yingkou Commercial Development"
 FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc: "The port city of Yingkou serves as Fengtian's primary gateway to the world, and the second largest port on the Bohai Gulf after Japanese-controlled [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The tremendous increase in material production in Fengtian demands an equally large investment in commercial infrastructure."

#Develop the Nine Provinces Section
 FNG_Develop_the_Three_Northeast_Provinces: "Develop the Three Northeast Provinces"
 FNG_Develop_the_Three_Northeast_Provinces_desc: "The Three Northeast Provinces, Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, already contain over 30% of China's railroads and much of its heavy industry. However, if the National Reclamation War is to be won, both will have to be expanded upon and improved. Ideally this would be achieved solely by the Chinese people, but reality dictates that the Japanese will lead much of the path forward."

 FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy: "Wang Yongjiang's Legacy"
 FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy_desc: "Manchuria's transformation from a backward borderland into one of China's most prosperous regions owes itself to the work of Wang Yongjiang, Zhang Zuolin's late Finance Minister. Disgusted by the Grand Marshal's costly excursions south of the Great Wall in 1928, Wang resigned and died shortly thereafter, his work left unfinished. We must pick up where he left off."

 FNG_Reorganise_the_NTC: "Reorganise the NTC"
 FNG_Reorganise_the_NTC_desc: "Founded by the Fengtian Government shortly after its creation, the National Transportation Commission serves as a planning board for infrastructure construction across the country. The Japanese allege that its foremost aim is to disrupt Mantetsu's operations, and there may be at least some truth to this claim."

 FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies: "Support Sino-Japanese Joint Companies"
 FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc: "A great number of businesses in Fengtian offer shares to both Chinese and Japanese, including the infamous Mantetsu, but relatively few Chinese have the funds to invest and as a result most joint companies are Japanese dominated. Government backing may permit us to provide means and incentives to fellow Chinese and gradually shift this balance."

### Beijing Tree ###

 FNG_From_Beijing_to_the_Begonia_Leaf: "From Beijing to the Begonia Leaf"
 FNG_From_Beijing_to_the_Begonia_Leaf_desc: "For decades, students and nationalists have compared the shape of China, that is to say China undivided, to the shape of a Begonia leaf. With Beijing in our hands, it has come time to reclaim all of our homeland, and make the Begonia Leaf a reality!"

 FNG_Suppress_the_Bandits_Collect_the_Harvest: "Suppress the Bandits; Collect the Harvest"
 FNG_Suppress_the_Bandits_Collect_the_Harvest_desc: "The last time soldiers of the Fengtian Army entered the North China Plain, some units were encouraged to suppress banditry and assist in collection the seasonal harvest in return for lodgings and food. Where such amenities were normally simply seized, these tactics seem to have ameliorated local unrest and partisan activity. All commanders would do well to follow this example."

 FNG_Continue_the_Reclamation_War: "Continue the Reclamation War"
 FNG_Continue_the_Reclamation_War_desc: "The war of National Reclamation did not end with the capture of Beijing. One by one, each of China's provinces must be brought to heel, and the country once again unified."

 FNG_Integrate_Occupied_Arsenals: "Integrate Occupied Arsenals"
 FNG_Integrate_Occupied_Arsenals_desc: "The Shenyang Arsenal is unquestionably the greatest in China, but by integrating and specialising newly seized arsenals, now as part of a national supply system, we may be able to ease the burden on Shenyang and improve our overall logistical capability."

 FNG_Crush_Flies_and_Capture_Pigs: "Crush Flies and Capture Pigs"
 FNG_Crush_Flies_and_Capture_Pigs_desc: "Corruption and abuse of power have run rampant throughout China over the past several decades, and all levels of the Fengtian Government are complicit in this activity. In order to regain the public's trust, some measure of law and order must be restored, and examples will be made of both low-level “Flies” and high-level “Pigs”, who have been greedily gorging themselves on the nation's livelihood."

 FNG_Expand_the_Baojia_System: "Expand the Baojia System"
 FNG_Expand_the_Baojia_System_desc: "The Baojia System is an ancient method of social organisation and military recruitment. Zhang Zuolin revived the practice several decades ago in the Northeast, and to great effect, but now the time has come to once again expand the system to the rest of China, where it has by and large fallen by the wayside."

 FNG_Incorporate_Local_Patronage_Networks: "Incorporate Local Patronage Networks"
 FNG_Incorporate_Local_Patronage_Networks_desc: "There is more to every institution than meets the eye, and every good warlord builds his stronghold through a network of reciprocal partnerships negotiated behind closed doors. With the collapse of enemy authority, there are many such individuals and institutions without a clear place in the new order. There is every reason to begin incorporating these individuals into our own networks, where possible."

 FNG_Centralize_Provincial_Revenues: "Centralise Provincial Revenues"
 FNG_Centralize_Provincial_Revenues_desc: "Perhaps the greatest source of disunity in China has been the decentralisation of the tax system, begun with the introduction of provincial “Lijin” transit tariffs in 1853. The new Central Government must limit provincial taxation, and reduce the percentage local authorities may keep for themselves. Otherwise, local governments will continue to deny the nation revenue."

 FNG_Institute_Labour_Discipline: "Institute Labour Discipline"
 FNG_Institute_Labour_Discipline_desc: "The industrial policy of our nation is being threatened by the increasingly divergent interests of industrialists, union leaders and workers. Unions serve only to divide, and creating distrust, forcing the leaders of our country to compromise. Only through an intervention that solidifies the discipline and loyalty of labour organisations, can the unity be forged that will allow us to move our country forward."

 FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best: "The Generals Know Best"
 FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best_desc: "There is no doubt that a centralised army can serve as the foundation to a centralised state, but China's great size requires a different approach. For this reason, we will continue to appoint military governors. To better balance this arrangement, provincial armies must recruit the majority of troops from outside their own provinces, and limit their production and deployment of heavy weapons."

 FNG_One_Army_One_Republic: "One Army One Republic"
 FNG_One_Army_One_Republic_desc: "If we are to learn a single lesson from over two thousand years of Chinese history, it is that when military force is divided, so too is the country. In order to build a unified China we must create a single army, beneath a single banner, at the direction of a single command structure. This measure will not be popular at any level of government outside the Cabinet."

 FNG_Secure_the_Rear_Area: "Secure the Rear Areas"
 FNG_Secure_the_Rear_Area_desc: "The North China Plain has been seized, but it has not been pacified. For now, the Army controls only the railways and their immediate proximity, with bandits and partisans running wild beyond. China is a big country, and the rear areas must be thoroughly scoured in order to ensure an uncompromised advance toward the goal of national reunification."

 FNG_against_imperialism_of_all_forms: "Against Imperialism of All Forms"
 FNG_against_imperialism_of_all_forms_desc: "Japan poses itself as a friend, an able ally, perhaps even an equal. But the Chinese know better; their designs on the nation, their aspirations for Asia as a whole, their deriding attitude towards detachment from their Chinese \"allies\". They merely practice imperialism in a far more clever form, but they will have to be far more cunning if they are to outsmart the Old Marshal."

 FNG_faith_in_the_anguojun: "Faith in the Anguojun"
 FNG_faith_in_the_anguojun_desc: "Only the National Pacification Army, the military arm of the Fengtian-led rival government, can guarantee the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution and the Five Races Under One Union. Sullied by the likes of provincial warlords, Federalists, Third-Way Democrats, and Revolutionaries, the Chinese Revolution has been terribly distorted, turned into a feral cancer that must be pacified. And it is only our officers that are capable of such."

 FNG_ensuring_efficient_procurement_desc: "Keen to fatten themselves and guarantee their own futures, the various petty warlords and minor bandits have found themselves seizing \"rightful\" arms shipments aimed at Central Government units. Similarly, war and destruction have wrought much damage on China's local arsenals, and their once starry manufacturing has seen a plummet as of recent. Logistics and supplies win wars, and thus proper attention and care must be given."

 FNG_revitalise_the_bank_of_communications: "Revitalise the Bank of Communications"
 FNG_revitalise_the_bank_of_communications_desc: "The Bank of Communications once held the very stability of Chinese government cabinets in its palms, for it facilitiated foreign investments, crucially to back the governments of Yuan Shikai, and later that of Duan Qirui. Yet with the Nishiwara Loan and the outcry of the Paris Peace Conference, it has been far diminished. It is only natural that its clerk's capabilities once more be exhibited in a primary role."

 FNG_renewing_trust_in_industry: "Renewing Trust in Industry"
 FNG_renewing_trust_in_industry_desc: "With a nigh-unending Warlord Era, bar a brief interregnum of Zhili Unification, the stability and faith within the Chinese nation-state's industrial capacity is particularly lacklustre, at least as far as foreign firms are concerned. With an explosion of Anti-Concessionism off the cusp of the Shanghai Uprising and other events, it will take a concerted government effort to restore faith in our factories."

 FNG_the_marshal_and_the_emperor_desc: "Hand-in-hand, the Son of Heaven and the Old Marshal of Dongbei have marched forward onto a new era of prosperity for Asia. It would be amiss to end things prematurely. Whatever Fengtian needs, it receives from Japan, and whilst many in the government warn the Marshal of traps, intrigues, and plots linked to the Japanese, it takes more than a simple spy to kill the Tiger of the North."

 FNG_following_the_kingly_way_desc: "The Kingly Way, that Confucian method of governance to ensure morality and benevolence, whilst traditionally applied to the Emperor in respect to his court, finds much a similar place within the Marshal's Palace. Make no mistake, there shall be no monarchs in the new China, but the Old Marshal, the Father of the Nation, it is his portrait on Tiananmen Square, and it is to his example of which the Chinese must emulate."

 FNG_militarise_the_student_body_desc: "In this period of great strife and terrible bloodshed, it is the youth whom suffer most. Deprived of the most basic building blocks of their future, the education system, they can all but languish as the nation grows increasingly wounded. But it is the same youth that hold the nation's future in their palms, and it is their duty to fight for China, and for national liberation."

 FNG_dictatorship_of_the_transport_ministry_desc: "Railways bring prosperity! Or well, they should have. Yet most railways within China are built by Western companies, or at the very least funded by them. In a practical sense, they have always been a symbol of simultaneous progress, yet abounding imperialism. Through decisive action, men such as Chang Yinhuai will reclaim the railways from the imperialist, and return them to the Central Government's fold."

 FNG_harmonising_the_social_classes_desc: "The masses are a powerful force, capable of a political whirlwind few associations can withstand; Anhui realised this, perhaps only in hindsight. But one can curry favour with the masses, without becoming beholden to them.

 FNG_clear_cut_political_economics: "Clear-Cut Political Economics"
 FNG_clear_cut_political_economics_desc: "This is not a game of cards, the life of all Chinese are at stake, and the Central Government cannot be entrusted to transform its most humble villages and hamlets into modern cities if its rulers are merely politicians.

 FNG_alliance_of_state_and_business_desc: "The true keys to China's recovery after decades of disunity and disruption is that of capital, and it is only through the men of capital, and their assets, that the government can produce the necessary means to connect China at its fraying seams. By engaging in government contracts with various major companies, they make rake in the benefits, whilst the government can direct their resources to proper usage."

 FNG_government_as_a_machine_desc: "There can be no time for debate or pettyness in statecraft; ideology, intellectualism, and idealism, they merely serve to dissuade advancing efforts of the government to perform its duties at maximum efficiency.

 FNG_the_president_of_providence_desc: "A man of duty, of perseverance, of servitude and of loyalty, Yang Yuting has long been denied his destiny. And it is most blatantly out of fear for his capabilities. Having fought for most of the Warlord Era, he would only find himself deprived of positions due to the meddling of men like Xueliang. But now they pose no threat to the Man of Providence, and his revitalised Republic."

Whilst unable to truly associate with them in the Northeast, in-part due to their anti-Fengtian oppositional stance, and Feng Yong's alignment with Xueliang, now that they are face-to-face, Yang must but only open his arms to his new set of skilled scholars."

Yang Yuting however, far more capable as a soldier, orator, and politician, has managed to win genuine favour from Tokyo. No longer are they master and subject, but true equals, and together, undefeatable."

Be it graduates of Japanese academies, those of the Concordia Association, the Communications Clique, those of the Zhang Clique with Japanese sympathies, or even the Japanese themselves. This new government heavily emulates that of Tokyo, for better and for worse."

 FNG_freedom_of_the_five_races: "Freedom of the Five Races"
 FNG_freedom_of_the_five_races_desc: "China is a nation of many nationalities: Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui. And even such a delineation is hardly thorough and all-encompassing. By uniting the various nationalities of China through the guiding concepts of the Kingly Way, the state can bind national harmony to the very concept of citizenship and statehood; a nation of morality, and etiquette, not revolution."

 FNG_the_chinese_shogunate: "The Chinese Shogunate"
 FNG_the_chinese_shogunate_desc: "Simply put, the Qing refused to modernise due to their own arrogance and perception of celestial rights; despite numerous overtures from various states that offered immensely beneficial deals, the court would always run to obstruct modernisation. But the men of China today are far more pragmatic; if we can learn everything from Japan, we will inevitably become stronger than them."

 FNG_in_the_spirit_of_1912_desc: "Perhaps out of folly, idealism, or a faint desire for a more utopian world, the North and South have once again attempted a mutually beneficial deal of national unification. Much maligned and considered a falsehood, their efforts mirror that of 1912, running off the cusp of Xinhai. Retaining the various Southern Federal Governors, alongside the appointment of Zhang Junmai as Prime Minister, perhaps it will go smoother than last time."

 FNG_reconstruction_through_autonomy: "Reconstruction Through Autonomy"
 FNG_reconstruction_through_autonomy_desc: "One of the many promises made to the Federalist movement was that of the creation of democratically elected provincial assemblies, organised according to their locally drafted provincial constitutions. Whilst the latter requires Central Government authority to promulgate, the various delegation of powers has enabled swift and steady national reconstruction, if disparate."

Together they have become known as \"Twin Dragons Taming the Water\", though some question whether this harmony can last forever."

 FNG_disavow_tokyo: "Disavow Tokyo"
 FNG_disavow_tokyo_desc: "Japan has proven itself useful, even perhaps, benevolent and beneficial in its long-term relationship with the many ministers of the incumbent Central Government. Yet it proves itself incapable of disguising its hunger, or of its innate desire for \"kickbacks\", \"concessions\", or even that of territory. Truly they have not learnt from the past couple decades, and thus, the time has come to move away from Tokyo, and towards self-reliance."

 FNG_The_Ultimatum: "The Ultimatum"

 FNG_Promote_Young_Officers: "Promote Young Officers"
 FNG_Promote_Young_Officers_desc: "Despite years of reform, our officer corps still suffers from a chronic lack of modern thinking with a significant portion of the officer corps being made up of older sub-par officers. While both the Shikan Clique and Shaoshuai Clique have different candidates for promotion, they nevertheless both advocate for the promotion of young, talented officers. Let us heed their advice to eleviate our current leadership problems."

 FNG_Modernized_Curriculum: "Modernised Curriculum"
 FNG_Modernized_Curriculum_desc: "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors and tenacity of the will, stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack; enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying numerically and technologically superior forces."

 FNG_Improve_Logistics: "Improve our Logistics"
 FNG_Improve_Logistics_desc: "Our logistics network has always been one of the best in China. Since the First Zhili-Anhui war our logistics system has been able to funnel supplies and reinforcements quickly and efficiently to the frontline, allowing us to effectively utilise our large industrial and manpower base to our advantage. Let us once again utilise this advantage against our enemies!"

 FNG_Modernise_Infantry_Tactics: "Modernise Infantry Tactics"
 FNG_Modernise_Infantry_Tactics_desc: "During the last few conflicts we have been involved in, our infantry have been found lacking in multiple aspects. Our machine gunners were operating off outdated tactics, often with unskilled gunners. Our infantry often found themselves unsupported by artillery and other support weapons. If we hope to emerge victorious in our upcoming struggle to unite China, we must modernise our infantry tactics and fix any remaining issues we may have."

 FNG_Artillery_Reform: "Utilise our Strengths"
 FNG_Artillery_Reform_desc: "Over the last two decades our artillery force was one of the bright spots within our often lacklustre army, with their effective and often accurate fire helping us emerge victorious in many battles.

Comprised mainly of young forward thinking officers, they emphasise the need for a well disciplined core of NCOs and infantrymen. Therefore, we must entrust our army reform to these young officers and their old guard allies so that we can prepare ourselves for the inevitable confrontation with our enemies in the south while also staving Japanese influence in our army."

 FNG_Train_New_Field_Officers: "Train New Field Officers"
 FNG_Train_New_Field_Officers_desc: "Historically, the Fengtian Army had found itself lacking skilled junior officers capable of maintaining cohesion at the front lines.

 FNG_Promote_New_Non-Commissioned_Officers: "Promote New NCOs"
 FNG_Promote_New_Non-Commissioned_Officers_desc: "Drawing from teachings at the Baoding military academy and the influence of Guo Songling, the Shaoshuai Clique emphasises the need for a capable corps of NCOs to maintain the cohesion and discipline of our troops at the front lines. By promoting promising soldiers into these positions, our armies can hope to defeat the enemy through superior discipline and organisation instead of solely relying on our superior equipment as we have done historically."

 FNG_Model_Soldiers: "Model Soldiers"
 FNG_Model_Soldiers_desc: "While our army has come a long way since our defeat in 1922, our significant portion of our forces are still comprised of unmotivated and poorly trained troops.

However, his ideas have proved to be quite effective in the years following his death and has lead our army to many victories. Perhaps by adopting and refining his ideas, as well as returning his followers to more influential positions, we can greatly increase our army's strength."

 FNG_Modernise_The_Cavalry: "Modernise the Cavalry"
 FNG_Modernise_The_Cavalry_desc: "Historically, our cavalry force has performed exceptionally well in the North China Plain against our adversaries. During the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, our cavalry proved to be a vital part of our victor in Rehe. We must ensure our cavalry force is up to modern standards if we hope to replicate our previous successes. Furthermore, General Ma Zhanshan has suggested that our cavalry may also prove useful in the event our enemies occupy our lands..."

 FNG_Shikan_Clique_Chosen_desc: "The Shikan Clique, lead by Yang Yuting, are a group of officers educated at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko in Japan. Yang's goals of creating a centralised command structure, precision artillery strikes and modern officer corps have served us well in the past, especially on the Rehe front during the Second Zhili-Fengtian War. Perhaps Yang Yuting's ideas can once again transform the Fengtian army into one of the greatest armies in China."

 FNG_Study_Japanese_Infantry_Tactics: "Study Japanese Infantry Tactics"
 FNG_Study_Japanese_Infantry_Tactics_desc: "During the very limited Japanese interventions by the Imperial Japanese Military in our conflicts, their tactics have proved to be extremely effective.

Learning from these Japanese strategies may prove extremely useful for our army's combat effectiveness."

 FNG_New_Generation_Of_Chinese_Officers: "A New Generation of Chinese Officers"
 FNG_New_Generation_Of_Chinese_Officers_desc: "If we are to produce one of the premier fighting forces in China, our officers must match the standards of our new army.

 FNG_Modern_General_Staff: "A Modern General Staff"
 FNG_Modern_General_Staff_desc: "Much of the Imperial Japanese Army's success can be traced back to their general staff. Therefore, to replicate their successes we must create a modern general staff of our own, allowing us to create battle plans for any confrontation with our enemies long before we come to blows. Consequently, this would give us an advantage over our enemies and would prove extremely useful in our battles against our southern adversaries."

 FNG_Methodical_Approach_To_War: "A Methodical Approach to War"
 FNG_Methodical_Approach_To_War_desc: "After observing the past three decades of almost constant fighting, only one conclusion can be drawn. Even in China, where armies hundreds of thousands strong regularly clash with one another, fanaticism and numbers will not win battles.

 FNG_Diversify_Armament_Production_desc: "The Shenyang Arsenal has always been a massive but totally centralised operation, with one single plant and sub-factories in the Shenyang area accounting for the entirety of the Northeast's armament production.

 FNG_Re-Forming_the_Marine_Corps: "Re-Forming the Marine Corps"
 FNG_Re-Forming_the_Marine_Corps_desc: "A marine corps was created in 1914, called the 'Republic of China Marine Corps,' but this attempt went nowhere. We will revive the China Marine Corps along modern lines, enabling us to better operate in riverine environments like the Huang He and Yangtze. Given the right opportunity, we may even be able to cross the Bohai Sea, and make Wu Peifu's old strategy our own."

 FNG_Commission_Japanese_Ships: "Commission Japanese Ships"
 FNG_Commission_Japanese_Ships_desc: "There can be no doubt that our own ship-building capabilities pale compared to those of the Imperial Japanese Navy. They will never give us the ships necessary to build a truly modern fleet, but they might sell us enough to make a difference against other Chinese, and any other future threats."

#Air Force Branch
 FNG_Request_Air_Shipment: "Request Japanese Airframes"
 FNG_Request_Air_Shipment_desc: "While we have a strong air force in comparison to most warlords, our air force still lacks behind the [QIE.GetName] air force in size and modernity, as they are supplied with modern German aircraft. We will need to leverage our relationship to Japan in order to be able to have a chance against them."

 FNG_The_China_Flying_Corps: "Restructure the China Flying Corps"
 FNG_The_China_Flying_Corps_desc: "Originally organised by the Grand Marshal's son, Zhang Xueliang, the Corps performed well in the last war, losing air superiority only upon the arrival of more modern German-piloted planes. Since then it's expanded, but retains aircraft decades behind Western standards."

 FNG_Order_New_Aircraft: "Request Aircraft Blueprints"
 FNG_Order_New_Aircraft_desc: "True aircraft design requires well educated and extremely specialised engineers, which we sadly don't have access to. As a result, in order to improve our air force, we must order more from Japan."
 FNG_Reverse_Engineering_Efforts: "Reverse Engineering Efforts"

 FNG_Reverse_Engineering_Efforts_desc: "With some Japanese planes in our possession, it seems possible that we might reverse engineer them for our own use, though the success of such efforts cannot be guaranteed."

 FNG_Shoutai_Tactics: "Shoutai Tactics"
 FNG_Shoutai_Tactics_desc: "Enormous advances in aircraft design in recent years have produced planes that fly completely differently than their predecessors, requiring reevaluations of flight manoeuvring and tactics. The Japanese have reorganised their Air Squadrons into three-plane 'Shoutai' units which are designed around the flexibility necessary for dogfighting. These could give us an important edge."

 FNG_Expand_the_Shenyang_Aerodrome: "Expand the Shenyang Aerodrome"
 FNG_Expand_the_Shenyang_Aerodrome_desc: "One of China's first military aviation centres, the Shenyang Aerodrome requires expansion in-line with our increasing air power."

 FNG_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Once the greatest of the Beiyang warlords and master of Northern China, the Fengtian Clique found itself reduced to its base in the Northeast by a resurgent Zhili Clique and was left sole heir to the Xinhai Revolution following the Qing Restoration.\n\nBalancing internal factions with ever-growing Japanese influence, Marshal Zhang rebuilds his army for one final struggle against his Zhili rivals. Will the Old Marshal successfully march into the Central Plains and carry out unification, or will his benefactors in Tokyo crush the Chinese dream underfoot?"

### Intro Screen ###
 FNG_country_intro_background: "GFX_FNG_intro"
 FNG_country_intro_header: "The Bastion in the North"
 FNG_country_intro_content: "As the year 1936 dawns, Fengtian stands in the Northeast as the final bastion of China's Republican dream. As with many things in China however, the abstractions of this dream hide complex and often inconvenient truths. The Fengtian Government of the Republic of China, contesting [QIE.GetNameDef]'s claims to legitimacy, maintains democracy only as a thin veneer, covering what has always been, and perhaps always will be, an authoritarian state.\n\nThe Assembly in Shenyang is widely regarded to be corrupt, power divided between autocratic generals, unscrupulous railway barons, and Pan-Asianist ideologues with questionable motivations. Amid it all stands Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, his ambitions great, but limited by the stark realities of [QIE.GetAdjective] strength and Japanese power; for now forced to walk a political tightrope between the two, and above the machinations of his own divided government. The status quo cannot last forever, and if the right moment to strike south is not chosen soon, it may never come at all.\n\nThe staggering cost of the wars with the south and the severance of economic ties left Fengtian reeling, and while past years have been spent rebuilding, there is much left to do. Likewise, the army has suffered from neglect, and must be reorganised. The Japanese, their influence growing by the day, present both a dire threat and an opportunity. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of all China.\n\nBriefings are available on Fengtian's special mechanics, its relationship with the Japanese, and internal politics."

 FNG_country_intro_header_1: "Special Mechanics Briefing"
 FNG_country_intro_content_1: "The Fengtian Government is unstable, pressured from without and within, ultimately a fusion of elements that would be contradictory were it not for their shared goals. The parties, more accurately termed factions, exercise their grip through dominance of the country's institutions instead of mass appeal. As such, the 'popularity' of parties should be taken to represent their degree of control over the country's government and other structures of power, control being determined not by the popular policies of ministers, but by choices, focuses, and events that increase or diminish their power.\n\nConsequently, your aim should be to balance the various factions, each of which has the potential to abuse their power if given too much of it, though each will do so differently. Each political advisor is part of one of the four factions. Each advisor hired, in addition to their trait, will improve the Divided Governance national spirit while also boosting the influence of their respective faction. As such, advisors should be picked wisely to avoid the negative consequences of an imbalance of power later down the line.\n\nAnother crucial point is the role of our benefactors in Tokyo, whose influence grows and wanes in the Fengtian Clique depending on our reliance on their aid. As their influence grows, it will lead to increasing bonuses to production, but at the cost of political power and autonomy. The rise of this influence is inevitable over time, and should be viewed with caution."

 FNG_country_intro_header_2: "Japanese Briefing"
 FNG_country_intro_content_2: "The Japanese exercise their power in Fengtian through a series of treaties permitting them not only extraterritoriality, but also the right to live and work in Fengtian more or less as if they were its citizens. While the Grand Marshal and others utilise a wide variety of means to slow and inconvenience the Japanese, their presence is necessary and the growth of their influence inevitable. The primary institution responsible for this growth is the South Manchuria Railway Company, more commonly termed 'Mantetsu', the profits from which in recent years have accounted for nearly a quarter of Japan's entire national budget.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese need Fengtian and what it represents. Its cooperation and the prospect of a victory in the South offer to save Japan a great deal of time and money. The result is a tenuous balance, the Japanese ever looking for more profit and power, but well aware that pushing too hard will place Zhang Zuolin in a politically untenable position, and thus bring their careful efforts to naught.\n\nSo far Zhang has pursued a patchwork policy; promotion of Pan-Asian brotherhood with Japan, only to intermittently replace this with repudiations of Japanese initiatives that push too far, and consistent private efforts to lessen Japanese influence. How to proceed will be your choice, but caution is advised."

 FNG_country_intro_header_3: "Politics Briefing"
 FNG_country_intro_content_3: "Fengtian has four primary political factions:\n\n1. The Recovery League\n\nA loose association of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians without any strong ideological affiliation, most of whom find themselves in Fengtian because there are few other places where they might hold any semblance of power. Easily bribed and tempted, they often serve to promote the interests of whoever is willing to pay, and consequently the 'league' is highly splintered despite controlling a large portion of the Assembly, lacking the political will to act decisively.\n\n2. The Zhang Clique\n\nA collection of loyalists and generals, the Zhang Clique holds no specific ideology beyond promoting the furtherance of the Grand Marshal's political powers. While making pretences to democracy, Zhang's supporters are not committed to republican ideals, and promote them only for their utility.\n\n3. The Communications Clique\n\nThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique are a collection of railroad and telegraph barons, primarily self-interested, but locked in confrontation with Mantetsu and the Concordia Association over the country's infrastructure.\n\n4. The Concordia Association\n\nA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly. Their actual ideological positions vary, some using the Japanese to counter Zhang's power for their own gain, with others subscribing to Pan-Asian principles."

### New Fengtian Events ###
 fengtian_events.1.t: "Rumours Incite Regionalist Uproar"
 fengtian_events.1.d: "Although no plans have been made public, or even exist in anything approaching a final form, rumours have already begun to spread that the Fengtian Army is preparing to march south and conquer Beijing within the next month. The scattered news coming in from the south has inspired a potent mix of excitement and concern, and confrontations have already broken out in tea rooms, bars, and other public places between ardent nationalists and regionalist 'Dongbei Party' members.\n\nThe 'Dongbei Party' is not a political party in any real sense, and more a nickname applied by detractors to any espousing doubts about Zhang Zuolin's mission to reunite the country. A significant number of local officials and bureaucrats, including school teachers, share this kind of scepticism and have begun organising protests criticising what they view as a costly and unnecessary war.\n\nNaturally, the government will not refute the rumours, as that might free up Beijing's hand to intervene in the League Crisis."
 fengtian_events.1.a: "Rumours can be dangerous..."

 fengtian_events.3.t: "Regionalists Take Action"
 fengtian_events.3.d1: "Shouting 'Donbgei weile Dongbeiren' or 'The Northeast for Northeastern People', protestors have gathered near the Grand Marshal's palace, in Harbin's Sophia Square, and outside Jilin's Medical College demanding an end to war preparations. Their numbers are not great enough to present serious problems, and police have already been dispatched to maintain order, but this is only part of an ongoing campaign which threatens to undermine public confidence in the regime. If the whole of the Northeast cannot be united behind the Grand Marshal's dream to reunite all of China, then how can it ever be realised?"
 fengtian_events.3.d2: "Protestors gathered again in several prominent locations in Northeastern cities. Their numbers were not great enough to present serious problems, but that did not stop police from cracking down hard, wading into the masses with clubs and rifle butts, and scattering fleeing protestors into crowded side streets. Angered by the violence, some 'Dongbei Party' members have already vowed to return in even greater numbers, but it is hoped that this quick and decisive response will deter all but the movement's hard-liners, making them all the easier to round-up and silence.\n\nMore concerning is talk among members of local trade associations, chambers of commerce, and town assemblies of a tax boycott. Unlike some of the young students, these older men remember the hard times late last decade when war expenditures outgrew the Northeastern economy and sent it into economic freefall."
 fengtian_events.3.d3: "Despite efforts by the police regionalist protests have continued sporadically across the Northeast, and have been given further weight by support from local chambers of commerce, currency exchanges, and other business institutions concerned about the economic costs of a war to the south. While this currently appears to be posturing, there is no telling whether these groups will undermine the war-effort when the decisive moment comes, and while the public protests have yet to turn violent it may be only a matter of time. The sooner this problem is addressed the better."
 fengtian_events.3.d4: "News of continued conflicts to the south have given the regionalist movement renewed momentum. Attempts at suppression have been continually hampered by the unwillingness of some sympathetic bureaucrats, police chiefs, and other officials to carry out their duties in full. Undoubtedly a complete effort will need to be made to root out these frustrating elements and restore order. As the public discontent continues the legitimacy and strength of our government is gradually sapped away."
 fengtian_events.3.a: "Unfortunate."

 fengtian_events.4.t: "Agent Provocateurs in Action"
 fengtian_events.4.d: "Just as planned, our well-placed agents have successfully pushed some in the regionalist movement toward violence. Already increasingly violent protests have caused damage to public property, and reactions have been negative. It may only be a matter of time before we have the justification we need."
 fengtian_events.4.a: "Excellent."

 fengtian_events.5.t: "The Harbin Riots"
 fengtian_events.5.d: "A protest rapidly escalated into an all-out riot last night, as protestors clashed with police in downtown Harbin. There have been fifteen recorded deaths, with unknown numbers of wounded on both sides, numbers possibly stretching into the low hundreds. Of particular concern is the Harbin Central Station which saw its front windows shattered, and its roof in flames. Damage to the station and several pieces of rolling stock have delayed travel along connecting rail lines, and the bureaucrats at Mantetsu have already registered their outrage.\n\nCleaning up this mess may take some time, but at least we now have a clear justification for action against the regionalist movement."
 fengtian_events.5.a: "Good... and bad."

 fengtian_events.6.t: "Mass Arrests Begin"
 fengtian_events.6.d: "With the appropriate justification now in place, our dutiful police officers, with support from local militia and the Fengtian Army, have begun rounding up suspected protestors. The majority will eventually be sent home, but not necessarily in one piece. Hopefully, their imprisonment will serve as a message to the other protestors, and any sympathisers, that the government will no longer tolerate their subversion."
 fengtian_events.6.a: "Good riddance."

 fengtian_events.7.t: "An Offer from the Kempeitai"
 fengtian_events.7.d: "The Kempeitai, the Japanese Army's extrajudicial police force, have taken note of our regionalist problem and come forward with a partial solution. With a wide network of informants, they claim to have information on a number of figures underpinning the regionalist movement - information they have volunteered. In response, we must provide intelligence on several anti-Japanese agitators and insurgents who have so far slipped through their fingers; not in the least due to our own interference. So far it has been convenient for us to keep in contact with these nationalists, pending cases where we need to push back against Japanese influence.\n\nIs this one of those cases? Or should we take the deal and offer these people up on a silver platter?"
 fengtian_events.7.a: "Take the deal."
 fengtian_events.7.b: "No thank you."

 fengtian_events.8.t: "Regionalist Movement Suppressed"
 fengtian_events.8.d: "The 'Dongbei Party', and the regionalist movement in general, have been suppressed at last. While this is not an end to regionalist sentiment in the Northeast, it may last for decades to come, but for now it has ceased to be a consideration as we turn our attention southward."
 fengtian_events.8.a: "Progress."

#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling
 fengtian_events.9.t: "Picking up the Educational Slack"
 fengtian_events.9.d: "Our targeted removal of regionalist 'Dongbei Party' school teachers and other intellectuals has predictably led to educational chaos and major research interruptions, but staffers at the Japanese Consulate have come forward with a possible solution. Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At our behest, the Japanese government might pressure Mantetsu to open these to the public and provide staff to fill temporary shortages.\n\nOnce we open the door to this kind of activity it will be very difficult to close, and these schools will almost certainly be used to spread Japanese culture and norms. We should consider carefully."
 fengtian_events.9.a: "Decline the offer."
 fengtian_events.9.b: "Accept the offer."

 fengtian_events.10.t: "The Kimono Scandal"
 fengtian_events.10.d: "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutō Kokuritsudaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged.\n\nThere is little question, however, that our enemies will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
 fengtian_events.10.a: "What an embarrassment!"
 fengtian_events.10.b: "Close the Mantetsu schools!"

 fengtian_events.11.t: "Students Join the Youth League"
 fengtian_events.11.d: "In an embarrassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many and invited outright enmity toward the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."
 fengtian_events.11.a: "This is an outrage!"
 fengtian_events.11.b: "Close the schools!"

 fengtian_events.12.t: "Chinese Uniforms for Chinese Students"
 fengtian_events.12.d: "After the demoralising effects of our harsh but necessary crack-down on 'Dongbei Party' teachers, our Education Ministry has come forward with a new national school uniform. While this may seem like a small change, the uniforms are a symbol of Chinese independence and national identity stretching beyond any particular region. Surely a bright new future awaits our students as part of a united China!"
 fengtian_events.12.a: "A point of pride!"

#NTC Infrastructure and Railway Construction
 fengtian_events.13.t: "Developing Infrastructure in Liaoning"
 fengtian_events.13.d: "Northeast China's infrastructure is often considered superior to what can be found across the rest of the country, but even so it rarely meets western standards. For all their modernity, Mantetsu's railways fail to fully cover a region the size of France and Germany combined. Smaller provincial rail lines, as well as a network of criss-crossing motorways, have been built over past decades in an attempt to solve this problem, but they are few and far between - not to mention often poorly maintained. If we are to stimulate economic development, and better support our armies in the field, we must further develop these networks and ensure their maintenance. Liaoning, the heart of our operations, is as good a place to start as any, and a collection of smaller Chinese companies are already eager to begin work.\n\nThese companies, in the absence of Mantetsu and Japanese engineers, will do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."

If we are to stimulate economic development, and better support our armies in the field, we must further develop these networks and ensure their maintenance. Liaoning, the heart of our operations, is as good a place to start as any, and already both Mantetsu and a collection of smaller Chinese companies are vying for the open contract.\n\nThe Japanese claim, and perhaps correctly, that they could have the work complete in half the time due to their resources and expertise, but choosing a Chinese company would do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
 fengtian_events.13.a: "Choose a Chinese Company."
 fengtian_events.13.b: "Choose Mantetsu."

 fengtian_events.14.t: "Infrastructure Development in Liaoning Complete"
 fengtian_events.14.d: "After months of construction and various unfortunate delays, the planned infrastructure developments in Liaoning ares finally complete. After reviewing plans and available resources, the NTC will undoubtedly make another contract available soon."
 fengtian_events.14.a: "Great news!"

 fengtian_events.15.t: "Developing Infrastructure in Liaobei and Jilin"
 fengtian_events.15.d: "In contrast to Liaoning, existing local infrastructure in Liaobei and Jilin is somewhat sparse, particularly in the foothills of the Greater Khingan and Changbai ranges. The NTC has drafted an elaborate Japanese-inspired plan intended to link the central hubs of Jilin City and Changchun to otherwise isolated communities, with road extending outward almost like spokes on a wheel. The plan is so extensive that much of it is beyond our ability to complete in a reasonable time-frame, and such we will be completing only its initial stages for now."
 fengtian_events.15.d_jap: "In contrast to Liaoning, existing local infrastructure in Liaobei and Jilin is somewhat sparse, particularly in the foothills of the Greater Khingan and Changbai ranges. The NTC has drafted an elaborate Japanese-inspired plan intended to link the central hubs of Jilin City and Changchun to otherwise isolated communities, with road extending outward almost like spokes on a wheel. The plan is so extensive that much of it is beyond our ability to complete in a reasonable time-frame. Some have suggested this represents a cunning plan by the Japanese to engender greater reliance, as Mantetsu could likely complete such a sprawling project where our own Chinese companies would fall short. Nonetheless, we've decided to split work into stages, with only the initial development planned for now.\n\nAs in the past, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction work in a very timely manner, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."
 fengtian_events.15.a: "Choose a Chinese Company."
 fengtian_events.15.b: "Choose Mantetsu."

 fengtian_events.16.t: "Infrastructure Development in Liaobei and Jilin Complete"
 fengtian_events.16.d: "Our infrastructure development plan for Liaobei and Jilin is complete, at least insofar as it needs to be for our current purposes. Truly, the Northeast is moving toward a brighter future."
 fengtian_events.16.a: "Excellent!"

 fengtian_events.17.t: "Developing Infrastructure in Nenjiang and Songjiang"
 fengtian_events.17.d: "While far more tame than the wilds of Heilongjiang or the Hailar Steppe, Nenjiang and Songjiang represent some of the least developed areas in Manchuria. The majority of our work there will mean transforming ancient footpaths, winding across hills and between mountains, into modern narrow-gauge railways or sturdy motorways. By necessity, most of our work will link up to the 'Chinese Eastern Railway', originally built by the Russians as part of the Trans-Siberian railway, but now heavily influenced by the Japanese."

The majority of our work there will mean transforming ancient footpaths, winding across hills and between mountains, into modern narrow-gauge railways or sturdy motorways. By necessity, most of our work will link up to the 'Chinese Eastern Railway', originally built by the Russians as part of the Trans-Siberian railway, but now heavily influenced by the Japanese.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mantetsu offers to perform the construction work, though there are perfectly viable Chinese companies available too."
 fengtian_events.17.a: "Choose a Chinese Company."
 fengtian_events.17.b: "Choose Mantetsu."

 fengtian_events.18.t: "Infrastructure Development in Nenjiang and Songjiang Complete"
 fengtian_events.18.d: "Despite the challenges our workers faced, work is complete on the newly developed infrastructure in Nenjiang and Songjiang. While development further north has been considered, the NTC feels that is beyond the scope of their current mandate; at least for now."
 fengtian_events.18.a: "Wansui!"

 fengtian_events.19.t: "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
 fengtian_events.19.d: "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight.\n\nWhile this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves. The strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
 fengtian_events.19.a: "Unfortunate."

 fengtian_events.20.t: "Delays Plague Infrastructure Construction"
 fengtian_events.20.d: "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments unaccountably missing, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labour force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals'; inspections which inevitably required the suspension of work.\n\nThese same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit Chinese construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do."
 fengtian_events.20.a: "Frustrating."

 fengtian_events.21.t: "Delays Plague Mantetsu Infrastructure Construction"
 fengtian_events.21.d: "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive.\n\nThe local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."
 fengtian_events.21.a: "What a pity."

#Imperial Fury/Japanese Aid Cut
 fengtian_events.22.t: "Imperial Fury"
 fengtian_events.22.d: "Infuriated, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programmes, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
 fengtian_events.22.d_influence_low: "Worried by the decreasing power of their political proxy in the Assembly, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programmes, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
 fengtian_events.22.d_fengtian_refuses_food: "Incensed by what they see as impertinence, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programmes, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament.

 fengtian_events.22.d_fengtian_blames_japan: "Incensed by our 'grave insolence', the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programmes, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
 fengtian_events.22.a: "A hard lesson."

 fengtian_events.23.t: "Japanese Aid Returns"
 fengtian_events.23.d: "Apparently feeling that their lesson in obedience is clear and punishing enough, the Japanese have resumed their aid. We should be careful about provoking them in the future, and make sure not to push the Concordia Association too far out of the Assembly before we are ready."
 fengtian_events.23.a: "At last!"

 fengtian_events.24.t: "Feng Yong Criticises Japan"
 fengtian_events.24.d: "Citing the recent expansion of the Japanese military garrison in Shenyang, Feng Yong launched a scathing criticism of Japan and its foreign policy from the Assembly floor. Though other politicians have been known to disparage the Japanese in the past, the premier post within Marshal Zhang's cirle gives Feng's words a different kind of significance, and elevates them above the confines of the Assembly.\n\nWasting no time, the Japanese Consul-General has already demanded that we remove Feng Yong from office."
 fengtian_events.24.a: "Oh dear."
 fengtian_events.24.b: "Japan is our fraternal ally..."

 fengtian_events.25.t: "Mantetsu Protests Railway Construction"
 fengtian_events.25.d: "Mantetsu's president, Matsuoka Yōsuke, has notified the government of his discovery of our recently resumed railway construction. Frustrated with our attempts to circumvent his company's stranglehold on logistics, Matsuoka has arbitrarily raised the prices on the imported high quality steel we need to complete the project. Steelworks in Japan have proven no more cooperative, likely having already received direction from the Japanese government. Though we could source the material elsewhere, the costs would make the entire project impractical.\n\nAccepting the raised prices would come at a significant political cost, and reduce the number of workers we can hire, but there could be another solution. By claiming to end the project, we could continue to access the steel at normal prices, while secretly continuing construction. By leading Mantetsu employees in circles with extensive red tape, bureaucratic obstructionism, and bogus paperwork, we could likely finish construction before anyone realises. We've done it before. Unfortunately, due to the secrecy of the project, it'd likely take much longer."
 fengtian_events.25.a: "Prices are prices."
 fengtian_events.25.b: "They won't notice until it's too late."

 fengtian_events.26.t: "The Kwantung Army Tears up our new Railway"
 fengtian_events.26.d: "Apparently having discovered our deception, soldiers from the Kwantung Army's 'Railway Guard' stormed our ongoing railway construction project, savagely destroying the rails and leaving dozens of dead workers; shot for supposed 'hostile interference'. Though the Japanese were unable to destroy everything, large sections of rail were even melted and twisted into 'railway ties'. To add to the challenges facing resumption of the project, prices on Japanese steel have been raised sky-high, likely at Mantetsu's behest. Though the Japanese are unable to completely stop our work, now we need to start almost from square one."
 fengtian_events.26.a: "These insufferable Japanese!"

 fengtian_events.27.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] is Building Parallel Railways!"
 fengtian_events.27.d: "Word has come to us by way of Mantetsu's intelligence division that [FNG.GetLeader] has resumed one of his old projects, aiming to circumvent our monopoly on Manchuria's rail network. By building parallel railway lines to the SMR and CER, should a war break out between us, Zhang will be able to ferry his men across the region without immediate interference by the Kwantung Army; not to mention without their immediate knowledge. This represents a threat to our interests, and would normally deserve a swift response.\n\nAlready the Kwantung Army is demanding that these insolent Chinese not be allowed to get away with this brazen insult to the nation."
 fengtian_events.27.a: "A swift response they shall have!"
 fengtian_events.27.b: "We have bigger problems."

 fengtian_events.28.t: "Japan Ignores Railway Construction"
 fengtian_events.28.d: "Surprisingly, the Japanese seem to have chosen to ignore our railway construction, despite their discovery of its continuation. Apart from a 'strongly worded letter', lacking any real teeth, the swift and severe response we've come to expect never came. It's possible they see their complete stranglehold on Manchurian transportation as no longer tenable, but more likely they have greater concerns at the moment."
 fengtian_events.28.a: "We've run circles around these fools!"

 fengtian_events.29.t: "Zhang Zongxiang Negotiates New Trade terms"
 fengtian_events.29.d: "The [QIE.GetAdjective]-German embargo on goods moving to and from the Northeast hit our economy hard. Continued trade was instead routed through the Legation Cities, open as they were to all nations. Although we were able to side-step the embargo, the use of Tianjin and Shanghai as intermediaries came at the cost of additional tariffs, and reliance on third parties. With these businesses, both legitimate and illegitimate, fully aware of their control over an entire region's trade, trade deals have always been lacklustre despite their necessity.\n\nSomehow Zhang Zongxiang has managed to push through years of negotiations however, and secured a deal offering better terms for trade. Rumours swirl that a number of palms were greased in the process, but nobody seems to want to ask questions."
 fengtian_events.29.a: "Excellent!"

 fengtian_events.30.t: "Mantetsu Lifts Railway Restrictions"
 fengtian_events.30.d: "After some consideration, and in spite of our sometimes fraught relations, Mantetsu's governing board has decided to set aside the restrictions usually placed on our strategic movement. This is undoubtedly an accommodation made in consideration of our newly entered war. Mantetsu will likely reimpose the restrictions when peace is made."
 fengtian_events.30.a: "Finally!"

 fengtian_events.31.t: "Mantetsu Reimposes Railway Restrictions"
 fengtian_events.31.d: "Given the end of our recently concluded war, Mantetsu's governing board has decided to reimpose its restrictions on our strategic movement in Manchuria."
 fengtian_events.31.a: "Naturally..."

 fengtian_events.32.t: "A New Automobile Company"
 fengtian_events.32.d: "Thanks to the Shenyang Arsenal's regular production of the Minsheng Truck and our efforts to encourage sino-japanese cooperation, a group of Communications Clique oligarchs have partnered with the Jidōsha-Seizo Company, subsidiary to the Nihon Sangyō Zaibatsu, to fund the creation of a new automobile factory in Fengtian province. Already a collection of young engineers, mostly educated in Japan, are studying the prospects of more modern consumer-oriented Minsheng-inspired models."
 fengtian_events.32.a: "Good news!"
 fengtian_events.32.b: "Japanese involvement is unacceptable."

 fengtian_events.33.t: "An End to the Investment Shortage"
 fengtian_events.33.d: "After roughly a decade of limited external or internal investment beyond the government's own, Fengtian has made itself a reliable and trustworthy location for prosperous growth. Going from strength to strength, and with the fires of industry behind us, our prospects of retaking the country are growing by the day.\n\nAs we begin other development projects, we should begin to see our investment efforts open up related opportunities."
 fengtian_events.33.a: "Finally!"

 #Post-Beijing Chaos Events
 fengtian_events.34.t: "Red Spears in Dezhou!"
 fengtian_events.34.d: "Bands of Red Spears, peasant self-defence units which are often little better than bandits, have grown in size and strength across Dezhou recently, especially along the Zhili-Shandong border. As the new rulers in the area, we are expected to maintain peace and order, which has now been substantially disturbed. Several local garrisons have been attacked, villages burned, and towns raided. Forces have already been dispatched to deal with the issue, but a concerted effort to wipe out resistance in the rear areas, behind our front lines, is likely needed to deal with them permanently."
 fengtian_events.34.a: "Damn peasants!"

 fengtian_events.35.t: "Deserters Rise up in Daming!"
 fengtian_events.35.d: "When our troops swept through Zhili province, they crushed all signs of organised resistance, but sometimes resistance isn't so organised. Groups of deserters, stemming from our enemy's former armies and our own forces, have begun organising in order to take on larger targets across Daming. Several trains in the vicinity of Shimen have come under attack, and have caused our logisticians serious concern due to the Jinhan Line's major strategic importance. Local garrisons will be mobilised to deal with the issue, but matters such as these behind our lines deserve a coordinated response."
 fengtian_events.35.a: "Traitors the lot of them!"

 fengtian_events.36.t: "Warlords Resist in Ruyang"
 fengtian_events.36.d: "Composed as they are of informal patronage networks, not all local power structures can be co-opted by our occupying forces. In this case, several local warlords formerly loyal to Wu Peifu have seemingly taken offence at our policies in Ruyang, and seized the Gongxian Arsenal at Xinyang. Despite their relative organisation and the weapons from the arsenal, their troops are still too few and too ill-equipped to combat our own on a large scale, but they will nonetheless force us to divert forces away from the front lines. We need a coherent response to these cases of resistance."
 fengtian_events.36.a: "Fools."

 fengtian_events.37.t: "Bandits Sweep Guanzhong"
 fengtian_events.37.d: "The mountains around Xi'an have been home to bandits since time immemorial, but now these brigands have come down from the hills and begun preying on hapless travellers, undefended villages, and most importantly our supply caravans. Due to their diffuse and disorganised nature, bandits can be difficult to track down and eliminate permanently. To do so we will undoubtedly need a coordinated effort."
 fengtian_events.37.a: "Well what are we waiting for?"

#Soy Agricultural Initiative
 fengtian_events.42.t: "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
 fengtian_events.42.d: "Soybeans are an extremely flexible crop, useful for human food, animal feed, fertiliser, and for a wide variety of industrial applications. Mantetsu's Research Wing has made great strides in making their growing, processing, and use more efficient, but planting percentages across Fengtian remain relatively stagnant. Korean farmers, who make up the majority of immigrants to Manchuria, are excellent rice planters, and like many Chinese prefer crops they have more experience with.\n\nIn an attempt to change this, Mantetsu began the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a plan intending to educate farmers and incentivise the production of soy as a cash crop, but it has so far been poorly received. Mantetsu hopes to gain the government's support in promoting the initiative, which would almost certainly increase soy yields and therefore long term profits.\n\nA few dissenting voices have pointed out that excessive soy production could reduce food security in the northeast, and in the right conditions might lead to a famine."
 fengtian_events.42.a: "Back the Initiative."
 fengtian_events.42.b: "We need no more soy."

 fengtian_events.43.t: "Japan and Korea Struggle with Drought"
 fengtian_events.43.d_fengtian_forced: "Both Japan and Korea are experiencing severe drought conditions, which we have fortunately been spared, but their economies and people now suffer, and some live on the brink of starvation. The Japanese government has formally demanded that we take part in a programme wherein we provide rice and millet to Korea, which in turn will provide rice to Japan. However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThanks to Japan's political and economic influence, we have little choice but to comply."
 fengtian_events.43.d_fengtian_normal: "Both Japan and Korea are experiencing severe drought conditions, which we have fortunately been spared, but their economies and people now suffer, and some live on the brink of starvation. The Japanese government has informally asked that we take part in a programme wherein we provide rice and millet to Korea, which in turn will provide rice to Japan. However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThis is a surprising turn for the typically aloof Japanese, but all the same, while we may refuse, it would almost certainly be met with severe repercussions."
 fengtian_events.43.a: "We will provide food."
 fengtian_events.43.b: "Japan is on its own."

 fengtian_events.45.t: "The Industrial Soy Proposal"
 fengtian_events.45.d: "Our increased food exportation, in order to counter-act the drought currently facing the Home Islands and Korea, has resulted in low provisions across Fengtian and considerable public upset. Some government ministers have proposed cutting production of industrial soy, thus providing sufficient food but handicapping our civilian industry and some exports until the crisis is resolved."
 fengtian_events.45.a: "Cut industrial soy production."
 fengtian_events.45.b: "We cannot afford this."

 fengtian_events.46.t: "The Drought Ends"
 fengtian_events.46.d: "After months of hardship, the drought in Korea and Japan has ended. We are no longer expected to render any aid to Japan or Korea."
 fengtian_events.46.a: "Finally!"

#Hokkaido Farming
 fengtian_events.47.t: "A Proposal from Mantetsu"
 fengtian_events.47.d: "A representative from Mantetsu's Research Wing has come forward with a proposal, the acceptance of which he assures us is in our best interest, but which he insists must be kept completely secret. Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in the Northeast. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway.\n\nAfter some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic offices have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."
 fengtian_events.47.a: "Accept the proposal."
 fengtian_events.47.b: "Refuse the proposal."

 fengtian_events.48.t: "Hokkaido Farming Bears Fruit"
 fengtian_events.48.d: "After much time and effort, the Hokkaido farming methods proposed by Mantetsu seem to be bearing fruit in some areas, increasing production, and freeing up additional land in the north."
 fengtian_events.48.a: "Excellent."

 fengtian_events.49.t: "Discovery"
 fengtian_events.49.d: "Although no public announcement has been made, Mantetsu's research wing has communicated that the Kwantung Army discovered our collaborative farming effort, a claim backed up by findings from our intelligence services. General Ueda Kenkichi himself is said to have stormed into the office of the Mantetsu president, Matsuoka Yōsuke, and delivered a thunderous verbal barrage regarding the necessity of Fengtian's continued state of dependence. The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved. Unfortunately, this will certainly be the end of this specific collaboration project with Mantetsu."
 fengtian_events.49.a: "Unfortunate."

 fengtian_events.50.t: "Discovery"
 fengtian_events.50.d: "Although no public statement has been made, the recent signs of discontent within portions of the army leadership have become difficult to ignore. Apparently word of our farming collaboration project with Mantetsu has spread further than we anticipated, and according to some nationalistically inclined generals, 'China must reform itself' and not submit to 'forced restructuring disguised as collaborative reform'.\n\nAlthough this is far from a major crisis, any threat to the continued cooperation of our generals and other officials is no laughing matter. Some ministers suggest that we might defend our collaboration, painting it as an instance in which we are able to manipulate Mantetsu, instead of the other way around. Others suggest that this may simply dig our hole deeper."
 fengtian_events.50.a: "Guilty as charged."
 fengtian_events.50.b: "Our actions were legitimate!"

 fengtian_events.51.t: "Popular Opinion Shifts in Our Favour"
 fengtian_events.51.d: "Against what seemed to be all odds, Grand Marshal Zhang's defence of the Hokkaido farming project seems to have convinced all those concerned. The impact has been mitigated, and the programme can continue uninterrupted."
 fengtian_events.51.a: "Wonderful news!"

 fengtian_events.52.t: "The Public is Incensed!"
 fengtian_events.52.d: "Despite our bureaucrat's best efforts, and even those of Grand Marshal Zhang, many prominent figures in the military remain unconvinced that the Hokkaido Farming Project is worth our while. As a result, the programme will almost certainly grind to a halt, and our divided government faces yet another point of contention."
 fengtian_events.52.a: "Damn!"

#Focus Tree Specific Events

 fengtian_events.53.t: "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army"
 fengtian_events.53.d: "After decades of decline and destitution, the necessity of progress and development has never been more glaring. However, while we cannot afford to stagnate, change comes with its own risks - namely mismanagement and public discontent.\n\nThe task falls to the government to answer calls to 'Enrich the Country and Strengthen the Army', but we must prioritise one or the other."
 fengtian_events.53.a: "We must enrich the Country!"
 fengtian_events.53.b: "We must strengthen the Army!"
 fengtian_events.53.c: "Tell me more about the state of the Economy."
 fengtian_events.53.e: "Tell me more about the state of the Army."

 fengtian_events.54.t: "Enrich the Country"
 fengtian_events.54.d: "While Manchuria's resources are rich and diverse, and Fengtian stands as the third greatest industrial centre in East Asia, its economy remains plagued by a number of structural problems, the symptoms of which cripple the state and slow progress toward Southern Reclamation. Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society.\n\nWhile the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals.\n\nIt should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to [QIE.GetNameDef], they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."
 fengtian_events.54.a: "Let us enrich the country!"
 fengtian_events.54.b: "Perhaps the Army is more important?"

 fengtian_events.55.t: "Strengthen the Army"
 fengtian_events.55.d: "The Fengtian Army, officially the Army of the Republic, is an impressive sight by most Chinese standards, though pales in comparison to most foreign forces, and has only recently recovered much of its strength after its decimation in the last Zhifeng War. The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the war, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard.\n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of [QIE.GetNameDef], and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."
 fengtian_events.55.a: "Let us strengthen the Army!"
 fengtian_events.55.b: "But what of the economy?"

 fengtian_events.56.t: "An Empty-Handed Return"
 fengtian_events.56.d: "Despite their best efforts, the scientists and engineers we dispatched to study Japanese manufacturing methods have returned empty-handed. Perhaps the sheer disparity in sophistication between their technology and our own was a hindrance, or maybe the Japanese went out of their way to be unhelpful. Whatever the case, the general population seems to have been impressed more by the apparent accomplishment of our 'top men' than their failure, as this has gone mysteriously unreported. As far as anyone knows, our scientists went overseas to receive very prestigious awards."
 fengtian_events.56.a: "Top men."

 fengtian_events.58.t: "Yamato Hotel Licences"
 fengtian_events.58.d: "Mantetsu's Yamato Hotel line has long been a staple of the South Manchuria Railway Zone; the concessions zone ceded first to Imperial Russia and then to Japan after 1906, and then expanded following the 21 demands of 1915 through a rather loose interpretation of its provisions to include all of southern Manchuria. All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself.\n\nMantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices of Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."
 fengtian_events.58.a: "Limit construction."
 fengtian_events.58.b: "Let them build as they please."

 fengtian_events.59.t: "The Northeast Industrial Development Commission"
 fengtian_events.59.d: "At Japan's request, and with no particular reason to refuse, we have established a legal and fiscal framework enabling the creation of the Northeast Industrial Development Commission. Serving to oversee and direct the development of Fengtian's industry, mostly through the allocation of funds and leases, the commission now faces the question of its composition.\n\nThe Concordia Association has proposed the inclusion of a series of extremely talented individuals with experience working for the Nissan and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan, who stress the need for an export-driven economy taking advantage of Fengtian's existing natural resources, while the Grand Marshal's generals insist upon the necessity of an 'Army First' approach to development, and are using their considerable influence to ensure the placement of military men on the commission. The Communications Clique recommends their own presence, and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast.\n\nUnfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. Additionally, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence. At the same time, the Japanese will not appreciate exclusion."
 fengtian_events.59.a: "Prioritise exports."
 fengtian_events.59.b: "The army must come first."
 fengtian_events.59.c: "A mixed approach is best."

 fengtian_events.60.t: "Mantetsu Chōsabu"
 fengtian_events.60.d: "The South Manchuria Railway Company's Research Wing, colloquially known as 'Mantetsu Chōsabu', has grown over the years from a mere corporate R&D department into the heart of Japan's colonial research programme, with divisions dedicated to everything from agricultural science to intelligence gathering. The organisation's sheer scale has lead to the opening of offices in Berlin, Vancouver, and New York to attract foreign talent, plus wide recruitment from Japan's foremost universities. The result is a surprisingly liberal and open-minded intellectual community, which sometimes places scientific inquiry before nationalistic concerns.\n\nThis appears to be one of those instances, as our government has been approached by a Chōsabu representative offering future assistance in one of several fields. It should be noted that the Kwantung Army garrison in [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] were strongly opposed to this arrangement."

 fengtian_events.67.d: "Drawing from its wide-ranging intelligence operations, Mantetsu's research wing has provided a series of manuals detailing special methods and best practices for our covert operatives. Although the books are clearly out of date, and certain sections have been redacted, there is still much to learn.

 fengtian_events.68.a: "Excellent."

 fengtian_events.69.t: "The Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
 fengtian_events.69.d: "Jinzhou's convenient location makes it excellent for a proposed industrial zone, and several groups have already begun jockeying for a dominant position in development; most notably a Mantetsu subsidiary specialising in canning and light metal work, the Communications Clique who want to establish a rolling stock factory, and the military which insists that the zone must be used for munitions manufacture ahead of 'personal capitalistic gains'. The situation is made somewhat unusual by the Communications Clique, who are usually able to front quite a bit of money, and rumours suggest that several members are under pressure from the military to weaken their own bidding position."
 fengtian_events.69.a: "Choose Mantetsu."
 fengtian_events.69.b: "Choose the Communications Clique."
 fengtian_events.69.c: "Choose the Zhang Clique."

 fengtian_events.70.t: "Filling the Silver Reserve"
 fengtian_events.70.d: "A full silver reserve is crucial to building confidence in Fengtian's currency, and even more crucial to attracting foreign investment, without which Fengtian can never hope to match the Zhili to the south who have been, for the past eight years, flush with German capital. However, silver is an expensive commodity, and paying for enough to fill the reserve fully would undoubtedly cut funding from other areas.\n\nSome ministers have privately suggested only buying about half of the desired quantity, as many believed the reserve was less than full before the last Zhifeng War, and those rumours were never confirmed. Of course, it was later difficult to explain the significant economic recession that followed the government's inability to settle its war debts.\n\nStill, filling the reserve inadequately would certainly be a big risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one."
 fengtian_events.70.a: "Fill the reserve."
 fengtian_events.70.b: "No risk no reward."

 fengtian_events.71.t: "Economic Disaster!"
 fengtian_events.71.d: "After the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, major lenders to our own government, unexpectedly called for outstanding debts to be paid, our Central Bank suddenly found itself unable to provide sufficient silver for the transaction. News of the situation quickly leaked to the public provoking a run on the banks, and widespread financial panic. Rumour suggests that the crisis is not a product of gross mismanagement and incompetence on behalf of the government, which would surprise few in Fengtian, but rather a deliberate move to deceive the public. Mantetsu's offices in Shenyang and Harbin have already begun a full scale investigation, and unless action is taken they seem likely to discover a very incriminating paper trail.\n\nWhile there are several options available, it would be unfortunate if certain government files inexplicably went missing..."
 fengtian_events.71.a: "Burn the evidence!"
 fengtian_events.71.b: "Burn it and blame the Japanese!"
 fengtian_events.71.c: "Ask Japan for a bailout!"
 fengtian_events.71.e: "We must come clean!"

 fengtian_events.72.t: "Banking Evidence Discovered!"
 fengtian_events.72.d: "After a thorough investigation involving untold bribes and threats, Mantetsu investigators have concluded that our government intentionally deceived its people, and is entirely to blame for the recent financial disaster. We are in no position to refuse their calls for the arrests of several involved ministers, but conveniently the Grand Marshal and his closest advisors have been spared direct blame, and Mantetsu's Director Matsuoka Yōsuke has suggested that in return for political favours, the entire matter could be shelved indefinitely."
 fengtian_events.72.a: "Accept the offer."
 fengtian_events.72.b: "Refuse the offer."

 fengtian_events.73.t: "Japan Agrees to the Bailout"
 fengtian_events.73.d: "In a move that will surely save our economy, Japan has agreed to pay for sufficient silver to fill our reserve, and will not look further into the matter. Of course, this was likely inspired by little more than self interest, but some say that Japan may not be so bad after all..."
 fengtian_events.73.a: "We are saved!"

 fengtian_events.74.t: "Japan Refuses the Bailout"
 fengtian_events.74.d: "Despite our pleas, Japan has refused a bailout, leaving us in the same economic position we were before we made the request and with ample humiliation to boot. The only 'silver lining' is that many citizens, even including some employees of Mantetsu, have lost a great deal of faith in Japan's benevolent position toward China."
 fengtian_events.74.a: "If only that was more than a metaphor."
 fengtian_events.74.b: "Perhaps Minister Ruan can smooth things over."

 fengtian_events.75.t: "The State of the Officer Corps"
 fengtian_events.75.d: "Fengtian's officer corps is an unusual mix of young Chinese educated at either the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō in Japan, the Northeastern Army Lecture Hall, or the Baoding Military Academy, older Chinese who served in the Civil Wars, and Japanese officers part of the Military Mission to Fengtian, all united by common loyalties to individuals more than any special dedication to the state. Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in the Northeast, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population.\n\nNow, with the founding of the Shenyang National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, which are decades old and in disrepair. While a newer modern building rises nearby, the pitiful state of the academy at present leaves the government open to criticism."

 fengtian_events.76.t: "Expel Japanese Officers"
 fengtian_events.76.d: "Japan has maintained a military mission in Fengtian ever since the founding of the Fengtian Government in 1926, who were preceded by over a decade of informal Japanese operations in support of Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique. The Mission has served to aid many aspects of the military's development, primarily through the supply of arms and equipment, but also training and planning assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the shortage of officers in the aftermath of the civil wars provided Japan with the opportunity to attach Japanese officers to command positions in the field, and even lead our units independently. This has had a negative effect upon the morale of our men, making Japan's influence all too obvious, even as the Military Mission attempts, and often succeeds, in influencing our affairs of government. In order for our soldiers and the Chinese people to have any respect for our Government, the Japanese Military Mission must leave."

 fengtian_events.77.t: "Japan Declares War"
 fengtian_events.77.d: "In response to our expulsion of their officers, the Japanese Government has cut all ties and declared war! Many will look at this as a disaster, but perhaps it is an opportunity in disguise. The truth will be found on the battlefield."
 fengtian_events.77.d_breakaway: "In response to what they see as a violation of our commitment to cooperation, as well as the Thirteen Demands of 1915, Japan has subsequently declared war 'in protection of its treaty rights and interests in China'."

 fengtian_events.78.t: "Japan Delivers an Ultimatum"
 fengtian_events.78.d: "Despite our valiant attempts to remove the Japanese Military Mission, their influence in our government has proven to be too great, forcing its reinstatement. The only other option now would be a rejection of the ultimatum and a declaration of war, directed by the Grand Marshal himself."
 fengtian_events.78.d_ultimatum: "Negotiations have failed and Japan has delivered a simple ultimatum. We must reinstate the mission or they will immediately declare war."
 fengtian_events.78.a: "We have no choice but to submit."

 fengtian_events.79.t: "Wu Wang Zai Ju"
 fengtian_events.79.d: "Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin delivered a short but powerful speech alluding to the historical State of Qi which, when on the brink of defeat at the siege of Ju, turned the tide and eventually won the war. This is to be our example as we march forward against those who would keep China weak and divided."

The Grand Marshal has personally released several short speeches denouncing \"the Kaiser's puppet in Asia\", [QIE.GetLeader], calling him \"lower than a dog\" for his \"cowardice and brazen collaboration with the German intruder\", and for \"selling out the Chinese people to foreign interests\". Just how much further can the illegitimate [QIE.GetAdjective] government bow before it topples?"

In this particular case, we are being asked for artillery.\n\nWe could send the best we have, which ought to make a significant difference in such a backwards country, but we could also provide a greater number of cheap obsolete weapons at lesser cost to ourselves.

 fengtian_events.971.a: "So much for Pan-Asian Brotherhood."

 fengtian_events.98.t: "Obsolete Tanks from Japan"
 fengtian_events.98.d: "Although the Japanese predictably refused to send us their latest armoured equipment, only the most cynical anticipated the arrival of the rusting and dented Weltkrieg-era tanks now being unloaded at Yingkou. Although they are better than nothing at all, this is distinctly disappointing."
 fengtian_events.98.a: "So be it."

 fengtian_events.100.d1: "The Fengtian Government has long possessed an advantage against its Chinese rivals thanks to our frequent material aid. In this particular case, we are being asked for light tanks, which are better suited than heavier models to China's rough terrain and primitive infrastructure.\n\nThe latest armoured vehicles would be wasted or even outright dangerous in Chinese hands, but we do have surplus stockpiles of only slightly outdated tanks that might be appreciated. Alternately we could send even older equipment at no real cost to ourselves, though of course we could also choose to send nothing at all."
 fengtian_events.100.d2: "The Fengtian Government has long possessed an advantage against its Chinese rivals thanks to our frequent material aid.

All that remains is to stride forward and seize the moment. Ten thousand years to Grand Marshal Zhang! Ten thousand years to the Republic!\n\nEmerging from small villages and towns along the northern banks of the Chaobai River, our soldiers have lead a successful uprising, isolating and eliminating local garrisons, and holding key river-crossings. We must push South as quickly as possible, before they are overwhelmed by the enemy's response and greater numbers."
 fengtian_events.102.a: "History will remember this day!"

 fengtian_events.103.t: "Shanhaiguan Infiltration"
 fengtian_events.103.d: "The time has come for our soldiers to put into action our carefully laid plans and begin to infiltrate through Shanhaiguan and into the province beyond. Their mission will not be easy, as any number of things could go wrong, but if they are successful we will have an uprising behind enemy lines to keep them busy and cut their supply."

 fengtian_events.104.t: "Preparations Complete at Shanhaiguan"

 fengtian_events.105.d: "Word has reached our intelligence operatives that, in the process of infiltration through Shanhaiguan, our soldiers were discovered and picked off by enemy operatives and groups of military police. If anyone is left, they will undoubtedly be too scattered and disorganised to be of any use once we begin the war, and so unfortunately this plan must be considered failed."
 fengtian_events.105.a: "A brave sacrifice."

 fengtian_events.106.t: "Infiltrators Disappear"
 fengtian_events.106.d: "Although our intelligence services received reports of progress through the beginning stages of the Shanhaiguan Infiltration, contact has been abruptly cut off, and our forces have disappeared South of the Great Wall. It's possible that some were discovered and are merely avoiding detection, or that the entire force was destroyed. The fate of these brave soldiers could never be known."

 fengtian_events.107.t: "An Unexpected Advantage"
 fengtian_events.107.d: "Despite the cessation of all contact with the Shanhaiguan infiltration force, reports have made their way north of gunfire and chaos on the northern banks of the Chaobai River. It seems that these heroes have avoided all detection, only to strike now at the opportune moment. Truly, this is an unexpected advantage, and we must push south before they are overwhelmed by the enemy response and greater numbers!"
 fengtian_events.107.a: "Glorious!"

 fengtian_events.108.t: "Shanhaiguan Uprising Fails"
 fengtian_events.108.d: "Before it could ever truly begin, our uprising south of Shanhaiguan was detected and quickly overwhelmed by the local enemy garrison in a short but violent confrontation. While we may encounter some survivors as we push south, we will have no organised assistance from the other side of the Great Wall."
 fengtian_events.108.a: "Damn."

 fengtian_events.110.t: "The Gang of Three"
 fengtian_events.110.d: "As a loose coalition of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians exiled from the South by the collapse of the Beiyang Government, the Recovery League is widely acknowledged to be susceptible to corruption. However, recent discoveries by police have turned up something unusually troubling. It seems that a group of Recovery League politicians, who were made mayors of townships in Jilin, owing to their experience with governing in the South, had in fact never been mayors anywhere or at all. Instead, they had killed and replaced their namesakes and, through a complicated plot of deceit, fooled the authorities while eliminating any who might contradict them.\n\nThe web of lies, corruption, and murder necessary to sustain this falsehood stretches across the whole of the province, and the damage dealt to the government's legitimacy is not inconsiderable."
 fengtian_events.110.a: "Disgusting."

 fengtian_events.111.t: "Mantetsu Bribes"
 fengtian_events.111.d: "A pair of Concordia Association members were recently caught attempting to bribe Recovery League politicians, and while this activity has long been suspected, this is the first time it has been caught in the open. Although members of the other parties have motioned to remove the offending members, the Japanese Consulate has already delivered a message 'strongly advising' that no action be taken against the members of the Concordia Association.\n\nThe Grand Marshal could choose to do so regardless, but not without risking Japanese wrath."
 fengtian_events.111.a: "Remove them anyway."
 fengtian_events.111.b: "We can do nothing."

 fengtian_events.112.t: "The Anshan Incident"
 fengtian_events.112.d: "As Anshan's ore lies close to the surface, its mines have mainly expanded outward rather than downward, swallowing up nearby land at an alarming pace. Our decision to approve the company's further expansion has thus led to the complete destruction of several nearby farmsteads, and half a village, at the hands of Japanese mining equipment.\n\nPromised compensation has not been forthcoming, and protests quickly broke out among local farmers, which our local police refused to break up on 'patriotic grounds'. The ensuing riot severely damaged expensive mining equipment, leading to the deployment of the Japanese railway guard, and the use of lethal force to disperse the riot. This slaughter of our citizens has not gone unnoticed, and existing anti-Japanese sentiment has only been inflamed. The people will hold us accountable in our response, but the deposits and the company working them are essential to Japan's strategic goals, and our relationship with the Japanese permits little room to manoeuvre."
 fengtian_events.112.a: "Denounce the Japanese."
 fengtian_events.112.b: "Stay silent."

 fengtian_events.113.t: "Japan Denounces Us"
 fengtian_events.113.d: "Describing our denouncement of their conduct during the recent Anshan Incident as 'insolent' and 'unbefitting of Japanese generosity', the Japanese government issued a scathing rebuke both publicly and through a letter delivered directly by the Japanese Consul General in Shenyang. The Kwantung Garrison performed a series of motorised and armoured manoeuvres in full view of the capital, their message clear. Any escalation of this situation would undoubtedly result in further rebukes to which we can make no meaningful response."
 fengtian_events.113.a: "So be it."
 fengtian_events.113.b: "We will not be intimidated!"

 fengtian_events.114.t: "An Opportunity Arises"
 fengtian_events.114.d: "In the years since the Fengtian's Army retreat beyond the Great Wall, a watchful eye has been kept on the south. The natural chokepoint created by the Shanhai Pass has always made it hard for Zhili armies to get in, but equally difficult for our own to get out. Any effort to reclaim China has always depended upon a moment of southern weakness. Such a moment now seems set to arrive, as simmering anti-German sentiment has erupted into violence in the League of Eight Provinces, and the governor of Anhui has broken away from Nanjing - hoping to leverage the League and the Central Government against one another for his own gain.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not yet ready to begin our long-awaited campaign, as there are outstanding issues in the Northeast to be settled and it is still not clear exactly what will become of the situation in the League. We must watch and wait for the right opportunity."
 fengtian_events.114.a: "Let us choose wisely."

 fengtian_events.115.t: "The Zhang Zuolin Radio Incident"
 fengtian_events.115.d: "In what has come to be known as 'The Zhang Zuolin Radio Incident', a [QIE.GetAdjective] subversive was able to record a frank conversation between the Grand Marshal and his generals, and transmitted it over widely used frequencies in Shenyang for nearly forty minutes before being jammed by a nearby Mantetsu owned station. The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests.\n\nThe broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of [QIE.GetNameDef]'s relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."
 fengtian_events.115.a: "Like laws, it is better not to see Hongchang being made."

 fengtian_events.116.t: "Seditious Articles Proliferate"
 fengtian_events.116.d: "An article in the Nihon Kogyō Shimbun, or 'Japan Industrial Newspaper', has been translated into Chinese and spread widely in local newspapers before censorship officials managed to track and shut down the publisher. The article described in substantial detail the extensive degree to which Mantetsu and other Japanese companies have established control over most sectors of our economy, and set a forecast predicting near-complete control within five years time. For obvious reasons, the article has been deeply upsetting to the general population, and there is little we can do to prevent the existing copies circulating."
 fengtian_events.116.a: "Disgraceful!"

 fengtian_events.117.t: "Honghuzi Attacks in Heilongjiang"
 fengtian_events.117.d: "Honghuzi, translated literally as 'Red Beards', are groups of bandits and robbers that have long plagued the Northeast. In recent years the Honghuzi have usually been content with low-key extortion, banditry, and ransom, but now several market towns in southern Heilongjiang have been set alight. This is unusually bold behaviour, perhaps encouraged by the nation's recent focus on events to the south.\n\nSome have suggested that an expedition should be mounted to crush the bandits and send a clear message, but various generals feel that such a mission is beneath the central government.\n\nWe could also ask the Japanese for help, though this idea is unpopular."
 fengtian_events.117.a: "Send an expedition."
 fengtian_events.117.b: "Ask for Japanese help."
 fengtian_events.117.c: "An expedition is a fool's errand."

 fengtian_events.118.t: "Honghuzi Attacks in Xing'an"
 fengtian_events.118.d: "Despite efforts to contain them, the Honghuzi have struck again, this time in Xing'an, raiding farmsteads and traders along its major roads. The local governor has dispatched his garrison to guard against future incursions, but the rough terrain and the bandit's elusive nature suggests that they may simply strike again elsewhere.\n\nThere are rumours that the group, now several thousand strong, is led by Zhang Haitian, known among the locals as 'Lao Beifeng' or 'Old North Wind'."

Now they have begun leading attacks into Liaobei province, and even venturing to the borders of Jilin, where they derailed a local train and robbed its occupants, including a number of Japanese citizens. The local authorities have apologised profusely for this embarrassment, and additional guards have been posted on nearby trains, but the Japanese Consulate has already demanded compensation from our government for the property lost.\n\nAllowing this to continue for any longer would be a national embarrassment."

[QIE.GetNameDefCap] has been known to recruit spies and assassins before, but some rumours suggest that this assassin was instead hired by members of the Concordia Association, locked in conflict with the Communications Clique's Railway and Telegraph barons for control of the country's infrastructure."
 fengtian_events.124.a: "A terrible loss."

 fengtian_events.125.t: "Record Mantetsu Profits"
 fengtian_events.125.d: "The South Manchuria Railway Company, colloquially 'Mantetsu', has long dominated large sectors of Fengtian's economy, and in turn acts as Japan's primary means of influence over our government. While this influence is unwelcome, it brings crucial capital and technology without which the Grand Marshal could never hope to retake China.\n\nThe Company has today announced record profits, much of which goes to Japan's government in the form of tax revenue."
 fengtian_events.125.a: "Is this a necessary evil?"

 fengtian_events.126.t: "Counterfeit Dollars Spread"
 fengtian_events.126.d: "In order to save money, the version of the Fengtian Dollar being circulated currently is the same as it was when it was first issued, as quality printing equipment is highly expensive.

Of course, our aid has played a great role in getting Fengtian to where it is today, and already some ministers have suggested that we might make a private commitment to joining their war.\n\nThis would be in our interest, as Fengtian is the best means of pushing German influence out of China, but at the same time it might be best to limit their ambitions and our resources are not limitless. The Grand Marshal will, of course, push on regardless. His legitimacy depends on it."

By doing so, the Fengtian clique acknowledges the national government of [FROM.overlord.GetNameDef] and has, thus, renounced their claims to the Republic of China. As a result of their declaration, [FNG.GetLeader] has announced that Fengtian's ties with Japan are now to be cut and that they will no longer support Japan's interests in China.\n\nFor years [FNG.GetNameDef] has only survived due to our military and economic aid to their backwards province. Under Japan, Manchuria has become a jewel of the East - a province for all of Asia to look up to. We cannot risk the humiliation and shame this betrayal will give us. Our military high command and Mantetsu business owners are now calling for a direct military intervention to protect Japanese honour and to put the rebellious Fengtian Clique into its place. Nonetheless, some within our government are calling us to stand down and say that war in China is not what we have priority for now."

Privately, Mantetsu's President has indicated that the studio will also be used to subtly spread anti-[QIE.GetAdjective] messages, but this has left some close advisors to the Grand Marshal wondering what else might be subtly inserted.\n\nThe government could always instruct Jilin's governor to deny Mantetsu permission to build, but the Film Association would likely just move south to [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where we will have no influence over it at all."

Overall, and despite its relatively small screening due to limited theatre numbers, the film has been considered a great success."

She later learns of the deliberate arrangement of this misunderstanding by [QIE.GetAdjective] spies, renews her faith in Hasegawa, and undermines the Manchu plot.

Aside from some first-time viewers being scared out of the theatre, the overall message is demeaning, playing to Japanese assumptions that Chinese are, by habit, dirty and lice-infested; the reception being quite negative as a result, and leading some to wonder whether this might have been avoided if the government took a more active role in production."

 fengtian_events.167.d: "Warlord cliques are hardly the most concrete or coherent bodies at the best of times, with such a statement being evident even within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s own ranks. However, serious is the common case of defection, or betrayal, from one clique to another. Usually such events are retained merely for when one Clique's epoch passes onto another's, such as when Anhui fell and beget defections to the Zhili and Fengtian on the rise to their first era of prominence, or when Feng Yuxiang's betrayal in conjunction with the Second Zhili-Fengtian war saw defections from the Zhili onto the Guominjun, or furthermore to Fengtian.\n\nWith the most concerning news of Zhang Zuolin's death in his prized Northeastern Provinces, allegedly at the hands of the Japanese, and the rapid rise of General Yang Yuting to the position of Grand Marshal of the Fengtian Government, another wave of defections have poured out from Fengtian. Following his assumption of power, Yuting set forth purging all rivals or those that had even a thought of betraying him, including the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang and his loyalists.\n\nHowever, managing to avoid Yuting and his Shikan Clique for long enough, Shaoshuai stalwarts Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Tingshu alongside two of Marshal Zhang's old allies, Wan Fulin and Wu Junsheng, colloquially known as the \"Heilongjiang Clique\", have communicated through mounted messenger, informing [ROOT.GetLeader]'s field commanders of their intentions to defect. Whilst of varying degrees of skill, with Zhanshan known for his eccentricities, and Junsheng for his clumsy malaise, they nonetheless are fiercely vengeful for the death of the Old Marshal, seeking the deposition of Yuting. Albeit the question remains, can the bandits-turned-generals be trusted?"

All under the late Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, neither Shikan nor the disparate Anti-Shikan Cliques, such as Shaoshuai or Heilongjiang, would have dared to act against eachother in brazen strikes. Yet with the death of the Marshal, the cause for caution has been utterly called off — with Shikan's purge of the Shaoshuai Clique and other loyalists. Scheduled to be on the chopping block, in a surprising twist it would appear that the Heilongjiang Clique — that is, Wu Junsheng alongside his protégés, Wan Fulin and Ma Zhanshan — have struck first."

In correspondence with their frontline commanders, the Heilongjiang Clique's leaders managed to secure passage to, equipment from, and commissions within [FROM.GetNameDef]'s armies. During their rapid escape, the Clique simultaneously managed to secure three million silver dollars from the Fengtian treasury, taking it with them across the border. Whilst clearly a move pinned on their salvation, it has both made glaringly obvious the weakness of Yuting's nascent government, and the strength of Zhang Zuolin's last free loyalists.

Ultimately, it would appear that their soliciting for commissions from the enemy bore no fruit, thankfully. To [ROOT.GetLeader]'s dismay however, instead of choosing to lie down and accept defeat like the rest of Marshal Zhang's allies, the Heilongjiang Clique fled to the hills of their frontier province, intending to stage a defiant last stand, or at least collapse the perceived rotten structure of Yuting's government with the aid of outside forces."

Whilst resembling the various bandit groups that have roamed the Three Northeastern Provinces for years, the Heilongjiang Insurgency took on the form of a far more organised, and capable, force. Even with noted blunders under the command of Wu Junsheng and Wan Fulin, the desperados continuously managed to trump Fengtian forces.\n\nOr so was the case up until recently. Despite arduous attempts from the Kempetai and Fengtian military forces to squash local provincial insurgent headquarters as they sprung up, the majority of attempts resulted in mixed failure. Whilst most success was won against Wan Fulin's area of the operation, Ma Zhanshan's cavalry forces managed to not only trump the Fengtian army, but the Japanese too. Whilst not inflicting particularly strong casualties, Ma's forces nonetheless could not be squashed. For his skill and notoriety, the Japanese have begun dubbing him the \"Napoleon of the East\".\n\nNonetheless, it would appear that the Heilongjiang Insurgency has ran past its expiration date, as in recent days much of the fighting in the province and neighbouring regions has subsided. With notably less troop movements than before, much of their radio channel's chatter has dissipated, and it's all but a foregone conclusion that their movement has ran out steam. Reports have even emerged that Wan, Ma, Zhang, and Wu have all departed into Siberia, somehow aiming to return to a less hostile China, or forever remain in exile. Whatever the case may be, the inability for the government to squash such a seemingly small rebellion has terribly hurt its reputation."

Chasing up the ladder of provincial insurgent HQs, and through systematic deployment of Kempetai interrogation and bribery of less than convicted cadres of the rebel's escapades, Ma Zhanshan, Wan Fulin, and Wu Junsheng fell akin to dominoes. First to fall was Wan Fulin, proving to be little more capable than his days in the broader Fengtian army. Then came Wu Junsheng, unable to stem the tide, perishing ironically due to a local explosive carried by a double agent. Third arrived Zhang Tingshu, collaborating with the Kuomintang insurgents, he would ultimately suffer the fate of many of China's prior revolutionaries.\n\nFinally arrived Ma Zhanshan, proving to be the most resilient of the three. An expert at maintaining the primacy, mobility, and cohesiveness of his broadly cavalry force, Ma defiantly resisted to the brutal and bitter end. Rallying all loyalist forces on radio channels all throughout the Northeast, he gained notoriety for his surprising skill in guerilla tactics to the point that [ROOT.GetNameDef] troops and the Japanese have dubbed Ma the \"Napoleon of the East\". Much like Napoleon however, Ma Zhanshan fell to superior forces. Conducting a raid on his HQ, a local explosive would gravely wound the General's left hand. Despite this, he continued to hold out for hours, only perishing in the fighting after much of his forces ran out of ammunition."

However, the major lines running from [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to Harbin have suddenly experienced a series of strikes, shutting down service in protest of the proposed legislation.\n\nFaced with this overwhelming rejection, the legislation has been shelved for the time being, and it seems likely that Li Shaogeng and his widespread contacts are responsible."

Or has he?\n\nAn image depicting Tang has circulated widely, appearing in newspapers across the Northeast, though its origin is unclear. Some claim that the image is doctored, while others believe the tiger is only stuffed, but the aspect garnering the most attention is the context. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin is often referred to as 'The Tiger of the North', and so the fact that Tang is shown riding one paints a very questionable picture.\n\nOn his part, Tang Yulin claims that the image is the creation of a [QIE.GetAdjective] saboteur, but his extravagant parties in Chaoyang suggests that the image, if not the tiger, may well be genuine."

 fengtian_events.181.d: "The levying of seemingly arbitrary taxes to fill gaps in the budget, genuine or not, has been a long standing practice of national, regional, and local governments across China, including our own. This time, Police Chief Yuan is pressuring the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Li Shaogeng, to accept additional taxes on the railway, allegedly for the purposes of further strengthening the army. If his demands aren't met, he's threatening an investigation of Communications Clique assets, as well as various legally questionable fees the Board already charges its customers, the revenue from which almost certainly sticks to a number of fingers.\n\nThere is every likelihood that, as Yuan is likewise a member of the CER board and an advisor on our inner council, this is his idea of a power play. Still, it must be said, his tax would undoubtedly help fill the national treasury, if at the cost of undercutting competition to Mantetsu. It seems likely that the Grand Marshal will be forced to settle this dispute, lest it spiral out of control."

Already police forces have begun to converge, and unless the Grand Marshal intercedes soon, there is an increasing risk that the investigation could uncover larger secrets best kept from the public eye.\n\nOf course, if his investigation is stopped, Yuan will almost certainly resign from his position as police chief."

 fengtian_events.183.d_large: "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government. Those fears have now come to pass. Though the Communications Clique has been hit hardest by the ensuing scandal, the government as a whole has suffered a serious blow to its legitimacy, despite Yuan's best efforts to keep the full results under wraps. Though there have been calls for Yuan to resign, damage control takes priority, and the Police Chief has earned a great deal of respect from the general population, ironic though it may be."
 fengtian_events.183.d_small: "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government. Fortunately its results have narrowly targeted members of the Communications Clique, leaving the wider government largely unscathed. Yuan will walk away with a greater degree of control over the CER, and greater respect among the general population, despite his own 'alleged' shady dealings."

For decades it has served as one of China's primary transit arteries, ferrying goods across the length of the North China Plain, and connecting its width by way of Zhengzhou.\n\nIn the years since its construction the railway has fallen on hard times, and so while the Belgians are long gone it will take a great deal of investment to restore its infrastructure and integrate it with our new national railway services."

Like the Jinghan Railway, it has long served as one of China's most important logistical arteries, connecting north with south, and east with west by way of Xuzhou.\n\nIn the years since the last Zhifeng War the sections of the railway in Shandong and Jiangsu gradually fell under the sway of the German AOG, which updated and expanded its infrastructure. However, as the company's employees have now been driven away or shot as Hanjian they will need to be replaced.

This is rather outrageous, as this would certainly lead to war with the Anqing Clique, which would be a disaster. However, it is true that Zhang Zongchang and Zhang Zuolin go back a long way.

It is true that Zhang Zongchang and Zhang Zuolin go back a long way. Chen instead describes the fact that as the legitimate successor to the League, all of the Five Provinces should fall under his dominion. He demands that all of Jiangsu is returned to him at once.

Zhang will also never be happy with being stuck with only Shandong. This means that we will have to split Jiangsu, one way or another. One possibility is to simply split the western Xuzhou region, which would go to Zhang, from the eastern Yancheng region, with the latter including Nantong and going to Chen. It is unlikely Chen will see this as sufficient as the province was ruled from Xuzhou, which is also where the province's most important railroads meet. Another possibility is to separate economic from political control. In this scenario, one would officially run Jiangsu's government, which would of course have to be led by at least a somewhat independent governor. Then the other would be allowed to nominate a lieutenant governor, who would have control over all the province's resources and be allowed to levy taxes and conduct recruitment among other things."

While this means we will have no territorial expansion to show for our efforts against the League, the Jiangsu province is very rich. It would allow us to significantly bolster our ranks as well and gives us ample opportunity to expand our armies in order to strike again in the future. However, having full control remains ideal and if Chen is able to rebuild, it will be very difficult to ever defeat him."

 fengtian_events.253.t: "The Loyalty of Workers Achieved"
 fengtian_events.253.d: "The [FNG.GetName] has finally achieved its goal of destroying the influence of unions, by using various means like union busting, anti-union propaganda, as well as increasing national control of key industry. The propaganda has instilled the belief that unions are just a way to divide this society, weakening us against the West, which most workers now finally believe in."
 fengtian_events.253.a: "Unions divide the country in the face of foreign imperialism!"

 fengtian_events.254.t: "Reform of Command Structure Finished"
 fengtian_events.254.d: "The [FNG.GetName]'s massive reform of the command structure is finally finished, creating finally a centralised command structure in China, seen by the central government as paramount for preventing a new division of China in the future. While this has improved the army considerably in its efficiency, it is very unpopular among high-ranking generals as its removing their previous autonomy, same with warlords ruling in many parts of this nation."
 fengtian_events.254.a: "China shall be united forever!"

 fengtian_events.255.t: "Our Enemies Make Ready for War!"
 fengtian_events.255.d_1: "According to our spies in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the [FROM.GetName] is preparing to declare war on us soon. This fight will be one for survival."
 fengtian_events.255.d_2: "In the dead of night two trains, thirty four cars long, steamed through Huanggutun Station in Shenyang toward a staging area at Jinxi some 150 miles south. Two hours later another two trains passed, and by morning, ten in total. Our spies are certain now, a great mustering has begun beyond the Great Wall. Once again, Zhang Zuolin's armies are preparing to march south through the Shanhai Pass. Once again we must crush these northeastern dogs, as we did a decade ago, as did the dynasties of old."
 fengtian_events.255.d_3: "Our spies in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] report that the [FROM.GetName] is preparing to join the [FNG.GetName]'s war against us!"
 fengtian_events.255.a: "We have only a short time to prepare."

 fengtian_events.256.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Calls for Aid!"
 fengtian_events.256.d: "News has come by telephone straight from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], our allies in the [FROM.GetName] are about to be attacked by [FNG.GetName]! Already their forces are mobilising, but they cannot confront this foe alone."
 fengtian_events.256.a: "We must prepare!"

 fengtian_events.270.t: "The Matter of Occupation"
 fengtian_events.270.d: "Occupations are never easy or simple, but the average Chinese soldier is often little better than a bandit with marching orders. Already our troops have begun burning, looting, and defiling the same towns and villages that our government claims to be liberating. Some would say that we should let the troops have their fun, but now that Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin is again competing on the national stage he must consider his image. He was once a bandit himself, and many here in the south have a hard time showing respect to or taking orders from a former criminal. Already the elite have turned up their noses, and while force might be an easy answer, we do need these intellectuals, landlords, and businessmen to forward our greater aims. It is these figures through whom we must rule. Fortunately, our logistics system is sufficient to feed our soldiers, meaning our men are not looting for survival, but nonetheless they will be unhappy to be kept from what they see as their right by conquest.\n\nHere we must choose: The liberators or the liberated?"
 fengtian_events.270.a: "Let them have their fun."
 fengtian_events.270.b: "We're not bandits anymore."

 fengtian_events.271.t: "Feeding the North China Plain"
 fengtian_events.271.d_food: "As we extend our authority over newly reclaimed areas, we must ensure that they too do their part in the march toward reunification. Unfortunately, the North China Plain is densely populated and consumes more food than it produces, turning otherwise richly taxable land into a drain on our resources. Fortunately Manchuria is vast and fertile, and thanks to our decision not to push through the 'Soy Agricultural Initiative' we can afford to feed most of the population."
 fengtian_events.271.d_exports: "As we extend our authority over newly reclaimed areas, we must ensure that they too do their part in the march toward reunification. Unfortunately, the North China Plain is densely populated and consumes more food than it produces, turning otherwise richly taxable land into a drain on our resources. On the one hand, Manchuria is vast and fertile, and thanks to our decision not to push through the 'Soy Agricultural Initiative' we can afford to feed most of the population. On the other hand we are currently exporting all of our surplus grain to Japan to offset its current famine.\n\nHere we must choose: China or Japan? Do we put our own people first, or cower before Japanese martial supremacy?"
 fengtian_events.271.d_soy: "As we extend our authority over newly reclaimed areas, we must ensure that they too do their part in the march toward reunification. Unfortunately, the North China Plain is densely populated and consumes more food than it produces, turning otherwise richly taxable land into a drain on our resources. Unfortunately, thanks to the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a great deal of Northeastern grain production has been replaced by soy cash crops. With barely enough food to feed the Northeast, we can't even begin to think about shipping food anywhere else.\n\nNorth China will have to endure a famine, one which will reflect poorly on our leadership."
 fengtian_events.271.a: "Import grain from Manchuria"
 fengtian_events.271.b: "We need the grain, stop exporting to Japan."
 fengtian_events.271.c: "We can't stand up to them."
 fengtian_events.271.e: "Those damn soy beans!"

 fengtian_events.272.t: "Scandal in Beijing"
 fengtian_events.272.d_bad: "A certain amount of looting was inevitable in Beijing. As the national capital for centuries, and home to generations of emperors, the wealth spread throughout the city's rampant bureaucracy has long been beyond measure. However, it is not material wealth that has seen the city now dragged into scandal. Supposedly some of our soldiers have been capturing the wives and concubines of government ministers and, after committing unspeakable acts, parading them through the city streets as trophies. To make matters worse, some have been placed on a makeshift scaffold and are being sold as if cattle to the highest bidder. In any disciplined army they would be executed for this behaviour, and we have made assurances as such to the local population, but there is every possibility that the matter will be brushed under the rug by local commanders."

Fortunately, thanks to our code of conduct and the quick reactions of a less tolerant commander the majority of these soldiers have been imprisoned and await punishment."
 fengtian_events.272.a: "Outrageous!"

 fengtian_events.273.t: "Desecration in Yi County"
 fengtian_events.273.d_bad: "Alarming news has emerged from Yi County in Zhili Province, where a number of Fengtian Army soldiers have blown open the entrance to several of the Western Qing Tombs. Ever since the vulgar desecration of Dowager Empress Cixi's resting place in 1928, by Zhang's indirect subordinate Sun Dianying no less, this subject has been used to damage the Grand Marshal's reputation in certain circles. With this new episode, so similar to the last, there may be no true recovery. The exact amount of wealth stolen from the tombs is unclear, but the soldiers involved disappeared into the reeds along Lake Baiyangdian, and the majority will likely make its way onto the black market soon."
 fengtian_events.273.d_good: "Alarming news has emerged from Yi County in Zhili Province, where a number of Fengtian Army soldiers had reportedly begun placing dynamite at the entrance to the Western Qing Tombs. Ever since the vulgar desecration of Dowager Empress Cixi's resting place in 1928, by Zhang's indirect subordinate Sun Dianying no less, this subject has been used to damage the Grand Marshal's reputation in certain circles. With this new episode, so similar to the last, it is fortunate that a superior officer was able to prevent any serious damage. Regardless of the soldiers' supposedly republican intentions, it is important for the sake of national legitimacy that we respect our forebears. It is from their example of a single unified and unyielding China that we draw inspiration, if not practice."
 fengtian_events.273.a: "Even monarchist history can be worth preserving!"

 fengtian_events.274.t: "Disorder at Baoding"
 fengtian_events.274.d: "Disturbing reports have begun to emerge from Baoding Military Academy, which a company of our soldiers recently captured and occupied. As a military target in which the enemy held out for over a week, damage to the building was expected, as was some degree of looting, but few expected to hear of our men killing one another over the spoils. Supposedly the institution's store of medals and rank insignia was discovered shortly after its capture, creating several self-declared colonels, majors, and generals, each belonging to a variety of self-awarded honourable orders. These men, completely ignorant of the actual standing granted by their regalia, began to fight over precedence. By the time troops arrived from elsewhere to relieve the actual commander, the upstart soldiers had split into a number of cliques occupying different parts of the academy, and several dozen were dead."
 fengtian_events.274.a: "There can only be one Grand Marshal."

 fengtian_events.275.t: "Order Returns to Zhili Province"
 fengtian_events.275.d_bad: "After a wave of spontaneous and occasionally indiscriminate looting, burning, and other criminal behaviour by our troops, order has returned to Zhili Province. By and large, the soldiers simply burned themselves out. This episode will not be regarded highly by the peasants who bore the brunt of the violence, nor by landlords, business owners, or government officials. While this will eventually blur together with the rest of the atrocities of the warlord era, it will make governing the vast areas of newly conquered territory no easier."
 fengtian_events.275.d_good: "After our troops swept across Zhili Province the majority of the population braced themselves for a wave of indiscriminate violence. But, despite a few unavoidable incidents, our troops have largely kept to the code of conduct set out by Marshal Zhang. Some stubborn figures have attributed the surprise to Fengtian's advanced system of logistics, which reduced the need for our armies to live off of the land, instead of praising Zhang himself. Still, even they cannot ignore results, and this performance will go a long way toward earning the nation's trust."
 fengtian_events.275.a: "At least it's over."

##Luoyang-Zhengzhou Events
 fengtian_events.276.t: "Railway Chaos in Zhengzhou"
 fengtian_events.276.d_bad: "Apparently, as soon as our troops seized Zhengzhou, they descended on its railway station. As the heart of the nation's railway network in wartime, and perhaps due our enemies' dogged attempts to defend it, the tracks were crowded with rolling stock - full to the brim with refugee belongings and war materiel. The subsequent orgy of looting has seen railway traffic in the area backed up for days, as every last car has been ransacked, and while we have seized a certain amount of military equipment from the cars, the majority are now wrecked and unusable. It will take a long time to clear them from the railway, and longer still for the city's former residents to forget the blatant theft of their belongings."
 fengtian_events.276.d_good: "Apparently, as soon as our troops seized Zhengzhou, they descended on its railway station. As the heart of the nation's railway network in wartime, and perhaps due our enemies' dogged attempts to defend it, the tracks were crowded with rolling stock - full to the brim with refugee belongings and war materiel. Looting began almost immediately, but fortunately some of our officers were able to limit the activity to only half of the rail cars, with the officers themselves taking only a further quarter. Consequently what might have turned into a logistical disaster, where looted rolling stock blocked the tracks for days, became a relatively orderly affair that left at least something behind for the city's residents."
 fengtian_events.276.a: "What's left?"

 fengtian_events.277.t: "Bandits against Bandits"
 fengtian_events.277.d_bad: "Our troops recently seized Luoyang alongside most of Henan Province's major cities, but securing the countryside has proven another matter. Banditry has long history in Henan, and despite nearly a decade of Zhili rule this problem never truly went away. The majority were simply incorporated into Wu Peifu's armies. Now they are sweeping across the province's rural regions, and having 'defected' to our side, are claiming the spoils of a war they never won.\n\nOur own troops, feeling cheated, are now engaging in competitive looting and destruction, occasionally escalating into localised but coordinated battles. The planned arrival of some more orderly troops to the area ought to calm tensions so that the actual bandits can be rounded up, but the damage is already done. The combined destruction is being compared to a natural disaster."

Now they are sweeping across the province's rural regions, and having 'defected' to our side, have begun claiming the spoils of a war they never won.\n\nOur own troops have stepped in to quell the violence, but thoroughly combing Henan's hills and riversides will take time and energy; neither of which our troops would prefer to spend. In all likelihood bandit activity will resume again some time in the future, and everything already stolen is now in the hands of our own troops."
 fengtian_events.277.a: "Bandits everywhere!"

 fengtian_events.278.t: "Order Returns to Henan Province"
 fengtian_events.278.d_bad: "After transportation chaos, endemic violence, and a wave of all too familiar banditry, Henan province has settled back into relative normality. Times are still hard for the average peasant, and brigands still roam the hills, but by and large our own troops have burned themselves out and settled down. Henan in particular has seen its fair share of famine, violence, and other tragedy, in which this may be little more than a historical footnote, but for the lives it touched, and certainly the lives it claimed, the events of [GetYear] will never be forgotten."
 fengtian_events.278.d_good: "After some inevitable violence, and a wave of all too familiar banditry, Henan has settled back into relative normality. The province is no stranger to tragedy, and so the relatively decent conduct of our troops throughout has turned some heads. Local business owners, landlords, and government officials appreciate our soldiers' restraint, and it's their support that will be essential to governing the province in the future."
 fengtian_events.278.a: "At least it's over."

##Wuhan Events
 fengtian_events.279.t_bad: "Destruction in Wuhan"
 fengtian_events.279.t_good: "Victory in Wuhan"
 fengtian_events.279.d_bad: "China's republican dream was born in Wuhan, and today we are its torchbearers. Sadly revolutionary ideals were far from the minds of our soldiers who, after encountering unexpected resistance in Wuchang, proceeded to run wild through the city, looting indiscriminately. By the time order was restored, the docks, wharfs, and all manner of river-side businesses were reduced to ashes, along with sizeable residential areas. What might have otherwise served as political victory became a political defeat, and a mark of shame.\n\nOn a more positive note, our troops were able to recover a stockpile of equipment from the now abandoned Hanyang Arsenal, though it is suspected that a certain number of weapons were siphoned away and onto the black market."
 fengtian_events.279.d_good: "China's republican dream was born in Wuhan, and today we are its torchbearers. Fortunately this seems to have been on the minds of our soldiers when entering the city, which survived the fighting relatively unharmed, especially as looting was limited. After fighting their way across the North China Plain, it seems our troops have begun to acknowledge the benefits of a grateful populace. Our army, consisting as it does of so many former bandits and vagabonds, may never change completely, but today's relative restraint is a step forward.\n\nTo add to the good news, our troops have recovered a stockpile of equipment from the now abandoned Hanyang Arsenal."
 fengtian_events.279.a: "Shameful"
 fengtian_events.279.b: "What a relief!"

 fengtian_events.280.t: "Disaster at the Daye Mines"
 fengtian_events.280.d: "Ore has been mined at Daye for over two thousand years, and today iron from its depths feeds the fires of modern industry in Wuhan, Hubei, and the Lower Yangtze. This did nothing to stop our soldiers, who upon hearing rumours that gold was to be found there, plundered the mine and, in their disappointment at finding nothing of the sort, collapsed its entrance - trapping over one hundred miners inside. A rescue effort has been proposed, but such expense is widely considered wasted on common labourers. Those responsible for the disaster, meanwhile, have deserted and are nowhere to be found."
 fengtian_events.280.a: "Begin rescue operations."
 fengtian_events.280.b: "Life is cheap."

 fengtian_events.281.t_bad: "Tragedy in the Mines"
 fengtian_events.281.t_good: "Miners Rescued in Daye"
 fengtian_events.281.d_bad: "By the time our men broke through to the trapped miners in Daye, all had perished. While this is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for, the fact that our men tried at all has been received well by the local community, and more importantly by national newspapers."
 fengtian_events.281.d_good: "Thanks to an old O&K steam shovel brought over from a neighbouring mine, our soldiers were able to break through in time to rescue dozens of miners. Despite their initial reservations, the men seem to feel that the heartfelt gratitude of the labourers and their families made it well worth the effort, and praise by national newspapers has offset most political fallout from the disaster itself.\n\nTo add to the positive turn of events, an assortment of weapons crates were brought up by the grateful miners, which had apparently been stashed there during the enemy's retreat not so long ago."
 fengtian_events.281.a: "What a waste."
 fengtian_events.281.b: "Wansui!"

 fengtian_events.282.t: "Remember the Experience in Ju"
 fengtian_events.282.d: "The years since the formation of our Government have laid for us a solid foundation for national regeneration. We fear no problems, nor are we concerned over impending dangers. We merely lament the fate of the South, the freedom of which was originally brought about by the hard efforts and sacrifices of reformist patriots, and which has since been erased by the old and outmoded forms of government. Today, her people are powerless, and her rulers without integrity, thus allowing the slow degradation of the national condition, and the return to a state of total subservience to Western nations. These old ways are sapping China's national strength, shaking her national foundations, and subjugating her people.\n\nIt is thus that we find ourselves in the North, as the final bastion of all that our predecessors struggled to build, and the bearers of the future of a new China. The regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] government likes to say that, by fortifying the Northeast, we are 'digging a hole to die in'. To this I say 'Forget not what happened in Ju'. It was to Ju that the State of Qi retreated, and from there that it reconquered all that it had lost. When the time is right, the Northeast will be our Ju, and the whole of China will be our Qi. Our victory is inevitable, long live the Republic!"
 fengtian_events.282.a: "Wansui!"

 fengtian_events.283.t: "The Grand Marshal's Proclamation"
 fengtian_events.283.d: "An old proverb says: 'Virtue never lacks company; it will ever find support.' The forces of justice will rise, and men of goodwill ultimately cooperate in the interests of rectitude. There is little question that the regressive and illegitimate [QIE.GetAdjective] government stands in the way of progress, oppressing and subjugating the Chinese people, and I have received every assurance that our allies will stand with us to end this injustice. On our part, we should hold fast, fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success.\n\nIt is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal. And, when this year is done, the Five Colour Flag will fly high again in Beijing, and the [QIE.GetAdjective] government will be nothing but ash in the winds of history. Ten thousand years to the Republic! Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"
 fengtian_events.283.a: "Wansui!"

 fengtian_events.285.t: "Zhang Zuolin's Gambit"
 fengtian_events.285.d: "Although Marshal Zhang agreed to sign Tokyo's Treaties of Friendship upon his return to Beijing, Japan always suspected that perhaps he was hoping to renegotiate the concessions after unification was carried out. Tokyo had hoped to keep Marshal Zhang's government paralysed from attempting renegotiation through the Pro-Japanese Front, but it seems that the Old Marshal has mustered enough political momentum within his halls of power to send our ambassador notice of his intent to renegotiate China's continued status within the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nIn exchange for maintaining the current alliance with Tokyo, Zhang wishes for the return of all concessions, the dismantling of extra-territoriality, the withdrawal of Japanese forces in China, and the de facto nationalisation of Mantetsu and other Japanese companies in China. While Japan will continue to enjoy the fruits of its economic investments, its previous privileged status will be greatly undone. Although Marshal Zhang's proposal is full of cordial language, it is clear to Tokyo that refusal will result in the Anguojun Government taking decisive action to secure their interests. Marshal Zhang's offer has infuriated many in the Japanese Government, though others recognise that war with a united China will be a costly endeavour that may not develop to Japan's favour."
 fengtian_events.285.a: "Punish this utter insolence!"
 fengtian_events.285.b: "Well played, Marshal Zhang."

 fengtian_events.286.t: "Japan Accepts Our Demands!"
 fengtian_events.286.d: "Immediately after Marshal Zhang had sent out his new offer for the new Sino-Japanese partnership, he had also mobilised the Northeast Army to prepare along the Yalu River, and his forces within China proper to watch the Japanese concessions, in the event of Tokyo's retaliation. Much to Zhang's pleasant surprise, it seems that Tokyo has capitulated to all of his demands and has begun pulling out all forces from China.\n\nVarious Japanese companies operating within China have also reached out to Beijing, following Zhang's stipulations for de-facto nationalisation. For the first time in decades, China's cities and railroads are fully its own, and the nation has finally emerged from the Century of Humiliation. Marshal Zhang and his Fengtian Clique have secured China's future and independence through the pen, and will continue leading the Middle Kingdom into a new epoch of greatness!"
 fengtian_events.286.a: "A more equal relationship, at last."

 fengtian_events.306.t: "Attacks on the South Manchuria Railway"
 fengtian_events.306.d: "Left to their own devices for over two weeks, the loyalists in Harbin launched a series of coordinated attacks along the South Manchurian Railway. Fortunately some of our commanders acted on their own initiative and, with help from Japanese Railway Zone guards, were able to limit the damage and push the outnumbered enemy back into the city.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal street-by-street fight across the city, one which the loyalists had obviously prepared for, and our casualties mounted quickly. In a final act of defiance, the enemy detonated explosives inside several factories, but by daybreak silence ruled the city - broken only by occasional gunshots marking the executions of survivors.\n\nHarbin is ours once again."
 fengtian_events.306.a: "At least they're dealt with."

 fengtian_events.307.t: "A Meeting with Merchants"
 fengtian_events.307.d: "The Fengtian Chamber of Commerce represents the interests of numerous merchants in Shenyang and across the Northeast, most of whom are responsible for the proper functioning of our economy - at least those parts of it still outside Japanese hands. Their bargaining power is considerable, and with new authorities in the capital, they are hoping for a new deal that better serves themselves.\n\nZhang Zuolin famously shot several merchants and bankers for refusing him favourable terms, but doing the same now would set a poor precedent for our new administration - one supposedly introducing order and civilisation to a war-weary China.\n\nHowever, it would set an equally bad precedent to accept terms worse than our predecessor."
 fengtian_events.307.a: "Perhaps we can grease some palms."
 fengtian_events.307.b: "Maybe Zhang had the right idea."
 fengtian_events.307.c: "Never mind for now."

 fengtian_events.308.t: "Restoring Order to Manchuria"
 fengtian_events.308.d: "Despite the death of 'Grand Marshal' Zhang Zuolin, some of his legacy yet remains. Various civilian authorities across the region have either ignored or refused the order to recognise our new administration, and some still loyal to his cause have reportedly been coalescing in Harbin - perhaps to make a last stand.\n\nFor the time being our resources will be more limited than we might prefer, and we should focus our efforts on returning control and good government to Manchuria. The last remnants of Zhang's government must be swept away."
 fengtian_events.308.a: "Onward!"

 fengtian_events.309.t: "Pressing North"
 fengtian_events.309.d: "With the threat at Harbin eliminated, our Japanese advisors have recommended that we advance north along the railway. These frigid regions of Manchuria, themselves as large as some European countries put together, were beyond even Zhang Zuolin's direct control at times and again prove troublesome.\n\nOur greatest concern, however, ought to be the Russians, who have on occasion tested our borders and notoriously covet the Chinese Eastern Railway - seized from them over a decade ago. The Japanese want the Russians checked at the Amur."
 fengtian_events.309.a: "It will be done."

 fengtian_events.310.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Requests Assistance with Bandits"
 fengtian_events.310.d: "Manchuria has long been plagued by bandits, particularly in its sparsely settled northern frontier. A certain amount of this activity is considered normal, but apparently [FNG.GetLeader] has asked for our assistance in dealing with a particularly frustrating group of bandits. The Kwantung Army has recommended deploying a contingent of its South Manchuria Railway Guard, but the Foreign Ministry feels that such a large commitment risks an unforeseen incident. Our troops have been known to shoot first and ask questions later. Others ask why we should involve ourselves in something that, after all, ought to be [FNG.GetLeader]'s responsibility."
 fengtian_events.310.a: "Deploy the Railway Guard."
 fengtian_events.310.b: "Provide weapons and reconnaissance."
 fengtian_events.310.c: "This is beneath us."

 fengtian_events.311.t: "Japan Deploys the Railway Guard!"
 fengtian_events.311.d: "When we requested Japanese help, we didn't necessarily anticipate the deployment of the Kwantung Army's South Manchurian Railway Guard, which has begun a sweeping anti-bandit operation in [GetHonghuziLocation], complete with aerial reconnaissance. This show of force is clearly upstaging our own efforts, and already many of our generals are insisting that we mount our own expedition in response.\n\nBefore being shouted down as 'cowards', a few quieter voices suggested that both forces operating in the field together could spark an unforeseen unfortunate incident."
 fengtian_events.311.a: "We won't be outplayed by the Japanese!"
 fengtian_events.311.b: "Let's not take any risks."

 fengtian_events.312.t: "The Honghuzi in [GetHonghuziLocation] Melt Away"
 fengtian_events.312.d: "Despite our best efforts, Zhang Haitian and his Honghuzi have disappeared into the Manchurian wilderness. Some reports suggest he crossed the Amur just south of Aigun, seeking refuge across the Russian border. Others believe the bandit chief himself is dead, killed by some insubordinate, leaving the once thousands-strong gang to disperse; its members once again content with routine theft and extortion. All agree, however; if the Old North Wind is alive, he'll likely return in due time."
 fengtian_events.312.a: "Then let us hope he is dead."

 fengtian_events.313.t: "The [GetFNGJAPClashTown] Incident"
 fengtian_events.313.d: "A deeply regrettable incident has occurred in the vicinity of [GetFNGJAPClashTown], in [GetHonghuziLocation] Province. Apparently mistaken for bandits, a contingent of our expedition were fired upon by the Japanese SMR Railway Guard. Hardly expecting the Honghuzi to have artillery, our men were closely encamped and subsequently blown to bits by the Japanese bombardment. Hearing the commotion from a distance, our other nearby forces broke off their anti-bandit operations, and flew into a rage when they discovered the scene of the massacre - attacking Japanese positions almost immediately.\n\nWhen order was restored, it was discovered that, amid the chaos, the Honghuzi had made a daring raid on the Japanese encampment and stolen several hundred rifles. Considering this series of disasters, both our own forces and the Japanese Railway Guard have decided to break off the search for the time-being."
 fengtian_events.313.a: "What a mess..."

 fengtian_events.314.t: "Japan Provides Weapons and Reconnaissance"
 fengtian_events.314.d: "In answer to our request for assistance with our bandit problem, the Kwantung Army has delivered a mix of weapons and other supplies to aid our efforts. Most useful of all is their offer to run a series of reconnaissance flights over [GetHonghuziLocation], as their aerial optics are far in advance of our own. This should substantially boost the chances of our expedition's success."
 fengtian_events.314.a: "Great news!"

 fengtian_events.315.t: "Japan Refuses Involvement"
 fengtian_events.315.d: "The Japanese have refused any involvement in our anti-bandit operations, considering the matter 'beneath them'. Should we proceed anyway?"
 fengtian_events.315.a: "Call it off."
 fengtian_events.315.b: "We'll do it ourselves."

 fengtian_events.316.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Requests Assistance Again"
 fengtian_events.316.d: "We have been asked, once again, to assist the Fengtian Government in its struggle to deal with what ought to be a routine matter; the pacification of China's seemingly endemic bandits. It seems that the group giving [FNG.GetLeader] an unusual amount of trouble is led by one 'Lao Beifeng', or 'Old North Wind', who has proven difficult in the past and is now raiding [GetHonghuziLocation].\n\nShould we commit ourselves to this venture?"
 fengtian_events.316.d_clash: "We have been asked, once again, to assist the Fengtian Government in its struggle to deal with what ought to be a routine matter; the pacification of China's seemingly endemic bandits. It seems that the group giving [FNG.GetLeader] an unusual amount of trouble is led by one 'Lao Beifeng', or 'Old North Wind', who has proven difficult in the past and is now raiding [GetHonghuziLocation].\n\nGiven the Railway Guard's last disastrous deployment, we have been urged to consider other less overt options."
 fengtian_events.316.a: "Deploy the Railway Guard."
 fengtian_events.316.b: "Provide weapons and reconnaissance."
 fengtian_events.316.c: "We are not at [FNG.GetLeader]'s beck and call."

 fengtian_events.317.t: "Bandits Crushed by the Railway Guard!"
 fengtian_events.317.d: "The Kwantung Army has announced the successful conclusion of an anti-bandit operation in the vicinity of [GetFNGJAPClashTown] in [GetHonghuziLocation] Province. Though we must take the Japanese at their word, there is every reason to believe that the threat posed by this unusually bold and aggressive band of Honghuzi has ended. It is unfortunate that the Japanese will be able to claim most, if not all, of the credit for the operation. At least any risk of a clash between our own forces and theirs has been successfully avoided, and we can be reasonably certain of no future attacks."
 fengtian_events.317.d_jap: "The Kwantung Army has announced the successful conclusion of an anti-bandit operation in [GetHonghuziLocation] Province, Manchuria. We have rendered the aid requested by [FNG.GetLeader], and shown the necessity of our continued presence in the region. Truly, the Japanese soldier must now represent peace and order in a troubled land!"
 fengtian_events.317.a: "Thus to all bandits!"
 fengtian_events.317.b: "Thus to all bandits!"

 fengtian_events.318.t: "A Regrettable Incident"
 fengtian_events.318.d: "An unfortunate incident has occurred near [GetFNGJAPClashTown], in [GetHonghuziLocation], Manchuria. It seems the SMR Railway Guard we deployed mistook Fengtian Government forces for bandits and opened fire with artillery, leading to heavy casualties. Our soldiers were then attacked by [FNG.GetLeader]'s men, causing further unnecessary destruction, all while actual bandits raided our forward operating camp and stole several hundred weapons.\n\nThe Railway Guard cannot be blamed for this disaster, given that [FNG.GetLeader]'s Chinese rabble is indistinguishable from bandits, and the Kwantung Army has already offered an apology for their interference in our operation. For now, it is at an end."
 fengtian_events.318.a: "What a mess..."

 fengtian_events.319.t: "The Honghuzi Disappear"
 fengtian_events.319.d: "Despite everyone's best efforts, the Honghuzi plaguing [FNG.GetNameDef] have apparently disappeared into the Manchurian wilderness. Some reports suggest they crossed the Amur just south of Aigun, seeking refuge across the Russian border. Others believe the leading bandit chief is dead, killed by some insubordinate, leaving the once thousands-strong gang to disperse; its members once again content with routine theft and extortion.\n\nFor the time-being our interests in Manchuria are again safe from this particular breed of marauding bandit."
 fengtian_events.319.a: "Good news."

 fengtian_events.320.t: "Success in Manchuria"
 fengtian_events.320.d: "Reports from Manchuria indicate that [FNG.GetName] forces finally located and eliminated the bandits causing them so much trouble. The region should now be a safer place to do business."
 fengtian_events.320.a: "Good news."

 fengtian_events.321.t: "An End to the Protests"
 fengtian_events.321.d: "In recent days, the Kwantung Army, or perhaps some bureaucrat in Tokyo, decided that the continued protests across Manchuria ran contrary to Japanese national interests. This morning, squads of Japanese soldiers deployed to neighbourhoods across Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, and Jilin.\n\nThe firing began around noon and continued well into the evening. Those who attempted to interfere, including some of our own soldiers and police, were summarily executed, and the bodies, of all shapes and sizes, were left scattered throughout the cities' streets.\n\nMost of our men stood aside as ordered, and the Japanese authorities seem pleased. The message could not have been more clear."
 fengtian_events.321.a: "They were only doing their jobs."

 fengtian_events.322.t: "Jubilation over the return of the Legation Cities"
 fengtian_events.322.d: "With the return of Shanghai and the other former 'Legation Cities' to our rightful rule, the people of China have [FNG.GetLeader] to thank. The news has already spread far and wide, greatly improving our legitimacy."
 fengtian_events.322.a: "A glorious day for China!"

 fengtian_events.323.t: "The Five Colour Flag flies in Qingdao!"
 fengtian_events.323.d: "For the first time this century Qingdao lies solidly in Chinese hands, thanks to our strenuous patriotic efforts. The people of China have much to celebrate!"
 fengtian_events.323.a: "Wansui!"

 fengtian_events.324.t: "Macau is returned to China!"
 fengtian_events.324.d: "For the first time in nearly five centuries Macau has been returned to China! Celebrations are in order, and our legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people can only grow!"
 fengtian_events.324.a: "At last!"

 fengtian_events.330.t: "Involve Japan in the Reclamation War?"
 fengtian_events.330.d: "Despite [FNG.GetLeader]'s many promises to march past the Great Wall and begin a war of National Reclamation, much time has passed with little to no change in our situation. The ancient city of Beijing lies mere miles from our borders, yet with each passing day, the possibility that we may ever set foot there grows more and more distant, fading as our enemies grow stronger. Though Zhang has insisted that he is simply waiting for the right time to strike, many fear that such a time will never come, and have urged the man to play his ultimate trump card - the Empire of Japan.\n\nEven if the Japanese do not fully trust us, and we do not fully trust them, the prospect of a [608.Owner.GetAdjective] dominated China for the foreseeable future is a difficult one to swallow for the both us. Members of the Shikan Clique have encouraged [FNG.GetLeader] to secretly contact Japan to ask them that they join the National Reclamation War on our side - we may not be able to defeat [608.Owner.GetNameDef] alone, but they would sure fall before the might of a combined Fengtian-Japanese army. Of course, this proposition comes with the risk of destroying our legitimacy to the people, but we may not have a choice...."
 fengtian_events.330.a: "We have no choice - contact Japan"
 fengtian_events.330.b: "This is a Chinese affair!"

 fengtian_events.331.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Asks Us to Join Their War"
 fengtian_events.331.d: "Forced into Manchuria in the aftermath of the Shanghai Conference, [FNG.GetLeader] has long planned to march south of the Great Wall and reclaim China, yet it seems his plans have run into obstacle after obstacle - most recently, the growing strength of [608.Owner.GetNameDef]. Now, with his enemies growing stronger by the day, Zhang has reached out to us to gain our involvement in a war against [608.Owner.GetNameDef]. Even if [FNG.GetNameDef] lacks the strength to defeat the [608.Owner.GetAdjective] by themselves, they would surely be crushed by our forces combined.\n\nThe Army and Foreign Ministry have, in a rare moment of unity, both urged our government to accept Zhang's proposal. The warlord's ambitions have caused countless issues for Japanese governments in the past, and the long-term prospect of a [608.Owner.GetAdjective] dominated China bodes ill for our interests. If we could bring [FNG.GetLeader] to fight along our side, we would be solving both issues in one fell stroke. Many, however, have also been highly critical of our chances in such a war. We may simply be signing a suicide pact by agreeing to this proposal."
 fengtian_events.331.a: "We will fight together"
 fengtian_events.331.b: "Gomenasorry..."

 fengtian_events.332.t: "Japan Agrees To Join Our War"
 fengtian_events.332.d: "The Empire of Japan has agreed to join the war when it begins on our side. There is no turning back now..."
 fengtian_events.332.a: "Excellent..."

 fengtian_events.333.t: "Japan Refuses To Join Our War!"
 fengtian_events.333.d: "The Empire of Japan has refused to join our war when it begins! They have instead urged us continue to wait for the 'right moment' and simply reassured us of our safety in Manchuria. It seems we will have to do this without them... one day."
 fengtian_events.333.a: "We'll reclaim China without them!"

 fengtian_events.334.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Goes To War"
 fengtian_events.334.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has begun his war of National Reclamation against [608.Owner.GetNameDef]. We had promised him that we would fight along his side when the day came - the time has come to honour that commitment."
 fengtian_events.334.a: "To arms!"

 fengtian_events.501.t: "A letter from Yu Xuezhong"
 fengtian_events.501.d: "Today, the Grand Marshal received a letter with a pleading and humble request from an ex-enemy general, asking for a military position in the Fengtian army so that he may sustain his living. Contemporarily speaking, the Marshal would not have even bothered to read such a letter, but the signature peaked his attention with great interest, as it reminded the Grand Marshal of his early ages. Having unsealed it with great care on his desk.\n\nThis letter is from Yu Xuezhong, a former Zhili general known for being an outstanding defensive commander, who returned to his hometown Penglai as a jobless man; what matters to the Grand Marshal is that he is the son of Yu Wenfu who recruited and promoted Zhang Zuolin in the Yi Army in 1894. This paved the way for Zhang to move through the hierarchy as a strong man from the Northeast, and to a certain extent, it can be said that without Yu, the Grand Marshal may have remained a poor and unknown ordinary man in this chaotic era. After looking back to his past quietly and recalling his early life in his residence alone amidst the night, the Grand Marshal decided to pay this debt of gratitude whilst recruiting an able commander, he wrote..."
 fengtian_events.501.a: "\"Your service is more than appreciated, please send my regards to your father...\""
 fengtian_events.501.b: "\"I can give you some money as my gratitude but I can't offer more.\""

 fengtian_events.502.t: "The [FNG_zhifeng_war_name]"
 fengtian_events.502.d: "Tensions in China have remained high since 1927, when the German intervention brought the twenty-year conflict between the various factions to a temporary stand-still. Over the last decade, however, both the Fengtian government in Manchuria and the [608.Owner.GetAdjective] in Beijing have consolidated and built their forces. The stage is set for the most dramatic confrontation in over ten years.\n\nWhichever side emerges victorious, however, will not be alone. Japan and Germany still loom large over the region, as the Land of the Rising Sun greedily eyes Germany's possessions in the Pacific, and the victor of this war will no doubt have a part to play in that conflict as well."
 fengtian_events.502.a: "The battle begins."

### FNG Political Events ###
 fengtian_political_events.15.t: "Encryption Codes Leaked!"
 fengtian_political_events.15.d_Wang: "Although our encryption is by no means as advanced as that in the West, or even Japan, it still helps ensure vital information doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, Wang Yintai seems to have mislaid his copy of our codebook while staying at the Palace Hotel in Shanghai. Subsequently, much of our intelligence network and all of our encrypted communications are now compromised. While a new system could be implemented in short enough order in some countries, backward governance and the Northeast's sheer size means that doing so could take over two months.\n\nIf we're lucky the code book will go undiscovered for that span of time, but that seems unlikely."
 fengtian_political_events.15.d_Tang: "Although our encryption is by no means as advanced as that in the West, or even Japan, it still helps ensure vital information doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, general Tang Yulin seems to have lost his copy of our codebook during a lavish party in his estate in Chengde. Subsequently, much of our intelligence network and all of our encrypted communications are now compromised. While a new system could be implemented in short enough order in some countries, backward governance and the Northeast's sheer size means that doing so could take weeks.\n\nIf we're lucky the code book will go undiscovered for that span of time, but that seems unlikely."
 fengtian_political_events.15.d_Ruan: "Although our encryption is by no means as advanced as that in the West, or even Japan, it still helps ensure vital information doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, Ruan Zhenduo seems to have lost his copy of our codebook while conducting diplomatic business in Tokyo. Subsequently, much of our intelligence network and all of our encrypted communications are now compromised. While a new system could be implemented in short enough order in some countries, backward governance and the Northeast's sheer size means that doing so could weeks.\n\nAlso, due to Ruan's political leanings, there have already been accusations that this 'accidental' incident was in fact entirely deliberate. While there is no proof one way or the other, it seems likely that Japan will not take kindly to Ruan's treatment, should we choose to remove him."
 fengtian_political_events.15.a: "Such is fate..."
 fengtian_political_events.15.b: "Remove him from office!"

 fengtian_political_events.16.t: "Expel the Japanese Bandits!"
 fengtian_political_events.16.d: "The time has come to declare our independence, drive the Japanese intruders from China, and end a century of unbearable national humiliation! We will naturally be deprived of foreign material support, but the Chinese people now rally behind us. Onward! Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"
 fengtian_political_events.16.a: "Wansui!"

 fengtian_political_events.18.t: "Mantetsu Influence"
 fengtian_political_events.18.d: "Mantetsu's economic influence spreads across the country and through the assembly. While the government is, for now, committed to privately resisting, their efforts seem to grow weaker by the day."
 fengtian_political_events.18.a: "A necessary evil?"

 fengtian_political_events.19.t: "Pervasive Mantetsu Influence"
 fengtian_political_events.19.d: "Our factories rumble with activity, churning out weapons, supplies, and every-day conveniences at an astounding rate. None of this would be possible without Japan, but whispers of discontent abound. Who are we fighting for, China or Japan? Is the Republic really being strengthened, or instead brought to its knees by foreign exploitation? Is this truly necessary?"
 fengtian_political_events.19.a: "How much further can this go?"

 fengtian_political_events.20.t: "Mantetsu Dominance"
 fengtian_political_events.20.d: "Japanese expertise and Mantetsu's influence propels Fengtian forward in ways previously thought impossible, but for all intents and purposes most meaningful control has passed from the hands of the Assembly to Japan. [FNG.GetLeader], for better or worse, stands alone before Mantetsu's overwhelming power in the country. It will be up to him to determine the path forward, if there is even one to be found, even as the legitimacy of the government collapses about him."
 fengtian_political_events.20.a: "These are dire times."

 fengtian_political_events.21.t: "Disastrous Governance"
 fengtian_political_events.21.d: "With the power of other factions receding, the Recovery League has found itself in an unprecedented position of strength. However, the League is a far cry from the political party it is often believed to be, lacking functional leadership and clear direction at its higher levels; its lower levels falling prey to various special interests and personal squabbles. The result is a government unable to govern, and while the Grand Marshal is able to use his extensive powers to ensure continued order, this and the League's unscrupulous actions tear at the government's already thin veil of legitimacy.\n\nThe balance must be restored if the country is to prosper."
 fengtian_political_events.21.a: "Things are spiralling out of control..."

 fengtian_political_events.23.t: "Zhang Clique Dominance"
 fengtian_political_events.23.d: "With the power of Zhang's loyalists and immediate subordinates reaching levels unseen since the establishment of the Fengtian Government, its other political factions have begun to turn to unconventional means to stave off a total dictatorship.\n\nAt the Communication's Clique's behest, trains have stopped running on time and telegraph messages disappear, while the Japanese have stepped up both political and economic pressure to aid the Concordia Association. Even the Recovery League, usually considered politically impotent, has staged protests, rallied by a cause célèbre.\n\nThe situation is worsened by the Zhang Clique's now frequent abuses of power and attempts to retaliate through force. Though he has more power than ever before, the Grand Marshal must surely rein in his followers for the greater good of the nation."
 fengtian_political_events.23.a: "Things are spiralling out of control..."

 fengtian_political_events.25.t: "Plutocratic Exploitation"
 fengtian_political_events.25.d: "Though few might have predicted it years earlier, the Communications Clique finds itself as the most powerful faction in government, though this dominance conceals a power structure built upon nothing more than a controlling interest in infrastructure and abundant capital. Thus, Liang and his party lack a broad base of support or the means to render this absence irrelevant. Already the other factions push back as the Clique abuses its power; reaching for further control but sabotaging the national interest in the process.\n\nThis unbalanced situation cannot last forever."
 fengtian_political_events.25.a: "Things are spiralling out of control..."

 fengtian_political_events.28.t.minor: "Anti-Japanese Protests"
 fengtian_political_events.28.d.minor: "Angered by Japan's increasing control over our country, protests have broken out in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun. Police and military units are already on site, containing the protests, but the damage is already done."
 fengtian_political_events.28.t.major: "Major Anti-Japanese Protests"
 fengtian_political_events.28.d.major: "Angered by the overwhelming control over our country by Japan and Mantetsu, protests have broken out across the country. Police and military units are already on site, but they seem unwilling to truly press the crowds. While the protests ought to die down in a few days, they seem unlikely to end unless major changes occur."
 fengtian_political_events.28.a: "Unfortunate."

 fengtian_political_events.29.t: "Creeping Mantetsu Influence"
 fengtian_political_events.29.d: "As it has done for years, Mantetsu continues its slow but sure efforts to dominate our economy, investing in businesses, buying others up, and diversifying across the industrial sector.\n\nGiven enough time, it seems as if the whole country might be swallowed up, unless a final and decisive break is made with Japan."
 fengtian_political_events.29.a: "This must be resisted."

 fengtian_political_events.30.t: "The Generals Grow Restless"
 fengtian_political_events.30.d: "Worried by their diminishing influence in the Assembly, and throughout the government, powerful members among the Zhang Clique have begun voicing their discontent, claiming that if they so desired, the entire assembly could be dissolved in minutes by force of arms. These statements have been reinforced by a slow but steady increase in the capital's garrison, which would almost certainly overwhelmingly side with their patron generals in the event of any political upheaval."
 fengtian_political_events.30.a: "Worrying..."

 fengtian_political_events.31.t: "Railway and Telegraph Mysteries"
 fengtian_political_events.31.d: "Ministers and other government officials have strangely found themselves immensely inconvenienced as of late, with telegrams going missing or relayed to the wrong people, secrets uttered only over the telephone suddenly becoming public, and trains mysteriously arriving chronically late. Of course, many are well aware that this is merely the Communications Clique showing its discontent with its recent diminishing influence, and it seems likely that these measures it has taken will reinforce its necessity to the government's effective functioning."
 fengtian_political_events.31.a: "Such is politics."

 fengtian_political_events.32.t: "Communications Clique Leads Railroad Strikes"
 fengtian_political_events.32.d: "The Communications Clique, with its widespread influence in Chinese-owned Manchurian railroads like the CER, has resorted to encouraging union activity and strikes to compensate for its recent losses of influence in government. The Clique will likely only go so far, for risk of creating something it cannot control, but their methods have already been fairly successful in demonstrating their political and economic clout."
 fengtian_political_events.32.a: "Troubling."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.1.t: "The Shenyang Conference"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.1.d1: "As it stands, [QIE.GetNameDef] presents the most powerful obstacle against our ambitions for China and Asia as a whole. Although we have the means to defeat them alone, it would certainly be a daunting and costly task. Worse yet, we run a significant risk of being seen as Japan's crony if we go at it alone, allowing [QIE.GetLeader] to rally the other warlords against us. We must not allow this to happen.\n\nIn order to show to our friends in Asia that we're a legitimate power when we stand up to [QIE.GetNameDef], we have organised a conference to be held in Shenyang where we'll form a coalition against them. Not only will this strengthen our position, but it will also prove our legitimacy to the world."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.1.d2: "We have been forced to already commence our Reclamation War against [QIE.GetNameDef], even though not all of our allies may have been ready. However, some may yet be swayed to our side during this conflict. We must reach out to the Anqing Clique to the south, which has just come out victorious against the League and hope to immediately get them to join our side. We cannot afford the resources now to aid them in reconstruction, as we are already occupied with the war."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.1.a: "Send the invitations."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.2.t: "Invited to the Shenyang Conference"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.2.ddef: "Today we formally received an invitation to the Shenyang Conference hosted by [From.GetNameDef]. Its goal is to allow us to improve our coordination in future conflicts and create a broader cooperation between [From.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] and the other powers across China. As we have nothing to lose by accepting their friendly invitation and participating in the conference, we will accept and attend."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.2.danq: "We have received an invitation to the Shenyang Conference hosted by [From.GetNameDef]. They hope to discuss important issues related to us joining their Reclamation War against [QIE.GetNameDef], which has already begun. As they aided us in our conflict to reunite the Five Provinces, we should hear them out. They have also let us know they currently cannot spare any resources to aid us in our reconstruction, as they are fully occupied with the war."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.2.a: "Send a delegation."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees to the Conference"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.3.d: "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our invitation and they have agreed to attend the Conference. We can expect their delegation to arrive soon."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.3.d1: "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our invitation and they have agreed to attend the Conference. We can expect their delegation to arrive soon. However, we must note that their current loyalties lie with [ANQ.GetLeader] as Anqing took Shandong in the League War and turned them into a puppet. They have promised the province to us once the war begins, however."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.3.a: "Excellent."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.4.t: "Negotiations with the Federalists?"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.4.d.no_allies: "Our current diplomatic position leaves much to be desired. Besides Japan, we have no natural allies in the region that would be able to cooperate with us against [QIE.GetNameDef]. This leaves us with the unorthodox but still present possibility of approaching the Federalists to support us. While they are anything but insignificant, we certainly have our fair share of ideological differences. Be that as it may - if we can bridge them, they could become a potent ally in the conflict ahead."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.4.d.conference: "While we have gained ground with our recent diplomatic efforts, the question of whether or not to engage the Federalists has been raised by some of our advisors. While we have our fair share of ideological differences, they argue that our growing strength and influence should allow us to overcome this hurdle and add another ally to our ranks. Thanks to our other successes however, we could always decline to do so and spare ourselves from their inevitable demands."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.4.a: "Let's try to find common ground."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.4.b: "Don't bother."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.5.t: "An Offer from [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.5.d.no_allies: "Today we received a message from [FROM.GetNameDef] stating their wish to discuss possible cooperation against [QIE.GetNameDef]. While we don't see eye to eye on a lot of issues, we can perhaps attribute their more welcoming tone to the broader isolation that they're experiencing. Given their lack of allies in the region, attending would allow us to encourage them to agree to sorely needed reforms in exchange for our helping hand. How should we reply?"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.5.d.conference: "In a rather surprising development, [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] has invited us to attend their conference in Shenyang. Their goal is to create a broad coalition against [QIE.GetNameDef]. So far, they seem to have had some success in bringing the other warlords on board. Perhaps if we attended, we could get them to agree to undertake some sorely needed reforms. How should we respond to their invitation?"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.5.a: "Very well, let's go to Shenyang."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.5.b: "We don't trust them."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.6.t.accepted: "[From.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Agrees to the Conference"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.6.d.accepted: "Good news! [From.GetLeader] has replied to our invitation to attend the Shenyang Conference. He has agreed to attend the conference and we should expect a Federalist delegation to arrive in short order."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.6.a: "Excellent."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.6.t.refused: "[From.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Refuses our Offer"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.6.d.refused: "Perhaps unsurprisingly, [From.GetLeader] has refused our olive branch. In the letter he sent in reply to our invitation, he cited the Japanese influence as the primary reason, claiming that he doubted our ability to speak for ourselves rather than simply doing Tokyo's bidding."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.6.b: "Their loss."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.7.t: "Start of the Shenyang Conference"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.7.d: "Delegates have arrived in Shenyang to discuss [From.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]'s initiative against the regime. A brief opening ceremony was held, culminating in an introductory speech by Zhang Zuolin. Everyone's in good spirits, though no one doubts the diplomatic challenges that lie ahead."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.7.a: "Let's begin."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.8.t: "Heated Discussions"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.8.d: "Everyone knew that [ANQ.GetLeader] and [SHD.GetLeader] would have a hard time cooperating given their mutual dislike. Unfortunately, they've allowed their private disagreements to become a public dispute, which has now disrupted the talks. Zhang Zongchang in particular has caused a scene as his mannerisms and blatant disrespect for authority are enough to make even the most hardened warlord raise an eyebrow. We can only hope that this won't set a trend as the conference goes on."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.8.a: "Cut it out, both of you!"

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.9.t: "Federalists Press for Reforms"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.9.d: "As expected from the Federalists, [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] has been attempting to pressure Zhang Zuolin to adopt reforms. The aim of these would be the gradual liberalisation of [From.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] and ideally - for him - that these reforms at the head would trickle down to influence the other warlords as well. It's clear that the Federalists aren't prepared to support Zhang without getting something in return."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.9.a: "Make vague promises."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.10.t: "The Anti-Concessionist Question"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.10.d.ANQ: "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to make any definitive pledges on the matter so far, but that hasn't made the issue go away. It's evident that this won't last long if the conference is to move forward."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.10.d.GXC: "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. They've been supported in this endeavour by the Federalists, who are equally defiant against the Concessions albeit from a more liberal position. While Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to state an official position on the matter so far, he's likely to be forced to do so soon. As the influence that the two Chens wield is gaining momentum, this issue isn't likely to go away."

With broad support for their positions, Zhang Zuolin's undeclared position is becoming more and more untenable by the hour."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.12.d: "After drinking Sake by what we can only assume to be the barrel-load, [SHD.GetLeader] has created a scene today as he slurred and yelled his way through a drunken tirade. What little could be understood of his ravings were nothing short of a love letter to Japan with only his love for Japanese booze and women being comprehended by the hostage audience, if only through repetition. Most of Zhang's incomprehensible ravings were, for better or for worse, impossible to understand, which may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\nAfter creating a spectacular scene, he got up on his chair and put one boot down on the table. Before he could be made to sit down again, he declared a toast to Japan, with the rest of his speech sounded more like a man struggling to hold back vomit than actual words. To say that this has created a negative atmosphere among the conference attendants would be the understatement of the decade."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.13.t: "Yang Yuting Urges Caution"
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.13.d: "With Anti-Concessionist sentiments rising, Yang Yuting has come forward to urge the Old Marshal to be cautious with regards to the stance on the Concessions. Because of Japan's strong interests in them, particularly through its China Agency in the Legation Cities, they stand to lose greatly if we went ahead and declared ourselves to be against the Concessions. Because of our healthy and mutually beneficial cooperation, alienating them would be seen by Tokyo as not merely an insult, but naked aggression against them.\n\nWhile hardly unexpected, Yuting's actions prove that Japan is worried about our eventual decision. If nothing else, it's a reminder that they will not sit idly by if we join the Anti-Concessionist movement."
 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.13.a: "A fair warning."

 fengtian_shenyang_conference_events.14.t: "The Point of Decision"

There's absolutely no way we can side with [From.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] under these circumstances. While we'd hoped that he'd see reason, we can't say we're surprised either.

#Beijing Conference

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.000.t: "The Beijing Conference"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.000.d: "China, long divided, may finally find a respite from the chaos. The Five-Coloured Flag of the Chinese Republic now flies proudly over Zhengyang gate as [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s troops hold garrisons and posts throughout the country. With several major urban centers fully occupied and liberated, prospects of national unification grow ever so strong.\n\nDespite their victory, the Fengtian Clique has a massive hurdle to cross with the burdens of unification. Fengtian's economy, once one of China's greatest industrial centres, now faces hyperinflation with the sudden influx of inheriting the former national economy. With currency completely non-standard and markets utterly collapsing, the newly unified republic suffers from the possibility of a total economic depression. Furthermore, the ever-growing military of the Fengtian Clique also suffers from disarray, due to its overextended troops, undisciplined looting, and deserters. The military leadership have attempted to install discipline within the ranks but it's clear that the overextended and burdensome military will need to be addressed.\n\nZhang Zuolin, the Old Marshal, plans to use this moment of victory by hosting a National Reunification Conference in Beijing. This conference aims to bolster the Clique and Zhang's legitimacy as the true inheritor of the Republic of China. It's expected that politicians, intellectuals, industrialists, and generals from both the Fengtian Clique and China nationally will be in attendance to witness the momentous event.\n\nThe Japanese government has also been present in witnessing the unification of China unfold. Newspapers and pamphlets throughout Japan applaud Zhang's unification in driving out Western influence from Asia and achieving China's liberation from imperialism. In particular, Japan's prestigious Tianjin Army has been praised for their speed, discipline, and efficiency in assisting Marshal Zhang's advance throughout the country."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.000.a: "The Road to Unification lies in front of us."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.001.t: "Zhang Calls Conference in Beijing"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.001.d: "Once exiled and isolated from Beijing's halls of power, the Fengtian Clique has made a rapid turnabout with Japanese support. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin stands triumphant, having overrun most of his foes and is rapidly being recognised internationally as China's legal government.\n\nThe ascension of the National Pacification Army (the Anguojun) has worried many, who fear the rapid expansion of Japanese influence across China. As Zhang's foes begin to band together against Japan, within the Fengtian Clique divisions have emerged about their erstwhile \"patrons.\" Amid a changing political situation and the challenges of economic reconstruction, the Grand Marshal has called a conference to resolve lingering tensions."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.001.a: "The final enemy of the nation remains..."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.001.b: "Let us see if Marshal Zhang will play ball."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.001.c: "Will the Dragon remain shackled or fly free?"

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.002.t: "Japan Divides the Conference"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.002.d: "Although Marshal Zhang called the Beijing Conference to discuss matters regarding national unification, it seems that much of the discussion has devolved into debates around Japan and the fate of the new Anguojun government. It is no secret that Sino-Japanese ties have proven to be a double edged sword for previous Chinese administrations, having resulted in the toppling of the Anfu Government. Zhang too was forced to rely extensively on Tokyo's aid to maintain his ailing government, his reputation too was marred and members of the Anguojun Conference have rightfully voiced concerns.\n\nThe Marshal's Zhang Clique inner circle are somewhat hesitant to maintain such close Japanese ties, with Zhang Xueliang's young guard being particularly hostile. Meanwhile, the Recovery League has split over the issue, with members like Wang Yitang calling for maintaining close ties to Tokyo, while Wu Jinglian and his supporters advise the Grand Marshal to distance himself from the Rising Sun.\n\nThe New Communications Clique is unsurprisingly also advising Marshal Zhang to maintain his ties to Tokyo on the grounds of economic recovery and development. Yang and the Shikan Clique have been somewhat split, with Chang Yinhuai's nationalist faction declaring that they've learned enough from Tokyo to go their own way, while Yang has been more passively pro-Tokyo in his stance.\n\nThe Concordia Association has been the most vocal about maintaining Japanese ties, declaring their support for the Pan-Asian project to topple European Imperialism and China's role in the New Asian Order. The New People's Society has also made a presence in the conference, funded by the Tianjin Army in hopes of challenging the Concordia Association and their Kwantung overlords. They too call for maintaining ties with Tokyo, but urge the conference to redirect its focus to unification. With so many voices declaring different concerns, Marshal Zhang recognises that his choice will be controversial no matter what."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.002.a: "For the good of the nation, we must maintain our ties to Tokyo."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.002.b: "The nation must be free, both from Germany and Japan!"

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.003.t: "The Remnants of Beiyang"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.003.d: "The Beiyang Government was once a Northern Chinese government based in Beijing, held together by the united Beiyang Army. Although Yuan Shikai was able to hold the army together as its founder, his successor Duan Qirui favoured his Anhui faction above others, earning him the ire of many who coalesced into the Zhili Clique. Meanwhile in the Northeast, local Beiyang forces join with Zhang Zuolin's former bandit allies to create the Fengtian Clique.\n\nAfter the Beiyang Government was shattered by infighting, the Zhili and Fengtian Cliques remained in constant struggle, with the Zhili scooping up most of the apolitical elements and Fengtian gaining many former Anhui supporters. With the fall of the Zhili Clique as well, the Fengtian Clique has emerged as Beiyang's sole heir, leaving many old anti-japanese luminaries with a hard choice. The remaining Beiyang splinter cliques under the Zhili have been absorbed by the Fengtian factions, though such a process has not been smooth.\n\nLocal Northeast bureaucrats have been hesitant to move south, Beiyang bureaucrats are resentful of Northeasterners marching into the Northern Plains to dictate terms to them, and many Fengtian officials squabble amongst themselves for jobs. As it stands, much of the newly conquered territories will remain in states of unrest and disorder until the growth pains of the Fengtian Government subside."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.003.b: "Is this not a meritorious government?"

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.004.t: "The FCDP Rally the Opposition"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.004.d: "With the Fengtian Clique consolidating control of Northern China, old opponents of the Zhili Clique have re-emerged. The Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties, founded as the United National Construction League, was created by liberal opposition to the Zhili Government in the aftermath of the Seven Gentleman Incident where seven prominent National Salvation Federation members were arrested on charges of treason.\n\nA coalition of the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, Political Science Clique, Endeavor Society, and National Salvation Federation, they were an influential force in Northern China until the Zhili suppressed them in 1932. In the chaos of the Fengtian reconquest, the FCDP has once again emerged as a prominent force across the Northern Plains.\n\nMany of China's intellectual and politician class dislike Zhang, viewing him as a despotic brute in comparison to the learned Wu. The FCDP is an unwieldy force, but they have some institutional power as established opposition, and Marshal Zhang recognises that ignoring them would be a grave mistake.\n\nThe FCDP has taken to the streets, where they foster support amongst nationalistic students and intellectuals, denouncing any potential alliance with Japan that Zhang may consider. Northeast People's Self-Help Association too has joined with the FCDP, with the NSF in particular, in denouncing Japanese domination. This development has been of particular concern to Zhang, who has traditionally been quite popular in the Three Northeastern Provinces."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.005.t: "The Great Decision"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.005.d: "What began with the Beijing Conference has come to a head. Pro-Japanese elements in the Fengtian Clique have increased pressure on Zhang to align his government with Tokyo, while anti-Japanese factions in the government as well as street protestors have intensified their rhetoric. Rumours circulate across the nation that non-aligned warlords and rival governments to Fengtian intend on forming a United Front to fight the Fengtian Government and public perception of Zhang is falling rapidly.\n\nIt seems that Tokyo has run out of patience with Zhang's deliberations, and the Japanese ambassador is directly pressuring the Old Marshal to sign more indepth treaties with them, including formally joining the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nMarshal Zhang now finds himself facing a tough choice with two options. He could sign the treaty for joining the Co-Prosperity Sphere immediately, gambling on Japanese aid to sweep away the opposition and then negotiate for concessions later from a stronger position. The second more risky option is for him to demand the concessions as part of the agreement to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere, which would appease the nationalists but risks causing a major overreaction by the Japanese who expect to hold onto their major concessions."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.010.d: "With Fengtian victory over their rivals in Beijing, it seems that unification is finally at hand after decades of division. In order to plan the Anguojun's next move, Marshal Zhang has called a conference in Beijing involving all major warlords that recognise his government. However, it seems that the conference has rapidly devolved into debates surrounding the future relationship between China and Japan, much to Zhang's chagrin. The Zhang Clique has argued for distancing from Tokyo, while Concordia, New People's Society, and Communications Clique have pushed for maintaining ties, and the Recovery League and Shikan Clique find themselves divided over the issue. On top of factional disputes on Japanese ties, the FCDP has re-emerged as a liberal opposition force, taking to the streets to campaign against Japanese alignment and call for an end to corruption and democratisation. The Japanese have also directly demanded Zhang to sign treaties of friendship, including formal entry into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. As a major figure in the Anguojun, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s word would surely influence Marshal Zhang's decision."

It is unknown whether he is coming from an angle of genuine patriotism, or is at least appealing to it. Cynically, perhaps [FROM.GetLeader] simply fears that Japanese dominance will result in their declining influence and eventual sidelining, or maybe they fear that the rest of China will rally against the Anguojun.

[FROM.GetLeader] in particular has been very vocal in supporting further alignment with Tokyo, declaring it to be critical to the survival of the Fengtian Government. It is unknown the true reason for why he supports the Japanese Alliance. Maybe he fears Japanese invasion and views alignment to be a better fate, and perhaps rationalises that China will inevitably have more leverage in the future in such a partnership. Cynically, perhaps he has merely been bribed by the Japanese to support their interests. For whatever reasons, Marshal Zhang must consider [FROM.GetLeader]'s stance carefully."

It has become apparent that our opinion means nothing in Marshal Zhang's calculus. [FROM.GetLeader] offered his Marshal his sincere opinion in the hopes of bettering the nation, and was promptly ignored. It is clear that Marshal Zhang is nothing more than a selfish dictator who ignores his subordinates. [FROM.GetLeader] has angrily stormed out of Beijing, deliberating his next move."

The Anguojun has greatly expanded, reaching deep into the Central Plains. However, success often proves to be a double edged sword, and the rest of China has become scared into banding together against both Zhang and Tokyo. We have the leverage to pressure Zhang into formally joining the Co-Prosperity Sphere as the internationally recognised China, but the Beijing Conference has produced worrying results. Many of Zhang's inner circle oppose alignment with us, and our allies and agents on the ground have been quite counterproductive. The Concordia Association's presence south of the Great Wall has been meagre to say the least, their associates in the Kwantung Army are more furious that the Tianjin Army was able to successfully carry out their plan, and the Tianjin Army has been doing premature victory laps before their eggs hatch in establishing the New People's Society to rival the Concordia Association and be their mouthpiece, and the Shanghai Garrison has not exercised any meaningful influence in the Beijing Conference. Of the Pro-Japanese elements in the Fengtian Government, many dislike each other, and are mutually suspicious of each other. We can consider trying to bring together all these disparate elements into a single cohesive Pro-Japanese front, but such a difficult effort requires substantial investment and time."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.021.d: "It is well-known that despite shared affinity for Japan, the various Pro-Japanese factions in the Fengtian Government have typically engaged in substantial infighting. Rivals in the Recovery League often get into squabbles with the New Communications Clique, and the Concordia Association and Kwantung Army spend more time attempting to root out Tianjin Army influence than on promoting Tokyo's interests in Shenyang, and vice versa. However, recently it seems that there has been a substantial shift in Pro-Japanese circles, as they have begun to work as one cohesive chorus guided by an invisible conductor at the helm. They have all been unanimous in urging Marshal Zhang to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Such a concerted effort has concerned the Old Marshal, who has traditionally played these groups against each other in his bid to prevent anyone from getting too much influence."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.200.t: "Zhang Demands the Concessions"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.200.d: "In the Beijing Conference, it became clear that Marshal Zhang's stance towards Tokyo would be the primary topic of discussion. Various minor warlords argued for or against us, as did Zhang's many factions in Shenyang. Of the major factions not directly aligned with us, the Recovery League was mainly divided, the New Communications Clique threw their weight in favour of us despite their recent business disputes with the Concordia Association, the Zhang Clique was mostly against us, and the Shikan Clique was divided, but leaned towards us.\n\nAlongside the debates at the highest levels of government, on the street the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties organised protests of nationalistic students to rally against continued Japanese influence. With our ambassador directly pressuring him to sign treaties of friendship and formal entry into the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Zhang has finally made his move.\n\nHoping to throw his weight around to his advantage, the Old Marshal has demanded the return of Japanese concessions in China and the end of extra-territoriality. He has stressed that he hopes to enter the Co-Prosperity Sphere as in equal power to Tokyo. Although Zhang has not explicitly declared his intention to take control of Mantetsu or other Japanese interests in China, it is clear that Zhang already sees himself as the victor in China. Tokyo is faced with a choice to either accept Zhang's terms or stall for time while preparing our forces to \"protect\" vital interests."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.201.d: "Ever since Marshal Zhang's confrontation with the Japanese, it seems that Sino-Japanese tensions were escalating rapidly and an invasion of the Northeast was imminent. In the dead of night, a section of the South Manchuria Railway near Liutiao Lake was blown up by unknown actors. Tokyo declared that Chinese dissidents connected to the FCDP were involved.\n\nDenouncing Marshal Zhang as being unable to protect Japan's interests, Tokyo mobilised the Kwantung Army and its forces in Korea to cross into Chinese territory to secure its interests. Firing at our border guards, the Japanese Imperial Army crossed the Yalu River at midnight in what was essentially a declaration of war in all but name. Marshal Zhang has called the Anguojun to meet this threat to Chinese sovereignty and defend China from the Japanese invaders.\n\nRegardless of whoever set off this bomb, it seems that China and Japan are headed towards all out war. Already Japan's youth are being called upon to \"fulfil the duty of their fathers\" who fought and died in Manchuria in 1905, and there can be no illusions about the seriousness or extent of this war - for us it will soon become one of survival or annihilation."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.202.d: "Although Marshal Zhang was widely reputed to be Japan's willing partner in China, it seems that the relationship between Shenyang and Tokyo was always more fragile than previously believed. Nationalistic street protests and pressure within the Beijing Conference has persuaded Zhang to take a more assertive stance against the Japanese, much to Tokyo's fury.\n\nA week ago a bomb went off on the South Manchuria Railway. The Japanese seized the incident as a pretext to cross the Yalu River in a full invasion of China. As the two Asian titans clash, the rest of the continent holds their breath. Should China emerge victorious, the Japanese will lose an integral part of the Imperial war machine. Should Japan win, the rest of Asia will surely bow swiftly."

Today, the Japanese ambassador has met with the Old Marshal to announce that Japan has accepted China formally into the Co-Prosperity Sphere in exchange for returning all concessions. This is a great victory for the Fengtian Government, for it has not only secured a powerful partner in the East, but also done so while undoing many of the unequal treaties imposed previously, appeasing nationalist elements in the populace. Although the various rival governments in the South will rally against us, Marshal Zhang is confident that the combined efforts of Japan and Fengtian will see them defeated and Beijing ascendant."

Tokyo has agreed to hand over all concessions to Zhang's government, including the Legation Cities which have been a boon to the Japanese economy. The Shanghai Garrison has already been ordered to evacuate, and [ROOT.GetLeader] faces a difficult choice.

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.212.d: "After the Fengtian victory, fears that Zhang would continue to work closely with Japan ran amuck. Zhang's Beijing Conference to discuss peaceful unification was derailed by debate surrounding China's future relationship with Japan.\n\nHemmed by anti-Japanese protests, threats of a warlord coalition against him, and pressure from within his own government, the Old Marshal made a daring gamble. Demanding Japanese concessions in exchange for entry into the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Zhang was able to enshrine his alliance while avoiding the appearance of kowtowing to Japanese interests. Though war with the rest of China is expected, he has staved off challenges to his leadership from within."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.212.a: "A Free China in a Free Asia!"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.212.b: "It seems our worst fears have been realised."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.300.t: "Zhang Asks to Join the Sphere"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.300.d: "In the Beijing Conference, it became clear that Marshal Zhang's stance towards Tokyo would be the primary topic of discussion. Various minor warlords argued for or against us, as did Zhang's many factions in Shenyang. Of the major factions not directly aligned with us, the Recovery League was mainly divided, the New Communications Clique threw their weight in favour of us despite their recent business disputes with the Concordia Association, the Zhang Clique was mostly against us, and the Shikan Clique was divided, but leaned towards us.\n\nAlongside the debates at the highest levels of government, on the street the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties organised protests of nationalistic students to rally against continued Japanese influence. With our ambassador directly pressuring him to sign treaties of friendship and formal entry into the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Zhang has finally made his move.\n\nMuch to our approval, Zhang has agreed to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere without any stipulations. Perhaps Zhang hopes to negotiate for greater concessions after unification, where his leverage will be higher, but that will not be an issue for Tokyo. We can prevent Zhang from demanding much of anything if the Fengtian Pro-Japanese front and our agents in China work to maintain our influence in his government."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.300.a: "Zhang submits to reality."
 FNG_JAP_prevent_focus_tooltip: "§YAs long as our Influence remains high, the Fengtian Clique will be unable to take the focuses and decisions needed to demand the return of the concessions.§!"

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.301.t: "Our Entry into the Sphere"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.301.d: "With our entry into the Co-Prosperity Sphere, we can expect much more significant Japanese aid in the struggle to come. Marshal Zhang's rivals in the South have already denounced him as a traitor to the Chinese nation, and have openly called for a United Front to jointly fight off the Anguojun and Japanese. Marshal Zhang is less concerned about the United Front, instead already looking to his ambitions after unification is carried out. The Old Marshal is already scheming to retake the coastal concessions after unification is carried out against his rivals, and keep Japanese influence at a minimum, as he did a decade ago."
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.301.a: "Let's hope we win this game of chess."

 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.302.t: "The Fengtian Clique Joins the Sphere"
 fengtian_beijing_conference_events.302.d: "After the Fengtian victory, fears that Zhang would continue to work closely with Japan ran amuck. Zhang's Beijing Conference to discuss peaceful unification was derailed by debate surrounding China's future relationship with Japan. Brushing aside anti-Japanese protests, threats of a warlord coalition against him, and pressure from within his own government, the Old Marshal moved to enter the Co-Prosperity Sphere, gambling the Japanese support will help him crush any enemies he makes.\n\nIt seems that Zhang is heading on an inevitable collision course with his remaining rivals across China. The United Front are unlikely to win this war against the Japanese Goliath, but perhaps they will go down as the last stand of a Free China."

###FNG-JAP Mechanic Events

#FNG-JAP Mech Events Pt 1 (000-099) - Mission Events
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.000.t: "Our Allies in Tokyo"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.000.d: "Zhang Zuolin is proud to have survived decades of China's brutal power games, but the reality is he could not have done it alone nor would his dreams of reunifying the country be realistic if it was not for the patronage of Japan. Many of our rivals paint him as a stooge for foreign imperialists, and even more embarrassing a power that China once saw as akin to a younger brother, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\nZhang Zuolin and many other politicians sympathetic to Japan do seek cooperation with Japan and are willing to make pragmatic concessions to advance their interests, but they also often believe that once China is united they will inevitably have the leverage to renegotiate treaties as equals. Their personal motivations also vary - some are cynically hoping to preserve their own power and wealth while others sincerely buy into Japanese Pan-Asian rhetoric against European powers.\n\nWhatever the case, Japan's outsized influence adds another layer of intrigue in Fengtian Clique politics. Japan expects returns on their investments, but conceding too much to Japan has brought down entire governments in the past - a lesson the exile Anhui and Communications Clique have learned the hard way.\n\nJapan's agents on the ground often fight and compete among themselves as they execute competing agendas often without Tokyo's knowledge. Zhang has been willing to exploit the lack of strategic clarity among Japanese decision-makers, but it also means that many of the deals he makes lack permanence for both sides. Managing expectations from both sides will be integral in his quest to liberate his nation."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.000.a: "We will not be scorched by the rising sun."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.000.tt: "§RBe careful in our dealings with Japan. When we begin our war for Beijing, it will worry many of our Japanese advisors who in turn may do something drastic should the war turn against us. Similarly, if Japanese influence is too high our options for handling reunification may be limited.§!"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.001.t: "The Three Armies in China"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.001.d: "We have a long history with China, but after our victory in the Sino-Japanese War it was clear that we had eclipsed the once great power. Still, our efforts at establishing a hegemony over China have been stymied, even after the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing Warlord Era tore apart the fragile nation. In addition to surges of Chinese nationalism and also the interference of Western powers, a lack of consistent strategic clarity from Tokyo has caused our various forces on the continent to adopt their own rival agendas.\n\nWhile this strategic ambiguity does offer plausible deniability and flexibility, it has hampered the establishment of a cohesive strategy for handling Chinese affairs. The closest to the \"Official\" line taken by our government in Tokyo are the officers of the Tianjin Army. The oldest but smallest of our China garrisons, they aim to support Zhang Zuolin and the Fengtian Clique's planned War of National Reclamation, which they believe will pave the way for Japanese influence over the whole nation. This subtle, insidious strategy will allow for a Chinese leader at the helm but Japanese control behind the scenes.\n\nTheir rivals in the Kwantung Army, who protect our valuable railroad and mining concessions we won in our wars with China and Russia, oppose operations that may jeopardise those interests. They instead wish to create buffer states to protect our hard-won gains, supporting Russian adventurers in Siberia and secessionist groups in China. They have fostered the Concordia Association as a civilian front to promote our interests in Manchuria.\n\nThe last major force is the Shanghai Garrison, made up of marines and with support of the IJN. Fierce inter-service rivalries have led them to try to seek alternative collaborators in China's east and south.\n\nThe growing autonomy of these three forces are a major concern, as is the growing inevitability of conflict in China with the collapse of the League. It would appear that our fates are now intertwined."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.001.a: "We will tame the Chinese dragon."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.001.tt: "§ROur dealings with China are essential to the long-term health of our empire. When the Fengtian Clique begins their war of National Reclamation, it will present both opportunities and danger. We will likely be dragged into the conflict, but we can ensure it is on favourable terms and it will end to our advantage by supporting the Fengtian Clique and increasing our influence within it.§!"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.002.t: "Tensions in Manchuria"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.002.d: "Ever since the fall of the Anhui Clique, the Fengtian Clique and Zhili Clique have regarded each other as their principal rival. The Zhili first gained the upper hand in the First ZhiFeng war, but Fengtian nearly toppled the entire clique in 1924. However, Zhang Zuolin was ousted yet again in 1927 following Zhili victory against the KMT. For around a decade, Zhang Zuolin has sat north of the Great Wall, licking his wounds and plotting his eventual return to Beijing. It seems that this period of buildup has finally run its course, and Marshal Zhang has embarked on one final campaign to not just seize Beijing, but unify all of China.\n\nAlthough Tokyo has been allied to Marshal Zhang's government for nearly two decades, Japanese policy towards the Fengtian Clique continues to be divided and contradictory. The Tianjin Army has largely been supportive of Zhang's National Reclamation War. They hope that by aiding Marshal Zhang in his war, the Tianjin Army will be able to insert themselves as China's real rulers from behind the scenes, even perhaps eliminating their Kwantung rivals. Conversely, the Kwantung Army has long maintained their influence in Manchuria, and are very concerned of the possibility of Marshal Zhang losing the war, which would result in the loss of their own influence.\n\nEven within the Fengtian Clique, there have been those with concerns regarding the National Reclamation War's feasibility. For the moment, Zhang Zuolin has largely kept such dissident voices quiet. However Zhang Zuolin, like the pessimists in his camp, understands that this war will be an all or nothing effort - either he succeeds in establishing himself as master of all China, or he will die trying. For Japan, they largely continue to support Marshal Zhang in his war for China, but should he disappoint Tokyo with lack of progress, the Kwantung Army may be provoked into taking drastic action to secure Japan's interests."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.002.a: "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.002.tt: "§YThe die has been cast. Zhang has §Rlimited time§! before tensions boil over, which will increase or decrease based on battlefield success and decisions by Shenyang and Tokyo. Should time run out, the Kwantung Army will attempt to force the Imperial Court's hand and §Rdrag them into war on the continent§!. Should he §Gsucceed in capturing Beijing§! and at least one of Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, or Chongqing, Fengtian and Japanese relations will face a different reckoning §Rdepending on Japanese influence in his government.§!§!"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.003.t: "The Fengtian-Japanese Alliance Victorious?"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.003.d: "Although the National Reclamation War threatened to strain the Fengtian - Japanese alliance to the limit, it seems that the war has concluded with Zhang's complete victory. The Kwantung Army is no longer openly scheming to replace Marshal Zhang, and the Tianjin Army has encouraged Zhang to continue his wars of unification.\n\nOnce again, the Fengtian Clique rules in Beijing, and extends its foothold in the Central Plains. However, as Zhang continues to consolidate his authority across the rest of China, many in both Japan and China both wonder if this Sino-Japanese alliance will continue to hold.\n\nTokyo had always hoped for a more subservient partner in China than Zhang, and the Old Marshal has long viewed the Japanese with suspicion and his alliance with them as merely one of convenience. Will Japan and China both continue to maintain their ties despite mutual distrust and conflicts of interest? Or will tensions boil over and Tokyo and Beijing engage in one final war to end all wars?"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.003.a: "Can China and Japan really be long-term allies?"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.004.t_huanggutun: "The Huanggutun Incident"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.004.d_huanggutun: "With the National Reclamation War going poorly, it seems that Marshal Zhang's luck has finally run out. Although he had hoped to win the war swiftly, the situation has evolved to become anything but. Zhang's struggles in the war have vindicated the fears of the Kwantung Army, who believe that the Old Marshal may try to negotiate to save his skin, have decided to act decisively.\n\nAs Marshal Zhang was returning to Shenyang after visiting the frontline, his train was hit by a bomb planted by the Kwantung Army. Although Zhang survived for a few hours, the Old Marshal ultimately succumbed to his wounds. Acting immediately, the Kwantung Army has driven out Zhang Xueliang, leaving Fengtian in the hands of Yang Yuting who has reluctantly taken on the position of Generalissimo of the Anguojun.\n\nThe Kwantung Army has largely acted on their own without Tokyo's knowledge or consent, but are gambling on the prospect of total Japanese defeat to force Tokyo's hand. With the Fengtian Government in utter disarray, the Japanese Government will be forced to directly intervene in the National Reclamation War to save Yang's crippled government."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.004.t_manchurian: "The Manchurian Incident"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.004.d_manchurian: "With the fall of Shenyang, fears have grown among Japanese decision-makers of the possibility of the total loss of Japanese influence in Manchuria - and with it decades of investment and national pride. Zhang Zuolin's incompetent handling of the war and rumours that he is attempting to negotiate a peace behind their backs has led to Kwantung Army hardliners to make a drastic move.\n\nDetonating a small amount of dynamite near a Mantetsu-owned railway (though far away enough that it would not cause any significant damage to the track), they alleged that it was an attack by the Fengtian Clique's enemies on the ostensibly neutral Japanese garrison. Utilising that pretext, the garrison then began shelling Chinese positions - pressuring initially reluctant senior Japanese officers and later Tokyo to embrace the plan.\n\nAs the Japanese moved into position for direct intervention in the conflict, they assassinated Marshal Zhang before he could potentially denounce Japanese imperialism and switch sides. His allies have fled underground and in his place Yang Yuting has assumed control over the remaining Fengtian forces in hopes of preserving some semblance of autonomy for his men."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.004.a: "All eyes are on Marshal Yang to navigate us out of the crisis..."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.004.b: "Marshal Zhang has failed us for the last time."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.005.t: "Zhang Zuolin Assassinated"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.005.d: "Although Zhang Zuolin seemed like a loyal partner to the Empire of Japan, it seems that perhaps there was greater tension in the Fengtian-Tokyo relationship than was apparent on the surface. Dissatisfied with the progress of Zhang Zuolin's National Reclamation War, disgruntled Japanese officers carried out his assassination and installed Yang Yuting in charge of the collapsing government.\n\nYang Yuting's government is unlikely to survive without Japanese aid, while Nationalist sentiment rallies his enemies across the Chinese nation. China and Japan have been drawing towards another war for Asia's future, and it seems that this one will be far more destructive and devastating than the first."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.005.a: "Surely we are safe from Marshal Zhang's fate, right?"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.005.b: "It seems that Zhang's time simply ran out."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.005.c: "Japan has disgraced itself in the eyes of the world."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.006.t: "From Traitor to Top Dog?"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.006.d: "Grand Marshal Yang Yuting toured the ruined city of Beijing, one of [FNG.GetNameDef]'s recent conquests as its military began to turn the tide against their foes. He was met with a stony reception by its local citizens, the intelligentsia, and the newly restored national assembly as he reasserted his claim to leadership over the republic. Though many of the soldiers and officers are the same as Zhang Zuolin's old National Pacification Army, perceptions have drastically worsened - a great feat given how controversial Zhang when he dominated the north.\n\nMany still refuse to forgive the Shikan Clique for their part in allowing Japan to tighten its grip on the continent, even if General Yang justifies it as part of the national fight imperialism and socialism in public, and in private claims it a necessary evil to prevent the total dominantion of the Kwantung Army in the aftermath of Zhang's death. Regardless, [FNG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is resurgent and their influence stretches far beyond Beijing. But with that will come many more challenges as they fight to unite the country under their banner."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.006.a: "China's savior or its sellout?"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.030.t: "Japan Enters the Fray"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.030.d: "The start of the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japan's direct participation in the war on the continent has placed [FNG.GetNameDef] in an awkward spot. Most of China has banded together against the Japanese threat and though we have not endorsed Japan's war we have quickly been branded as Hanjian and collaborators. Many of our own officers and officials have begun to waver as word of Japanese atrocities and fears of their ambitions spread.\n\nWithin the ranks of our erstwhile \"allies\", agitation has grown. The Kwantung Army craves battlefield glory and the Tianjin Army demands further coordination with Tokyo. They have pressed [FNG.GetLeader] to formally join the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Doing so would be the sensible choice, but should we lose (and possibly even if we win) we may be damned as traitors forever."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.030.a: "At least this way we ensure China will have a voice in the sphere."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.030.b: "Please, we just need some more time to sort out our affairs…"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.031.t: "Japan Enters the Continent"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.031.d: "The start of the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japan's direct participation in the war on the continent has placed [FNG.GetNameDef] in an awkward spot. Most of China has banded together against the Japanese threat and though we have not endorsed Japan's war we have quickly been branded as Hanjian and collaborators. Many of our own officers and officials have begun to waver as word of Japanese atrocities and fears of their ambitions spread.\n\nJapan's decision has blindsided [FNG.GetLeader]. The Fengtian Clique's army has yet to complete their preparations for war but Japanese entry has forced their hand. They have little choice but to join the Co-Prosperity Sphere, shrugging off accusations of treason, and hope to race the Imperial Japanese Army to secure major cities."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.031.a: "It seems our time has simply run out."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.032.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Sphere"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.032.d: "The start of the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japan's direct participation in the war on the continent has placed [FNG.GetNameDef] in an awkward spot. Most of China has banded together against the Japanese threat and though they have not endorsed Japan's war they have quickly been branded as Hanjian and collaborators. Many of their officers and officials have begun to waver as word of Japanese atrocities and fears of our ambitions spread.\n\nThe start of the Second Sino-Japanese War has blindsided [FNG.GetLeader], a source of considerable tension. But under pressure from the Kwantung Army and Tianjin Army and a desire to claim at least a partial share of our ultimate victory, they have pragmatically decided to sign protocols bringing them formally into the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.032.a: "Together we shall triumph over Western bootlickers!"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.033.t: "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] Stalls for Time"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.033.d: "The start of the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japan's direct participation in the war on the continent has placed [FNG.GetNameDef] in an awkward spot. Most of China has banded together against the Japanese threat and though they have not endorsed Japan's war they have quickly been branded as Hanjian and collaborators. Many of their officers and officials have begun to waver as word of Japanese atrocities and fears of our ambitions spread.\n\nThe start of the Second Sino-Japanese War has blindsided [FNG.GetLeader], a source of considerable tension. Despite pressure from the Kwantung Army and Tianjin Army, the Fengtian government has been reluctant to coordinate more closely with our forces or formally join the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nOur agents on the ground assure us however, that they are keeping a close eye on the situation. If necessary and the opportunity arises, they may take emergency action to ensure [FNG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s cooperation in this great conflict."

#FNG-JAP Mech Events Pt 2 (100-199) - Decision Events for Japan
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.100.t: "Zhang Pleas for More Time"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.100.d: "Although Zhang Zuolin is Japan's closest ally in China, he is hardly an ideal partner for Tokyo. While Zhang greets our dignitaries and businessmen with smiles and handshakes, he attempts to maintain his distance at every turn. Zhang's shifty strategy of appeasing Tokyo while in a position of weakness but spurning Japan in a position of strength has worn down the patience of the Japanese government.\n\nThrough all of our cooperation with Marshal Zhang was the hope that one day he would come to appreciate the wisdom and experience of Tokyo, but it seems he will never follow our sagely example. Once again it seems that the foolish warlord has squandered Tokyo's aid and is once again at our doorstep begging for scraps.\n\nPerhaps he has realised how much he has worn down our desire to aid him, and is attempting to salvage our strained relationship. Regardless, Tokyo has agreed to allot him a little more aid and has extended him a little more patience, but should Zhang fail to make substantial gains, it will be the last time he has played us for fools."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.100.a: "We are tired of being disappointed with your lack of progress..."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.101.t: "Zhang Cracks Down on Sedition"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.101.d: "Zhang Zuolin, though rising from humble circumstances to become master of the Northeast with whatever means available to him, has never been one to tolerate blatant corruption. No, the Grand Marshal has worked tirelessly to promote his regime with an image of inscrutability and moral principle.\n\nMost recently, Marshal Zhang has enacted an anti-corruption purge within his administration, prompting a slew of arrests and executions for those accused of corruption, sedition, and treason. While some have noted Zhang's earnestness in promoting a relatively fair administration, many observers note that most of those purged were tied in some way to Japanese interests operating in Dongbei.\n\nAlthough Marshal Zhang has not publicly revealed the source of bribes, most understand the message he is sending to Tokyo. Japan for their part have not publicly commented on the Old Marshal's recent anti-corruption purges, but the government is undoubtedly displeased with their wayward ally in the Middle Kingdom. However, Tokyo is not in a position to or has deemed it not in their interest to punish Zhang's regime at the moment, leaving the incident largely a victory for Zhang and his Anguojun regime."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.101.a: "That ungrateful fool..."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.102.t: "Zhang Curtails the Shikan Clique"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.102.d: "In the late Qing Dynasty, many sought out a foreign education to learn how they could best heal the ailing Chinese state. Many aspiring soldiers gravitated towards the rising Japanese Empire, which had undertaken a rapid modernisation programme spearheaded by Emperor Meiji. The Japanese for their part encouraged Chinese students to seek an education on their shores, establishing the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko Military Preparatory School, specifically catered towards giving Chinese students military training and education.\n\nWhen the Qing Dynasty was brought down by the Xinhai Revolution and warlords rose up in its place, many of China's prominent generals and leaders were Tokyo Shinbu Gakko alumni. They brought with them a wealth of knowledge on modern warfare, which made them invaluable assets to various powerful warlords. Marshal Zhang recognised the capability of Yang Yuting, who was one such NCO with Japanese education. Yang shared Zhang's ambitions of leading unification efforts, and became a crucial officer within the Fengtian Clique. Yang and other Japanese-educated NCOs formed what became known as the Shikan Clique, and have generally called for ties between Tokyo and Shenyang to be strengthened.\n\nYang's Shikan Clique in recent years has profited greatly from the increase in Japanese influence in Dongbei following Marshal Zhang's retreat from Beijing, and has courted regionalists and disgruntled officers into its camp. The increase in Shikan power has not gone unnoticed under the Old Marshal's watch, as he watches with concern at both the rise of Shikan and Tokyo's influence. Marshal Zhang has increasingly worked to curtail the Shikan Clique's activities, elevating loyalists to higher military positions."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.102.a: "Does Zhang really believe he can unite China without the Shikan Clique?"

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.103.t: "Concessions to the Concordia Association"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.103.d: "In the aftermath of the Anguojun's crippling defeat by Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique, the Fengtian Clique was once again pushed north of the Great Wall. In this time of vulnerability and weakness, the Russians attempted to pounce on Marshal Zhang's domain, forcing him to rely further on Tokyo's support.\n\nFengtian and Japan stood together against the Russian bear and humiliated the fools like in the days of 1905. In order to consolidate the Sino-Japanese friendship between Marshal Zhang's government and our own, the Concordia Association was formed in Fengtian to promote the ideals of the Pan-Asianist dream. The Association has found a boon of support within Manchuria's ethnic minorities, and has also become the home of certain Japanese radicals who have been expelled from the Home Islands in de facto exile.\n\nRegardless, the Concordia Association remains one of the primary allies of the Shikan Clique and the Kwantung Army, assisting Yang Yuting and his allies whenever possible. While Zhang Zuolin has never truly appreciated the Association, he has been known to shore up temporary support for them in times of strife, such as now."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.103.a: "Marshal Zhang has recognised the wisdom in accepting our aid..."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.104.t: "Zhang Empowers Our Advisors"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.104.d: "Ever since the Russo-Japanese War which saw our ascendant empire defeat the clumsy Russian Bear, the Kwantung leased territory, which was ours by right ever since the Sino-Japanese War, was returned to us. A year after, the Kwantung Garrison was established, which saw the beginnings of the Kwantung Army. The actual army was established in 1919, when Japan replaced the old governance structure of the port.\n\nSince its creation, the Kwantung Army has maintained influence in the neighbouring Fengtian Clique, and has sought to act as a guiding hand for Japan's influence in Manchuria, and ensure Marshal Zhang's compliance to Tokyo's will. With the Japanese military radicalising substantially in the late 20s, the Kwantung Army for such beliefs, becoming involved in many various coups throughout the interwar period.\n\nThe Kwantung Army stands in staunch rivalry with the Tianjin Army, who look towards the rest of China and hope to assist Zhang Zuolin in destroying the German lapdogs in the Zhili Clique, restore the Anguojun's presence south of the wall, and ensure that Zhang will maintain his ties to Tokyo thereafter, or suffer the consequences. For whatever reasons, Zhang Zuolin has usually attempted to remain aloof from the Kwantung Army's influence, but he has recently brought in some Kwantung Army advisors to assist him in modernising his military force."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.104.a: "We'll show them how modern wars are fought."

#FNG-JAP Mech Events Pt 3 (200-299) - Decision Events for Fengtian
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.200.t: "Japan Searches for Collaborators"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.200.d: "Although Zhang Zuolin is regarded by many in China as the arch-collaborator with Japanese interests thanks to years of Zhili propaganda, the people of the Three Northeastern Provinces understand the true situation. Marshal Zhang was forced to inherit the Japanese as his “allies” upon his takeover of Dongbei, and attempted to contain their influence whilst also not provoking them into taking action.\n\nIt seems that this delicate balancing act is perhaps not long for this world, as it seems that the Empire of Japan is not only unsure of the Old Marshal's ability to win the war, and are even looking for potential replacements. If true, Tokyo could choose from a large array of willing conspirators. Japan's longtime relationship with the Fengtian Clique has produced pro-Japanese elements in all major factions within the government.\n\nThe Concordia Association is already openly pro-Japanese, the Shikan Clique is generally in favour for close ties, the Communications Clique's leaders in Zhang Zongxiang and Lu Zongyu have also shown an openness to working with Tokyo, and even within the Zhang Clique, the Old Marshal's more flexible sworn brothers like Zhang Jinghui and Zhang Haipeng may even be pliable puppets.\n\nAlthough Marshal Zhang is aware of Tokyo's increasing disillusionment with his leadership, there's not much for him to do. He can only recognise the danger he presently is in. The search for collaborators began under local Japanese elements but is now receiving backing from Tokyo itself now, certainly a bad omen for Zhang's government and the fight for a free China."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.200.a: "I never thought it would end like this..."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.201.t: "Japan Reins in Extremists"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.201.d: "Although Japan and Fengtian have been allies for two decades, Japan's policy towards us has been incredibly unclear. While Tokyo may decide one thing, the Kwantung Army will do what they have deemed Japan's best interest, as will the Tianjin Army.\n\nWhile the Tianjin Army has generally been more cooperative with the Anguojun, the Kwantung Army not only wants to keep our government contained to north of the Great Wall, and have long disliked Marshal Zhang.\n\nThe increasing radicalism in the Kwantung Army has certainly generated great concern among the Grand Marshal and his inner circle, and years of increasing tensions has certainly been unbeneficial for both powers. Recently, Tokyo has sought to give Marshal Zhang's government some relief by reining in extremist officers stationed in the Northeast, targeted primarily towards the Kwantung Army.\n\nWhile many of their officers have been demoted or recalled, Tianjin Army Officers have been elevated in their place. Tokyo's policy towards Marshal Zhang's government has certainly been made clear, and finally they have enforced the compliance of the wayward armies."
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.201.a: "We might actually survive this age of chaos..."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.202.t: "The Japanese Aid Plan"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.202.d: "While Fengtian has boasted China's strongest regional economy with most of the nation's heavy industry centred around Fengtian Province and Jilin, the financial situation of the government is no better than the rest of China. Whenever Marshal Zhang has attempted to achieve his ambitions and cross the Great Wall, there have been massive economic consequences back home.\n\nJust a decade ago, the Fengpiao currency collapsed after Zhang's government was unable to secure loans due to the existence of a rival Kuomintang government in Guangzhou, and Zhili resurgence once again relegated Marshal Zhang's government to north of the Great Wall. Recognising the dangers of economic collapse in Fengtian, Tokyo has begun funneling emergency funds to our government through Concordia Association shell organisations.\n\nIn addition to loans, Japan has sent engineers, encouraged its businesses to make contracts with the Fengtian Government, and offered a trade deal for steel. Tokyo's generosity will certainly stabilise the homefront and thus aid the front lines, but every aid package strengthens our economic reliance on Tokyo."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.203.t: "Japanese Sends Arms Shipments"
 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.203.d: "Ever since Marshal Zhang and Tokyo came to a mutually beneficial arrangement, the Fengtian Army has boasted one of the best equipped armies in the Chinese military. During the first Zhifeng War, Wu Peifu's soldiers were dressed in tattered uniforms while the Fengtian Army was fully equipped. To our shame, Wu and his men of rags were able to defeat us.\n\nSince the early 20s, it seems that the various rival warlords have also found friends in high places. Chen Jiongming found friends in the British and Americans, Wu in the Germans, and the Kuomintang in France, and Feng Yuxiang in Russia. The Fengtian Army has experienced the effects of the modernisation of the armies of the Central Plains firsthand, with equipment attrition skyrocketing.\n\nIn order to resupply our troops in this war for Chinese unification, Japan has sent a massive arms shipment to our government. Of course, Japan has seen to it that sympathetic officers to Tokyo have seen their men resupplied first, and while Anguojun High Command will have a say in weapons distribution, it has not stopped pro-Japanese united being favoured."

 fengtian_japan_mechanic_events.204.d: "The increasing chaos in China in recent years has intensified Tokyo's interest in the affairs of our nation, for better or for worse. While Marshal Zhang was able to contain Japanese influence in Dongbei for the first decade of his rule, the collapse of the Fengtian dollar coupled with the loss of Beijing forced previously unseen levels of Japanese influence in the Three Provinces of the Northeast.\n\nWith Marshal Zhang's government once again waging for control of Beijing and China, Tokyo has increased its talons in the Anguojun Government once again. Just yesterday, the government in Tokyo has ordered additional divisions deployed to China in order to shore up its already-stationed Kwantung and Tianjin Armies. Though this move strengthens both of their forces, it in a way weakens both of them, as Tokyo's direct footprint has been increased, now that the Japanese Government is directly involved in this war."

###FNG Endgame Events
 fengtian_endgame_events.000.t: "Unification by Dongbei"
 fengtian_endgame_events.000.d: "Perhaps the greatest ambition of the Old Marshal and his compatriots since the 1920s, the cementing of their control within China has long been a desired dream for many within the Fengtian Clique. With multiple gambits such as the First and Second ZhiFeng Wars, with the latter seeing a term of Fengtian as the beholder of the Beijing Government, their rule was ultimately not to last. Following the Third and Fourth ZhiFeng Wars, Fengtian was ejected to the Three Northeastern Provinces, alongside Rehe.\n\nContinuing to parade themselves as the legitimate successors to the Beiyang Government, the Old Marshal and his subordinates could hardly pose much of a threat in the face of the Zhili's unification of the nation, even when such a foundation was gravely shaken in 1932 and 1933; Zhang Zuolin merely withdrawing from attempted peace negotiations beforehand due to Zhili success in national elections. Yet such a situation was not to last! Rebuilding their strength, in no small part due to Japanese assistance, the army of the Anguojun managed to successfully rout defenders south of the Great Wall, and secure Beijing.\n\nAt the present, there is much jubilation and many celebrations to be held. Both in earnest, and perhaps to mask government difficulties following intense warfare all-throughout the nation-state. Nonetheless, for the third time in the nation's history, Beijing has become the seat of a Dongbei-led government. And for many citizens in China, they look towards the Northeasterners for direction, and for support."
 fengtian_endgame_events.000.a: "And so our mission is fulfilled."

 fengtian_endgame_events.001.t: "Fengtian Factionalism Rises"
 fengtian_endgame_events.001.d: "Often thought to be a united force under the strength of a single figure, the Fengtian Clique itself is split into various disparate factions, akin to most major warlord cliques in China. Yet unlike most, it is relatively responsible in its proclamations of internal unity; few would dare defy Marshal Zhang. Even in such an environment however, intense rivalries and inter-personal differences can emerge, most violently and evidently in events such as Guo Songling's rebellion of the 1920s. In-effect, Guo's legacy lives on, shattered and reconstituted both politically and military into two major factions: Shaoshuai, and Shikan.\n\nLed informally by the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang, the Shaoshuai Clique corresponds to his immediate courtiers, and their ambitions to prop up Guo's reform-minded protégé. As the Old Marshal's de-facto successor, Xueliang has appreciated immense benefits within the Fengtian government, albeit his military and political careers leave much to be desired, so much so as to not mention his social activities.\n\nOn the opposing end lies the Shikan Clique. A group of modernisers, militarists, patriots, and the meritocratic underdogs of Fengtian's factionalism, they are led by the oft misused Yang Yuting, and his close friend Chang Yinhuai. Graduates from the Japanese Army Academy and otherwise, the clique serves as the main vector for internal opposition within the military; fiercely opposed to the seeming nepotism and incompetency of the Shaoshuai, Zhang, Heilongjiang, and other Cliques.\n\nWith the arrival of new glories arrives similarly new difficulties, and the ever simmering lid of Fengtian tensions seems to have finally burst, as whole divisions refuse to heed Central Government orders, and Shikan Clique aficionados meet increasingly with Japanese contacts..."
 fengtian_endgame_events.001.a: "The legacy of Guo Songling..."

 fengtian_endgame_events.002.t: "Failure of Government Economics"
 fengtian_endgame_events.002.d: "Suffice to say, the Chinese economic situation has never been particularly stable ever since the onset of the Warlord Era, perhaps even ever since the decline of the Qing. Industrialisation has usually been at the behest, or at the enquiring, of foreign powers and foreign investments. As such, China's fledgling Feudal land-situation combined with foreign-dominated industrialisation efforts in the urban cities has resulted in quite a tenuous situation throughout the nation.\n\nFurthermore, with the outbreak of hostilities following a brief tenure of relative peace during the Zhilo Unification, investors have fled, industrialists have cordoned their factories and arsenals, and immense damage has been wrought in both the roaring countryside and urban sprawl. In the Northeast, relatively despoiled of damage and conflict, Japanese investments and the clever management of Communications Clique, Zhang Clique, and Recovery League officials have resulted in a flourishing industrial belt stretching through Jilin and other provinces.\n\nDescending from their Northeastern sanctuary however, the Fengtian government has run into all too friendly situation for Chinese Central Governments; an inefficient tax system, local banditry, incompetence and lack of trained officials, and many more issues have resulted in piling debt, and lowering economic productivity. Whilst foreign loans present themselves as a useful bandage to prevent hemorrhaging of national finances, they are but a pittance in light of the true issues. It will undoubtedly take concerted effort to remedy the situation at present."
 fengtian_endgame_events.002.a: "Best begin searching for loans..."

 fengtian_endgame_events.003.t: "Fears of Fengtian Domination"
 fengtian_endgame_events.003.d: "Politically, Dongbei almost always seemed as a microcosm of broader Chinese currents. Relatively isolated, the Northeastern Cliques had themselves far more concerned with the Japanese to the South, Russians to the North, and the affairs of the Mongol regions to the West. Suffice to say, the provincial governments of the Northeast functioned far more off of personalities and the Fengtian Clique than most other comparable administrations in the era. With relatively little infiltration by organisations south of the Great Wall, namely the Chinese Constitutionalists, Kuomintang, and the Young China Party, various minor Fengtian organisations have managed to rise to prominence: the revived Restoration Society, for example.\n\nYet following the Third and Fourth ZhiFeng Wars, the Northeastern has become a haven for those who have burnt political bridges in the Central Plains and further. Hosting exiled Anhui aficionadoes such as Wang Yitang, Zhang Zuolin's own personal political jockeys such as Pan Fu, or even the Japanophile Communications Clique (far removed from they heyday), the character of the Marshal's rival government has truly been multifaceted, and in-effect tearing at the seams.\n\nAscending from the Great Wall southwards, the character that long loomed Marshal Zhang's government attempts of the 1920s remains large even now. Few would desire to work with Northeasterners, viewed as nothing more but militarists, and perhaps bandits. Uniquely disposed of in-regards to available political muscle, the new Fengtian Government has seemingly brought forth fears of possible domination by men of lesser standing, and even lesser know-how."
 fengtian_endgame_events.003.a: "Really? As bandits? Still?"

 fengtian_endgame_events.004.t: "A Nation Under the Northeast"
 fengtian_endgame_events.004.d.base: "Bringing unification to China has been no easy task, and yet it would appear that the consistent, ever-present rival of the Zhili Government has finally emerged on top. Residing within their Northeast sanctuary, and backed by the Japanese, the Fengtian government has finally, for the third time, retaken Beijing. Running through the consequences of national unification, their government has been beset with critical economic shortcomings, and a wasteland of political support; few have forgotten the reputation of Fengtian's aficionados.\n\nFurthermore, it would appear that despite Zhang Zuolin's best efforts, the fracturing Anguojun alliance has begun to tear itself apart. With the ambitions of Tokyo intermixed, a rapidly unfolding tornado of political rivalry and infighting has emerged under the Five Banner flag. The Shikan Clique, the Communications Clique, Recovery League, various democrats and other smaller cliques have all begun to feud over patronage positions and the direction of the government."
 fengtian_endgame_events.004.d.generic: "$fengtian_endgame_events.004.d.base$\n\nSecuring national unification through the might of the Anguojun, it would appear that the disparate Warlord alliance stewarded by Fengtian's eclectic and corrupt government has begun to mandate proper consolidation under National forces. Whilst perhaps an ideal preferred by a nation so damaged by war and bloodshed for decades, is it tolerable for [ROOT.GetLeader] to submit their government to an intolerable northerner? To permanently sunder any ambitions of their own stake to the presidency?"
 fengtian_endgame_events.004.d.shx: "$fengtian_endgame_events.004.d.base$\n\nHaving collaborated with the Old Marshal intermittently all throughout the Warlord Era, few would besmirch the Model Governor for throwing his lot once again with the Dongbei divisionaries. And yet, many within Yan's camp insist upon his inherent kingmaker role within national politics. With the capacity to descend from Shanxi onto the Central Plain in a lightning strike, the notion of Yan's own Presidential ambitions present themselves as an all-too enticing offer, but is the Model Governor willing to roll the dice? Whatever the case, the time to decide is now, as the Anguojun recoils from its unification and own internal rivalries."

As evident to anyone, knives have been unsheathed, and Governor Zhang owes his loyalty to Marshal Zhang, not to his upstart child or any other member of the Fengtian Clique."

 fengtian_endgame_events.005.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Rebellion"
 fengtian_endgame_events.005.d.base: "Following the realisation of Anguojun unification of China, the various cliques and power-holders in China's restored republic have begun to scramble for power and support across the country. Within regionalist sentiment lies a fear of growing government centralisation, corruption within the government ranks (all too well known to the Northeasterners), and a fear of dominance from Dongbei political cliques. With [FROM.GetLeader]'s supporters willing to back their claims with arms, a civil war is likely underway.\n\nThe Central Government of course is expected to have a major advantage, controlling China's major cities and commanding international legitimacy (at least for now) which as given them greater access to loans as well as a larger tax and manpower base to draft an army. The centralised Anguojun however still holds many disloyal regionalists within its ranks. Furthermore, [FROM.GetAdjective] regionalists are confident in the abilities of their forces and expect that others will rise up against the tyrannical dictatorship of the Central Government. And China is no stranger to upsets. What both sides can agree on, however, is that they will not tolerate another warlord era."
 fengtian_endgame_events.005.d.generic: "$fengtian_endgame_events.005.d.base$\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] have been loosely tied to the Anguojun as of late, with  independent but seemingly compatible roots. Their national ambitions coincided with the Fengtian victory in the North, and rode its wave to unification. Now, however,  with the Central Government attempt to assert its authority over its former allies, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] is simply unwilling to accept Dongbei's domination."

Led almost entirely by the sheer personality of some of its forefront members, its paradoxical nature has led it to be tugged in all variety of directions, yet it remains held together by common interest to never see China return to the Warlord Era.

In the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, Zhang was able to secure control of his home province of Fengtian. Zhang's large assortment of alliances, composed of local Beiyang officers and old bandit friends, formed the nucleus of the Fengtian Clique, which would become one of the main Beiyang Clique splinters.\n\nZhang originally made an alliance with Duan Qirui to utilise his Japanese connections for the purpose of securing firearms, but turned on the Anhui Clique alongside the Zhili Clique. The two warlord cliques would later emerge as arch-rivals, a state of affairs still present today. For a time Zhang was the sole controller of Beijing, but the Zhili Clique would restore their control over the city in 1927.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Qing Restoration, Zhang carried out the independence of the Northeast from Beijing's authority and challenged their direct authority to rule China, claiming for himself the mantle of the Xinhai Revolution and rightful heir of the Beiyang Government. Zhang's true commitment to democratic republicanism is dubious at best, but if the Old Marshal can utilise republican rhetoric to restore his status as the internationally recognised government, then so be it."

Sharing the same courtesy name as Xueliang, and growing up together, Feng would accompany Xueliang to the Northeast Army Lecture Hall, and similarly to the Baoding Army Officers School. Serving as a staff officer of the Fengtian Aviation Department, he would play a key role in the establishment of the Northeast Air Force.\n\nFollowing the First ZhiFeng War in 1922, Feng would grow disgusted with the concept of war, resigning from the military and became the general manager of Daye Iron Factory, engaging in armament production, and concurrently principal of Daye Factory Engineer School. In 1926 he donated 3.1 million yuan to establish Feng Yong University, serving as its principal — the first Western style university in the Northeast.

When he grew up, Wu joined the Qing Military, joining Ding Chunhua's anti-banditry army. By 1897, Wu had become a platoon leader and Ding's right hand man. During the late Qing Dynasty, banditry had become rampant in Shengjing, and Wu took it upon himself to root it all out, becoming the vanguard of anti-banditry action in the Northeast.\n\nIn 1907, Zhang Zuolin met Wu, and the two became lifelong friends and sworn brothers. In the aftermath of the Wuchang Uprising, Wu and Zhang marched into Shenyang to maintain order, petitioning Yuan Shikai to put down the revolution. Wu continually assisted Zhang's ambitions after the Xinhai Revolution, helping him oust Zhang's old bandit leader Feng Delin to become the warlord of Fengtian. In 1921, Zhang Zuolin had secured control of the entire Northeast, and gave Wu control over Heilongjiang.\n\nWu helped the Old Marshal in ending Guo Songling's rebellion, and also fought against the Guominjun.

In 1914 he became supervisor of the Fengtian Army Supplementary School, adjutant of the Taoliao Garrison, Chief of Staff of the 29th Division and also that of the Heilongjiang Dujun's Office.\n\nIn 1918, Yu Zhen would work with Yang Yuting to expand their influence and power albeit would be dismissed by Zhang Zuolin only to be re-commissioned in 1921. During this time, Yu would work with Yang Yuting, Jiang Dengxuan, Han Linchun, and Ji Yiqiao to form the \"Shikan\" Clique, with Yang and Yu taking leading roles. Appointed as deputy commander of the 3rd Army of the Zhenwei Army, Yu would ultimately not take command due to Yang's intervention.\n\nIn 1927, Yu would see service in the 3rd and 4th ZhiFeng Wars, albeit would end up dismissed due to blunders on the field. Retreating north with Yang into Manchuria following the 4th ZhiFeng, he became Chief of Staff of the Fengtian Dujun's Office.§!\n\n§YNotes: Whilst the co-leader of the Shikan Clique, Yu Zhen is one of the most stringent anti-Japanese members of the Fengtian Clique, with his home becoming something of a hub for Anti-Japan discussions.\nHe is known as the \"Old Mongolian\" due to his conscientious and lawfully steadfast nature.§!"

In 1911, 19-year-old Liu migrated to Northeast China with his father to make a better living.\n\nBefore entering the Northeastern Army Lecture Hall with the referral of Guo Songling, Liu first worked as a letter writer and joined the Fengtian army as a clerk in 1918. After graduating, he stayed in Guo Songling's force as a junior commander and took part in the Second Zhili-Fengtian War. When Guo revolted against the Fengtian clique, Liu followed as a divisional commander under him. Despite so, Liu was eventually pardoned and he enrolled in the Staff College in 1927, becoming the cadet with the highest rank in his class. As a well-educated and passionate officer, Liu stands out in the ranks of the Fengtian clique when new groups of officers are promoted. Yet, it is noteworthy that Liu seems to have some strong opinions against Japanese presence in the Northeast provinces and the pro-Japanese elements of the so-called Shikan clique.§!"

Zhou participated in the 3rd and the 4th Zhili-Fengtian Wars and rose through the ranks thanks to his performance as a well-trained officer in the front against Zhili troops. Zhou would already be a regimental commander by 1927, and he was promoted to a divisional commander not long ago in replacement of his incapable superior.\n\nAs a surefooted and domestically trained officer, Zhou received much recognition within the Fengtian clique(excluding some senior members who are part of the Shikan clique), especially from the Young Marshal who values talents in the army, it is also why he is now given command authority as a senior general. Having that said, Zhou is not particularly interested and involved in the politics of the clique, but he seems to be concerned with the Japanese presence in his home province.§!"

Instead of concluding his military studies, Guo decided to further his cadet life in Japan as he enrolled in the 12th Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy to study infantry with government sponsorship. Unlike most of his compatriots who would return to China after studying in the Academy, Guo joined a Japanese artillery regiment as an intern and later entered the 4th class of the Army War College of Japan in 1923.\n\nGuo finished his military studies in Japan in 1925 and joined the Fengtian army as a senior staff under Zhang Zuoxiang, Guo was also responsible for the training of armies in Jilin. Although he missed the first two Zhili-Fengtian Wars, Guo still proved himself as a capable staff in the other two conflicts with the Zhili clique. As a well-educated officer who studied modern warfare in Japan, Guo's skills would be valuable.

Returning to China in 1911, he briefly taught at the Baoding Military Academy before taking part in the Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai, participating in the capture of Nanjing. After tensions between Sun Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai came to a head in 1912 culminating in the Second Revolution, Ji would join the war on the side of the revolutionaries, going into exile after its defeat. Later on at the invitation of Tang Jiyao, he would go to Yunnan to serve as an instructor at the Kunming Military Academy. Eventually in 1922, his old classmate Yang Yuting invited him to join the Fengtian army as chief of staff of Han Linchun's division. Serving with distinction since then, Ji has proven himself to be a capable commander in the Second Zhifeng war, the suppression of Guo Songling's rebellion and the two subsequent Zhifeng wars. It was during the Third and Fourth Zhifeng wars where Ji would demonstrate his true skill as a commander, outmanoeuvring and cutting off a significant Zhili force in Henan province.

At that time, the mainstream figures of the Navy were all studied in Britain, and most of them were from Fuzhou.
