 FER_totalist_party: "PSR(m)"
 FER_totalist_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (maksimalistov) (Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries-Maximalists)\n§gThe Maximalist cells have weathered many storms in the faraway mining towns and sawmill villages of Siberia. They remain as an underground organisation, agitating and preparing for the struggle to build communism once more.§!\n"
 FER_syndicalist_party: "PSR-Left"
 FER_syndicalist_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries)\n§gSiberia has always been an Eser stronghold, and they remain a major force among Siberian socialists. Some regional sections can even be described as anarcho-syndicalists.§!\n"
 FER_radical_socialist_party: "PSR-Left"
 FER_radical_socialist_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries)\n§gSiberia has always been an Eser stronghold, and they remain a major force among Siberian socialists. Most of them are agrarian socialists, drawing their strength from the land like the Narodniks of old.§!\n"
 FER_social_democrat_party: "SSF"
 FER_social_democrat_party_long: "Soyuz Sibiryakov-Federalistov (Union of Siberians-Federalists)\n§gThe Siberian-Federalists are a minor group largely based in the small, left-leaning city intelligentsia of Siberia. Their programme is moderately socialist but Siberian regionalist, championing a federal solution for all of Russia.§!\n"
 FER_social_liberal_party: "DNPVS-Left"
 FER_social_liberal_party_long: "Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya Volnoy Sibiri (Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia - Left Faction)\n§gThe Free Siberians have their ideological roots in Siberian national liberalism, and they have rapidly grown to be the largest political party in Siberia. The DNPVS is an alliance of the independent peasants and growing middle class of Siberia's towns and cities. The leading figure among the progressive faction is Sergey Nikolayevich Markov, a former Kadet and the protégé of venerable Siberian leader Ivan Serebrennikov.§!\n"
 FER_market_liberal_party: "DNPVS-Right"
 FER_market_liberal_party_long: "Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya Volnoy Sibiri (Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia - Right Faction)\n§gThe Free Siberians have their ideological roots in Siberian national liberalism, and they have rapidly grown to be the largest political party in Siberia. The DNPVS is an alliance of the independent peasants and growing middle class of Siberia's towns and cities. The leading figure among the right wing - and for the whole party - is Ivan Serebrennikov, an old Kadet and Right-Eser who once served in Kolchak's government.§!\n"
 FER_social_conservative_party: "Independent Conservatives"
 FER_social_conservative_party_long: "Independent Conservatives\n§gWhile there is not yet a Siberian-wide conservative party, various conservative communities across the lands exert considerable influence in local politics. The Old Believers form a particularly significant political group in the Transbaikal region.§!\n"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party: "BOR"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Byuro Osvobozhdeniya Rossii (Bureau for Liberation of Russia)\n§gSemyonov would portray the BOR as a future ruling party and organisation to lead the struggle for Siberia, but in practice it is merely a propaganda department for Semyonov's army.§!\n"
 FER_paternal_autocrat_party: "Semyonov Clique"
 FER_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Semyonov Clique\n§gThe man, the legend! Grigory Semyonov has always been a leader to inspire great personal loyalty from his trusted men, who came to follow him in his Manchurian exile. And it is this charisma that has enabled him to build a personal fiefdom around him, carving it with a Cossack sabre, but with lessons learnt from Chinese wars. His clique will follow him to any end.§!\n"
 FER_national_populist_party: "Circle of St. George"
 FER_national_populist_party_long: "Krug Svyatogo Georgiya (Circle of Saint George)\n§gThe Circle was founded by General Vyacheslav Volkov in 1931, after he and a number of other monarchist officers were expelled from the Russian Army as Kornilov's rivals. The Circle, receiving its name from the Soldier-Saint so often celebrated in Russian military symbolism, is a conspiratorial organisation centred around a few military men of great gravitas, like Mikhail Diterikhs and Volkov himself. Their goal is nothing less than the restoration of monarchy in Russia - and they will either succeed in achieving their vision or die trying.§!\n"

 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_2: "DNPVS-Semyonov"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_2_long: "Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya Volnoy Sibiri (Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia - Semyonov's Faction)\n§gThe Free Siberians have their ideological roots in Siberian national liberalism, and they have rapidly grown to be the largest political party in Siberia. The DNPVS is an alliance of the independent peasants and growing middle class of Siberia's towns and cities - and with Grigory Semyonov's influence, there is a significant conservative and patriotic wing of the party under the leadership of Sergey Tashkin, another former Kadet and Semyonov's right-hand man in politics.§!\n"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_3: "DNPVS"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_3_long: "$FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_3_long_tt$\n§gThe Free Siberians have their ideological roots in Siberian national liberalism, close to the Kadets, but under the leadership of Sergey Tashkin. The DNPVS has turned into a political machine propping up Grigory Semyonov's regime. The DNPVS is populist, patriotic and, in truth, any ideology a potential voter might like at any given moment. After all, it is not formed around an idea, but a man, and that man took Russia with his sword, not by ballot.§!\n"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_3_long_tt: "Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya Volnoy Sibiri (Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia)"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_4: "VNP"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_4_long: "$FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_4_long_tt$\n§gThe VNP is a people's party - vaguely populist and patriotic, more show than actual policy. It has been created out of groups supporting Grigory Semyonov, under the leadership of his right-hand man Sergey Tashkin, a former Kadet. The All-Russian Popular Party is not like other parties, obsessed with ideologies and dogmas - but instead it is only concerned with the well-being of the Russian people, and loyally supporting President Semyonov in his quest to restore Russian prosperity and greatness.§!\n"
 FER_authoritarian_democrat_party_4_long_tt: "Vserossiyskaya Narodnaya Partiya (All-Russian Popular Party)"
 FER_paternal_autocrat_party_2: "VVS"
 FER_paternal_autocrat_party_2_long: "$FER_paternal_autocrat_party_2_long_tt$\n§gThe VVS is not a party, but a movement. It is composed of the patriotic veterans and their allies, men who are to be thanked for Russia's liberation. And chief among them is Supreme Ataman Grigory Semyonov himself, whose regime is filled with brave men from the VVS.§!\n"
 FER_paternal_autocrat_party_2_long_tt: "Vserossiysky Voinsky Soyuz (All-Russian Military Union)"
 FER_national_populist_party_2: "RMS"
 FER_national_populist_party_2_long: "$FER_national_populist_party_2_long_tt$\n§gThe RMS is a union of various monarchist organisations in Russia, forced underground by the earlier government. They were formed by General Mikhail Diterikhs' supporters as a political front for his rule, rallying all those who agree with the General's vision for a traditional and strong Russia. As a civilian organisation, the Union has quickly turned into a counter-balance to the military-oriented Circle of St. George. The membership of the Union has multiple well-known names, such as Ivan Solonevich, Ivan Ilyin and Metropolitan Iosif.§!\n"

 FER_focus: "Far Eastern Focus Tree"
 FER_mobilise_eastern_cossacks: "Ride of the Cossacks"
 FER_mobilise_eastern_cossacks_desc: "Since the times of Yermak Timofeyevich, Cossacks have ceaselessly pushed the Russian frontier eastwards. Once the white-blue-red tricolour was planted on the banks of the Amur river, several new hosts were created to protect the new territories - Amur and Ussuri Cossacks populate territories under our control to this day. Extremely dissatisfied with the callous centralism of the government in Moscow, they will form the core of our military."
 FER_get_help_from_kwantung: "Arms from the Kwantung Army"
 FER_get_help_from_kwantung_desc: "Japanese ambitions in East Asia have made it a consistent enemy of the governments in Petrograd and Moscow, and Japan has succeeded in pushing Russian influence out of Manchuria over the past decades. In our revolt, they see a possibility to permanently bar the northern rival from access to the Pacific, as well as a possibility to tap into the resource-rich lands of Siberia. The Kwantung Army is ready to supply us with arms posthaste, even without direct sanction from Tokyo."
 FER_parliament_of_free_siberia: "Assembly of the Free Far East"
 FER_parliament_of_free_siberia_desc: "Our rebellion draws its strength from two groups - Cossacks, who wish to fight against the centralisation efforts of the Moscow government, and the democratic opposition, who were attracted to our call to fight for a free Russia against tyranny. To achieve any kind of political legitimacy, we have to create some political body representing both of these groups. Naturally, no elections can be held until our state is more stable, so the first delegates will be appointed by the Ataman."
 FER_semyonov_tree: "All the Ataman's Men"
 FER_semyonov_tree_desc: "As time unfolds, our rebellion keeps growing stronger. Forces loyal to Moscow have been unable to suppress it, and many Cossacks, who had previously refrained from joining us, are now reconsidering their decision. War is a chance for many of them to enrich themselves beyond measure, and certainly beyond whatever honest service provides. Letting our Cossacks punish suspected Svobodniks and Socialists on their own initiative will allow our numbers to swell."
 FER_liberty_declaration: "Liberty Declaration of Buryats and Yakuts"
 FER_liberty_declaration_desc: "Cossacks are not the only people in the Far East who were deeply offended by the policies of the terrorist-turned-dictator. Savinkov's efforts to get rid of federalism and local autonomies have aggravated relations between Moscow and the country's many national minorities. Hearing of the success of our revolt, Buryats and Yakuts are now much more active in their resistance. If we provide them with support and relief, we will significantly expand our power base."
 FER_negotiate_with_sternberg: "The Mongolian Connection"
 FER_negotiate_with_sternberg_desc: "No amount of personal bravery and Japanese support can make up for the fact that we are completely outmatched by the forces still loyal to Moscow. The success of our campaign depends on our ability to seize control of Siberia before the enemy solves a multitude of crises on other fronts. To cause such a collapse of Muscovite authority, we need powerful allies - we can possibly find one in Mongolia."
 FER_expand_honghuzi: "Expand the Khunkhuzs"
 FER_expand_honghuzi_desc: "Who says that we can only rely on the peoples of Russia in our revolt against tyranny? The Khunkhuzs are bands of Chinese warriors who took up arms against the government in Beijing and made a living by taking property from the wealthy and distributing it to the poor. Some of them worked closely with our Cossacks and are already enlisted in our army. We can use those contacts to offer service to others who are still in Manchuria."
 FER_force_of_personality: "Rule Through Personality"
 FER_force_of_personality_desc: "The more we expand our domain to the West, the more diverse our army and groups of supporters become. To stay afloat, we already have to balance the interests of nationalistic and democratic Russians, particularist Cossacks and Yakuts, and even of Chinese and Japanese foreigners. To have any semblance of unity in our war camp, we will have to agree on the only moral principle applying to the men of the Far Eastern Army - personal loyalty to Ataman Semyonov."
 FER_cossack_army: "Army of Free Cossacks"
 FER_cossack_army_desc: "For centuries Cossacks have been chained to the Tsar's throne, with their liberties and honour laid at the feet of the faraway despot. Even our sacrifices in the war against the satanic Bolsheviks did not change the disposition of the new government in Moscow, which kept trying to eradicate our culture and traditions. We will have no more of this - Cossacks are now free and led by themselves, and the war will not stop until whoever rules in Moscow is forced to accept that."
 FER_diterikhs_tree: "The Sword of the Spirit"
 FER_diterikhs_tree_desc: "There is no greater affront to God than a terrorist sitting in the place of a divinely appointed Tsar. Fortunately, Russian people have always been zealous in upholding their faith. We will spread the word, and the people will rise up to defend the principles of divine authority.\n\"And take the helmet of Salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\"\nEphesians 6:17"
 FER_ally_church_administration: "Clerical Administration"
 FER_ally_church_administration_desc: "The Church, with its established administrative structures, can provide organisational infrastructure for the revolt. We can leverage parochial structure to create loyal local authorities.\n\"And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.\"\nColossians 1:18"
 FER_fight_for_restoration: "The Cause of Imperial Restoration"
 FER_fight_for_restoration_desc: "During the times of the Empire, Russia was ruled by God's appointed ruler and was the defender of Orthodox faith worldwide. The current illegitimate government will be brought down with fire and sword.\n\"O God, give Your judgement to the Tsar, and Your righteousness to the Tsar's Son, that He may judge Your people in righteousness.\"\nPsalm 72:1-2"
 FER_holy_squads: "Holy Brigades"
 FER_holy_squads_desc: "With our message starting to spread all over the Far East, there is no shortage of faithful who are ready to take up arms against the pagans and idol-worshippers - they need only weaponry and training, which we are prepared to provide.\n\"I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.\"\nIsaiah 13:3"
 FER_patriarch_of_east: "Abolish the Patriarchate"
 FER_patriarch_of_east_desc: "The Moscow Patriarchate has always been an illegitimate institution, born out of separation between the State and Church. Righting this wrong by union of State and Faith will directly benefit our cause.\n\"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the Tsardom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\"\nMatthew 23:13"
 FER_lands_host: "The Lands' Host"
 FER_lands_host_desc: "Restoration of the monarchy in Russia will only be legitimate if it happens as it did in 1613. We will convene a new Lands' Host, with representatives from all stratas of the population, and formalise our commitment to finding Russia a just and kind monarch.\n\"And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a tsar to judge us like all the nations.\"\n1 Samuel 8:5"
 FER_mobilisation_tree: "Mobilise the Far East"
 FER_mobilisation_tree_desc: "In Moscow alone, there live more people than in all the lands that rose with us in revolt. To beat the enemy we will have to be more ruthless than he is - conscription into the army will be mandatory for all men of working age, with each exception needing personal authorisation from the Ataman. Of course, this will limit the amount of weapons our modest war machine can produce, but help from our Japanese friends should more than make up for the drop in productivity."
 FER_green_ukrainian_army: "The Green Ukrainian Army"
 FER_green_ukrainian_army_desc: "Yury Glushko has already earned himself a place in the history of the Russian Far East by his attempts to create here a Ukrainian state during the Russian Civil War. He failed then, and we aren't about to let him succeed now. Still, the Ukrainian movement of the Far East can be harnessed in support of our rebellion if we allow them significant cultural autonomy now and political autonomy after the war's end - by that time the Ukrainians won't be able to press their demands."
 FER_consolidate_businesses: "Favour from the Business Elite"
 FER_consolidate_businesses_desc: "Far East does not have many cities, but it does have its industry and its own business elite. Some of them ran as soon as it was clear that this territory is about to go into revolt, others remained and are waiting for us to formalise our economic policy. General Diterikhs is adamant that all industry relevant to war production has to be brought under the government's direct control. Still, others wonder - maybe we will benefit more from an alliance with the industrialists?"
 FER_take_gold: "Primorye Gold"
 FER_take_gold_desc: "Considering our dependency on timely delivery of armaments from abroad to keep the rebellion going, the existing gold mines of Primorye become even more critical to us than they were for the tyrants we're fighting against. Considering that, it would only make sense to nationalise the mines and significantly increase our revenue stream. Of course, the legitimacy of our regime must be considered - we do not want to be perceived as corrupt and greedy bandits."
 FER_freedom_rhetoric: "For a Democratic Russia"
 FER_freedom_rhetoric_desc: "Before the convention of the Assembly of the Far East, we have already promised to hold free elections after the war's end. However, many drastic measures implemented by our government, as well as strict martial law introduced on all territories under our control, made many people doubt our democratic credentials. Ataman will personally reassure the people that his promise will be kept, perhaps winning the trust of some of the democrats of the Far East."
 FER_proper_statehood: "Siberian Regionalism"
 FER_proper_statehood_desc: "Our forces continue to achieve victory after victory, and from controlling just the banks of the Amur river, we have now become true masters of Eastern Siberia. This provides us with new opportunities to strengthen our revolt - moving away from a few ragtag groups of Cossacks and bandits armed with Japanese weaponry, we can now have a real army. Of course, to make use of all the resources under our control, the government will have to be reorganised."
 FER_mass_conscription: "Organised Conscription"
 FER_mass_conscription_desc: "Uniform conscription has already been our policy from the very beginning of the revolt, though implementing it in practice has proved to be a difficult affair. Lacking a loyal and robust administration, we could only conscript the men when our Cossacks rode through towns and villages. However, thanks to our administrative reorganisation, this is already beginning to change - with our men in all corners of Eastern Siberia, the stream of recruits will only be increasing."
 FER_siberian_stavka: "Stavka of the Siberian Army"
 FER_siberian_stavka_desc: "The Far Eastern Army could be run with some effectiveness in a semi-informal fashion by the Ataman - the Siberian Army is too large to allow that. Mirroring the organisation of the Russian Imperial Army, we will create Stavka - the supreme high command of our armed forces, always attending the Ataman and helping him with strategic decision-making, directing military operations on a large scale, and allocating our limited resources effectively."
 FER_mantle_of_whites: "March of the Siberian Riflemen"
 FER_mantle_of_whites_desc: "Through every conflict that they fought in, Siberian riflemen earned for themselves a fearsome reputation for exceptional bravery, tenacity, and resilience. In this conflict, this reputation will be defended once more. The Siberian army is filled with men who were accustomed to living in a harsh environment from early childhood, and their experience with hunting made them excellent marksmen. They will not stop their march until Siberia is freed from corrupt despots in the west."
 FER_military_industrial_complex: "Far Eastern Military Industry"
 FER_military_industrial_complex_desc: "Territories that came under our control are extremely rich in natural resources, like timber, minerals, and metals. They also provide us with a large domestic labour force that can be used to produce useful armaments and equipment. Industrial machines could be imported from the Japanese, who are eager to profit from our success. Thus, we have all the components necessary for a sizeable military industry at our disposal; we only need to organise it."
 FER_logistics_corps: "Main Logistics Command"
 FER_logistics_corps_desc: "At the outset of our rebellion, the multitude of different units at our command seemed to be a significant advantage, as it gave us the numbers over the forces loyal to Moscow. However, now that we're organising a proper military force, this is becoming a problem: our logistics operations are extremely decentralised and fragmented across different units. The Main Logistics Command (Glavnoye Upravleniye Snabzheniya) will be tasked with organising it efficiently."
 FER_armoured_trains: "Dominate the Trans-Siberian"
 FER_armoured_trains_desc: "The Trans-Siberian Railway is a constant defining all combat taking place in Siberia, as the majority of supplies and troops are inevitably moving through it. We need to improvise and construct armoured trains and railway guns from old outdated trains captured by us. Although most of them are useless to us in their present state, if we succeed in equipping them with armour and guns, they will serve us as a battering ram to smash the gates of the Moscow garrisons along the railway."
 FER_armoured_train_tt: "§Y120§! units of §YArmoured Train§! is added to the national stockpile."
 FER_munitions: "Breakthrough Artillery"
 FER_munitions_desc: "Unfortunately for us, the majority of military production in Russia took place in the Ural region or in the European part of the country. Our industrial specialists have to learn on the fly, so by focusing their efforts on fewer types of equipment, we increase our odds of producing a good product. Our military is particularly interested in the production of heavy-calibre guns capable of providing enough firepower to penetrate enemy lines. Their request will be fulfilled."
 FER_cheap_armour: "Armour on Budget"
 FER_cheap_armour_desc: "Our current industrial capacity is simply not sufficient for the production of tanks that can be fielded by our adversary. However, this does not mean that we are going to give up on motorisation completely. Trucks will be distributed among our multiple cavalry divisions, significantly increasing their mobility and logistical support. We will also simplify tank designs, with the hopes of eventually putting cheaper and effective tanks in production."
 FER_recon_planes: "Far Eastern Aviation"
 FER_recon_planes_desc: "No modern conflict can be conducted without aviation. Of course, our limited resources require us to prioritise cheaper and more practical aircraft. We can never hope to match the size of the Russian air force, so we should instead focus on providing as much direct aid to our troops as possible. Given our industrial capacity, we have to settle for lighter aircraft for now."
 FER_japan_tree: "Line to Tokyo"
 FER_japan_tree_desc: "We already have a good working relationship with the Kwantung Army, but the support we are getting could increase tenfold if we managed to secure the official backing of Tokyo. Fortunately, many people in our high command had already worked with the Japanese during the Russian Civil War, so convincing them to aid us in this affair will not be too difficult. While Japan is wary of getting into a direct conflict with Russia, the rewards for aiding us are too great to pass up."
 FER_lease_dalzavod: "Lease Vladivostok Docks"
 FER_lease_dalzavod_desc: "Dalzavod has been the primary Russian shipyard on the Pacific since 1887, and its proud reputation is well established by now. However, with the current war taken into account, we won't have any money for shipbuilding any time soon. To save the jobs of the workers of Dalzavod, increase our revenue, and endear ourselves to our friends in Tokyo, the shipyards of Vladivostok will be leased to a subsidiary of Mitsui for the duration of 10 years."
 FER_mineral_wealth: "Mineral Extraction Zaibatsus"
 FER_mineral_wealth_desc: "With the majority of our financial resources going towards supporting the war, we are left with very little money for internal development. This is yet another field where our Japanese allies can help us - the possibility of the Empire to profit from Russian Far Eastern resources has been one of the primary reasons behind their decision to support our righteous rebellion, so they will gladly help us explore and extract new sources of raw materials."
 FER_trade_agreement: "Contacts with Mitsui"
 FER_trade_agreement_desc: "One of the Zaibatsus most interested in improving the relationship with us is Mitsui, who engaged in significant political lobbying efforts to garner support for the Far Eastern Army from the Japanese government. They hope that their actions will lend them a position of unique preference in regards to control over our natural resources, as well as expand their market presence in the Amur region. If we fulfil their requests, more aid will follow."
 FER_heavy_equipment: "Seek Heavier Equipment"
 FER_heavy_equipment_desc: "Japan has already provided us invaluable support in arming our divisions with infantry equipment, but we must continually push them for more. The government in Moscow believes us to be of little threat compared to the Germans, so the forces opposing us are the weakest Russia has to offer. Therefore, if we get our hands on tanks and airplanes, the balance of power will decidedly swing in our direction, securing freedom for us and profits for our benefactors."
 FER_heavy_industry: "Expand Metallurgical Sector"
 FER_heavy_industry_desc: "While armaments constitute a big part of the foreign aid that we are receiving, it is clear that this state of affairs won't be useful to us indefinitely. The more lands we conquer and the more men enlisted in our army, the more we will have to rely on domestic military production to cover our needs. To prepare for that future, we will ask Japanese industrial experts to establish a powerful metallurgical sector that will be the foundation of our military industry."

 ### Post-War focuses
 FER_masters_over_siberia: "Masters of Siberia"
 FER_masters_over_siberia_desc: "The war is finally over; we have outlasted the tyrants from Moscow, and their decisive defeat leaves us as the new dominant power in Siberia. From a few bands of disgruntled Cossacks, we have grown to one of the largest states in the world in the span of a few years, so we will need to take an operational pause to consolidate our gains. The new geopolitical situation also has to be assessed: will we continue the fight to unite Russia or try to build a new state from its ashes?"
 FER_rival_government: "Declare All-Russian Government"
 FER_rival_government_desc: "The reality we face is scary in its simplicity: the Russian State has fallen, and its core territories are now under the control of ruthless foreign occupiers. To preserve the principles of Russian sovereignty, we must fill the vacuum of power created by this tragedy. By officially positioning ourselves as the legitimate government of Russia, we will proclaim to the entire world our intention to see a Russia free from tyranny and foreign intervention, from Petrograd to Vladivostok."
 FER_integrate_administration: "Integrate Old Administration"
 FER_integrate_administration_desc: "After our official proclamation of ourselves as the legitimate Russian government, it would be reasonable to connect ourselves to the more well-intentioned members of the administration formerly loyal to Moscow. Naturally, all diehard Svobodniks and Socialists will be purged, but the integration of mostly apolitical technocrats and bureaucrats into our administration will serve as proof of continuity of government and significantly increase our control over Siberia."
 FER_russian_army: "Remake the Russian Army"
 FER_russian_army_desc: "The proclamation of the All-Russian Government positions us as a certain enemy to the powers that have conquered the European part of Russia. To have any chance of succeeding where the Moscow government failed, the reformed Russian army and air force have to be significantly increased, so we will continue to pour a large part of our resources towards the military even in peacetime. All true patriots will be allowed to join us in the crusade to restore Russia."
 FER_to_moscow: "Crusade to Restore Russia"
 FER_to_moscow_desc: "The two world wars have gone terribly for Russia: we lost our richest territories in the first one and let the enemy squat in the Kremlin in the second one. However, nothing can defeat the Russian spirit. Just like Minin and Pozharsky in 1612, we have mobilised the Russian people in a holy crusade to kick the foreigners out once and for all. The upcoming war will be long, gruelling, and hard, but with God and justice on our side, we are left with no choice but to win."

 FER_siberian_state: "Solidify Siberian Regime"
 FER_siberian_state_desc: "The reality we face is scary in its simplicity: the Russian State has fallen, and its core territories are now under the control of ruthless foreign occupiers. Our Ataman realises perfectly well that if a united Russia could not win in the Second Weltkrieg, we stand no hope of success in a potential campaign to free the western parts of the country. Therefore, it would be reasonable to consolidate our rule over Siberia and reap the spoils of our successful war for freedom."
 FER_align_japan: "Align Japanese Empire"
 FER_align_japan_desc: "We would never have been successful in our war for independence if it were not for the aid of the Japanese Empire. They supplied us with crucially important weaponry and armaments early on, saving our rebellion from being eliminated by better-armed loyalists, and they helped us build a strong economy in the later stages of the conflict. We can return the favour by welcoming all kinds of Japanese influence in our country, and officially join their military alliance."
 FER_banish_japanese: "Banish the Japanese"
 FER_banish_japanese_desc: "Japan was never a true friend to ourselves; they only supported the rising star of the Far Eastern Army to neutralise the Russian threat and extract economic benefits while doing so. With the war for our existence having come to a successful conclusion, we no longer have to tolerate their pervasive influence in our country. All economic concessions will be voided immediately, Japanese advisors will be sent home packing, and our natural resources will belong to us only."
 FER_home_in_east: "Home in the East"
 FER_home_in_east_desc: "Many of our citizens are still doubtful that an independent Siberian state will be a viable alternative to being a part of Russia, doubly so due to the military-centric way of governance that we have been adopting so far. To mollify their fears, we will considerably reduce our military expenditures and instead direct our revenues from exporting raw materials towards improving local industry and infrastructure throughout Siberia. Let no one feel forgotten."
 FER_siberian_hetmanate: "Siberian Atamanate"
 FER_siberian_hetmanate_desc: "Siberia exists as it does today mainly due to the heroics of the Cossacks of the past and present, who shaped the history of this land from the times when Yermak Timofeyevich crushed the Khanate of Sibir to Grigory Semyonov, who has freed this land from Muscovite centralism and tyranny. It is only natural that Siberia needs a unique form of government; much like the central role in Ukraine belongs to the Hetman, our country will be ruled by its Ataman."
 FER_siberian_republic: "Siberian Republic"
 FER_siberian_republic_desc: "We already have significant issues with legitimising our rule and our newfound state; the legitimacy can be improved by formalising Siberia as a democratic republic and holding the first free elections in the independent history of the country. This will show the people that Ataman keeps his promises, and he may be open to further concessions, unlike the government in Moscow. The independent Siberia though wouldn't exist without the Ataman - and politicians know it."
 FER_cossack_nationalism: "Cossack Nationalism"
 FER_cossack_nationalism_desc: "No matter the form of government, it is clear to all that our rule in Siberia bases itself on the support of the Cossacks, so their loyalty must be secured by further concessions. Cossacks will have guaranteed representation both in local and national governments, their history and culture will be included in our curriculum, and their organisations and communities will receive financial support from the state. Cossacks will feel at home in Siberia like nowhere else in the world."
 FER_federal_framework: "Federal Framework"
 FER_federal_framework_desc: "Our revolt began as the fight for freedom against centralism, and it was defined by this idea. Many different nationalities fought to make the day of our final victory come true, and they now expect to reap the political benefits for which they paid in blood. They will not be disappointed; all peoples of Siberia will be granted their autonomous republics, where they will be free to practise their own culture, religion, and traditions without interference from the federal government."
 FER_nation_of_free_people: "Nation of Free Peoples"
 FER_nation_of_free_people_desc: "The Siberians always differed from the rest of Russians by being more resilient, independent, and self-reliant. Thanks to our victory, they can now use those qualities for nation-building without being held back by the robbers seeking to extract all valuable resources from this land while investing the bare minimum for its development. The Siberia that we have built is free, federal, and powerful, allowing its citizens the opportunity to prosper under the protection of the mighty Cossacks."

 FER_return_to_kremlin: "Return to the Kremlin"
 FER_return_to_kremlin_desc: "Even Grigory Semyonov himself did not initially expect the rebels of Amur to eventually reach and occupy the seat of government in the Kremlin, and yet here we are. Our success did not come without its costs, and we have our work cut out for us before we can say that Russia is truly ours. With our power base remaining on the other side of the Ural Mountains, special efforts will be required to pacify and bring law and order to the European part of the country."
 FER_purge_enemies: "Purge thy Enemies"
 FER_purge_enemies_desc: "In the Russian lands to the west of the Urals, there are many more people than in the entirety of Siberia. Our rule over the country may be brief if we do not proactively oppose any kind of organised resistance in the liberated territories. We will establish offices of our intelligence agencies in all the Guberniyas in the west and assign to each a number of Socialists and Svobodniks that have to be found and prosecuted monthly; punishments will be determined and carried out locally."
 FER_pacify_land: "Pacify the Land"
 FER_pacify_land_desc: "The total collapse of authority on a large part of the Eastern European Plain has immediately led to a severe rise in banditism and lawlessness, with many trained killers discharged from the army now joining various bands of criminals. The situation here reminds us of the early days of the rebellion in the Far East. Back then, we managed to convince many of the soldiers without a cause to join our side, and we will try doing the same here; select few bands will be establishing order in our name."
 FER_constitutional_assembly: "The Constituent Assembly"
 FER_constitutional_assembly_desc: "With law and order brought to the vast expanses of Russia and Svobodnik and Socialist resistance deemed inconsequential, we feel secure enough in our power to convene a Constituent Assembly in Moscow. It will define the political structure of our country for years to come, so delegates will be appointed personally by [FER.GetLeader] from our loyalists in the business community, the military, the Church, and the nationalist political sphere."

 FER_holy_rus: "Holy Rus'"
 FER_holy_rus_desc: "The Russian people had to suffer a lot before our final victory; they lived through both godless governance and foreign oppression, with a lot of blood having been shed for causes not worth supporting. At last, they will be granted a reprieve, and a monarch will be restored who will once again rule the nation with good and wholesome laws. Naturally, he will be assisted by the elected Duma, Zemsky Sobor, and Supreme Voyevoda Diterikhs, who will retain command over the armed forces."
 FER_monarchic_union: "The Russian Monarchic Union"
 FER_monarchic_union_desc: "To avoid the mistakes of the past and stave off revolution, we will renounce the multi-party political system. By forming a singular party loyal to the Tsar to a fault, we will avoid the harmful conflict of interests and ideologies influencing the policy of the restored Russia. The Russian Monarchic Union will be formed with the help of renowned politicians such as Ilyin, Shulgin, and Solonevich, and it will attract all like-minded people of good moral character from all over the country."
 FER_society_of_nicholas: "Memory of the Tsar-Martyr"
 FER_society_of_nicholas_desc: "Several decades of decadent Republican rule have started to erode the traditional foundation of Russian Autocracy - the love of the people for the Tsar and his family. The Society for the Memory of Nikolay II will be formed by a royal decree, and it will be tasked with counteracting the republican influence. Our last Tsar Nikolay II will be remembered as a martyr, with the bloodshed and disasters that followed his death being the divine punishments for our sin."
 FER_rise_voevedas: "Rule by Voyevoda"
 FER_rise_voevedas_desc: "To ensure total military readiness in the future and avoid any more humiliating defeats, in the rebuilt Tsardom of Russia, the military should be granted supreme civilian power in the oblasts and governorates. From Oleg the Wise and Svyatoslav Igorevich to Aleksandr Suvorov and Mikhail Kutuzov, Russian military leaders have been men of distinguished moral character. Voyevodas will hold supreme authority in all our military districts and administrative regions."
 FER_faith_and_tradition: "For Thine is the Tsardom"
 FER_faith_and_tradition_desc: "With all of the country now firmly united under our control, we can begin the most influential religious reform in decades. Patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, who like the Whore of Babylon served all the interests of godless Republicans, will be thrown off its gilded throne. The organisation of the Church will be returned to pre-revolutionary times - the Most Holy Synod will be restored under the Tsar's control, allowing for the Byzantine symphony to begin again."
 FER_solidarist_economy: "The Golden Rule"
 FER_solidarist_economy_desc: "The Golden Rule is quite simple: 'Treat others as you would like to be treated yourself'. This rule is the core moral principle of Christianity, and ignoring it in statebuilding in favour of unrestricted chase after personal gain or treating history as a series of dialectical conflicts has several times led our country to ruin. We do not intend to repeat those mistakes; our economy will be constructed along corporatist lines, aiming for moral business practices and inter-class unity."
 FER_behind_thistle: "Behind the Thistle"
 FER_behind_thistle_desc: "Unlike the former rulers of Russia, we only pursued our reforms to return to a traditional society firmly grounded in Christian moral principles, not to chase material benefits or an ill-defined 'progress'. We have succeeded in building an island of traditionalism in an ocean of hostile and competing ideologies, whose tendency to multiply themselves across the world likens them to a plague. To avoid getting infected with their ideas, Russia will focus on self-sufficiency."

 FER_saviour_of_republic: "Saviour of the Republic"
 FER_saviour_of_republic_desc: "People all over Russia view Ataman Semyonov claiming total power over the country with apprehension. The irregular composition of our army and the stark disconnect between our democratic rhetoric and the omnipresent rules of martial law increase the people's willingness to resist, as they do not view our government as legitimate. To rectify this situation, we will loudly proclaim the restoration of the Constitution of 1922. Of course, some safeguards will remain in place."
 FER_russian_hetmanate: "Russian Atamanate"
 FER_russian_hetmanate_desc: "There is no need to restore a federal system that has already failed to prevent centralists from coming to power and attempting to subvert Cossack autonomy. There is also no need to invent a new political system from the ground up. The state of Ukraine under the rule of Hetman Skoropadskyi was transformed into a system that would ideally fit our vision of Russia - a state united around the powerful leader of the Cossacks, but allowing some democratic concessions."
 FER_all_russian_popular_party: "All-Russian Popular Party"
 FER_all_russian_popular_party_desc: "To keep power for a long time, we will need to integrate new allies into our governing coalition. We have already co-opted the democratic movement of Siberia in support of [FER.GetLeader], and there is no reason why we can't do the same in Europe. The old democratic parties understand that our government is the only chance they have of returning to prominence, so they will have to swallow their dislike of our leader and join the All-Russian Popular Party."
 FER_appeal_to_centre: "Appeal to the Centre"
 FER_appeal_to_centre_desc: "President Semyonov does not care that much for policy, content with leaving the actual governance to his political allies, as long as they do not attempt to act against the powers of the Cossacks or the personal power of the President. This political position allows us to find many allies among those who hope that Semyonov's rule will begin a period of normalisation that will eradicate extremism and return stability and peaceful governance to Russia."
 FER_national_myths: "Formulate National Myths"
 FER_national_myths_desc: "Russia has seen a lot of wars and a lot of revolutions in the 20th century - we can use the former to prevent the latter. All far-reaching civilian projects that promised to turn our country into Heaven on Earth have failed. Only the brave men of the army have saved the nation from total collapse and subjugation by foreigners - it is only natural that Russia will be led into the future by military men. We will launch a far-reaching campaign of promoting new national heroes."
 FER_unify_the_patriots: "Rally the Veterans"
 FER_unify_the_patriots_desc: "The stability of our rule cannot depend solely on the Cossacks, who wholeheartedly recognise Semyonov as their supreme commander and Ataman. All other military men must also recognise him as their leader and supporter of their interests. We shall form the Vserossiysky Voinsky Soyuz (All-Russian Military Union), an organisation that will integrate all veteran paramilitaries across Russia. With loyal men in charge of it, our position will be greatly strengthened."
 FER_cult_of_supreme_ataman: "Cult of the Supreme Ataman"
 FER_cult_of_supreme_ataman_desc: "Skoropadskyi's great authority and power in Ukraine stemmed from his success in creating a larger-than-life image for himself - a successful military officer, the leader of the Cossacks, the creator of the Ukrainian state. To repeat his success, we will have to create a similar cult of personality around the great Ataman Semyonov - the saviour of the Russian nation from tyranny and foreign oppression, chosen by destiny to lead our people to greatness."
 FER_empower_old_elites: "Empower Old Elites"
 FER_empower_old_elites_desc: "The revolution of 1917 began with the dissatisfaction of the Russian elites, who lost faith that the Tsar represented their interests sufficiently well. To avoid such a scenario from repeating itself when the central government is even weaker than back then, we will endeavour to fulfil their wishes. Our regime will stand staunchly on guard of private property rights, principles of economic deregulation, and conservative moral values."
 FER_restore_autonomies: "Restore the Autonomies"
 FER_restore_autonomies_desc: "To further improve our legitimacy and entrench our regime for good, we can fulfil another of the key promises our revolt was based on: the protection of autonomies. Minorities of Russia will all receive a right to self-governance, preservation, and promotion of their national cultures - rights that have been trampled by the old governments. Naturally, Cossack hosts and Siberians will receive the most benefits under this system, as they were the ones who brought us into power."
 FER_relax_economy: "Relax the Economy"
 FER_relax_economy_desc: "We have already begun the programme of freeing up the economy, as our most influential businesses have received tax breaks, deregulation, and investment incentives in return for their loyalty. This will continue as we start applying the same principles in economic relations with other countries. Russia is unrivalled in the amount of natural resources we could export to the world; if we can make some new trade deals, we could enrich ourselves beyond measure."

 FER_restore_army: "Restore the National Army"
 FER_restore_army_desc: "Deeds of the heroes who marched from the Pacific to the Kremlin shall live on forever, but they are not enough to garrison our vast empire. Army structures built by the interwar years are still needed, and must be restored to glory."
 FER_restore_air_force: "Restore the Air Force"
 FER_restore_air_force_desc: "We had no industrial ability to field large air force in the East, but now with all of Russia in our hands, we need to build proper organisation for that."
 FER_restore_navy: "Rebuild the Navy"
 FER_restore_navy_desc: "Russian Fleet cannot be ignored in defence of our Empire from Petrograd to Vladivostok. Battleship strenght is where our might will lie in the future."

 FER_great_power_again: "Great Power Renewed"
 FER_great_power_again_desc: "A country spanning more than one ninth of the world's landmass, populated by tens of millions of people, and located on the critical intersection of Europe and Asia would naturally arise to be a great power. Of course, recent wars and even complete collapses of our statehood have shaken that image of our country, but through a committed programme of rebuilding our army and navy, we are once again strong enough to project our power abroad and influence world affairs."
 FER_crusade_against_communism: "Crusade Against Communism"
 FER_crusade_against_communism_desc: "The world can only be safe for the restored Russia if the menace that once brought it near destruction is utterly eradicated. The Reds will pay for what they did to Russia in 1917: we shall get our ultimate revenge."
 FER_finish_the_turks: "The Pretender to Rome"
 FER_finish_the_turks_desc: "One must almost feel bad for the Turkish oppressors - they would have been destroyed in the First World War had it not been for the hated Germans. But with Russian power restored, the Turks must be brought into the fold as soon as possible, and the Holy City of Constantinople restored to the Faithful."
 FER_siberian_periphery: "The Siberian Peripheries"
 FER_siberian_periphery_desc: "Our insurrection was not a European one, but an Asian one. While we need not retreat from European affairs, we must remember that our natural sphere of influence is along our southern and eastern borders."
 FER_revenge_for_1905: "Revenge for Varyag"
 FER_revenge_for_1905_desc: "The Japanese were foolish to believe that they could bankroll our rebellion and use us for their own interests. Seemingly thinking that they could use the Far East as a buffer against Russia, their plan has failed spectacularly, and now we are in a position to get back at them for all the trouble they caused us years ago. Like famous last stand of cruiser Varyag, we will fight to the last!"
 FER_eradicate_western_influence: "Eradication of Western Influence"
 FER_eradicate_western_influence_desc: "Russia, the great defender of the Orthodox Faith, was destroyed by modernity and westernism ever since the ascension of Peter to the throne. Deeming all that was traditional and rooted in faith as 'backwardness', they declared war on the Russian spirit. But this spirit did not die - and only by destruction of the modernist warmongers can we be sure it stays aflame."
 FER_eradicate_western_influence_tt: "Declares war on every §mMarket Liberal§!, §lSocial Liberal§!, §SSocial Democrat§!, §RRadical Socialist§!, §rSyndicalist§!, and §oTotalist§! nation in Europe."
 FER_join_old_allies: "Rekindle the Old Alliance"
 FER_join_old_allies_desc: "The Entente has been both a friend and enemy of circumstance. In the new era, where Germany further attempts to cement its dominance over the world, the Entente is the only bastion that stands against it. Russia's inclusion in this bloc of powers would at least give Berlin a reminder that its foes have been beaten, but they will never be defeated."

 fer.1.t: "Bureau for Liberation of Russia"
 fer.1.d.szrs: "The Far East is in chaos. Following the rebellion of the Amur-Ussuri Cossacks and the fall of Primorye into the hands of warlord Grigory Semyonov, he was elected as Chief of State of Free Siberia. The organisation convened in Blagoveshchensk, the capital of the Amur Cossacks, with both Cossack delegates and local Russians, largely from anti-Savinkovite groups. The Bureau for Liberation of Russia was created under the protection of Ataman Semyonov and his military allies with one goal: to free Russia from Boris Savinkov and his cronies. How effective Semyonov's campaign will be - no one knows."

Following the rebellion of the Amur-Ussuri Cossacks and the fall of Primorye into the hands of warlord Grigory Semyonov, he was elected as Chief of State of Free Siberia. The organisation convened in Blagoveshchensk, the capital of the Amur Cossacks, with both Cossack delegates and local Russians, largely from anti-socialist groups. In the first session of the parliament, the Bureau for Liberation of Russia was created under the protection of Ataman Semyonov and his military allies, with one goal: to free Russia from Communism. Immediately, Siberian anti-socialist resistance found its champion and focal point to rally behind. Is this the birth of a new White Movement?"
 fer.1.a: "To the west!"
 fer.1.b: "Treason and banditry."

 fer.2.t: "The Enemy of My Enemy"
 fer.2.d: "The mood was sour as Grigory Semyonov's Chinese Khunkhuz forces, alongside small bands of local Russian forces, entered Khabarovsk from the south, while Yury Savitsky's Cossack forces came from the west. Khabarovsk garrison had fallen under the command of General Fyodor Emilyevich Bredov, Mikhail Diterikhs' ally and his brother-in-law. There was almost a shootout between 'Diterikhsites' and 'Semyonovites', but Bredov's intervention kept the peace.\n\nAtaman Semyonov arrived in the city the next day, having ridden like the storm from battles south of Khabarovsk. Yes, Semyonov and Diterikhs had planned the operation together, but it was obvious that Diterikhs was not happy working with someone who was essentially a glorified bandit, and some kind of disagreement had been expected. But even with the garrison of Khabarovsk and the headquarters of the Far Eastern Military District in Diterikhs' hands, he simply did not have the manpower to resist Semyonov's forces.\n\nSo, the two men and their inner circles met in the headquarters of the Far Eastern Military District to hash out an agreement. Semyonov had the men and the foreign backing, while Diterikhs had the support of the professional officer corps. Ultimately, he agreed to Semyonov serving as Commander-in-Chief and de facto leader of the state, while Diterikhs became his Chief of Staff and de facto war minister. The rest of the positions of influence were divided between Semyonovites and Diterikhsites like bandits carving out their plunder. Semyonov's ally, Sergey Afanasyevich Tashkin, was chosen as the de facto prime minister as a more moderate, civilian administrator capable of managing affairs on the home front while the military men focused on conquest."
 fer.2.a: "Let us see how long the alliance lasts."
 FER_bop_tt: "The Balance of Power between §PSemyonovites§! and §0Diterikhsites§! is fickle, and all military personnel have alignment to one direction or the other. Ideally, sides are able to cooperate, but too many failures on Semyonov's part may expose him to Diterikhs' schemes."

 fer.3.t: "An Army or Rabble?"
 fer.3.d: "General Mikhail Diterikhs angrily stormed into the Arkhipov tenement building, home to Semyonov's headquarters. He bombarded his superior with complaints - it is impossible to instil proper discipline in the army when Semyonov allows his rabble to do as they please. The Cossacks and the Khunkhuzs spend more time raiding the countryside than actually exercising, and while they have been effective in combat, their ability to coordinate with proper units is abysmal. When Diterikhs tried to put them into order, they refused, appealing to Semyonov for their operational independence. Of course, a control freak like Diterikhs would try to restrict freedom-loving Cossacks and soldiers of fortune!"
 fer.3.a: "This is just called partisan warfare."
 fer.3.b: "Even if boring, Mikhail Konstantinovich is right."

 fer.4.t: "Semyonovite Commanders Replaced"
 fer.4.d: "As Chief of Staff, it falls upon General Diterikhs to handle the everyday management of the Far Eastern Army, while Semyonov handles the more all-encompassing matters of state. This has led - according to some - to the blatant favouritism of officers from the Circle of Saint George and other Diterikhsite sycophants. Some Semyonovite officers have been shuffled into less important duties, or replaced with more experienced monarchist officers suspected to be loyal to Diterikhs. Should Semyonov's office countermand such orders?"
 fer.4.a: "I mean, his candidates ARE more competent."
 fer.4.b: "Yeah, this is just a petty scheme."

 fer.5.t: "Attempt on Semyonov's Life"
 fer.5.d: "Just outside Khabarovsk, Ataman Grigory Semyonov was ambushed by two Cossacks. The soldiers used their rifles to open fire at Ataman's Nissan 70, but Semyonov - ever paranoid - avoided death and was only lightly wounded, as his chauffeur and one of his bodyguards died immediately. In a day-long manhunt, Semyonov's Cossacks hunted down the assassins. They were court-martialled and shot, but they refused to elaborate on their plot, no doubt protecting other co-conspirators. Semyonov was sure that these men had been ordered by Diterikhs to take his life, but there is no proof."
 fer.5.a: "I will deal with this later."
 fer.5.b: "Tell Diterikhs to send better men next time."

 fer.6.t: "Spies in Diterikhs' Staff"
 fer.6.d: "For some time, General Diterikhs has been organising recruitment campaigns for officers fleeing Russia or being taken in as prisoners of war, preferring monarchist recruits. Just now, Gurgen Asriyants, Semyonov's chief of the Information Bureau, accused two recent recruits of Diterikhs' for spying and relaying information to Moscow. It would be easy to simply make these men disappear without a trace, but it could also be publicised and used against Diterikhs."
 fer.6.a: "Just get rid of them."
 fer.6.b: "Diterikhs recruited SPIES."

 fer.7.t: "A Spy in Semyonov's Staff?"
 fer.7.d: "Rumours about Gurgen Asriyants' true allegiance have been circulating in Khabarovsk. Asriyants, who serves as the chief of Semyonov's Information Bureau, is an odd Armenian exile who got in touch with Semyonov's clique recently. Thanks to his connections and experience in Russian intelligence before dishonourable retirement arranged by his superior, he was tasked by Semyonov to organise his intelligence operations. However, rumours from an unknown source claim that Asriyants is secretly a double-agent selling information to Moscow."
 fer.7.a: "Nonsense, he is a good man."
 fer.7.b: "I suppose it is a bullet in the head, then."

 fer.8.t: "The Night-Life of Khabarovsk"
 fer.8.d: "It is no secret that Semyonov has very good relations with the Japanese and often spends nights in the best restaurants with associates from the Kwantung Army and Japanese industries. There he is no doubt making backroom deals, giving him more arms and the Japanese more control over our resources. Recently, it was revealed how massive of a loan Semyonov took from a number of Zaibatsu businessmen, which he immediately spent on weaponry with zero coordination with Diterikhs or the Quartermaster department on what is actually needed by the army. This sparked another debate between Diterikhs and Semyonov, as the former is accusing the Ataman of selling out Russia and being wholly incapable of long-term military planning."
 fer.8.a: "Semyonov assures he will not do it in the future."
 fer.8.b: "Diterikhs is CHIEF OF STAFF, not MINISTER OF FINANCE."
 fer.8.c: "This blows up in Semyonov's face."

 fer.9.t: "The Kalmykovites"
 fer.9.d: "Ivan Pavlovich Kalmykov, one of Semyonov's top generals and, like Semyonov, a Cossack Ataman, is an infamous man. He is brave, violent, greedy, and now that he is back in command, none of these aspects have brought any good. Kalmykov's division has quickly become infamous, leaving a path of destruction and pillaging everywhere they go. There have been many complaints about them turning locals against our cause, but what finally made things snap in the headquarters was reports of the pillaging of the Holy Odigitriyevsky Cathedral in Buryatia.\n\nKalmykov's men took over the Cathedral, stole its valuables, and made it their temporary headquarters, telling the priests to move into a smaller local church. Overnight, much of the wealth was spent on alcohol, prostitutes, or simply pocketed by the Cossacks.\n\nNaturally, Mikhail Diterikhs was extremely insulted by this and is preparing to strip Kalmykov's ranks and declare them to be apprehended. This would turn Kalmykov's men into bandits, free to be hunted down by our forces. But then again - he is a useful man, say what you will."
 fer.9.a: "These things happen."
 fer.9.b: "Have him court-martialled."

 fer.10.t: "Stab in the Back"
 fer.10.d.default: "As Semyonov's and Diterikhs' relations have become increasingly strained, tensions between their supporters have been growing steadily. But Diterikhs acted first. In the dead of night, General Nikolay Bredov's Rifle Division entered Khabarovsk, while the garrison was ordered to stand down by Diterikhs. Before Semyonov could know what happened, his personal security force around the Arkhipov Building was forced to surrender after a brief firefight, and a half-dressed Semyonov was arrested by Bredov's men. He went down kicking and screaming, trying to reach for a revolver and then a sabre unsuccessfully.\n\nIn the morning, he was dragged to the Military Court and accused of selling Russian national secrets to the Japanese government, gross mismanagement of state property, and corruption. Whatever the court decree would be, one thing was clear: Mikhail Diterikhs would assume leadership over the Bureau for Liberation of Russia, and thus the conduct of the war in Siberia."
 fer.10.d.fadingsun: "News from Tokyo has sent immediate tremors to our own corner of Siberia. The moment it was clear that Semyonov had lost his great backer, there were vultures circling around the Ataman. The greatest of those vultures is Mikhail Diterikhs himself, who swooped in almost immediately.\n\nIn the dead of night, General Nikolay Bredov's Rifle Division entered Khabarovsk, while the garrison was ordered to stand down by Diterikhs. Before Semyonov could know what happened, his personal security force around the Arkhipov Building was forced to surrender after a brief firefight, and a half-dressed Semyonov was arrested by Bredov's men. He went down kicking and screaming, trying to reach for a revolver and then a sabre unsuccessfully.\n\nIn the morning, he was dragged to the Military Court and accused of selling Russian national secrets to the Japanese government, gross mismanagement of state property, and corruption. Whatever the court decree would be, one thing was clear: Mikhail Diterikhs would assume leadership over the Bureau for Liberation of Russia, and thus the conduct of the war in Siberia."
 fer.10.a: "Humble him, but let him continue serving."
 fer.10.b: "Exile him from Russia, for the second time."
 fer.10.c: "He is a traitor to the Motherland."

 fer.11.t: "The Krasnov Organisation"
 fer.11.d.soc: "Our ranks grew today with the legend of the Kuban, Ataman Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov. The old Cossack general and his organisation have been conducting sabotage and espionage against the communist regime in Moscow, but now the situation has become too tenuous, and his circle has been forced to flee, with many being taken into the dungeons of the VGPU. Krasnov has already endorsed our regime as the 'morally just' Russian government."
 fer.11.d.szrs: "Our ranks grew today with the legend of the Kuban, Ataman Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov. The old Cossack general ended up in a battle of wills with the Vozhd and lost due to his attempt to rally Cossack resistance. Krasnov and some of his supporters conducted sabotage and espionage against the Kremlin, but were forced to flee, lest all of them would have ended up in the dungeons of Gosstrazha. Krasnov has already endorsed our regime as the 'morally just' Russian government."
 fer.11.a: "Welcome!"
 fer.11.b: "He thinks too much of himself."

 fer.12.t: "Bombing by the Krasnov Organisation"
 fer.12.d: "A bomb went off in the headquarters of the Ural Military District in Yekaterinburg, killing seven, including General-Major Filipp Yershakov. The Krasnov Organisation, a terrorist clique led from the Far East by former Ataman and arch-reactionary Pyotr Krasnov and [FER.GetLeader], claimed responsibility for the act. And for what reason? Because the Krasnovites wish to restore the monarchy, bring back the oppression of the 1910s, and shackle the Russian soul once again. We cannot let that happen."
 fer.12.a: "Tighten security, make arrests to spread fear."
 fer.12.b: "Just focus on investigation."

 fer.13.t: "The Glory Days"
 fer.13.d: "General Vyacheslav Ivanovich Volkov has served as Diterikhs' Chief of Staff and de facto prime minister, largely tasked with keeping things at home running. While Volkov is good at this, and he is a trusted confidant of Diterikhs', he has frequently asked to be at the frontline. He is an old war horse of the civil war, Butcher of Ufa and the Siberian Cossack General, but no measure of patriotic zeal can combat age and health.\n\nStill, Volkov has once again requested to gain a frontline posting, one in the most heated section of the frontline, to 'feel alive once more.' Diterikhs has been lukewarm to the idea, considering Volkov more useful at home... but then again, it is his sincere request."
 fer.13.a: "You are more useful here."
 fer.13.b: "Go with God, Vyacheslav Ivanovich!"

 fer.14.t: "The Tomsk People's Army"
 fer.14.d: "As our offensive pushes west, we have encountered forces belonging to the 'People's Army of the Siberian Liberation Committee', occupying part of the countryside north of Tomsk. Led by the Socialist-Revolutionary and Boldyrevite Mikhail Bonifatyevich Shatilov, they claim to fight for a free and democratic Russian republic, and their irregular forces are currently advancing towards Tomsk and Ob.\n\nOne small problem: they are in our way. Their forces are poorly equipped and organised, and if we wanted to, we could simply treat them as enemies and give it no more thought. However, it would not be taken well by the peasants of the region, who are currently supporting Shatilov's committee. Instead, we could try to negotiate, and perhaps gain an alliance - Shatilov is a Siberian regionalist, after all."
 fer.14.a: "They are just bandits."
 fer.14.b: "Let's hope they are reasonable."

 fer.15.t: "Expectations in Siberia"
 fer.15.d: "With most border crossings to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria secured and the latest shipment of Japanese arms delivered, [ROOT.GetLeader] has started to ponder how far Japanese patience can truly take him into Siberia before they run dry and expect their efforts to bear fruit.\n\nGeneral Masanobu Tsuji knows that for [ROOT.GetLeader] to succeed, the rebellion must find its feet first, but as an ambassador to Japan, ever more pressure is being applied on a weekly basis to the results."
 fer.15.a: "Let's see how far they'll take us."

 fer.20.t: "Mobilising the Primorye Economy"
 fer.20.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader] requested the presence of all the major business owners of the areas in control of the Far Eastern Army to reach an understanding on their support for the war. There have already been cases of banditry, many supply chains have collapsed, and the local elite fear losing their property. The richest man in Amur, Nikolay Pavlovich Mordin, owns multiple gold mines in the region and has expanded his empire to fabric and timber factories in Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk. The owner of Dalzavod, Viktor Vologdin - Vladivostok's largest employer - has fled to the west, to our best knowledge. Additionally, there are a handful of others present at the meeting.\n\nThe industrialists, understanding our need for funds, promise to loan our government as much money as we need (which is daring, considering bonds issued by us are almost worthless) as long as they are left alone to do as they please. This was also supported by de facto prime minister Sergey Tashkin. However, Vyacheslav Volkov, Diterikhs' spokesman in the negotiations, disagreed with such laissez-faire treatment, and argued that all businesses relevant to the war effort should be put under the military-industrial committee and their products directed to the military. After all, there is nothing these men could do to stop us if we decided to take their properties by force."
 fer.20.a: "Respect their property, and accept their funding."
 fer.20.b: "Put the relevant industries under our direct control."

 fer.21.t: "The Gold of Amur"
 fer.21.d: "Our land is harsh and not terribly populated, but we have something that has made empires rise and fall in the past: gold. In the mountains of Primorye and Amur, vast amounts of gold lie untapped. The imperial regime was only beginning large-scale extraction, and in the 1920s many great mines were opened with cheap Chinese labour from the other side of the border. Now these mines are what fund our war, and what afford us to pay the troops and equip them.\n\nBut more could be pushed. Nationalisation of the mines would increase our budget greatly, even if it would make an enemy out of the richest man in Amur... though he would likely be the former richest man should we take his mines."
 fer.21.a: "Just squish more taxes out of them."
 fer.21.b: "The land his belongs to us."

 fer.22.t: "The Arrival of Annenkov"
 fer.22.d: "The Annenkovites arrived today in Vladivostok. General Boris Vladimirovich Annenkov is an infamous Ataman and the Governor of Semirechye from the Civil War, whose forces committed horrible atrocities, even compared to the everyday horrors of that fratricidal war. For this, Annenkov had no place in Russia, and rather chose self-exile than to be stripped of his ranks and titles, possibly worse. So, the enterprising Boris Vladimirovich served as a mercenary, military expert for hire, and commander of his small band of loyal men in various Chinese conflicts, and finally landed in service of the Dogmeat General, Zhang Zongchang.\n\nBut even a mercenary grows tired of pointless war, and Annenkov was attracted to our cause by Semyonov's promise of pardon. Such is the way how Mother Russia calls her sons when the time is most dire."
 fer.22.a: "Cossacks must stand together."

 fer.23.t: "General [FER.GetLeader] and His War"
 fer.23.d: "War is ongoing in the north, as old General [FER.GetLeader] and his [FER.GetName] are battling with forces loyal to Moscow. This uprising has the backing of the Siberian Cossacks, Yakuts, Buryats, and other various dissidents. They are requesting our support to ride against the tyrant in Moscow like Sternberg rode in 1918. What is in it for us? Fighting for a just cause, and a sizable amount of gold from the Amur mines to 'persuade' us."
 fer.23.a: "Their cause is worthwhile."
 fer.23.b: "This is an exercise in insanity."

 fer.2300.t: "Mongolia Ignores Us"
 fer.2300.d: "The Mongolian government explained that they have no interest in starting a war with Russia. Cowards!"
 fer.2300.a: "Whatever."
 fer.2300.b: "Fine, we shall invade them too."

 fer.24.t: "Mongolia has Agreed"
 fer.24.d: "The Mongolian government responded to our call for arms. They are ready to sign a treaty of alliance with us, and stand together against the tyrant [RUS.GetLeader]. We will ride together through Siberia like a whirlwind!"
 fer.24.a: "The beginning of something great."
 fer.24.b: "Invite the Central Asian states too!"

 fer.25.t: "Liberation of the Peoples of Siberia"
 fer.25.d: "What do the men in Moscow know of lives here in the furthest Siberia? Nothing! [RUS.GetLeader] can keep the Kremlin, but the land belongs to us, the Siberians. Not just the Russians or Ukrainians - but the Yakuts, Evenks, Buryats, Evens, Chukchi... Many have fond memories of the 1920s, when under the republic these lands enjoyed relative autonomy in their own matters, and their traditional ways of life were not being persecuted as they are now. The Young Yakut National Party has been banned, the Buryat-Mongolian People's Party was dispersed.\n\n[FER.GetLeader] may be a mere warlord, but to many separatists, it seems a better chance than to meekly go into the night without resistance. The Yakut national resistance has been especially strong, conducting campaigns of non-compliance and freeing political prisoners in raids, and they can be a true asset to our cause against the tyranny of Moscow."
 fer.25.a: "To freedom!"

 fer.26.t: "The Khunkhuzs"
 fer.26.d: "The Khunkhuzs, or Honghuzi, are hardy outlaws who make their living in the unforgiving Russo-Manchurian frontier. These bands of bandits have been a common thorn to both Qing and Russian administrations, but to Ataman Semyonov, they are a surprisingly useful resource.\n\nIn the 1920s, many of the Honghuzi gangs developed further, slowly becoming more of a local military force, sometimes against and sometimes for Zhang Zuolin. They were the real law in the frontier, with their robbery, smuggling, and illegal mining operations bringing substantial cash to them. However, after Zhang Zuolin's regime started to put the frontiers under better control, many were driven even more north - and eventually found their way into Semyonov's army, paid in loot and gold.\n\nDespite common hatred for these Chinese mercenaries, Semyonov has grown strangely fond of them, often comparing them favourably to the Cossacks."
 fer.26.a: "Ensure they are paid properly."
 fer.26.b: "The payment is land they conquer!"

 fer.27.t: "The Honghuzi Ataman"
 fer.27.d: "Many bandits of northern Manchuria have fled north and joined with Grigory Semyonov's forces as mercenaries, attracted by the riches of Siberia. While it does mean we lose some amount of skilled horsemen we could normally recruit, it will make northern regions safer - for now, at least."
 fer.27.a: "Good riddance, I suppose."

 fer.28.t: "Siberian Labour Camps"
 fer.28.d.szrs: "During Boris Savinkov's Voskhod programme, many of the most distant regions of Russia were developed and their resources tapped. Some workers came from state artels, but especially in the most accursed regions of Russia, such as the mines of the Kolyma Valley, were operated with prisoner workforces through Rasolkos, Worker-Soldier Penal Colonies. Our forces have liberated the first of these work camps and found them in chaotic conditions after the retreat of government forces. Many of them still have functional gold, platinum, or tungsten mines."
 fer.28.d.soc: "Russia has a long tradition of penal colonies exploiting Siberia's resources. From imperial Katorgas to Boris Savinkov's Worker-Soldier Penal Colonies (Rasolkos), the latest version are Koretrud Rehabilitative Labour Colonies operated by the socialist government. Our forces have liberated the first of these work camps and found them in chaotic conditions after the retreat of government forces. Many of them still have functional gold, platinum, or tungsten mines."
 fer.28.a: "Continue operating them with prisoners."
 fer.28.b: "Sell mining rights to Amur companies and the Japanese."
 fer.28.c: "Leave them to be forgotten."

 fer.29.t: "Declaration of War for Restoration"
 fer.29.d: "Until now, the ideology of the 'Far Eastern Government' has been vague at best, focusing on vague opposition to Moscow, defence of Siberian regional interests, and traditionalism. It all changed recently, as Vyacheslav Ivanovich Volkov published his 'Declaration of War for Restoration of Emperor and Motherland', a government-issued pamphlet describing the ideology of the Far Eastern movement as 'inherently monarchist and traditional' and decrying [RUS.GetLeader] as a communist hell-bent on destroying the Russian way of life. It extends a call for all 'true God-loving Russians' to resist the Moscow government and fight for the restoration of the rightful Emperor on his throne."
 fer.29.a: "Onwards, brothers, for our beloved Martyr-Emperor Nikolay!"
 fer.29.b: "The Russian Empire is gone, Vyacheslav. You need to accept that."

 fer.30.t: "Brigades of the Holy Cross"
 fer.30.d: "Our cold and poor lands have no resources to speak of, except for faith. To tap into this great spiritual strength of the Russian people, General Diterikhs has formed the 'Brigades of the Holy Cross', also dubbed as Holy Brigades. They are modelled after the Volunteers of the civil war, with oaths and uniforms - but instead of Volunteer Army, it shall be a Crusader Army.\n\nThe Brigades are organised as regular military units under stricter discipline than usual, refer to each other as brothers, and swear an oath to General Diterikhs to fight to the last for Christ's Tsardom. Make no mistake - rather than just a symbolic force, Diterikhs has started shifting the best equipment and officers into these brigades, fully intending to make them the basis of his forces."
 fer.30.a: "The Sun Will Rise over Russia!"

 fer.31.t: "Religious Authority in the East"
 fer.31.d: "The Patriarchate of Moscow is a bastard of the Revolution, which replaced the Most Holy Synod with the Patriarch, a position that seems more like a temporal king than a shepherd of God's flock. The East has always been home for those deemed non-conformists by Moscow and remains so. As the Patriarch bows down to [RUS.GetLeader] and his cronies, the real faithful continue the struggle against the godless.\n\nThis brings only a natural chance to arrange religious authority in the East in a proper way, one not dictated by Moscow. General Diterikhs himself is well-read on theology and is connected to both mainstream Orthodox clergy and the Old Believers of the region, who form significant regional minorities in Eastern Siberia. A Holy Synod must be convened out of the clergy of liberated Siberia to elect a Metropolitan to serve as the Prelate of the Most Holy Synod - and matters of the Church must be solved collegially through the Synod, not through dictatorial decrees of the Patriarch.\n\nA popular choice would be Metropolitan Vissarion (Zornin), who has already been removed from his position as Metropolitan of Omsk due to conflicts with the Patriarch. Vissarion is a charismatic leader, fit to lead a schismatic Church, especially after we rule all of Russia.\n\nAnother option would be to appeal to locals, namely the Old Believers of Eastern Siberia. An Old Believer Metropolitan would be a great gesture towards the region's faithful, but it would be harder for many common Orthodox to accept. The best choice in this case would be Bishop Afanasy (Fedotov) from Verkhneudinsky - an admired and popular local figure."
 fer.31.a: "Vissarion."
 fer.31.b: "Afanasy."

 fer.32.t: "Renewal of Democratic Society"
 fer.32.d: "In the initial months after the great uprising, all of the Far East was effectively under martial law without meaningful democratic participation. However, the situation has normalised somewhat, with political parties and labour unions beginning to organise. They are looked on with suspicion by [ROOT.GetLeader] - after all, democracy has rarely achieved anything good in Russia, and the Circle of St. George is supporting a full ban on political parties and unions.\n\nThe largest group is Ivan Serebrennikov's Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia - an alliance of various liberal and centrist politicians, building on the political tradition of Right-Esers and Kadets. They are generally supportive towards the regime, at least in the sense that it offers hope for better than what is going on in Russia proper today."
 fer.32.a: "Allow them to operate as they wish."
 fer.32.b: "Ban them before they become a problem."

 fer.33.t: "The Promise of Elections"
 fer.33.d: "Sure, we claim to fight for freedom and for all those oppressed by [RUS.GetLeader]'s regime, but in practice [FER.GetLeader] runs a military dictatorship, with most people being largely apathetic towards it. As a way to build up support, Prime Minister [GetSecondInCommand] has allowed some local elections to be held for the City Dumas of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, and talked of the further restoration of pre-Savinkovite local democracy. It is hard for the audiences to assess how much of these promises are mere talk, as [FER.GetLeader] is hardly known for his support for democracy. Still, any promise of future elections is taken with joy and will inspire some more people to join our struggle."
 fer.33.a: "Elections, yeah."

 fer.34.t: "The Siberian Regional Assembly"
 fer.34.d: "The shores of Lake Baikal are ours, and with Irkutsk, all of the Russian Far East is in the hands of [FER.GetLeader]. As territory controlled by us expands, we are increasingly hard-pressed to manage all of it, considering our starting government is essentially... just a bunch of military men. So, following Sergey Tashkin's proposal, we have convened the Siberian Regional Duma to expand civilian governance. Obviously, this Duma would only be a middle manager, only allowed to do what [GetSecondInCommand]'s government allows them to do.\n\nThe broadest possible Duma would include representatives from all governorates in our control, with possibly extra delegates for Cossacks and the military. Such a broad assembly like this would give us the best legitimacy and help manage territory the best, but they might also start making demands. Alternatively, Vyacheslav Volkov suggests a system where our government appoints representatives - trusted local politicians, Metropolitans, or others - to discuss shared matters, and use their connections in favour of our government.\n\nIt's not like this needs to be any long-term decision - in case of any problems, we can simply ignore these kinds of bodies."
 fer.34.a: "Let's try an elected Duma under our control."
 fer.34.b: "An appointed Duma would make more sense."

 fer.35.t: "Svobodniks of the Far East"
 fer.35.d.soc: "The former regional leader of the Amur branch of the SZRS, Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzayevsky, has appeared before [FER.GetLeader] after some period of hiding from the socialist authorities hunting him.  Rodzayevsky, a man of a relatively unimpressive past and track record, is mainly known for his old far-right party of the Amur region until its merger with SZRS in 1934. He claims he was organising an anti-socialist sabotage cell, and that he is more than willing to join his forces with Semyonov and Diterikhs, who represent a 'more authentic form of Russian nationalism.' He is offering to organise men from former Svobodniks behind our cause."
 fer.35.d.szrs: "The former regional leader of the Amur branch of the SZRS, Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzayevsky, has appeared before [FER.GetLeader] after some period of hiding as the SZRS in our liberated territories was banned.  Rodzayevsky, a man of a relatively unimpressive past and track record, is mainly known for his old far-right party of the Amur region until its merger with SZRS in 1934. He is now pleading that he only supported Boris Savinkov out of fear, and in his heart, he is a true believer in Diterikhs' cause and his more 'authentic' form of Russian nationalism. He is offering to organise men from former Svobodniks behind our cause."
 fer.35.a: "No mercy for traitors."
 fer.35.b: "We are all together against godlessness."

 fer.36.t: "Savinkov Dead - What Now?"
 fer.36.d: "At first, the news from the prisoners of war was ignored - surely the death of Savinkov was merely a ploy to confuse our brave troops. But after the international press also wrote of the Vozhd's demise, it must be believed. This... this is terrible! We mean, how great that the tyrant is dead. General Diterikhs immediately declared that our quest is now done, and we may return home as men who fought for the right side, for true Russia. Naturally, for Semyonov, this is rather a setback - what excuse can now be used for carving out a kingdom in the Far East?"
 fer.36.a: "To the bitter end."
 fer.36.b: "Yes, the war makes no sense."

 fer.37.t: "The Far Eastern Army Collapses"
 fer.37.d: "With the death of Savinkov, much of the reason that the Far Eastern Army rose up in the first place has been tossed aside. General Diterikhs' alliance with Semyonov has ended, and Semyonov is no longer able to rally the Cossacks and peoples of Siberia to his side. As such, order has been quickly restored in the Far East."
 fer.37.a: "Warlords..."

 fer.40.t: "The Dalzavod Lease"
 fer.40.d: "The Russian Vladivostok-based enterprise Dalzavod is the main port and dock facility in the Russian Far East. These dockyards were initially nationalised after 1936 and have since then fallen into the hands of [FER.GetLeader] and his warlord regime. They have leased Dalzavod's attractive dockyard facilities to Mitsui O.S.K. - the largest shipping company in Japan."
 fer.40.a: "Our control over the Pacific grows."

 fer.41.t: "Negotiations with the Kwantung General"
 fer.41.d: "The beginnings of the 'Semyonovite Insurrection' can be traced back to the Russo-Fengtian Conflict of 1928, as Grigory Semyonov began creating plans together with the Kwantung Army to organise a campaign of sabotage and intelligence against the Trans-Siberian railroad. But this humble plan grew in scope as political developments in Russia kept increasing tensions in the Far East, genuinely creating unrest in the area.\n\nEnter 1937, when a meeting took place between Grigory Semyonov and General Masanobu Tsuji of the Kwantung Army, a proponent of the 'Northern Direction' of Japanese expansionism. With political backing from Tsuji, Semyonov's organisation received funding and armaments and was able to expand and attract Russian political dissidents, eventually striking a deal with the Circle of St. George.\n\nNow that Khabarovsk and Vladivostok have fallen to the Semyonovite forces, it is time to talk business. The Japanese goal was always economic and strategic in nature, and now it is clear that they expect returns in the form of access to Russian resources. Together with Tsuji, the Japanese government official and industrialist Naoki Hoshino has met with [FER.GetLeader] with a proposition of direct, binding sales of Primorye mining rights in exchange for further funding. It seems like the Japanese charity has run its course."
 fer.41.a: "Sign the deal immediately."
 fer.41.b: "Just give vague promises."

 fer.42.t: "The Japanese Approach the New Leadership"
 fer.42.d: "The ascension of Mikhail Diterikhs was taken cautiously by the Japanese representatives in Khabarovsk. Semyonov had been easy to make deals with, as the man was completely spineless, with no morals to speak of. But Diterikhs was a man of great determination and moral stubbornness. Religious fundamentalists such as he would not be as welcoming to dealing with foreign powers.\n\nSo, a quick meeting was arranged between General Masanobu Tsuji and Diterikhs, seeking the new Russian strongman to confirm earlier deals accepted by Semyonov. Diterikhs was always an opponent of giving too many concessions to the Japanese and considered such behaviour potentially traitorous, but even then, he does accept that Japanese material support is important to our fighting capability."
 fer.42.a: "Lukewarmly continue deals with them."
 fer.42.b: "Reduce our reliance on the Japanese."
 fer.42.c: "Banish them from our lands!"

 fer.43.t: "The Northern Direction"
 fer.43.d: "A faction in the Japanese Army has often spoken in favour of the 'Northern Resource Area', the mineral wealth of the Russian Far East. The mountains of Primorye, Okhotsk and Kolyma are full of iron, coal, tungsten, chromium, copper, zinc and gold, along with many rare earth minerals. Access to these could feed the hungry Japanese war industry. In addition, a buffer state between the Japanese Empire and Russia would improve the security of Manchuria and Korea.\n\nWe do not wish to spark direct hostilities with [RUS.GetNameDef], but the Kwantung Army and individual Japanese business conglomerates such as Mitsui have been supporting the schemes of Grigory Semyonov and other Russian dissidents dreaming of an uprising in the Amur region. After the surprising success of this 'Semyonovite Uprising', we have started to pressure [FER.GetLeader] to give mining rights to areas under his control. If his revolt is crushed, we can deny any real part, as everything is handled through private or discreet methods."
 fer.43.a: "Let us see how it goes."

 fer.44.t: "The Russo-Japanese Industrial Company"
 fer.44.d: "What began as separate holdings by companies such as Nissan and Mitsui was officialised as a zaibatsu (Japanese corporate conglomerate), named the Russo-Japanese Industrial Company. This holding company is owned partially by our government and is tasked with the exploitation of Siberian mineral wealth and selling it to Japan through Vladivostok. Mitsui has been shipping Chinese and Korean labourers to their new mines, sidestepping the issue of lack of labour in the region. In other regions, Russians are employed, though conditions have been miserable. Still, the region's resources have been rarely been tapped to this depth. Surely this will enrich us in the long term."
 fer.44.a: "Excellent."
 fer.44.b: "Negotiate a higher cut for us."
 fer.44.c: "Ensure Christian workers are treated well."

 fer.45.t: "The Opium Problem"
 fer.45.d: "After being severed from both domestic Russian industries and most of world trade, Japanese companies have stepped in to fill the gaps. They are selling many everyday industrial goods to the better-off residents of Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Blagoveshchensk and other urban centres in the region. In addition to more typical consumer goods, there has also been great growth in the opium trade as Japanese companies search for higher profits. Especially infamous are the opium-laced cigarettes produced in Korea, which combine the addictive aspects of tobacco with that of opium. Growing access to cheap opium is making its use more and more prevalent, whereas earlier it was largely a habit of middle-class Russians."
 fer.45.a: "Vodka, opium, what's the difference."
 fer.45.b: "Ban opium."
 fer.45.c: "How can we get into business?"

 fer.46.t: "Investments in Amur Pay Off"
 fer.46.d: "The creation of the Russo-Japanese Industrial Company in the Russian Far East has brought Japanese businesses good dividends, as Mitsui and Nissan have been shipping Russian ores to be refined and used by the industries of the Home Islands. While there have been local problems on the restless Russian side, with negligible costs our northern gambit has already paid off."
 fer.46.a: "Excellent."

 fer.47.t: "Acquired Mining Rights in [FER_lease.GetName]"
 fer.47.d: "Mining rights in [FER_lease.Controller.GetNameDef] have been sold to the Mitsui-Nissan zaibatsu Russo-Japanese Industrial Company at a very cheap price. The companies have already started moving labourers from Korea there to build infrastructure and improve mining facilities."
 fer.47.a: "Excellent."

 fer.48.t: "Mitsubishi Bomber Exports"
 fer.48.d: "We have avoided making any too great commitments to [FER.GetLeader]'s rogue government - so, naturally, it was not taken well when we found out that Mitsubishi sold tactical bombers to [FER.GetNameDef]. In negotiations with minister [FER.GetSecondInCommand], Mitsubishi representatives had agreed to sell a sizable amount of Ki-1 medium bombers to the Russian rebels, greatly increasing their striking power."
 fer.48.a: "Ban any further imports."

 fer.49.t: "[FER.GetName] Seeks Official Alliance"
 fer.49.d: "[FER.GetNameDef] has requested a formal treaty between our two governments. We have been avoiding any such commitments earlier, but now it seems like the regime of [FER.GetLeader] has achieved a semblance of stability - and most importantly, Russia will not pose a threat to us or them. This means that furthering our relationship is possible, and we could negotiate accession of [FER.GetName] into our economic sphere."
 fer.49.a: "Naturally!"
 fer.49.b: "We shouldn't commit to Siberia."

 fer.50.t: "[FER.GetName] Expels the Japanese!"
 fer.50.d: "Our former treaties with [FER.GetNameDef] have been all but annulled as they have expelled our military and business representatives from regions 'liberated' by [FER.GetNameDef]. This has been followed by the mass seizure of Japanese assets, leading to the collapse of the Russo-Japanese Industrial Company and mass losses to Mitsui and Nissan, the main companies which invested in Russian resources. These companies are now lobbying the Kwantung Army to respond with force and move in to secure these assets by force."
 fer.50.a: "Not like we care."
 fer.50.b: "Who do they think they are?"
 fer.50.c: "Invasion shall begin, then."

 fer.51.t: "Japan Invades Sakhalin"
 fer.51.d: "Our 'ally', the Japanese Empire, has simply informed us that they have taken North Sakhalin under their control. The Japanese forces crossed the 50th parallel marking demarcation line between Russian and Japanese side of the island, meeting only practically no resistance. Capital of Sakhalin Oblast, Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky, fell almost immediately, as its garrison was only small unit largely there to maintain order, not actually fight battles. \n\nIn communiqué by the Japanese government, they cite protection of Japanese property in oil fields of Okha and Katangli as the reason of this intervention. They are likely bolstered by Russian defeats in the battlefield, allowing the Japanese to possibly simply grab the island without later consequences. They have informed us of necessity of formal agreement that would 'stabilise the situation' on island of Sakhalin, likely strong-arming us to legitimise their land-grab."
 fer.51.a: "What the hell?"
 fer.51.b: "No we will NOT sign anything."

 ###Post-WK2 Events
 fer.52.t: "Peace in the West"
 fer.52.d: "The day has come. Moscow, the Tsaritsa of Cities, has fallen. The traitors have taken over, competing over who can sell our dear Motherland at the highest profit. As the Russian and German arms turn towards the West, a truce has also been negotiated in Siberia - even with all our might, we cannot fight all of the German Empire on our own. So we settle in our cold, new home, and bide our time. One day, Russia will be free - but oh, how much blood must be shed first."
 fer.52.a: "And blood will flow, eventually!"

 fer.55.t: "Rival Government Beyond the Urals"
 fer.55.d.semy: "The insanity that has gripped Siberia has culminated in a rival government declared by Ataman Grigory Semyonov. This upstart bandit and warlord has ridden into power by utilising the discontent of the Amur-Ussuri Cossacks and many other minority groups in Siberia - and is obviously bankrolled by the Japanese as their buffer state. Semyonov's warlord state is essentially a puppet of the Kwantung Army, yet they have the gall to claim to be the 'true Russian government', while accusing us of collaborationism with Russia's enemies."
 fer.55.d.dite: "The insanity that has gripped Siberia has culminated in a rival government declared by General Mikhail Diterikhs. This man is an ultra-religious reactionary who was expelled from the Russian army in 1929 and is now dreaming of the rebirth of Ivan the Terrible's Tsardom. Together with warlord Semyonov and Japanese backing, they took over much of Siberia, and now have the gall to claim to be the 'true Russian government', while accusing us of collaborating with Russia's enemies."
 fer.55.a: "Will the civil war ever end?"

 fer.60.t: "Purge of the Diterikhsites"
 fer.60.d: "Dear Mikhail Konstantinovich has been a constant thorn in our side. From the beginning, he had zero respect for Semyonov. So morally upright and prideful he is, as if he himself were one of Christ's apostles! While his connections have been useful, he has tried his best to challenge and sabotage Semyonov's rule. But now we do not need him anymore - or at least, we can afford to lose him. Perhaps a couple of loyal military police should pay him a visit."
 fer.60.a: "They have proven to be useful."
 fer.60.b: "They have been a constant thorn in our side."

 fer.61.t: "DNPVS-Semyonov"
 fer.61.d: "The main party in our controlled territories is the Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia, as they have enjoyed a position of 'tolerated opposition'. Semyonov has maintained a functional relationship with the president of the DNPVS, Ivan Innokentiyevich Serebrennikov. Serebrennikov is a centrist, a pragmatic liberal who understood that it is better to mobilise Siberia's liberals against the tyrannical rule of Moscow than wage a pointless war against Semyonov.\n\nBut as the conquest expanded, the party started to attract genuine supporters of Semyonov. Under the direction of Sergey Tashkin, an ex-Kadet and Semyonov's prime minister, many loyalists have joined the DNPVS in such large numbers that there is an entire wing of 'Semyonovites' in the party. They have been able to take over the DNPVS's functions in many regions, and have successfully persuaded the more liberal end of the party to cooperate."
 fer.61.a: "Politics, so easy!"

 fer.62.t: "Anointing the Supreme Ataman of All Siberia"
 fer.62.d: "Our current regime is essentially improvised, created for the purposes of waging war. Rather than giving in to the demands of the Siberian democrats, there is another option: take a feather from Pavlo Skoropadskyi's hat, and form something inspired by his Hetmanate. In the case of Siberia, the natural inspiration is the Don Cossack Ataman Yermak Timofeyevich, a man who conquered the Khanate of Sibir and furthered Siberia for Cossacks and Russians. Siberian lands have a long tradition of Cossack rule; it is only natural Semyonov assumes a similar role.\n\nAfter being elected by the Siberian Regional Duma, Grigory Semyonov was anointed in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Cathedral in Irkutsk as the Supreme Ataman, the Russian equivalent of Hetman. In this role, Semyonov is one part military leader, one part president, and one part monarch - and most importantly, he and his supporters keep their grip on all state power in Siberia."
 fer.62.a: "Yermak reborn!"

 fer.63.t: "Elections of the Siberian Republic"
 fer.63.d: "The first proper elections under Semyonov's rule were recently held. They were far from free; all separatist, communist, Svobodnik, and other terrorist parties were banned. There were some protests in response, but they were broken up by the Cossacks, and the day of the election went relatively smoothly, with the DNPVS (Democratic Popular Party of Free Siberia) winning 67% of the seats in the Siberian Duma, with its Semyonovite wing under Sergey Tashkin holding over half of these seats. The second largest party, the left-wing Union of Siberians-Federalists, held around 12% of seats, while the rest went to independent regionalists and the Muslim faction. Unsurprisingly, this Duma elected Semyonov as President of the Siberian Federative Republic with a solid majority."
 fer.63.a: "Let's maintain a tight grip."
 fer.63.b: "Work with the moderates."

 fer.70.t: "The Homecoming"
 fer.70.d: "From the windy plains of the Amur Valley to the gates of Moscow - it is truly a tale worthy of a song, comparable to the heroics of the Volunteer Army, perhaps even greater. Russia is in ruins after the years of death, but finally she is saved. There is much to be rebuilt, many to be punished, much to be healed - and many rewards to be reaped by the victorious armies that followed [ROOT.GetLeader] through Siberia."
 fer.70.a: "Finally we can rest."

 fer.71.t: "Trial of the Traitors"
 fer.71.d.soc: "After 1921, thousands of Bolsheviks were executed and imprisoned for their crimes against Mother Russia. Now, having dug up the old legislation, a second round of white terror must begin. Sure, this new breed of Russian socialist is no Lenin and could mask their crimes better, but make no mistake, they are men who hate Russia and our traditional ways of life. Political leaders such as Vladimir Levitsky and Grigory Zinovyev will be tried for their ultimate responsibility for acts committed by the socialist secret police, in addition to those who directly took part in the purges, like Yakov Blyumkin. Military courts will try the likes of Tukhachevsky, Sablin, and Yegorov, whose armies are responsible for countless deaths."
 fer.71.d.szrs: "After 1921, thousands of Bolsheviks were executed and imprisoned for their crimes against Mother Russia. Now, having dug up the old legislation, it will be used to punish these so-called 'nationalists' hell-bent on destroying our nation. Boris Savinkov is dead, but many of his lackeys were captured or surrendered, pleading for mercy. Aleksandr Derental, Flegont Klepikov, and Karol Vendzyagolsky are among the highest-ranking leaders of the regime, and even more blood is on the hands of commanders like Vladimir Manstein."
 fer.71.a: "No mercy to destroyers of Russia."
 fer.71.b: "Mercy can be a useful tool here and there."
 fer.71.c: "...for we also forgive those who sin against us."

 fer.72.t: "The Old, New Constitution"
 fer.72.d.semy: "A New Constituent Assembly has been assembled by politicians and military men deemed to be loyal to the new regime, but they are lacking direction. Until now, Semyonov's declarations have been vague, merely claiming to fight for 'freedom'. Now, a decision on the future must be made.\n\nThe path of least resistance would be to restore the 1922 Constitution and appear as the saviour of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic, building on its tradition. Only minor changes are needed to the constitution, as it already provides much power to the President and the army - and the appearance of democracy would make Semyonov's authoritarian tendencies much easier for people to tolerate. Obviously, there would be no need to arrange actually fair and competitive elections.\n\nThe other, more out-there option is Semyonov's vague concept of the Cossack Republic, a Russian take on Pavlo Skoropadskyi's Hetmanate, as Semyonov's political advisors sought to find a way to justify such a state. In practice, the constitution of the Russian State would change the position of President to Supreme Ataman, a pseudo-monarchical title combining the head of the executive branch and head of the military under the personage of Grigory Semyonov. Other than that, much of the state would remain as the old republic used to be, with the appearance of democracy."
 fer.72.d.dite: "The 1922 republic represents a perversion of the Russian idea and it led to death and destruction. Those who called for the crowning of a Romanov - Russia's natural, God-given rulers - were silenced or ignored. No more! The Constituent Assembly convened under the watch of Mikhail Diterikhs is composed of hardline monarchists, and their plan is to draft a new foundational document, returning to the past. Much of the new constitution has been penned by Ivan Ilyin and Ivan Solonevich under Diterikhs' direction.\n\nThe new constitution of the Tsardom of Russia abolishes federalism and parliamentarism. The Tsar and his imperial government have ultimate civilian power, advised by an elected Duma and Zemsky Sobor (Land Assembly) composed of the most powerful men in the realm. Military Districts will be governed by Voyevodas as general-governors, and their supreme commander-in-chief shall be Supreme Voyevoda Mikhail Diterikhs. In cooperation with the Voyevoda and the Tsar, the Orthodox Church will handle much of everyday matters from healthcare to education. The three powers of the state shall be Tsar, Warrior, and Priest, protecting the state forevermore."
 fer.72.a: "We will restore the republic."
 fer.72.b: "Russian State proved stronger."
 fer.72.c: "The new Tsardom shall rise from the ashes."

 fer.73.t: "Coronation of Nikita I"
 fer.73.d: "Today marks the day of the coronation of the first Russian monarch born in the 20th century, as the grandson of Emperor Nikolay I, Nikita Aleksandrovich Romanov, takes the Crown in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow. Any criticism over the Regency Council's decision to crown Nikita was quickly forgotten in the pious pomp of this grand event. Nikita Aleksandrovich and his wife Maria Illarionovna are young and charismatic, representing great new beginnings for Russia.\n\nOfficially, Nikita I became Grand Sovereign, by the grace of God the Tsar and Grand Prince of All Rus', Vladimir, Moscow, Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan, Tver, Yugorsk, Perm, Vyatsky, Bulgar, Astrakhan, Kazan, Siberia, the Far East, and so on. In addition, Nikita I is the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Critically, he is not the supreme commander-in-chief - instead, his Supreme Voyevoda Mikhail Diterikhs has the final say on military matters as de facto war minister.\n\nNikita I and Diterikhs greeted those marching in a great military parade as they marched through Moscow, showcasing the power and might of the new Tsardom."
 fer.73.a: "Long may he reign."

 fer.74.t: "Fate of the Russian Church"
 fer.74.d.vissarion: "Metropolitan Vissarion was made the Prelate of the Most Holy Synod in Siberia and continues to hold this position as the Russian Orthodox Church is slowly being reassembled. The Patriarchate has been officially abolished, making the Tsar once more the head of the Church. The bishops of the Most Holy Synod govern the church under his wise leadership. In hindsight, choosing a more conservative option in Vissarion was a better choice for winning over the hearts of Orthodox faithful in Russia proper."
 fer.74.d.afanasy: "Metropolitan Afanasy was already a controversial choice as the Prelate of the Most Holy Synod in Siberia, even if that enabled us to win over local Old Believers far more easily. The Patriarchate has been officially abolished, making the Tsar once more the head of the Church. The bishops of the Most Holy Synod govern the church under his wise leadership. Now, Afanasy's faith has become an issue, as Old Believers are seen as heretical by most Metropolitans. Truthfully, it could be best to sideline Afanasy entirely, and instead let the Metropolitans choose whomever they like as Prelate - even if that would be somewhat embarrassing for our government's authority."
 fer.74.a: "The Most Holy Synod shall convene."
 fer.74.b: "Perhaps Afanasy should be sidelined."

 fer.75.t: "The Death of Diterikhs"
 fer.75.d: "The flags are at half-mast and the nation is in mourning, as God has taken His Supreme Voyevoda Mikhail Konstantinovich Diterikhs to Heaven. A grand state funeral in Moscow is being arranged for our beloved Devout General. Diterikhs was a giant among men, having seen two world wars and two civil wars, never flinching or giving up on his duties.\n\nHis corpse is barely cold, as scheming has already begun behind the scenes. Diterikhs was a dictator, even if he was technically a servant of Tsar Nikita. There is no clear successor, and while Nikita I will likely try to improve his own position, he hardly has the necessary connections to rule in his own right, something that was assured by Diterikhs.\n\nThe first to act was Ivan Lukyanovich Solonevich, President of the Monarchic Union, the single legal party in the country. Solonevich is an ambitious man who, during Diterikhs' latter days, was climbing up the ranks, and now he has put all his connections and resources to use. The Solonevichites in the Zemsky Sobor have already recommended installing Solonevich as the Pechatnik, the de-facto Prime Minister and the Emperor's closest advisor.\n\nThis campaign in the Zemsky Sobor has been countered by men from the Circle of St. George loyal to Diterikhs, chiefly Generals Pavel Petrovich Petrov and Viktorin Mikhaylovich Molchanov. They have expressed fears over Solonevich moving the regime in an even more radical direction, while - so they claim - Diterikhs always intended to eventually moderate and normalise the regime, and downplay its most oppressive aspects. In this battle of authority, only one side can win."
 fer.75.a: "Man may be mortal... "
 fer.75.b: "...but holy Russia is eternal."

 fer.76.t: "Ivan Solonevich Ascends"
 fer.76.d: "Solonevich's legal coup was a success. With surprising support from Tsar Nikita, Ivan Solonevich was appointed as the Pechatnik, Nikita's primary advisor and head of the imperial government. An attempt by Diterikhsite generals to stop this move failed, and to their dismay, the apolitical and moderate Mikhail Vasilyevich Khanzhin was appointed as the Supreme Voyevoda. Solonevich was quick to build on his victory: in cooperation with Nikita I, new decrees limited the power of the military and empowered that of the imperial government.\n\nDiterikhs' silent military dictatorship was being disbanded, but it did not lead to any kind of liberalisation; just the greater involvement of Solonevich's Monarchic Union. Under his direction, the government has declared war on corruption and democraticism, launching campaigns against Solonevich's political enemies and even purging some of the earlier supporters of the regime. As Solonevich has started to mould the state into his envisioned People's Monarchy, many fear yet further instability and chaos."
 fer.76.a: "A victory no one saw coming."

 fer.77.t: "Protectors of the Generals' Legacy"
 fer.77.d: "Solonevich's legal coup failed. Tsar Nikita remained outside the debate, and ultimately the generals rallied their ranks. The leadership of the Circle of St. George has been taken over by Viktorin Molchanov and Pavel Petrov, who are stability-oriented military men. They are convinced monarchists and conservatives, yes, but they do not share the ideological fanaticism of Solonevich or the religious fanaticism of Diterikhs. Thanks to Petrov's connections, he has been able to win the support of anti-Solonevichites in the Monarchical Party, and the plotting has put Ivan Ilyin in a position to challenge Solonevich.\n\nSolonevich's power-grab collapsed as it turned many in the upper echelons of the regime against him. Instead, he was forced to retire from politics under a 'suggestion' from General Petrov, who instead became the Pechatnik. Molchanov in turn became the new Supreme Voyevoda, under a power-sharing agreement with Petrov."
 fer.77.a: "They will stabilise the realm."

 fer.78.t: "The Union of Musketeers"
 fer.78.d: "Our regime looks at the past, but it needs to adapt to modernity. All great nations of the 20th century have utilised mass mobilisation of people, especially the youth of the nation. The Society for the Memory of Nikolay II is tasked with the important work of promoting monarchist and Orthodox values, but the future is truly in the hands of the Union of Musketeers, a youth organisation originally envisioned by Vyacheslav Volkov. This Union teaches youth martial and religious life, assuring them of the righteousness of the Tsar and of traditionalism."
 fer.78.a: "In youth is our hope."

 fer.80.t: "Semyonov Elected President"
 fer.80.d: "The first proper elections under Semyonov's rule over all of Russia ended in a great victory for Semyonov's own party, the All-Russian Popular Party (VNP). This party unites people from all sides of politics, championing a nationalist, populist, and conservative program. With all separatist, communist, Svobodnik, and other terroristic parties banned, turnout was quite low. There were some mass protests, but they were broken up by the Cossacks, and the day of the election went relatively smoothly. By the end of the day, the VNP gained a majority with its minor allies, facing little serious challenge. The Kadets became the main opposition party in the Duma, but even they seem accepting of Semyonov's regime, no doubt understanding that it is a better way to moderate the regime to take part in it rather than fight it. Semyonov was subsequently elected as President, and a new cabinet, again led by Chairman-Minister Sergey Tashkin, was appointed."
 fer.80.a: "Long may he defend our democracy!"

 fer.81.t: "In the Footsteps of Skoropadskyi"
 fer.81.d: "The first elections of the Russian State had little turnout, with campaigning restricted to a select few loyalist parties. More importantly than the elections, onlookers saw a megalomaniac show in Moscow as Grigory Semyonov formally became the Supreme Ataman. With ceremonies mimicking those that Pavlo Skoropadskyi used in 1918, Semyonov was elected by the Duma to serve as Supreme Ataman for his lifetime, and he received anointments and blessings in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow. In practice, this makes him the formalised military dictator, only relying on the Duma to legitimise his orders. He appointed Sergey Tashkin as his Chairman-Minister and rewarded his political allies with other cabinet positions."
 fer.81.a: "All other regimes have failed in Russia."

 fer.82.t: "The Ataman's Party"
 fer.82.d: "The All-Russian Popular Party (VNP) is Semyonov's key to Russian politics. Their press and street campaigns are vast, and they all seek to portray what a great man Grigory Semyonov is, and how decades of Kolchakite propaganda about his warlordism were merely lies. In these pamphlets and speeches, Semyonov is portrayed as the liberator, the saviour of Russian freedoms, the stalwart enemy of Savinkov and socialism. The VNP's vast campaign budget is often used to host generous events such as soup kitchens for the poor and musical concerts for the elites of the cities.\n\nOh, and what do they believe in? It is of secondary concern. They stand for all Russian people. In practice, their program is vaguely conservative, somewhat populist, and most of all, loyal to the Ataman."
 fer.82.a: "Better than all previous political parties."

 fer.83.t: "Allies from Old Russia"
 fer.83.d: "The old parties of Russia have taken some time to build up their power again, but such is their institutional strength that they cannot be ignored entirely. The vast majority of competent civil servants come from the Kadets, and conservatives from the VPP have broad support, particularly from large landowners and parts of the military. There is a risk that they will start cooperating against our regime, which could be best avoided by instead making a deal with one of them. While the VPP is closer to VNP's conservatism, we already have good headway in the Kadet party, as Sergey Tashkin, Semyonov's long-term right-hand man, is a former Kadet and can draw significant support from Kadet circles."
 fer.83.a: "Make a deal with the Kadets."
 fer.83.b: "Conservatives are closer to us."

 fer.84.t: "Rule by the Soldiers"
 fer.84.d: "The basis of the Supreme Ataman's rule has always been the military, both its threat of force and its political support from veterans. Semyonov has favoured veterans greatly, giving them ample pensions and job-producing programs, and, in exchange, he has found a loyal political support base from them. This provides ample recruitment opportunities for security services and civil service, staffing these institutions with ex-soldiers. The most privileged among them all are Cossacks, whose Hosts have been restored and much of their lands returned."
 fer.84.a: "Did they not bleed and die for Russia?"

 fer.85.t: "Mongolian Generals Defect!"
 fer.85.d: "The Mongolian generals we let into Russia and into our armed forces have switched sides to the bandit Grigory Semyonov!"
 fer.85.a: "Traitors!"

 fer.90.d: "Reports across the frontlines have been scarce, but the latest have painted grim news. The German Empire has fallen to opposing forces, and the Kremlin's forces have decisively triumphed, no doubt eager to turn to the east and finish our rebellion once and for all. Perhaps the only way to avert the inevitable would be to appeal for direct intervention from the Japanese, although this would make us even more reliant on Tokyo."

 fer.91.d: "With our victory in the west, the bandits in the Far Eastern Army have scrambled for a solution - and they seem to have an ace up their sleeve. Japanese troops quickly occupied the Far East and prevented us from advancing any further. A ceasefire was hastily assembled, and the Japanese do promise a long-term solution to the Siberian problem - though we are well aware they are full of lies. We will retake Vladivostok, sooner or later."
 fer.91.a: "Curse them!"

 fer.92.t: "Ceasefire in the Far East?"
 fer.92.d: "The Reichspakt collapsed, and with it, our hopes of a successful rebellion in the Russian Far East seem to have gone to waste. Moscow's troops are soon to occupy Vladivostok if we don't do something. A debate has risen up: many in the army have advocated that we occupy the Far East ourselves and force a ceasefire with Russia. After all, we have already put so much into Semyonov's uprising. Civilian leaders are far more sceptical, arguing that we would be setting ourselves up for an inevitable war with Russia."
 fer.92.a: "We need to protect our interests."
 fer.92.b: "They dug their own graves."

 fer.93.t: "In Defence of Siberia"
 fer.93.d: "We are now at war with the hated Boldyrevist regime, which seeks to subjugate the Siberian peoples and take all of our hard-earned gains! This will not be tolerated, of course. We will come out victorious!"
 fer.93.a: "Onwards!"

 fer.94.t: "Peace with [RSA.GetNameDef]?"
 fer.94.d: "The fighting has continued for some time now, with neither side being able to fully take out the other. It may finally be time for peace."
 fer.94.a: "We fought to preserve Siberian independence, after all."
 fer.94.b: "Continue fighting!"

 fer.95.t: "End the Siberian War?"
 fer.95.d: "The war with [FER.GetNameDef] has taken quite the toll. Contrary to earlier expectations of victory, we have been unable to take out [FER.GetLeader]'s Siberian regime, and he has sent an envoy for a truce between our nations. In doing so, we would be practically recognising their independence."
 fer.95.a: "We lost."
 fer.95.b: "No, this isn't over."

 fer.96.t: "To Vladivostok!"
 fer.96.d: "The bandit [RUS.GetLeader] has declared Siberia to be its own nation, and we have found ourselves at war. We will put an end to this pretender at once."
 fer.96.a: "Forwards!"

 fer.97.t: "Germany Offers Aid!"
 fer.97.d: "It was not much of a concern when we went to war with [FER.GetNameDef]'s Siberian regime, but now disaster has struck - Japan has explicitly backed them and joined their side. The German ambassador to Russia has offered us help in this conflict, at least to send a stern warning to Japan to back off."
 fer.97.a: "Their help is welcome."
 fer.97.b: "We don't need it."

 fer.98.t: "[RSA.GetNameDef] Asks for Aid"
 fer.98.d: "The Siberian warlord regime under [FER.GetNameDef] has invaded our ally [RSA.GetNameDef] with explicit Japanese support. We risk Russia getting bogged down in another conflict. Should we invite [RSA.GetNameDef] into our military alliance and fight alongside them?"
 fer.98.a: "Yes, of course!"
 fer.98.b: "Not our problem."

 fer.99.t: "Germany Declares War Against [FER.GetNameDef]"
 fer.99.d: "As expected, the Teutons came to [RSA.GetNameDef]'s aid, and our war against them is no longer as easy as it seemed to be. We certainly had no expectations of such escalations. Perhaps we should back down?"
 fer.99.a: "Get Berlin on the line."
 fer.99.b: "We will be victorious!"

 fer.100.t: "Japan Offers to Stop the War"
 fer.100.d: "We have received a message from Tokyo saying that they did not expect the great escalation of us joining the war, and want to arrange a ceasefire to avoid shedding too much blood over the Siberian lands."
 fer.100.a: "Glad they came to their senses."
 fer.100.b: "Seriously? They started this!"

 fer.101.t: "The War of National Reclamation"
 fer.101.d: "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s forces crossed the border into Boldyrevite territory, proclaiming a war to finally unify Russia after so many years. Semyonov claimed on the radio earlier to all Russian peoples that negotiations between him and [RSA.GetNameDef] had all but broken down, as [RSA.GetLeader] was apparently not interested in a settlement that would 'preserve Russian sovereignty'.\n\nWhile in reality caring little for it, Semyonov has promised to 'put down the German puppet administration residing in the Kremlin, and restore Russian power to the world'. For now, such a message seems to resonate with the soldiers on the ground. But only time will tell if the Far Eastern uprising can achieve the impossible..."
 fer.101.d2: "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s forces crossed the border into Boldyrevite territory, proclaiming a war to finally unify Russia after so many years. Diterikhs has called all Russians to arms against the decrepit, German-installed Boldyrevite republic which spits on all tradition and everything that is holy. For now, such a message seems to resonate with the soldiers on the ground. But only time will tell if the Far Eastern uprising can achieve the impossible..."
 fer.101.a: "Onwards to Moscow!"

 fer.102.t: "Meeting the Germans"
 fer.102.d: "It has taken some time, but the German ambassador to Russia has finally been sent to Moscow to relay Berlin's wishes for the new Russian government. He stated that Germany will recognise the new Russia as the legitimate one, but hopes that they will, as did the previous regime, respect the Treaty of Moscow and the borders between Russia and its western neighbours. [RUS.GetLeader] was adamant that there was no wish for any bad relations, despite earlier anti-German statements.\n\nIn reality, intelligence has indicated to us that Germany scrambled for a response when Moscow was about to fall, and even considered an intervention. Such reports indicate that they are seeking to actively undermine us."
 fer.102.a: "Understood."

 fer.103.t: "The New Oprichnina"
 fer.103.d: "A wave of terror has been unleashed by the security services under the tight grip of Supreme Voyevoda Diterikhs. Colonel Konstantin Kromiadi - a former Savinkovite who defected to the Circle of St. George - has led an organisation of paramilitaries nicknamed the 'Oprichniks', after Ivan the Terrible's proto-security service. The purpose of these 'Guard Brigades' is to hunt down the enemies of the state - not only separatists but also communists and various other criminals. With extralegal powers, these squads have been conducting public executions - ensuring that everyone in the village is perfectly aware of them.\n\nThese brutal methods have eradicated most public protests for now, forcing the resistance underground. Socialist terrorist cells continue to operate and strike against the Tsarist officials, but we will prevail.\n\nIn Tsar Nikita's address to the nation, he explained the need for drastic measures to ensure lasting peace and stability. Loyal and faithful Russians will have nothing to fear, but given how deep the socialist and collaborationist rot has spread in Russian society, there are many traitors and enemies of the people among the common people. To prove their loyalty, men are encouraged to join the Monarchic Union and its various side organisations - and help in restoring the old Russia, before all the schism, unrest and trouble."
 fer.103.a: "The Lord knows His own."

 fer.104.t: "End of the Second Troubles"
 fer.104.d: "Tsar Nikita Aleksandrovich has been taking a more significant role in the administration of the state since the death of General Diterikhs. The man who initially seemed little more than a puppet of the generals has more and more often gone against them, often relying on public addresses to the people as a way to force the military to submit. After all, Diterikhs started the cult around the Tsar as a way to legitimise the rule that was otherwise essentially a military dictatorship, and that proved a foundation for Nikita's own cult of personality.\n\nThe Tsar has been steadily filling his cabinet and organisations like the Monarchic Union with his own loyalists, often against the wishes of [GetSecondInCommand] and his own ambitions. Nikita visits the people often, and has created an excellent propaganda machine around himself. Despite the idolisation of past Russia, his regime has adopted mass politics, frequent radio speeches and other very modern methods of appealing to the masses, and combined it with old methods such as instructing Church sermons to always pray for the health of the Tsar, reminding Russians of what is truly important.\n\nOf course, the regime is hardly popular, but with a mixture of ruthless suppression and clever propaganda, it stands on a solid foundation, at least for now. In a recent address, Vasily Shulgin - an influential statesman in the government - claimed that finally Russia has been absolved of its sin of Murder of Nikolay II, and is on a better path after twenty years of New Troubles. If only the faithful imperials had held their ground in 1917, Russia would have not needed to pass through the fire and blood so many times - but it was the sacrificial blood that was required to wash away the sins of regicide and fratricide."
 fer.104.a: "Like the Messiah, Holy Rus' rises once more."

 ### FER Collapse
 fer.200.t: "The Siberian Rebellion"
 fer.200.d.semyonov: "The short-lived Siberian state has come to its end. After the end of the war, Grigory Semyonov, ruler and 'protector' of the Siberian Duma, has failed to pacify barely any of the provinces he claims to reign over. Initial promises of local autonomy fell flat as Semyonov has constantly meddled in local affairs, and it is clear he is nothing but a military dictator.\n\nThe wave of unrest started after mass protests around Semyonov's presidential residence were broken up by Cossacks, leading to seven dead and countless wounded. Until now, Semyonov has been able to trust in military might as his control of the Trans-Siberian enables quick reinforcement of any major town, but as protests spread and were joined by resistance groups operating from the countryside, it was quickly made clear that Siberia could not be held.\n\nNikolay Kalashnikov's Siberian Insurgent Army stormed [FER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and encountered only sporadic resistance: it seems like Semyonov has fled the capital in a convoy of armoured trains, sabotaging the tracks behind him and carrying a large amount of wealth with him. The restored Siberian Duma elected the national liberal Ivan Serebrennikov, chairman of the DNPVS, as the provisional president."
 fer.200.d.diterikhs: "The short-lived Siberian state has come to its end. Initially under Ataman Grigory Semyonov, the Siberians had been promised local autonomy and lax government, but ever since Mikhail Diterikhs' coup, even these small concessions had been revoked, and the Siberian Duma has more priests and officers than it has elected men. While Diterikhs does enjoy support in the more conservative stratum of Siberia, sympathy for him is rapidly running out.\n\nThe wave of unrest started after mass protests around Diterikhs' government residence were broken up by Cossacks, leading to seven dead and countless wounded. Until now, Diterikhs has been able to trust in military might as his control of the Trans-Siberian enables quick reinforcement of any major town, but as protests spread and were joined by resistance groups operating from the countryside, it was quickly made clear that the situation had become hard to salvage.\n\nAt the culmination of the rebellion, Nikolay Kalashnikov's Siberian Insurgent Army stormed [FER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], which was defended fiercely by men loyal to Diterikhs. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Volkov, an old general himself, died behind a machine gun installed in the window of his office. Diterikhs himself was court-martialed and shot in the backyard of the [FER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government palace.\n\nAfter the surrender of the Diterikhsites, General Kalashnikov declared the Siberian Duma restored. In its first sitting, Siberian national liberal, Ivan Serebrennikov, chairman of the DNPVS, was elected as the provisional president."
 fer.200.a: "Sic transit gloria mundi."
 fer.200.b: "Send a delegation to [FER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to talk them into re-joining."
 FER_collapse_tt: "§RLike so many conquerors before you, you lost.§!"

 fer.205.t: "[FER.GetName] Seeks to Join Our Alliance"
 fer.205.d: "In an unlikely twist of events, the ruler of the new Russia, Grigory Semyonov, has asked to join the Entente. It seems that he is likely looking for a way to rekindle the old alliance once again, as long as the Entente can prove to be a counterweight to German interests."
 fer.205.a: "Welcome!"
 fer.205.b: "No thank you."

 ### News event
 fer.1000.t: "The Far Eastern Army Unites Russia"
 fer.1000.d: "In a suprising turn of events, the small rebel faction that started from the Amur-Ussuri rebellion in Siberia, and has since grown to encompass all of Russia, has declared its victory, and the organisation of a new goverment under their oversight.\n\n[FER_unification_news_event_desc]"
 fer.1000.semyonov: "This new Russian goverment is to be led by Atman Grigory Semyonov, a formerly exiled Cossack warlord who is speculated to have been backed by Japanese intelligence services, and whose mens reputation for bandity and unscrupulous acts has spread far and wide.\nIt is still to be seen how this new goverment shall organise itself, as despite some promises to hold free elections, many suspect the creation of a personalist regime around Semyonov."
 fer.1000.diterikhs: "This new Russian goverment is to be led by Mikhail Diterikhs, an arch-reactionary monarchist General, who took control over the rebellion following the ousting of its former leader, Grigory Semyonov. General Diterikhs has openly voiced his desire for the restoration of a Russian monarchy styled after the old Tsardom. Many things are still uncertain regarding the direction of this new regime, but many of the governments of its neighboring countries expect it to be highly hostile and erratic."
 fer.1000.a: "We shall restore Russia to its full glory."
 fer.1000.b: "Stop, You're supposed to obey us!!!"
 fer.1000.c: "A highly concerning development."
