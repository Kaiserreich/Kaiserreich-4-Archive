### Ideas ###
 LEB_united_front: "United Front"
 LEB_united_front_desc: "The Lebanese people are emboldened by their opposition to tyranny and their cries for liberty. Despite the millennia of conflict between the different religious groups of Lebanon, we are all aware that we share a common enemy. The Ottomans and the Syrians have tried to play us off against each other, only seeking to curry our favour to further their own hegemony, with little care for the tyranny they’ve inflicted on the Lebanese people. We know that to oppose them we need to stand united, so for now it is all smiles above the table but daggers drawn beneath it. Until we have won our liberty with blood, sweat and toil, a strained sense of comradery binds us all together."
 LEB_economic_upheaval: "Economic Upheaval"
 LEB_economic_upheaval_desc: "Whilst Lebanon has been a centre of trade and commerce for millennia, our dependence on the Ottoman Empire severely stifled our economic influence. The Port of Beirut has been under direct Ottoman control for almost a century, during which it existed mostly to direct trade from the Mashriq towards the Turkish metropole. With the empire in collapse and the Turkish economy in a downward spiral, alongside the fact numerous new trade routes and economic blocs have been created in the rapidly changing Middle East, we are faced with the inevitable need to undergo a vast transformation of our economic system or face complete destitution."
 LEB_legacy_of_the_mutasarrifate: "Legacy of the Mutasarrifate"
 LEB_legacy_of_the_mutasarrifate_desc: "The rule of the second Mutasarrifate has been a time of healing and recovery for the weary Lebanese people, but not quite comfortable enough to make us complacent in the face of oppression. As political movements had the chance to come back out into the open, the nationalists and reformers in Lebanon have become far better organised and unified, which bodes well for shaping the future of our nascent state. The cornerstones of the Lebanese nation have already been laid by the political factions and coalitions forged during the period of the second Mutasarrifate."
 LEB_ethnic_and_sectarian_divides: "Ethnic and Sectarian Divides"
 LEB_ethnic_and_sectarian_divides_desc: "Lebanon has always been a cultural and religious melting pot, with numerous different kinds of peoples settling in it, trading with it, or conquering it across the millennia. As of currently, the three largest groups are Christians, Muslims and Druze, but all of those also have their own sectarian and tribal divides within the wider group. Whilst some cross sectarian alliances exist, there’s also notable extremists in each camp, who want to enforce their own religious rule over the Lebanese nation. In order for Lebanon to remain stable and prosperous, peace must be forged between these conflicting groups, either through negotiation or force, and a stable government that everyone can accept or one specific group can personally enforce, must be established."

 LEB_corruption_level_1_desc: "Political and financial corruption saturates most elements of Lebanese society, regardless of ethnic or sectarian background. From the Maronite oligarchs, to the Sunni landowners, all the way to the Druze clans. Local 'Zuama' (Bosses) can easily purchase votes and loyalty from their constituents and are in turn themselves often bought and traded in the smoky backrooms of the Grand Serail. Some politicians in Lebanon have built their entire careers off the back of this corrupt system, whilst others have made it their mission to see the Lebanese kleptocracy crushed once and for all.\n\n§RThe Constitutionalists will heavily benefit from high corruption levels, to the detriment of everyone else.§!"

 LEB_appeal_of_pan_arabism_desc: "Though composed by a myriad of different religions, culturally Lebanon remains overwhelmingly Arab; in addition, our foremost trading partners are all various Arab nations from around the Middle East.

 LEB_the_young_phoenicians_desc: "The Young Phoenicians are a very nationalistic force within Lebanon.

### Events ###

 leb.1.t: "Our Independence Achieved"
 leb.1.d: "After several weeks of struggle, the armies of Syria have finally stopped their attack on our nation, and their government has agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nIn this momentous occasion, most of the Country rejoices, as the oppression of Lebanon draws to a close; and although some within our borders don't approve of our newfound independence, notably the Sunnis and their Syrian Social Nationalist Party, the streets of our country are filled with enthusiasm as the Provisional President announces the liberation of Lebanon."
 leb.1.a: "Long Live Lebanon!"

 leb.2.t: "The Collapse of the United Front"
 leb.2.d: "While we had hoped that the wide United Front under Chehab would last enough time to guarantee a safe transition towards democracy, it seems this isn't going to be the case.\n\nFollowing the end of the Independence War, factional rivalries, policy differences, and clan rivalries have torn our national government apart. Starting today, the democratic parties have withdrawn their support of the Provisional President's interim mandate. This leaves us in a peculiar position, as the President is indeed in favour of a democratic restoration, however both him and the parties see an immediate election as dangerous. The situation is reaching a deadlock, though it appears it will undoubtedly be broken in a matter of days."
 leb.2.a: "Drat..."

 leb.3.t: "The Provisional Parliament demands Fouad Chehab Step Down"
 leb.3.d: "As expected, the political deadlock has been broken; the Parties seem to have grown weary of Chehab's presidency, and made a joint statement calling for the resignation of the Provisional President and the formation of a temporary parliamentary administration until elections can be held.\n\nWhile Chehab is indeed in favour of a restoration of democracy, he has noted that laying down powers to the Parliament might be the chance for dangerous scenarios to rise, one of these being a return of the various political dynasties, which Chehab very much opposes due to their corrupted political ways, or the rise of some radical militarist movements to replace the political weight of the Volunteers' Army.\n\nWhatever the case, Chehab must now decide: will the Provisional Presidency survive, or will the Parliament have its demands met?"
 leb.3.a: "Give in to the demands."
 leb.3.b: "Our nation isn't ready yet!"

 leb.4.t: "Dealing with the Dynasties"
 leb.4.d: "The great Maronite political dynasties of Lebanon have been in control of the country ever since the Mutasarrifate was formed back in 1860, their power and presence always felt at all political and economic levels. After the governorship of Djemal Pasha, the families returned, spearheaded by the Arslan and Jumblatt Druze families.\n\nThe families form an extremely powerful, though corrupted, political bloc; and some fear that they could effectively take control of the upcoming elections from the shadows.\n\nAs such, the Reform Society and the Army are both in favour of limiting their overall influence through special legislation; however, the Constitutionalists, who enjoy the support of the Families, are deeply opposed to such a move, and they might end up having the final say on the matter."
 leb.4.a: "Collaboration might be best..."
 leb.4.b: "Move to curb their power!"

 leb.5.t: "Dealing with the Republican Movement"
 leb.5.d: "After Chehab's refusal to leave the Provisional Presidency, the democratic parties unified as a single parliamentary bloc in order to protect the country from Chehab's 'dictatorial' turn. In spite of this, it was clear that such a pact was not going to last, as the internal differences between the factions was too great.\n\nAs such a chance has opened up to break this unnatural coalition: disillusioned by the Constitutionals' arabist and conservative policies, the Reform society has offered political collaboration with the arguably progressive Provisional Presidency."
 leb.5.a: "Let us join forces with the Reformists!"
 leb.5.b: "This is too dangerous of a move..."

 leb.6.t: "Sunni Riots"
 leb.6.d: "Being left aside in the political situation of our country, the Sunni populace has taken the streets in protests, to make their voice heard in the next elections.\n\nAs noble as this goal was, the situation has deteriorated, with widespread riots erupting and the suspicion of Syrian involvement arising.\n\nIn this precarious situation, the Marada Movement has proposed in the Provisional Parliament their militias step in in the Government's name and restore order to the Sunni areas of the country; an offer that is indeed worth considering, since sending in the Army might prove dangerous and attract reprisals from across the border."
 leb.6.a: "Allow the Marada to move in!"
 leb.6.b: "Call in the army!"

 leb.7.t: "Marada Demand Seats"
 leb.7.d: "During the War of Liberation, the Marada served alongside the Volunteers' Army, gaining sizeable support due to their daring tactics, but nevertheless received a relatively low number of seats in the Provisional Parliament.\n\nThis prompted the Movement to call upon our democratic values and, seeing their widespread support, grant them more seats even before elections have been held, in order to solidify the democratic (and Maronite) character of our Nation and to impede parliamentary meddling in the forthcoming elections.\n\nWhile they are highly hypocritical in appealing to the democratic process, themselves being little more than reactionary thugs, we could prove ourselves hypocritical too in not allowing the democratic process to proceed, in order to protect the democratic process."
 leb.7.a: "We will be better than them..."
 leb.7.b: "We will defend our democracy!"

 leb.8.t: "A Threat from Within"
 leb.8.d: "President Chehab's refusal to let go of the temporary presidency have kickstarted a smearing campaign by the Republican Movement against his person.\n\nIn fact, despite our President being a die-hard republican, the Movement has already accused him of trying to bring the Lebanese Emirate, which his family ruled, back to life and to be plotting a monarchist self-coup against the democratic apparatus of the Republic.\n\nWhile such claims are obviously baseless and are appearing because of Chehab's opposition to the political families that support the Constitutionalists and the Nationalists, the campaign has nevertheless damaged Chehab's reputation, and despite our best efforts, it will be a while before the effects of these attacks are completely vanished."
 leb.8.a: "We will have to live with this"

 leb.9.t: "The New Constitution"
 leb.9.d: "After long debates, a draft of the new constitution of the Lebanese Republic has been approved.\n\nAmong its basic principles stand the recognition of the democratic process, the freedom of speech and of press, the freedom of assembly and a recognition of human dignity and rights.\n\nAnd, among those, stands a recognition of the multi-religious, multi-cultural character of our Lebanese nation, giving our compatriots the right to profess any religion and recognising their customs.\n\nWhile there are those who oppose the new statute, namely the Marada movement, it is clear that the many ethnicities of our country will prosper under the masterpiece that is our new Constitution."
 leb.9.a: "Long Live our Republic!"

 leb.10.t: "The Marada Coup"
 leb.10.d: "Lights went out in Beirut tonight as militias of the Marada movement seized control over strategic positions in the city, disarming police and military checkpoints. Although armed with little more than scraps from the black market and Ottoman leftovers, they seem to have made up for their lack in strength with a form of unbridled enthusiasm. For many Beiruti citizens however, the coup attempt feels as yet another page in a long and drawn out history of political upheaval.\n\nWith gunshots echoing in the night, various reports of arrests and beatdowns are spreading through the city of political representatives and party leaders, dragged out of their houses and gathered on the square in front of the Parliament building. Although initially taken by surprise, rumour has it that elements loyal to the republic and its democratic system are arming themselves and planning a counter-attack. Whatever the outcome, it seems likely that once more the streets of Beirut will see blood."
 leb.10.a: "The Marada take over the government!"
 leb.10.b: "The militias are repelled!"

 leb.11.t: "God, Fatherland, Family"
 leb.11.d: "As the sun rises over Beirut, it has become clear that the Marada movement has succeeded in their plan. With victory now finally secured, all of Lebanon now falls under the guidance of their movement and its noble leader, Bachir Jumayyil! A glorious day in the eyes of his followers, while many others have cowered in their homes as the dream of a peaceful, democratic Lebanon has been squashed with great fervour. Although promising stability and a sense of continuity to the people of Beirut, Marada militias have spent all morning rounding up possible opponents, ensuring that no one can question their regime."
 leb.11.a: "Long Live Jumayyil!"

 leb.12.t: "A National Emergency"
 leb.12.d: "As the sun rises over Beirut, it has become clear that the Marada movement has failed. Thrown back and actively hunted by both army and police, the remaining members have fled outside of the city in an attempt to regroup. The coup may have been averted, but it is clear that they are not finished. Most concerning is that their leader, Bachir Jumayyil, has been able to escape unscathed, likely seeking refuge in the Lebanese highlands.\n\nThoroughly shaken up, the cabinet gathered as soon as possible, condemning the coup in the strongest of words and declaring the state of emergency. Believing that there may still be cells remaining in Beirut itself, the ministry of the interior has decreed martial law in the entire province with support of the president."
 leb.12.a: "We shall crush these traitors!"

 leb.13.t: "Extraordinary Powers?"
 leb.13.d: "With martial law in place and the Marada all but defeated, some are starting to question when the state of emergency and the extraordinary powers it has granted to our political leaders will be withdrawn. Although it has without doubt had a positive effect on the operations against the Marada, a recent article outlining corruption within the cabinet and questionable agreements between various industrialists and our leaders, misusing the situation to their advantage, has stirred up the people of Beirut. Demanding that the government lays down its powers, petitions and protests addressed at the Lebanese parliament have thus far not been answered but it's clear that the government will have to react one way or the other."
 leb.13.a: "It's time to step back."
 leb.13.b: "The country needs more stability..."

 leb.14.t: "The Marada Enter the Election"
 leb.14.d: "Named for the legendary Marada warriors of the Middle Ages, the Marada were capable fighters alongside the Volunteers' Army during the War of Liberation. With peace however, The Marada have decided to shift. They have reorganised as a small political party, centring on Lebanese nationalism and Maronite Christianity. They are now aiming for the presidency and for as many government positions as possible, but it looks like they have a long way to go."
 leb.14.a: "They have no chances."

 leb.15.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 leb.15.d: "The time has come for the next set of elections in Lebanon, and the people are heading to the polls in a steady stream. Who do you think will emerge victorious this time?"
 leb.15.a: "The Constitutional Bloc Wins!"
 leb.15.b: "The National Bloc Wins!"
 leb.15.c: "The Reform Society Wins!"

 leb.16.t: "The Third Beirut Reform Society Conference"
 leb.16.d: "Today, the Beirut Reform Society convened a conference, in order to establish the future agenda of the ruling party. After congratulating his fellow party members over the electoral victory, Salam then opened the convention. In rapid succession, all the major goals of the party were debated, voted on, and approved.\n\nThese goal include female suffrage and the enfranchisement of women, the overcoming of ethnic divisions and the defence of national unity and democracy; and as a new point, the expansion of the Reform Society to the rural parts of Lebanon in order to appeal to a larger electorate and ensure that the modernisation of Lebanon isn't limited to Beirut and the coast."
 leb.16.a: "A great goal!"

 leb.17.t: "The National Pact"
 leb.17.d: "The National Pact is an unwritten agreement that protects the multi-faith identity of Lebanon and helps to ensure stability within the country. Each of the major religions within Lebanon shall have their own designated posts and spheres of influence. Through the National Pact, we have made sure that every confession within Lebanon has been heard, and that no one is oppressed."
 leb.17.e: "The National Pact is an unwritten agreement that protects the multi-faith identity of Lebanon and helps to ensure stability within the country. Each of the major religions within Lebanon shall have their own designated posts and spheres of influence. Through the National Pact, we shall ensure that everyone feels like they have some power within Lebanon, and that all accept that Lebanon is a peaceful Christian society."
 leb.17.a: "We will have ethnic stability!"
 leb.17.a.tt: "The §lSocial Liberals§! will §Rno longer be electable§!"

 leb.18.t: "Syrian Nationalists Strike"
 leb.18.d: "Today a group of Syrian Nationalists launched an attack on an isolated military posting, injuring several before relief could arrive and scare them away. This will surely only embolden them to do more damage in the name of their cause."
 leb.18.a: "We will have our revenge!"

 leb.19.t: "Protests against El-Khoury"
 leb.19.d: "El-Khoury's blatant attempts to increase his own personal powers have come at a cost, as the more democratically-minded citizens of Lebanon have taken to the streets to protest these reforms. With Chehab and the Volunteers' Army lurking from the shadows, we fear a coup against us might be imminent. We must push through with our reforms as fast as we can, so that we may then work towards relaxing the situation."
 leb.19.a: "Let's hope things don't get too heated"

 leb.20.t: "Lebanon Wants to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 leb.20.d: "Having freed themselves from the Syrians, the Lebanese have enjoyed a period of neutrality; however, as the world descends into chaos, they have felt it necessary to exchange that for the safety of our protection. Thus, they have formally requested to join the [Root.GetFactionName]."
 leb.20.a: "Let them in!"
 leb.20.b: "We have no need for them."

 leb.21.t: "[From.GetName] Has Refused"
 leb.21.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has sent word that the [From.GetFactionName] has no need of our alliance."
 leb.21.a: "What a shame."

 leb.22.t: "The [GetYear] Elections"
 leb.22.d: "The time has come for the next set of elections in Lebanon, and the people are heading to the polls in a steady stream. Who do you think will emerge victorious this time?"
 leb.22.a: "The Constitutional Bloc Wins!"
 leb.22.b: "The National Bloc Wins!"
 leb.22.c: "The Reform Society Wins!"

 leb.23.t: "End of Chehab's Presidential Term"
 leb.23.d: "President Fouad Abdullah Chehab has finally stepped down as president of Lebanon after several years. He was generally well liked, though some viewed him with scorn. But no matter how anyone viewed him, his time is now a part of our history..."
 leb.23.a: "Long Live President Helou!"

 leb.24.t: "Fouad Chehab Intervenes"
 leb.24.d: "The actions of our executive have long irritated Chehab, who viewed us with distrust and labelled us ineffective against the plagues affecting Lebanon; through the last weeks tensions have reached a breaking point. Today, citing the corrupt nature of our government, Chehab stormed Beirut and effectively seized the reins of government."
 leb.24.a: "What will happen now?"

 leb.25.t: "Lebanon asks for Military Help"
 leb.25.d: "Having historically been the most Francophile nation in the Middle East, Lebanon has always seen France as something of a brother to look up to. As they seek to reform their army into a modern force, they've sent envoys asking for an official French mission to Beirut."
 leb.25.a: "Everything for our Lebanese friends!"
 leb.25.b: "We'd rather not get involved in Syria."

 leb.26.t: "[NFA.GetNonIdeologyName] Accepts"
 leb.26.d: "The French have accepted our request for military help. A mission, headed by Colonel Collet (who served in the French Army of the Levant during the Weltkrieg) is on its way."
 leb.26.a: "A toast for our friends!"

 leb.27.t: "[NFA.GetNonIdeologyName] Refuses"
 leb.27.d: "Unfortunately, the French have deemed a Syrian involvement to not be in their interest. We are on our own."
 leb.27.a: "I thought we had something going on..."

 leb.28.t: "Start of the Marada Land Reform"
 leb.28.d: "The dream of the Marada movement for a \"Greater Lebanon\" has always been that each Maronite man should be able to till the land and sustain a nourishing, productive lifestyle that supports the nation. Since the 7th century, we've been ruled by Muslim nobles who've consolidated ever greater hold over the land through their large feudal estates, crushing the Maronite population under their heel. To fight this, the Marada Government signed a new land reform act into law that guarantees the \"protection\" of Christian-owned land. This is easy to enforce west of Mount Lebanon, where detailed land contracts and other historical documents can be used to prove that the Maronite land in the region has always rightfully belonged to the Christian men who till it. Yet east of the Mountain, things get murkier and many Marada have chosen to ignore due legal process or even so much as supplying evidence for their claim to the land, seizing upon the protection act as a justification for taking whatever they want by force."
 leb.28.a: "All this, to \"protect christianity\"?"

 leb.29.t: "The National Crisis"
 leb.29.d: "The Lebanese Armed Forces, still under the leadership of General Fouad Chehab, has warned us that the \"Marada Land Reform\" is getting out of hand and that such a rapid escalation of Maronite political authority will risk tearing the nation apart into civil war, as the redistribution is now no longer targeting just the Sunni Muslim nobles but simple any and all Muslims, both Sunni and Shia who happen own arable land. President Jumayyil has thus far ignored the warnings, continuing to urge his followers to push east of Mount Lebanon and into the Beqaa Valley, declaring that he will avenge over a millennia of oppression and economic injustice. This policy was long promised to cultivate a free Maronite yeomanry, but in truth most of the land in Beqaa is being given to loyal Marada party operatives and members of Jumayyil's patronage networks, strengthening "Al-Rais" hold over the nation. As Arab refugees flee from Lebanon into Syria, we have been condemned by the government in Damascus as clashes are being reported between Syrian border guards and Marada militias. A national crisis looms over Lebanon, can the violence be curtailed, or will Jumayyil continue to support it even as it pushes us into brinkmanship with Syria?"
 leb.29.a: "Nothing will come of it, surely"

 leb.30.t: "Land Reform in Lebanon"
 leb.30.d: "With refugees pouring out of the country, it has become clear the Marada movement in Lebanon has started a radical land reform, with the ultimate goal of securing the power of the Christian landowners over their Muslim counterparts. Many are asking for us to officially intervene, as our brethren in Lebanon risks persecution."
 leb.30.a: "Terrible, something must be done"

 leb.31.t: "Syria warns us"
 leb.31.d: "Having taken the plight of the Lebanese Muslims at heart, Syria has informed us that our land reform must not continue, else they take up arms to protect the non-Christian population of Lebanon. Of course, this ultimatum is unacceptable to our movement, but a Syrian invasion might well mean the end of Lebanon as an independent nation."
 leb.31.a: "Does it look like we care?"
 leb.31.a.tt: "§RThis will lead to war with Syria.§!"
 leb.31.b: "Alright alright, you just need to ask"
 leb.31.b.tt: "§RThis will deal a fatal blow to the Movement.§!"

 leb.32.t: "Lebanon ignores our warnings"
 leb.32.d: "In spite of our overtures to them, the Marada have refused to come to terms. As refugees keep pouring out of Lebanon, it's clear the only option to stop this crisis is a direct military intervention."
 leb.32.a: "Intervention is necessary."
 leb.32.b: "Now now, war isn't what we had in mind."

 leb.33.t: "Syria caves in"
 leb.33.d: "Wanting to avoid a second defeat at the hands of the proud Lebanese armies, Syria has elected not to intervene in our internal affairs. The Land Reform may proceed without interruption."
 leb.33.a: "Hurrah for Lebanon!"

 leb.34.t: "The Marada overthrown"
 leb.34.d: "Their ineffectual actions against us have led to a rapid fragmentation of the Marada dictatorship in Lebanon. News now reach us that this fragmentation has been fatal, as Fouad Chehab found himself able to return to Beirut and overthrow the fundamentalist dictatorship. We can trust the generally progressive Chehab to be a massive step-up over his predecessor, both for relations with us and for the Muslims of Lebanon."
 leb.34.a: "A good deed"

 leb.35.t: "Victory in the Second Syrian-Lebanese War"
 leb.35.d: "The cowardly Syrian armies have stopped their attacks on our soil, and the Syrian government appears willing to yet again come to terms with the \"pesky Lebanese rebels\". This is a great victory for Lebanon, a second Day of Independence."
 leb.35.a: "Hurrah for Lebanon!"

Farajallah Estephan el-Helou was born to a Maronite family in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He drifted in and out of various Lebanese public schools, eventually securing an education which landed him a teaching job at the American-run National College in Syria. Farajallah fell in with a clique of radical teachers and students at the college, which exposed him to Marxist and Syndicalist ideology. He joined fellow Lebanese radicals Fuad Shamali and Yusuf Yazbek as well as the Armenian Artin Madoyan and Syrian Khalid Bakdash in organising the Syrian Syndicalist Party, as part of a Pan-Arabic effort to promote socialism in the Levant. Farajallah, like many other members of the party, faced heavy repression by the Ottoman authorities and spent several years in prison. In the 1930s he lived for some time abroad in the Commune of France, where he pursued further studies into Syndicalism and penned the book “A New Humanity Building a New World” about the future of Arab Socialism. Following his return to Lebanon he collaborated with Yazbek and Shamali by working for their Lebanese People’s Party, a regional branch of the Levantine Syndicalist movement, which adopted a more nationalist rhetoric to appeal to the local population."

 LEB_kamal_jumblatt_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 6th, 1917, in Moukhtara, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The great scion of the Jumblatt clan, Kamal Fouad was born in the Chouf region, his family’s domain in Lebanese Druze territory. Kamal was the heir to an influential dynasty that had lived in Lebanon for almost half a millennia, and which had maintained a long feud with a rival Druze clan, known as the Arslan. When Kamal was four years old, his father was killed by a member of the Arslan family. Kamal’s cousin Hikmat and his mother Nazira took over leadership of the clan, training young Kamal to eventually inherit his father’s place as patriarch of the Jumblatts. Nazira was a well known liberal and feminist, who gave her son a progressive education, setting him down a path of reading western philosophy and socialist texts. Kamal attained a philosophy diploma at a prominent Christian school, the Brummana High School, and learned how to speak English as well as French and Turkish. Additionally, he made attempts to negotiate a peace with the Arslan family, in 1928 marrying Prince Shakib Arslan’s daughter, May Arslan. He thereafter travelled to the Commune of France, with the intentions of studying a wide variety of subjects in Paris’ academies, which only radicalised him further. Upon returning to Lebanon and taking his place as the head of his family, he helped to found the “Progressive Socialist Party”, as a left wing political group among the Druze."

 LEB_saeb_salam: "Saeb Salam"
 LEB_saeb_salam_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 17th, 1905, in Beirut, Vilayet of Beirut, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Saeb embodies a generation of young, progressive activists who are stepping up to fill the natural power vacuum which has formed in a nation like Lebanon, who’s independence is still in its infancy. He is the son of Salim Ali Salam, a former Ottoman parliamentarian and the previous chairman of the Beirut Reform Movement. Salim was an immense force of nature in regional politics, a critic of the antiquated Sublime Porte and proponent of Lebanese independence, but also a committed reformist who believed that change was still possible within the Ottoman Empire. The failure of his father’s attempts to push the empire towards further modernisation radicalised the young Saeb, and then the flames of his political passions were fanned further by the Levantine War and the Lebanese Revolt. As the elderly Salim slowly grew frailer, he eventually retired from politics and left the leadership of the Beirut Reform Movement to his son. Saeb has been severely influenced by his father, as well as his sister, the prominent feminist Anbara Salam Khalidi (née Saeb), but most of his ideology is his own making: A combination of Muslim modernism, western philosophy, secularism and economic justice, which Saeb believes can become the glue that will hold Lebanon’s divided, sectarian structure together, no matter what comes. Beside his politics, Saeb is also well known for his dandyish manners and style of dress. He is usually never seen without a flamboyantly patterned shirt and a carnation on his lapel."

Émile's family were Maronites who had worked as interpreters at the local French consulate for two generations. At an early age he moved to Beirut and became a student at a Jesuit Missionary school, before travelling to France and attaining a doctorate in law. Unlike the rest of his family, Émile was far more politically active, growing to become an ardent Lebanese nationalist and very sympathetic to Zionism. After Émile returned from France he joined Salim Ali Salam’s Beirut Reform Society, a liberal and modernist group. When at the beginning of the Weltkrieg the Ottoman Empire cracked down on Salam’s activities, Émile was forced to flee with his new comrades to Alexandria, where he supported the Entente, viewing them as potential liberators of the oppressed Lebanese people. After the end of the war, numerous members of the Reform Society were pardoned by the Ottoman government and returned home, but Émile formed a small clique which chose to remain in Alexandria, maintaining staunchly francophile and anti-Ottoman policies and refusing to partake in any political activities back in the empire. He thereafter served as an administrator under the British administration in Egypt, but after the British control over the country faltered, he opened up an office as an attorney, gaining a great deal of fame and renown in Alexandria. When Émile's “Alexandria Clique” was eventually offered an opportunity to return to Lebanon on their own terms, he gleefully took it, returning to Beirut with celebrations and cheers, hoping to build a new, sovereign nation."

Born in the warm, Lebanese countryside south of Beirut, Bechara el-Khoury came from an old Maronite family who had been active in regional politics for decades. He went to the Jesuit St. Joseph University in Beirut and graduated as a lawyer, whereafter he bucked the family tradition and remained decidedly aloof from partisan politics and Lebanese nationalism, at least until the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Bechara thereafter became more involved with resistance to the authoritarian governorship of Djemal Pasha and used his considerable skill and charisma to sway both Christians and Muslims to his side. Bechara’s political activities were never so forward as to merit an exile by the Ottoman Government, even as many of his Maronite comrades were forced to flee imprisonment and execution by settling in Egypt. Bechara corresponded with many of them, but also forged tighter bonds with the Lebanese Muslim community, and in recent years emerged as one of the greatest advocates of a “unified Lebanon”, that could be governed despite its intense sectarian differences. Together with the industrialist Boutros el-Khoury, no relation, he formed the Constitutional Bloc to campaign for a peaceful cooperation with the Syrian government, as a means to attain Lebanese autonomy. When this proposed union failed, Bechara nevertheless sought to avoid war, and even after the Lebanese Rebellion remained graceful and dedicated to the concerns of the nation’s Druze and Muslim populations, hoping to quell the influence of Syrian separatists and radicals. Bechara is also known for his rather stringent attachment to power, having desired to pass numerous amendments that would increase his own and his cabinet’s influence on the country. Accusations of corruption have also been levied at him, owing to his ties to Maronite and Muslim businessmen such as his colleague Boutros and the influential Frangieh family."

 LEB_fuad_chehab_biography: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 19th, 1902, in Ghazir, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Fouad Abdullah Chehab was born in the Keserwan district, but moved to live in Jounieh with his uncles at an early age. Fuad was from the Maronite branch of the prestigious Chehab dynasty, who once ruled the Emirate of Lebanon as an Ottoman vassal, but over time his family had become greatly impoverished. After the Weltkrieg he chose to enlist in the Ottoman army, hoping to secure a steady financial income. He turned out to be apt for military matters which was noticed by his superiors and he was eventually recommended to an officer school in Aleppo, during a period of political thaw in the Ottoman military. During this time Chehab became more intimate with liberal and reformists ideas, initially being an admirer of Mustafa Kemal after studying the general turned Grand Vizier’s innovative approach to both military and political matters. In a few years time however, Chehab gradually grew more radical, associating with various progressive and republican groups, as well as corresponding with key nationalist figures back in his home of Lebanon. After graduating with top marks, Chehab remained posted in Syria and oversaw garrison duties out on the frontier, but his Christian faith prevented him from attaining any higher military position. This was one of the reasons why Chehab’s sympathies for the nationalist movements in Lebanon and Syria only grew. Like many of his former classmates in Aleppo, he defected to join the Syrian revolt, serving as both a vital strategic mastermind and an effective figurehead for rallying the Lebanese Maronites to fight for their freedom."
 LEB_fuad_chehab_leader_desc: "$LEB_fuad_chehab_biography$\nIn the aftermath of the Lebanese Declaration of Independence, Chehab has been appointed as the nation’s provisional president, owing to his influential ties within both military and political circles. Although regarded as something of a reluctant leader, Chehab has still been able to fulfil the role he’s been given, bringing much needed order to Beirut. Some have expressed worry about Chehab’s strong armed measures though, fearing that the General’s rather apolitical vision for the Lebanese Revolution, which puts national stability firmly before partisan politics, could potentially hamper the future development of a multiparty democracy."
 LEB_fuad_chehab_autdem_leader_desc: "$LEB_fuad_chehab_biography$\nAfter refusing to surrender his emergency powers as provisional president, and now having consolidated his hold on the state, following a series of failed violent insurrections by both Maronite extremists and Arab nationalists, Fouad Chehab has assumed the role of a guardian of Lebanon’s democratic future. Despite wide-spread condemnation by the parliament, he has derided the Lebanese political parties as being far too concerned with their own partisan issues and putting personal grudges ahead of the nation’s interests. It remains to be seen if Lebanon’s new great helmsman can steer the nation away from corrupt political scheming, familial oligarchies and radical populism, having promised that once these faults of the political system have been excised, a true Lebanese democracy will flourish under the legacy of Chehabism."

 LEB_charles_helou_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 25th, 1913, in Beirut, Vilayet of Beirut, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Few had expected Charles Alexandre Helou, a former member of the Marada Movement, to become Fouad Chehab’s successor. Born to an influential Maronite family from the Mount Lebanon Mutasufarriate’s capital of Baabda, his family connections not only allowed him into prominent European run schools, but also introduced him to the social circles of the Lebanese Independence movement. Helou emerged as something of an apolitical weathervane, moving smoothly between different political cliques and factions, as ideological trends changed around him. He has at various times been affiliated with Michael Chiha, Petro Trad, the Maronite clergy, Pierre Amine Jumayyil and now Fouad Chehab. Helou joined the Marada Movement seemingly on a whim, but grew alienated by their choice to adopt violence methods. He eventually turned out to be more the right material for a diplomat than a fighter, catching General Chehab’s eye after he was one of the men sent by the Marada to negotiate their integration into the Provisional Government and Lebanese Volunteer Army. Chehab took the easily influenced Helou under his wing, encouraging him to join the Provisional Government as an independent minister, like many other of Chehab’s followers. Helou’s lack of political guile and his admiration for Chehab left him as the perfect choice as a successor once Chehab’s term ran out, despite Helou’s previous affiliation with the Marada. After a heavily controlled election he has now become a civilian face for the enduring military administration."

 LEB_patriarch_antoine_peter_arida_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 2nd, 1863, in Bqarqacha, Vilayet of Beirut, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Patriarchatus Antonius the Second is a man of many names, although most commonly known by his title of Antonius Petros, or in Arabic as Antoine Boutros and in English as Anthony Peter. He was born with the name Selim Ben Abdel Ahad Arida and learned Arabic and Syriac as a schoolboy. From 1884 to 1890 he studied theology at the school of Saint-Sulpice, Paris and after returning to Lebanon was later ordained a Maronite priest in 1890. Later, he was made the Maronite bishop of Tripoli in 1908 by then Patriarch of Antioch, Elias Peter Hoayek. Hoayek was known as a colossal force in Lebanese politics, and commonly regarded as the “Father of Maronite Nationalism”. This left Arida with big shoes to fill when in 1931, the Maronite Church elected him Patriarch, receiving the Pope’s blessing shortly after. Arida took on the traditional name of Peter and the regnal name of Anthony the Second, beginning to guide the Church down a somewhat more liberal path than his die-hard predecessor. Notably, he began cooperating with other Eastern Catholic sects who remained in Lebanon, to consolidate Christian influence behind the Maronites, giving autonomy to Jesuits and Coptics in exchange for their political support. Arida is also known as a great architect and philanthropist for his work in renovating the estates of the Bishopric of Tripoli, as well as the Patriarch’s summer residence in Diman, which he personally funded with the help of his brother. Additionally, during his rule as Patriarch he has overseen the expansion of numerous monasteries and the establishment of church owned silk and cement factories to help finance these religious communities."
