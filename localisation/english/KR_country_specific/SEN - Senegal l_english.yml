 SEN_lamine_gueye: "Lamine Gueye"

 SEN_blaise_diagne: "Blaise Diagne"
 SEN_blaise_diagne_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 13th, 1872, in Gorée, Sénégal, French Republic§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn in the Old Commune of Gorée, Diagne served as a customs official for the French colonial bureaucracy before becoming the first African elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1914. He was an advocate for African equality with Metropolitan French citizens within the legal structure of the French Republic, and was a leading figure in Clemenceau's war cabinet, recruiting thousands of African servicemen with promises of rights and pensions. The failure of the Nivelle Offensive in 1917, in which the tirailleurs suffered severe casualties, complicated this relationship. Diagne felt a personal responsibility, having recruited many of the men who died in the offensive, and led an inquiry into the matter. He presented his findings to a secret session of the Chamber of Deputies, alleging that the French Army, and in particular General Charles Mangin, misused the tirailleurs under his command. Initially, Diagne was encouraged by the deputies' reaction, but any outrage among high political and military officials died out as the war stagnated and then turned against France. The tirailleurs were called upon again and again to sacrifice their lives, and Diagne watched as the men he promised liberty and peace died for a country that seemed to see them as little more than shock troops. His loyalty to the Republic profoundly shaken, Diagne turned his connections to the French Section of the Workers' International and his eminent position among the évolués of Senegal to the task of building a nationalist movement, a task that only became more urgent with the collapse of the Third Republic and the birth of the Algiers regime, and as his health began to fail him in old age.§!"

 SEN_leopold_sendar_senghor: "Léopold Sédar Senghor"
 SEN_leopold_sendar_senghor_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 9th, 1906, in Joal, Colony of Sénégal, French West Africa§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn to a wealthy family with customary royal connections, Senghor attended the Ngasobil Fathers of the Holy Spirit boarding school and in 1922 entered seminary school before dropping out to complete a secular education in the humanities, in which he achieved great distinction. He was offered a partial scholarship to study at the University of Algiers, which he accepted with the goal of becoming a teacher, but during his time at Algiers, he became involved with the nascent Négritude movement, which by that time had begun to spread to North Africa from salons in Paris. Driven by a desire to be close to the source of the revolutionary new ideas of the movement, Senghor dropped out of the University of Algiers and travelled to France by way of Spain. He completed his Agrégation at the Sorbonne in 1935 and taught for a time while writing prolifically for the chief Negritude journal, L'Etudiant Noir, publishing poems, treatises on black equality, and accounts of the wartime experience of the tirailleurs who fought for France before settling in the Commune after the war. With Senegal's declaration of independence, he returned home and settled in Dakar, eager to contribute to his country's political and artistic life.§!"

 SEN_ngalandou_diouf: "Ngalandou Diouf"
 SEN_ngalandou_diouf_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 14th, 1875, in Saint-Louis, Sénégal, French Republic§!\n§YBackground:§! §LNgalandou Diouf was to an upper-class Muslim family, and initially worked as a schoolteacher, before becoming involved in politics following his election to the General Assembly of Saint-Louis. He initially supported the political ascendancy of Blaise Diagne, but the two split following the Weltkrieg; Diouf believed that Diagne was too pro-French, and the Communard Revolution only intensified his anti-socialist sentiments even as it strengthened Diagne's socialist convictions. As a result, Diouf became popular among évolués who remained loyal to the French. He is seen as one of the only figures in French Africa capable of challenging Diagne's political dominance, even if his support is limited to the évolués and a handful of customary chiefs.§!"

 SEN_abdoulaye_ndiaye: "Abdoulaye N'Diaye"
 SEN_abdoulaye_ndiaye_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1894, in Thiowor, Colony of Sénégal, French West Africa§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAbdoulaye N'Diaye was one of the tirailleurs lucky enough to live through the Weltkrieg. Wounded twice and decorated with the Croix de Guerre and Médaille Militaire for his service at Verdun, N'Diaye returned to Thiowor after the war to tend to his family's farm, one of the even fewer tirailleurs to return to Africa following the Communard Revolution. When Diagne heard the news that Senegal was revolting against the French, he elected to stand with his countrymen and mustered in his old uniform before the Senegalese provisional government at Dakar. Blaise Diagne's affection for the old tirailleurs saw him take a shine to N'Diaye, and he was given command in the new Armée Sénégalaise.§!"
