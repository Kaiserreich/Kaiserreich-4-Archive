### Initial Parties ####
 KOR_totalist_party: "KWP"
 KOR_totalist_party_long: "Korean Worker's Party\n§gA small faction built from the contingent of Koreans within the Chinese Syndicalist Party or those who have found the KNRP too 'moderate'. Prior to its return to Korea, the KWP was based in Paris where its members became heavily inspired by the ideas of neosocialism and fringe Labour vanguardists.§!\n"
 KOR_radical_socialist_party: "KNRP"
 KOR_radical_socialist_party_long: "Korean National Revolutionary Party\n§gThe KNRP is the official sister organisation of the Kuomintang, formed from old contingents of the KIP unwilling to cooperate with its predominantly antisocialist government. The KNRP seeks to implement the Three Principles of the People to Korea as well, whether it be through methods democratic or more coercive. While it was certainly an apolitical organisation within the Kuomintang, its members have a range of leanings from those who supported the Provisional Action Committee and those who supported the Reorganised Comrades Association.§!\n"
 KOR_syndicalist_party: "KWP"
 KOR_syndicalist_party_long: "Korean Worker's Party\n§gA small faction built from the contingent of Koreans within the Chinese Syndicalist Party or those who have found the KNRP too 'moderate'.

 KOR_social_democrat_party: "CPKI"
 KOR_social_democrat_party_long: "Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence\n§gThe Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence is a committee built on unifying all the political factions in the Korean political sphere to one common goal: the independence of Korea. Although dominated by ex-KIP leftists, the committee wastes no effort or resource to seek the blessings and support of other factions, while defending itself against the attacks of said different factions. With independence now in grasp, the committee now turns its goal towards keeping the factions unified and disputes and unrest at bay, keeping the peace in Korea until the nation becomes stable, meanwhile also using all available force to steer the new state and nation towards some form of prosperity.§!\n"

As part of his reforms to modernise Korea, Kim has implemented the ideals of the Three Principles of the People - taking a strong influence from the Chinese Kuomintang. Today, Korean representatives met with [ROOT.GetLeader], to discuss the future relationship between the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea.

Yet, despite Korea's hard-fought independence, the Koreans have not forgotten the aid and friendship they held with their Chinese comrades in the Kuomintang. Today, Korean representatives met with [ROOT.GetLeader], to discuss the future relationship between the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. While Korea is to remain under China's sphere and protection, it will nonetheless enjoy a sense of nominal autonomy - as the two have pledged to work together as twin tigers to maintain peace, security, and stability in East Asia."

 KOR_cho_bong_am: "Cho Bong Am"

 KOR_kim_koo: "Kim Koo"
 KOR_kim_koo_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 29th, 1876, in Haeju, Hwanghae, Joseon\n§YPolitical Career:§! Towering over both his allies and opponents, Kim Koo is both the political embodiment of what remains of Korean nationalism while also the puppeteer behind countless cases of white terror. Born large, a young Kim Koo enlisted himself into the peasant armies in the Tonghak Movement, and as the Uprising scattered, he was rescued by An Taehoon, the father of the legendary An Junggeun, later assassin of Itō Hirobumi. In 1896 Kim would be arrested for murdering a Japanese merchant, believing him to be a military officer. After escaping, Kim turned away from politics,instead, he worked to establish schools with the help of churches. By 1905, however, outraged by the signing of the Japan-Korea treaty, Kim returned to the nationalist scene, befriending like-minded individuals who would become his comrades.\n\nWith the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai in 1925, Kim became one of its integral members, quickly establishing his position as the backbone of the Provisional Government, whether it be direct or indirect. Within his rise to power, Kim served as both a member of the Korean Provisional Congress and as the Chief of Policing, doing what he could to halt infiltrating traitors. Meanwhile, his activities included multiples assassinations of his comradery, many of whom served as obstacles in his power hoard. By 1923 he was appointed Provisional Interior Minister and in 1926 Prime Minister. In 1930 he established the Korean Independence Party, which became the solidifying element of his rise to power. As the unchallenged leader of the Korean State and Nation, Kim Koo looks forward into the abyss."

 KOR_yi_kang: "Yi Kang"
 KOR_yi_kang_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 30th, 1877, in Seoul, Joseon\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born as the fifth son of Gojong through his concubine Lady Jang, Yi Kang became Prince Uihwa in 1892. Falling into lawsuits and debts after being wedded to Kim Deoksu, the prince became Korea’s special ambassador to Japan in 1895 to partake in the Japanese victory celebrations over the Chinese in the First Sino-Japanese War. Having no issue of his own, he served as an ambassador to European countries and the United States, although his playboy lifestyle and profligate spending antagonised the Korean government. He participated in the Korean Red Cross from 1906 to 1907; however, when his father abdicated, his half-brother Prince Yi Un became crown prince due to his father’s dislike of him.\n\nFollowing Japan’s annexation of Korea in 1910, Yi Kang became increasingly dissatisfied with his status despite being provided with a generous annual allowance. When he heard the news of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in 1928, he attempted to flee Korea to join the exiles. His escape was a failure, and despite Yi Kang’s efforts to remove his titles, he effectively remained a political prisoner in Seoul. In 1930, he officially retired. Despite all this, his burning desire to see Korea independent never faded; he once remarked that he would rather be a peasant in an independent Korea than a noble under Japanese rule.\n\nWhen troops under the Qing Empire liberated Korea at the end of the Second-Sino Japanese War, Yi Kang was finally able to meet the Provisional Government that had been in exile for so long. To honour the Qing’s historical relationship with the Korean people and  to acknowledge Korea’s new relationship with China, Yi Kang was almost unanimously declared as King of a revived Korean Empire. He now bears the responsibility of carrying on the Korean Empire's glorious legacy under the banner of a newly freed Korea."

 KOR_yi_un: "Yi Un"
 KOR_yi_un_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! October 20th, 1897, in Seoul, Korean Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born into the family of Joseon royalty as the seventh son of Gojong, the Gwangmu Emperor, Yi Un hardly knew what it was like to be King of Korea. Anointed as Crown Prince in 1907, he was taken at the age of ten to Japan at the initiative of Ito Hibroumi. Here, the Japanese Emperor Meiji took a particular liking and attention to the young Korean prince. The prince grew up with Japanese nobility, such as the princes Hirohito, Takamatsu, and Chichibu. However, after Ito’s assassination in 1909, the Meiji Emperor stopped seeing Yi Un, and the Korean prince became a captive in his adopted country.\n\nFrom 1911-to 1924, Yi Un served in the Japanese Army despite his short stature after enrolling in the Army Central Youth School. From 1927-to 1928, the prince decided to see the world outside Japan and Korea. He thus embarked on a voyage to Europe, visiting the syndicalist capitals of London and Paris and visiting the German and Austrian Empires before returning to Japan in late 1928.\n\nWhen the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Yi Un served in the North China Army—where he was captured in the intense fighting along the Sino-Korean border by Qing forces. With the Qing’s support, the Korean Independence Party agreed to acknowledge Yi Un as the rightful heir of Joseon and adopt their government as one akin to their Chinese neighbours - that of a constitutional monarchy. As the new king of the restored House of Yi, Yi Un leads a new and revived Korean Empire - one that will no doubt echo the triumphs of Korea’s glorious past."

 KOR_kim_hong_il: "Kim Hong-il"
 KOR_kim_hong_il_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gSeptember 23rd, 1898, in Yongcheon, North Pyeongan, Korean Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gKim Hong-il’s childhood shook with the blasts of cannons as the Russo-Japanese War began in his hometown. Soon the war ended and followed the collapse of the Korean Empire under the Japanese jackboot, and Kim, who had seen the horrors of war and the fall of a nation at a very early age, began his struggle to fight for his country. After a turbulent youth travelling between Korea and China, eventually settling as a teacher, the Japanese police would catch up to Kim’s footsteps. He ultimately fled to Manchuria, where his brother ran a business. In 1918 Kim would find himself in Shanghai, where he would meet Huang Jue, a fellow Anti-Japanese partisan, which would help Kim enrol himself as a cadet in the Guizhou Military Academy. Kim, who began his education with the rather abrupt misplacement of his weapon, was placed under the special tutoring of He Yingqin, who taught him well to the point where he would graduate with honours. After graduating, Kim would make his way to Shanghai in search of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea but would be shunned by its infighting sparked by the recent impeachment of Syngman Rhee. Later, Kim would have an on-and-off career as a mercenary and an educator between China, Manchuria, and the Russian Far East.\n\nWhile attending a funeral, Kim would meet Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who encouraged his cause for independence greatly. By the beginning of the Northern Expedition, Kim had joined the Kuomintang and began service as his old teacher, He Yingqin’s adjutant. During the expedition, Kim would persuade Korean pilots from the Zhili armies to the KMT cause. By the end of the Northern Expedition, he would climb the ranks to become a general, although the fall of the KMT would make that achievement rather unnecessary. Kim would follow He back to Guizhou and later to Yunnan, where he became part of the remnants of the NRA loyal to Zhu Peide. In 1931 Kim re-establish contact with the Korean Provisional Government office in Shanghai and became one of the leaders of the Korean Liberation Army while also becoming one of the arms contacts of the PGROK.§!\n\n§YNotes: As a close aide and long time friend of He Yingqin, he is associated with the Kuomintang and Korean independence movement's right-wing.§!"

Inspired by the Nationalist Chinese Government set up in Guangzhou, Kim enrolled himself into the Whampoa Military Academy in January 1926 to train a proper army against the Japanese. As the expedition came to a failure, Kim would move around continental China helping socialist and Korean nationalist movements organise themselves. After disassociating himself from the Third Internationale in 1931, Kim would contact his old friends in Whampoa to re-insert himself as an associated officer of the Kuomintang. As such, he decided to fully integrate himself, along with the remnants of the Heroic Corps, into the Left KMT, who would use his expertise in espionage from his time fighting for Korean independence while gaining access to further training of Korean cadets. In 1932 Kim organised the Korean National Revolutionary Party, acting as the sister organisation to the KMT within the also widely KMT-associated Korean Provisional Government, and as the opposition to its ruling party, the Korean Independence Party.§!\n\n§YNotes: Connected to almost all factions within the KMT to some degree, and to respect his position as a partner in pragmatism, Kim Wonbong is mostly above internal party politics.§!"

He has emerged as an energetic and passionate leader as shown in his leadership and courage in the National Revolutionary Army during the Second Northern Expedition and the war with Japan.

Pak Hon-yong, born illegitimate son to an Yangban father, travelled to Seoul to seek study, and in the process became affiliated with nationalist thought. Forced into exile and a loyalist to a stateless nation, Pak went to foreign shores to find refuge. He settled in Europe, growing ideologically entangled with the rise of Syndicalism in France, Italy, and Britain. Profoundly affected by the revolutions he witnessed, Pak would be one of the first Koreans to be affiliated with the Third Internationale, and returned to Korea as an undercover agent to spread syndicalist ideals to the Japanese occupied peninsula. After a period of imprisonment and illness, Pak miraculously escaped the wrath of the Japanese forces and found his way back to Paris. There he involved himself deeply in the burgeoning Totalist movement, drawing himself close to Mosley and Mussolini's camps and finding common ground with their nationalistic tendencies. By 1931, Pak shuttled between Europe and Shanghai, where he could freely support both the struggle for independence and the struggle for syndicalism, initiating the publication of pro-syndicalist newspapers. The following year Pak condemned the Provisional Government for being too reactionary and excluding socialists thinkers. Having found a similarly minded backer, Pak firmly asserts himself as the champion of totalism in Korea, and the might of red rule has only begun."

Not all Korean nationalists affiliated themselves with the Provisional Government, and Lyuh Woon-hyung, once the Foreign Minister for the PGROK, is one of them. As foreign minister, Lyuh often found himself opposing the dominant factions. Lyuh was frequently approached in secret by Japanese officials trying to turn him, all returned bare-handed, if not severely ridiculed. Tiring of the constant factionalisation of the PGROK, he sought new contacts in the Third Internationale and the Kuomintang, only to fall out with them as well. After a tour of Southeast Asia fighting along local nationalists against the German colonial presence, Lyuh was eventually captured during a football match in Qingdao, where the German authorities promptly extradited him to Japan. After a short period of imprisonment Lyuh would return to the stage as the head of the Joongang Newspaper Company. He used this time to establish contacts with the various bickering groups in Korea, including his former rivals, building an underground presence hidden from the searchlights of the Japanese. This became known as the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence and as its leader Lyuh attempts to seek a unified force of all ideologies within the new Korean state. Under him, Korea shall grow strong, strong enough to weather the waves that it must bear alone. After years of trauma, Korea must not become a satellite or a 'Sister Republic' but instead a fully free and independent democracy!"

Jo So-ang, alumni of Sungkyunkwan, was selected by the Korean Imperial government to represent his country on an educational trip to Japan. Upon arriving, he encountered immense prejudice against his countrymen, and there began his long struggle to achieve his nation's independence. Jo would enrol into Meiji University as a law student but soon be shocked by the news of the annexation of Korea. After a long period of suffering from anxiety and depression, Jo would travel to Shanghai in an attempt to evade the spying eyes of the Japanese authorities. There, he would cross paths with the Korean officials who would later become the backbone of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Upon finishing his education, he settled in China for good. When the May 30th Movement shook eastern China, Jo quickly travelled to Shanghai, where he would meet up with his comrades and friends, who united together to form the Provisional Government. The year 1928 saw Jo, along with his two comrades, Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hong, arriving in the Shanghai Conference as the delegates of Syngman Rhee. Returning with what would be Rhee’s downfall, Jo took the initiative to meet up with and participate in the KIP. Once the KNRP was established, Jo would again side differently now with Kim Wonbong. Kim, an ardent believer in the three principles of the people, welcomed Jo and his draft of Samgyunism, a Koreanised version of the principles that Kim was willing to accept to distance his party as a mere Kuomintang puppet. Jo now stands independent away from both reactionary bickering and Sinophilic socialists, trying his best to light a beacon of liberalism so his now finally independent motherland may sail soundly against the tide of history."

After the impeachment and exile, then subsequent disappearance of Dr. Syngman Rhee in 1928, a young Chough Pyung-ok would meet many of Rhee's exiled and dispersing subordinates while studying in the United States. Greatly influenced by them and his patriotic father, Chough quickly returned to Korea to ignite independence movements at home. Neither affiliated with the Provisional Government nor the socialist presence, Chough would reunite with his friends of the old Rhee faction and form what would be the roots of the Korean Democratic Party, absorbing liberal elements from the KIP into their ranks. Full of zeal, the small party would attack the socialists and the KIP for their questionable ethics. Struggling, however, Chough and his subordinates eventually turned to deal with the devil, accepting hefty donations and entries from none other than their old enemy, the collaborators. With their money and power, the KDP grew from a small group to a fully-fledged political party but would permanently carry the stain as the party of the traitors."
