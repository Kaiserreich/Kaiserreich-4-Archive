### Ideas ###
 CRO_croatian_command: "Croatian Officers"
 CRO_croatian_command_desc: "The Croatian people fought to make an Illyria free of Austria a reality, while the rest of the so called Illyrians hid in their cities and did nothing. It is for this reason that we must restrict all officer positions to Croatians at the cost of alienating the rest of our countrymen."

### Intro Screen ###
 CRO_country_intro_background: "GFX_CRO_intro"
 CRO_country_intro_header: "Kingdom of Illyria"
 CRO_country_intro_content: "The Triune Kingdom of Illyria, which consists of the former Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Kingdom of Dalmatia and Condominium of Bosnia was proclaimed after the Crisis in Austria-Hungary and German Intervention in 1926. The creation of Illyria was proposed by the loyal to Vienna Croatian aristocrats and officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, who promised to be loyal to the Kaiser Karl and Austria, but claimed more autonomy and the end of the Hungarian rule on the lands of the South Slavs. Though the Triune Kingdom should have become a home for the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks, in fact there are a lot of controversies between these nations. The Serbs want to reunite with their Serbian Motherland, the Bosniaks want to get more independence, and the Croats, who have a relative majority in the country, want to strengthen their position in the country and reorganise it into the Great Croatia. But now the Austrians help us to secure the order of our Balkan Kingdom."

### Events ###
 croatia_events.3.t: "Matica ilirska"
 croatia_events.3.d: "'Matica ilirska' ('Parent body of the Illyrians') is the oldest educational organisation in Illyria, which started its activity as a book publishing company in 1842. The main aim of 'Matica' is the promotion of the Illyrian culture and language and also support to the mutual understanding between the nations of Illyria. With help of the 'Matica ilirska' the leaders of Illyria try to form a well-educated and united Illyrian nation. Now one of the most important missions of the organisation is the codification of the Illyrian language standard. Though it has been a hard work, but it seems that the most famous Illyrian writers and linguists have finally negotiated, which rules of the language our young generation will learn at schools. The creation of the united Illyrian nation is closer now!"
 croatia_events.3.a: "Wistful is my Slavic soul, I'm Illyrian!"

 croatia_events.4.t: "Sarajevo Agreement"
 croatia_events.4.d: "The nations of our Triune Kingdom use one South Slavic language, but the Croat, Serbian and Bosnian versions of it have some differences. More over, the Serbs use the Cyrillic script, while the Croats and Bosniaks prefer the Latin script. 'Matica ilirska' has already established the united standards of the language, which will be used in our Kingdom, but we still don't know, how to name our language. We can name it 'Croatian' and use the Latin script, since the Croats constitute the majority in our country with 60% of the population. Another possible name is the 'Serbo-Croatian' with both Cyrillic and Latin scripts to represent the role of the Serbs, who are the main minority in Illyria with 30% of our citizens. Or we can name the language 'Illyrian' to encourage the unification of our people and use the Latin script."
 croatia_events.4.a: "The Croat language is the only one in Illyria!"
 croatia_events.4.b: "Long live Brotherhood and Unity - the Serbo-Croatian!"
 croatia_events.4.c: "We are the Illyrians - and we speak Illyrian!"

 croatia_events.5.t: "Highway 'Unity'"
 croatia_events.5.d: "The construction of the highway 'Unity' was proposed by our prime minister in order to connect the biggest cities of the Illyria - Zagreb, Sarajevo and Podgorica. With the Austrian subsidies we will be able to hire enough workers and complete the construction soon. This project will also help us to reduce the unemployment rate in many our regions and revive the construction market in the Kingdom."
 croatia_events.5.a: "We worked, we work and we will work even more!"

 CRO_slavko_kvaternik_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 25th, 1878, in Moravice, Modruš-Rijeka County, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LKvaternik graduated from Vienna's Kriegsschule before the Weltkrieg, and from October 1914 to February 1916, he was adjutant to none-other than Svetozar Borojević, one of the most respected and competent commanders of the war. He would spend most of the war as a staff officer on the Italian front and, in 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became chief of staff of the 55th Infantry Division, part of the Army of the Isonzo. After the Austro-Hungarian Army's success against the Italians in 1919, Kvaternik was promoted once more and would end the war as a colonel. After the war, he remained in the army, retaining a high position among the staff of the semi-independent Croatian-Slavonian Home Guard behind illustrious Croatian war heroes such as Borojević and Stjepan Sarkotić. He quickly secured an important position as the Croatian-Slavonian Home Guard was reformed as the Illyrian Home Guard, making him a logical choice to succeed the ageing heroes, as Borojević passed away in 1923, and Sarkotić rose up to esteemed positions in the Austro-Hungarian Army before his retirement and term as Ban (governor) of Illyria. With the war heroes having passed their torch over to the younger generation, Kvaternik has found himself to be one of the most important Croatian commanders in the Austro-Hungarian Army, though he is largely untested as a field commander and his disdain for ethnic Serbs has caused significant friction in the Home Guard.§!"

 CRO_mihajlo_lukic: "Mihajlo Lukić"
 CRO_mihajlo_lukic_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LSeptember 24th, 1886, in Virje, Bjelovar-Križevci County, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHailing from a family of Serbian origin, Lukić attended a cadet school in Karlovac before studying in Vienna's Kriegsschule. He completed his staff officer courses shortly before the Weltkrieg began and would serve for the entirety of the war. After the war, he quickly rose up the ranks within the Austro-Hungarian general staff and was made colonel in 1931, then general in 1935. With his wartime experience and later work with Austrian alpine troops, he is one of the likely candidates to lead mountain units should larger ones be organised in the future.§!"

 CRO_fedor_dragojlov: "Fedor Dragojlov"
 CRO_fedor_dragojlov_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 21st, 1881, in Pančevo, Torontál County, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSon of a captain, Dragojlov comes from an Eastern Orthodox military family, graduating from the Military Technical Academy and the Kriegsschule in Vienna before the outbreak of war. He served in the Austro-Hungarian General Staff throughout the war, ending the war with the rank of colonel. Along with Kvaternik, Dragojlov was seen, after the war, as one of the potential successors to the Croat war heroes as they retired or passed away. For most of the interwar, he was assigned to the War Ministry in Vienna as part of the Operations Department. As he was made general in 1930, he began overhauling the training of Illyrian Home Guard units, especially with regards to mountain warfare.§!"

 CRO_eduard_bunic_de_bona: "Eduard Bunić de Bona"
 CRO_eduard_bunic_de_bona_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 14th, 1894, in Ogulin, Modruš-Rijeka County, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LScion of the oldest of Dubrovnik's noble families and one of the oldest in Europe, Bunić chose a military career early in his life. He had barely been commissioned as a junior officer when the Weltkrieg broke out, and he would serve through the entire war in various cavalry regiments. By the end of the war, he was a captain, and he stayed in the Home Guard afterwards. In 1924, he attended the Kriegsschule in Vienna to train as a staff officer before being assigned to the Ministry of Defence in Zagreb, slowly rising to the rank of colonel by 1936. While he has no frontline experience at a level higher than company-level, he is one of the few Croat officers with experience with cavalry, even if that arm of the Home Guard has seen limited love since the war.§!"

 CRO_matija_canic: "Matija Čanić"
 CRO_matija_canic_commander_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1901, in Gospić, Lika-Krbava County, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LLittle is known about Čanić's early life. What is known is that he served in the Croatian-Slavonian Home Guard during the latter part of the Weltkrieg. By the end of it, he was captain of a cavalry squadron of the 10th Home Guard Hussar Regiment. After the war, he remained in the Home Guard as it was reorganised into the military force of the reorganised Kingdom of Illyria. He was eventually set to Vienna to take staff officer courses at the Kriegsschule, graduating in 1926. He then served in the Illyrian Ministry of Defence, where he rose to the rank of colonel. It is no secret that he is a very young commander with limited experience, and what little he has was commanding nothing larger than a squadron.§!"

 CRO_vladimir_laxa: "Vladimir Laxa"
 CRO_vladimir_laxa_army_chief_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 21st, 1870, in Sisak, Zagreb County, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary§!\n§YBackground:§! §LCommissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1890, Laxa was already a senior officer when the Weltkrieg broke out. In 1917, as colonel of the general staff and commander of the 18th Infantry Brigade, he distinguished himself during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo: For \"heroism, enormous bravery, and tenaciously successful defence of positions\", he was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresia, the Austro-Hungarian Army's top award. He was, without a doubt, one of the most distinguished Croat senior officers of the war, and rapidly rose through the ranks after its conclusion. He is largely seen as de facto \"second-in-command\" of the Illyrian Home Guard behind Kvaternik, with General Dragojlov his nearest equivalent. However, his relationship with the former remains tense, and could become strained over disagreements in leadership style.§!"
