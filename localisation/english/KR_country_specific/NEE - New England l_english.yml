### Parties ###
 NEE_totalist_party: "TUEL"
 NEE_totalist_party_long: "Trade Union Educational League\n§LThe latest and longest lasting of several Syndicalist labour organisations founded by William Z. Foster, the Trade Union Educational League was founded in 1920 from the remnants of Foster’s Syndicalist League of North America and International Trade Union Educational League. Opposed to the Socialist Party’s policies of electoral participation and the IWW’s strategy of dual unionism, the TUEL instead maintains an anti-political ultra-syndicalist approach of \"boring from within\" the American Federation of Labor, a strategy which has seen some success, particularly in Chicago, where the Chicago Federation of Labor led by John Fitzpatrick has become closely aligned with Foster. Ideologically meanwhile, the TUEL has diverged somewhat from mainstream socialism in the United States, promoting a form of \"Patriotic Syndicalism\" that borrows from Sorelian ideas emerging across the Atlantic.§!\n"
 NEE_syndicalist_party: "Socialists (Ind. Unionists)"
 NEE_syndicalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America - Industrial Unionist Faction\n§LFounded in 1901, the Socialist Party of America quickly gained traction as the premier socialist political force in the United States. First drawing support from workers, farmers, immigrants, and social reformers, among others, it was soon faced with crisis, as the revolutionary wave of the late 1910s sparked a large factional struggle within the party, between the moderate \"Regulars\" and the \"Radicals\", who supported revolutionary action.\n\nThough the Radicals eventually emerged victorious, they were compelled by the success of the British Revolution to join Farmer-Labor, a decision which enabled them to make sweeping electoral gains in the 1932 and ‘34 elections, taking control of several midwestern state governments. It was this infiltration of Farmer-Labor which allowed the SPA to grow into a formidable political force, one capable of fermenting Civil War. As such, the party is now strictly banned in New England territory, with organisers arrested (or worse) on even remote suspicion.§!\n"

 NEE_radical_socialist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America - Progressive Caucus\n§LFounded in 1901, the Socialist Party of America quickly gained traction as the premier socialist political force in the United States.

 NEE_social_democrat_party: "Farmer-Labor"
 NEE_social_democrat_party_long: "Farmer-Labor Party\n§LWith the collapse of the old Farmer-Labor Party and the abrupt exit of the SPA from legal politics, remaining loyalist Farmer-Labor politicians sought to reorganise their political party without the interference of the Socialists. Already marginal in New England, the Farmer-Labor Party was dealt a crippling blow by the onset of the Civil War and occupation, and as such has become even more of a non-factor in New England politics than it was previously.§!\n"
 NEE_social_liberal_party: "Democrats (Lib.)"
 NEE_social_liberal_party_long: "Democratic Party - Liberal Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nIn New England, the liberal wing of the Democrats has been the predominant strain in the party since the revival of its fortunes in the 20th century. It is generally supported by urban \"ethnic\" catholic voters, as well as liberals opposed to Farmer-Labor, and supports modest government intervention to support the economy, as well as greater participation on the world stage.§!\n"
 NEE_market_liberal_party: "Republicans"
 NEE_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party\n§LFounded in 1854 as a broad tent party opposed to the Slave Power, the Republican Party has generally been regarded as the United States’ \"natural governing party\" since the end of the American Civil War. Representing the industrial interests which came to predominate in the country after the defeat of the Slave Power, as well as northeastern old stock protestants and wealthier western farmers, the Republican coalition has until recently generally maintained a long-term stranglehold on US politics.\n\nHaving once held a stranglehold over New England politics, the Republican Party now faces stiff competition from the Democrats, particularly in urban, catholic areas. The natural party of white protestants, New England Republicans can generally be categorised as either moderate or conservative on the national level, with fewer progressives in the typically conservative northeast.§!\n"
 NEE_social_conservative_party: "Democrats (Con.)"
 NEE_social_conservative_party_long: "Democratic Party - Conservative Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nThe conservative wing of the Democrats, usually associated with the south, has been dominant in that region since the end of reconstruction. It is the natural ruling party in most of the south, with nomination tantamount to election. Divided between agrarian reactionaries and more reform-minded moderate conservatives, they are generally opposed to Civil Rights reform and cartelisation of the economy, supporting smaller businesses and landowners.§!\n"
 NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Union (Reactionaries)"
 NEE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Union Party - Reactionary Faction\n§LThe newest major party in US politics, the Union Party was recently formed primarily as a vehicle for Huey Long’s bid for the Presidency, when it became clear he would not be able to attain the Democratic nomination. A broad-tent alliance comprising Democrats, reactionaries, and anti-syndicalist Progressives, they are united by little more than their shared opposition to the Smith Administration, and at least a temporary unity behind Long as their leader.\n\nThough traditionally Long’s base of support has been in the midwestern farm states, reactionary and populist southern Democratic leaders such as Eugene Talmadge and Theodore Bilbo have rallied behind Long out of their opposition to Smith. These southern Democrats are united primarily by their belief in white supremacy and disdain for Smith’s particular brand of liberalism. Their unity behind Long however is clearly conditional, and unlikely to last if push comes to shove.§!\n"

Long has aligned himself with western senators such as Burton Wheeler, who have come out to support his \"Share Our Wealth\" platform. It is this western faction of Long’s new party which is most loyal to him personally, and likely to stick with him through thick and thin.§!\n"

 NEE_Underground_Railroad_Smuggling_dc_desc: "While the rest of America fell into the darkness of the Second American Civil War, the people of New England were spared that same horror through the timely intervention of the Canadian armed forces. However, the Canadians were not able to save everyone in America who wished to avoid being drawn up into a war that they did not believe in. Many family members have become cut off from their loved ones and are trapped behind enemy lines.\n\nDespite the dangers, many attempt to travel vast distances to reach the safety of §G[NEE.GetNameWithFlag]§!, an island of peace in the swirling ocean of chaos that is the civil war.

### Ideas ###
 NEE_Arsenal_of_Democracy_idea: "Arsenal of Democracy"
 NEE_Arsenal_of_Democracy_idea_desc: "The collapse of the United States into civil war certainly thrust the idea of American democracy into a state of uncertainty. With our industrial sectors operating at full capacity and our armament output greater than ever before; it is our duty to the democratic nations of the world that our economy can and will be - the Arsenal of Democracy. In war and in peace, we will apply ourselves with the same urgency, patriotism, and self-sacrifice in our commitment to the freedom of the world's nations."

 NEE_Special_Forces: "Special Forces of the Republic"
 NEE_Special_Forces_desc: "Inserted deep behind enemy lines, the special forces of New England hold much in common with their colonial Ranger ancestors from the American Revolution. Forged from the harshest of training conditions and given the most physically demanding training regime, the special forces can strike the enemy where he least expects it, cutting off his communication and are capable of conducting light and unconventional warfare. As a result, selection for the special forces is highly selective to secure only the finest that New England offers."

 NEE_MOEF: "Mid-Ocean Escort Force"
 NEE_MOEF_desc: "As proven by experiences of the British in the First Weltkrieg, submarine warfare can be detrimental towards the desperate needs of trade and supply convoys in times of war. In order to increase the effectiveness of our convoy escorts, we will create and organise new compositions of our destroyers - fitting them as well with new technology such as radar and modern anti-submarine weapons."
 NEE_MOEF_NB: "Coordinated Naval Bombardment"
 NEE_MOEF_NB_desc: "With the availability of portable radios and sophisticated relay networks, forward observers are now able to transmit targeting information and provide almost instantaneous accurate reports to the battleships off the shore. In addition, observer aircraft are also able to provide warships with accurate information in preparation for amphibious landings."

 NEE_marine_corps: "New England Marines"
 NEE_marine_corps_desc: "Inspired by the Canadian commandoes and marines, the Marines of New England are organised in innovative light infantry fire teams of three and are well-versed in amphibious invasions and asymmetrical warfare. The true successors to the Continental Marines of the American Revolution, the Marines of New England are given egalitarian and ethical indoctrination in their training to mould the perfect Marine rifleman. As a salute to their great heritage from the Halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, the New England Marines are some of New England's most elite regiments - always present and always faithful."

 NEE_reluctant_populace: "Reluctant Populace"
 NEE_reluctant_populace_desc: "Strongly opposed to intervention or alignment with the factions in the fallout of the national crisis, throughout the Provisional Government - men and women are reluctant to go to arms. Declaring neutrality in the fallout of the national crisis in the spring of 1937, the people of New England remain committed to averting the bloodletting that has thrown the nation into chaos. Unless the situation changes and the people of New England's patriotic fever aroused, the government will not bring its people into the great war."

 NEE_Great_Depression: "Great Depression"
 NEE_Great_Depression_desc: "Unlike the rest of the nation that shifted into war-time mobilisation, the economy of New England remained bitterly stagnant as a result of the Great Depression. Throughout the Provisional Government, lines of unemployed men continue to fill the streets, and thousands of New Englanders find themselves either bankrupt or homeless from the continued economic crisis. While the people of New England trust their government to undertake significant economic reform, until that is done, the Provisional Government's economy will only continue to languish in bitter agony."

 NEE_highway_act_idea: "National Interstate and Defense Highways Act"
 NEE_highway_act_idea_desc: "In the latest sweeping bill signed by President [NEE.GetLeader], the National Interstate and Defense Highway Act aims to improve and modernise our government infrastructure to be the greatest in the world. With an authorisation of nearly $25 billion to construct 41,000 miles of interstate highway, our ambitious work project will aim to connect the American nation greater than ever before."
 NEE_canadian_backing: "Canadian Backing"
 NEE_canadian_backing_desc: "With the recent outbreak of war on the American continent and our relatively minuscule presence, our chances of restoring true American democracy appear rather bleak. The Canadian government, determined to restore order and prevent the success of a radical American government - has announced their decision to supply the Provisional Government with arms and industrial aid to prepare New England for the liberation of the former United States. Nonetheless, the people of the American Northwest remain wary as there are certainly those who do not think New England is ready to weather the storm ahead."

# Legacy #
 NEE_limited_recognation1: "Limited Recognition"
 NEE_limited_recognation1_desc: "The Provisional Government was formed in the early months of the Second American Civil War when the northeastern states of the former United States petitioned the Canadian government for official intervention. While the Canadian government was successful in securing the borders of New England from falling into the hands of the belligerent factions, the Provisional Government finds itself hardly recognised by the international community, and few are convinced that the Provisional Government is indeed the last bastion of American democracy."

Surrounded by reactionaries and revolutionaries, supporting our American allies may very well be the best course of action if we wish to see a democratic and free American neighbour. Our industry has grown large enough since the Great Depression to the point where we can divert production to the Yanks. While the motion is supported by many of our Entente allies, there is also the concern that every rifle we make has to support our own upcoming military excursions. Surely, they will be fine without our support?"

Workers on the home front will breathe a sigh of relief when the first shipments of Franco-Canadian weapons reach our shores. The New England soldier will find his new weapons to be made of the finest quality and craftsmanship - a testament to our shared commitment with the Entente to restore the rightful order to the world."
 new_england_events.442.d.decline: "Disappointing news from our Entente allies. Unfortunately, the Entente has rejected our petition for weapons contracts - citing that their production lines are already strained and that they will need every rifle for their own troops.

Pledging to aid the Entente's goals of hoping to return home from years of exile as well as to free America from the civil war that had felled her, Groves' speech was met with roaring applause among the attendees. Curious reporters and spectators watched and interacted with the men of the allied forces as soldiers competed with and against each other - regardless of nation and colour. Allied service members partook in recreational activities at the camp recreation halls, such as dancing with the locals or forming bonds of camaraderie during the nightly campfires.

On behalf of the naval forces of the Government of [NEE.GetNameDef], Admiral Thomas Kinkaid and a squadron of [NEE.GetNameDef]'s finest sailors were sent to participate in the event. Although the navy of [NEE.GetNameDef] is relatively inexperienced, the exercise proved to be incredibly helpful as [NEE.GetAdjective] sailors were able to practise signals, communications, and new naval strategies. For the inexperienced navy of [NEE.GetNameDef], the exercises strengthened the resolve and discipline of the fledgling American navy.\n\nAdmiral Kinkaid shared his articles on the importance of having more guns instead of bigger guns and his thoughts on naval aviation. The training exercise has also helped prepare their sailors for the eventual homecoming for the Canadian, Australian, and French navies. The nations that participated in the joint naval exercise found the experience to be quite beneficial, and at the encouragement of the Canadian government, plans are being set for future cooperation on the seas."

Chosen for its ideal weather, industrial facilities, wide-open spaces, and proximity to New England, the Canadian facilities will provide pilots of the Entente with the best possible simulations for aerial combat.\n\nRepresenting New England's air forces would be General George Kenney. While the American recruits are relatively inexperienced compared to their Allied counterparts, they have shown great enthusiasm in the training exercises thus far. American plane designs, especially those from Bell and Consolidated, were shared with Entente engineers and advisors who shared their designs with the Americans. With a feeling of general satisfaction among the air staff of the various Entente nations, the Entente hopes to coordinate greater cooperation in the years to come regarding aerial doctrine development and plane designs."

Food shortages and rationing continue to strain the already weary populace, and it will take a while before a full economic recovery is achieved. Their government has petitioned us for relief assistance, and with our resources, we should be capable of lending a hand to our American ally. However, with the Entente's inevitable homecoming, perhaps our resources are better served to help our people.

While paratroopers remain a relatively new, dangerous, and untested strategy, we will soon conduct our first airborne experiments to apply this doctrine to the field."

 NEE_Form_MOEF: "Form the Mid-Ocean Escort Force"
 NEE_Form_MOEF_desc: "With long supply lines across vast lengths of ocean, our transports lie vulnerable to enemy interdiction efforts. The Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) will be created in order to organise patrols and study new methods to protect our convoys as they sail potentially dangerous waters."

 NEE_Naval_Bombardment: "Coordinate Naval Bombardment"
 NEE_Naval_Bombardment_desc: "In order to give our marines the best chances of making it off the beach, any fortifications they come across must ideally be smoking ruins, devastated by offshore naval bombardment before attempts at landing are made. Through improvements to weapon accuracy and spotting technology, our vessels will turn any coastal fortifications to dust!"

 NEE_Fleming_Transport: "Fleming Transport Contracts"
 NEE_Fleming_Transport_desc: "As the Marine Corps naturally expands, so too does the number of landing craft needed for their operational capabilities. Without many local designs at home, we will look towards our northern neighbour for designs to improve the LVT and allow us to execute naval invasions that keep our marines safe when they land on the beaches."

 NEE_Mobile_Mountain_Arty: "Mobile Mountain Artillery"
 NEE_Mobile_Mountain_Arty_desc: "The terrain of New England makes it difficult for us to use traditional towed artillery, and to unlimber such artillery is slow and arduous. To make the movement of artillery faster, our military staff has proposed we adopt the M1A1 75 mm Howitzer that can be broken down into pieces to be carried by pack animals. This ensures that our artillery can quickly deploy through rugged terrain, giving our infantry the close support they need."

 NEE_Ensure_Clear_Skies: "Ensure Clear Skies"
 NEE_Ensure_Clear_Skies_desc: "With a large portion of the industrial power of the United States under hostile control to our south and west, we will have to prepare more robust defences to defend against any incursion by enemy airpower. As the war comes to New England, we must be sure to keep our military and civilians to ensure that once again, our skies will be clear."

 NEE_Airbase_Construction: "Syracuse Army Air Base"
 NEE_Airbase_Construction_desc: "Our military will need a dedicated airbase to ensure that our planes and pilots will be prepared before they are sent off to defend our skies. We will develop an empty 3,500 parcel north of the city of Syracuse into an Army Air Base where recruits will be able to learn basic training, aircraft will be tested, and our defences strengthened."

 NEE_Bell_Contracts: "Bell Contracts"
 NEE_Bell_Contracts_desc: "The Bell Aircraft Corporation in Buffalo has expressed its interest in aiding us in our struggle. One of the largest aviation industries in New England, signing contracts with Bell would greatly benefit their aircraft development.

 NEE_Synthetic_Oil: "Combat the Petroleum Deficit"
 NEE_Synthetic_Oil_desc: "The dire fuel situation of the Entente is forcing our hand in the ever-continuing search to find a reliable solution to the issue. Researchers from all across the British Empire and now also the Ivy League are hard at work to ensure that New England will not fall due to scarcity alone."

 NEE_Tank_Destroyers: "Tank Destroyer Doctrine"
 NEE_Tank_Destroyers_desc: "Our military staff has recognised the importance of tanks in modern conflict and the importance of anti-tank measures. Younger military staff members have pushed for the modification of existing tank models to faster and more manoeuvrable types while maintaining strong piercing abilities to quickly immobilise and disorganised enemy tanks."

 NEE_Tank_Destroyers_idea: "Tank Destroyer Doctrine"

 NEE_Main_Battle_Tanks: "Main Battle Tanks"
 NEE_Main_Battle_Tanks_desc: "Our military has studied the tank traditions intensely in the Commune of France and the German Empire and the varying schools of tank doctrine. While some tanks are designed for infantry support, others are intended to serve in their own formations. Proponents of tanks within our military have proposed that we adopt tanks that combine infantry support while also acting on their own."

 NEE_Main_Battle_Tanks_idea: "Schenectady Arsenal"

 NEE_M7_Designs: "M7 Designs"
 NEE_M7_Designs_desc: "Our army observers have remarked that we need a self-propelled artillery vehicle with sufficient firepower to support armoured operations. By mounting a 105 mm howitzer on a light tank chassis, we will have unparalleled mobile artillery support - giving us the firepower and speed we need to support our tanks."

 NEE_M10_Designs: "M10 Designs"
 NEE_M10_Designs_desc: "Our military has realised that anti-tank weapons are efficient against fast mobile tank formations launching a concentrated attack. To counter this, some in our military have proposed adopting the 3-inch gun on a medium armoured vehicle chassis. The M10 tank destroyer emphasising speed and firepower over armour will allow us to move aggressively and use ambush tactics to bring enemy tanks into ruin."

 NEE_Modern_Tank_Development: "Local Tank Development"
 NEE_Modern_Tank_Development_desc: "The United States has always neglected tank development. Our observers have noticed strengths in both the heavily armoured infantry tanks and the lighter, faster, cruiser tanks of our British allies. Yet, some request that we turn our attention towards a hybrid design attempting to take the best of both designs."

 NEE_A15_Ram: "A15 'Ram' Cooperation"
 NEE_A15_Ram_desc: "The engineers and scientists of the British Empire have long been experimenting with new ways of mechanised warfare and a joint tank development programme by the entire Empire has combined its forces to design the so called A15 'Ram' tank. Our knowledge of tank development is lacking but they have granted us the opportunity to join them in designing and creating this new vehicle."

 NEE_Schenectady_Industrial_Area: "Schenectady Industrial Area"
 NEE_Schenectady_Industrial_Area_desc: "Located sixteen miles northwest of Albany lies Schenectady, one of the largest electrical workshops in the United States. While the American Locomotive Company has factories here, Schenectady is also the home of the electrical industry, where radios and radar can be fashioned. As our nation fires up its industry for the battles to come, we will rally eager men and women to work at the plants to bring our boys in the field the tools they need to win."

 NEE_Redevelop_Upstate: "Redevelop Upstate New York"
 NEE_Redevelop_Upstate_desc: "As large numbers of workers begin heading down to industrial centres such as Schenectady, the burdens of our already exhausted infrastructure and public transportation systems are starting to show. We will have to make great efforts in reorganising the region's infrastructure to help our war machine's efficiency and ensure that our workers and troops can quickly get to where they are needed."

 NEE_Radar_and_Sonar_Development: "Radar and Sonar Developments"
 NEE_Radar_and_Sonar_Development_desc: "Advances in radio and undersea signals have led to radar and sonar adoption and development, respectively. With these new tools, we can detect enemy aircraft before they are over us and scan the seas for enemies hidden far beneath the waves. The military and navy has recommended that we expand the Naval Undersea Warfare Centre in New London to increase our application and develop these new devices to be one step ahead of our enemies."

 NEE_Portsmouth_Dockyard: "Expand the Portsmouth Dockyard"
 NEE_Portsmouth_Dockyard_desc: "Established in 1800 by President John Adams, the Portsmouth Dockyard has always held a grand shipbuilding tradition. Some of the first and finest ships of the former United States navy were constructed here, a testament to New England's long-term maritime traditions. With the conflict upon us, we will expand the dockyard to accommodate modern warships and expand jobs for civilians allowing us to fulfil our true naval potential."

 NEE_Signals_Department: "Signals Department"
 NEE_Signals_Department_desc: "As troops become increasingly mechanised and combat is focused on squad operations, we will have to improve our communications significantly. Wars are no longer fought in lines and trenches, and units moving quickly must be in constant communication with each other in order to coordinate effectively. In addition to expanding the Signals Department and by providing radios to as many squads as possible, we will also adopt the M18 coloured smoke grenades for soldiers to use."

 NEE_Schenectady_Research_Workshop: "Schenectady Research Workshop"
 NEE_Schenectady_Research_Workshop_desc: "The largest electronics workshop in the world, the Schenectady Research Workshop, will be expanded to increase our research capabilities to put us further ahead of our enemies. Our engineering prowess will be strengthened by further developing the research wings. We will use New England's historical role in American academia by inviting Ivy League researchers, professors, and scientists to use their academic gifts for the war effort."

 NEE_General_Electric_Propulsion: "General Electric Propulsion"
 NEE_General_Electric_Propulsion_desc: "With the help of the General Electric Company, we have been offered the chance to increase the speed of our ships. They have offered to provide their efficient turbine electric drive machinery research for the refinement of our vessels. As our research into efficient propeller systems gets progressively more advanced, we can count on them to help fit these turbine propellers onto our surface vessels."

 NEE_Expand_Armed_Forces: "Kenney Mobilisation Plan"
 NEE_Expand_Armed_Forces_desc: "With a somewhat radical and controversial stance given the fact that most of the high command has naval backgrounds, General George Kenney believes that New England's best plan for winning offensives is to begin a rapid rearmament process by placing women in the factories - freeing up the men to serve in the frontlines. His plan also calls for the coordination of high-intensity air support to help break through enemy lines."

 NEE_Lowel_Munition_Factory: "Lowell Munition Factory"
 NEE_Lowel_Munition_Factory_desc: "To assist our weapons manufacturers and to provide a steady supply of ammunition for our troops on the front, plans have been drawn up to fund the creation of a new munition plant in the town of Lowell, Massachusetts, which has been hit hard by the Great Depression leaving 40% of the population without jobs. With war upon us once more, the people will have work to do in helping us rebuild our industrial strength."

 NEE_New_England_Dockyards: "New England's Dockyards"
 NEE_New_England_Dockyards_desc: "Like \"old\" England, our future lies on the great blue before us - New England is home to a traditional but vibrant naval tradition. We must expand our shipbuilding facilities by prospecting land across the coast to construct new facilities for companies like Electric Boat to help produce vessels for our navy. We have two sites of interest in Groton, Connecticut, and Hingham, Massachusetts."

 NEE_Women_In_Factories: "Women into the Factories"
 NEE_Women_In_Factories_desc: "As more and more eligible young men are brought into our growing armed forces, the amount of workers at our industrial plants has also begun to wane.

 NEE_Arsenal_of_Democracy_desc: "For years, we have prided ourselves on our ability to distance ourselves from Europe's affairs knowing that we are safe thanks to the broad expanses of the Pacific and the Atlantic. However, with the outbreak of a total war on our very own continent - we are forced to re-evaluate our position in the world. As we fully mobilise the people and country of [NEE.GetNameDef], we can confidently declare that we are indeed the arsenal of democracy for the nations of the free world."

 NEE_Norwich_University: "Norwich University"
 NEE_Norwich_University_desc: "Norwich University in Vermont is the oldest military college in the United States and the birthplace of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).

 NEE_Modernize_West_Point: "Modernise West Point Curriculum"
 NEE_Modernize_West_Point_desc: "Having last officially seen action since the Spanish-American War, the military curriculum at West Point is somewhat behind. While observers did study the Weltkrieg in Europe, many of the tactics and doctrines practised are still somewhat behind. We will make efforts to modernise the school curriculum to ensure that the last remaining US military officer school remains at the top of its class."

 NEE_Encourage_Attack_Aviation: "Encourage Attack Aviation"
 NEE_Encourage_Attack_Aviation_desc: "Backed by George Kenney's experience observing aerial combat at the end of the Weltkrieg, he believes that the key to success in the next war will come from airpower being on standby to strike at targets that would normally bog down an advance by the army."

 NEE_Victory_Through_Airpower: "Victory Through Airpower"
 NEE_Victory_Through_Airpower_desc: "The next war will be won from the skies. While the technology was not there during the majority of the Weltkrieg, observers in France during the tail end of the conflict saw the potential. With the rapid advancements in aerial technology, large bombers capable of long distance travel can now fly missions deep into the enemy heartland to damage or destroy military installations or factories producing war equipment for the enemy!"

 NEE_Consolidated_Contracts: "Consolidated Contracts"
 NEE_Consolidated_Contracts_desc: "In our efforts to strengthen the firepower from the skies and improve existing models in the New England air force, we will form contracts with Consolidated. Famous during the prewar years for their flying boats, Consolidated has expressed interest in working with our government to ensure that we aid in the development of their new bombers. With these new bombers, we will be able to offer support to our troops and attack the enemy's strategic needs from the air."

 NEE_Infantry_Support_Breakthroughs: "Infantry Support Breakthroughs"
 NEE_Infantry_Support_Breakthroughs_desc: "The Weltkrieg conclusively proved that sending massive waves of infantry into a meat grinder does not win battles much less the war. They need to have a well rounded complement of supporting units to fight using combined arms tactics to effectively rout the enemy."

 NEE_Fleet_Air_Arm: "Legacy of the Ranger"
 NEE_Fleet_Air_Arm_desc: "While some believe that the firepower of dreadnoughts decides the waves, our naval command believes that deploying naval aircraft in engagements will win battles. Since we control the great Boston Naval Yard, the birthplace of the USS Ranger, we will be able to implement our tradition of ship construction with this great dockyard. With the dockyard's capabilities and workforce, we will build a new line of aircraft carriers like \"Lady Lex\" to help us dominate the waves."

 NEE_Gato_Subs_desc: "Many of our enemies rely on long shipping lines to import vital war materiel to fuel their economy. With modern designs and proper tactics, packs of submarines can be put to use slowly choking out the enemies abilities to manufacture weapons at home. If we can control their access to the world's resources, we shall have a decisive step up in the conflict!"

 NEE_Bell_Heavy_Fighters: "P39 Fighter Program"
 NEE_Bell_Heavy_Fighters_desc: "Bell Aircraft has come to our Air Force with their new aircraft design: the P-39. The aircraft is unusual in how its engine is installed in the centre fuselage and is fitted with a tricycle under cage. The plane is also suited for medium to lower altitudes only. Despite these quirks, the trials have gone well, and our command is eager to adopt the P39 to aid in our growing airpower."

 NEE_Modular_Design_desc: "As our naval production grows, increasing calls are made to design our vessels in a more modular manner. This would help speed up production in the shipyards by allowing workers to specialise in a certain piece that they craft for multiple ships. The secondary benefit is that when new and more advanced weaponry becomes more feasible, we will have an easier time outfitting our ships with modern gear!"

Their enhanced manoeuvrability and speed affords them the ability to effectively scout ahead of a fleet to find enemy vessels that may be lying in ambush to surprise a convoy. In an effort to incorporate this design, the Brooklyn class of light cruisers have been built with this factor in mind incorporating multiple plane catapult launchers to help scan the seas!"

With our borders largely secured by the middle of the 19th century, we turned to the great blue as our domain. At our peak, the wings of the Eagle could spread over ten thousand miles from tip to tip! While the outbreak of the second American civil war tore our great Navy to shambles, we must not forget our legacy and strive to rebuild what was lost."

Many are quick to point fingers at either the Socialist Party of America or the American First Party as the main instigators of the conflict. Allowing them to run at a local level may be enough of a concession to hardliners. However, banning these parties may invoke protests against how a \"democratic\" nation can restrict the nation's political parties."

He wishes to formalise a hearing to deal with the enemy officers of the rebellious factions. He claims that many of the officers were on the wrong side due to geographical allegiance.

America's reinvigorated industrial and military strength means that we act as the world guardian for democracy and freedom. After being ratified by Congress, the International Trade Organisation (ITO) was formed to unite the world under free trade and cooperation. The ITO plans to negotiate the reduction or removal of harmful import tariffs or other trade barriers, administer and monitor the agreed-upon treaties for trade, settle disputes among member nations of the ITO, encourage the prosperity of developing countries, and conduct economic research. The ITO's founding principles reflect its commitment to free international trade, contribution to global development, and transparency. The opening of national markets to international trade, with justifiable exceptions or with adequate flexibilities, will encourage sustainable development, reduce poverty, raise the welfare of people worldwide, and foster peace and stability."

# Basilica
 new_england_events.17.t: "The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul"
 new_england_events.17.d: "Faith and religion have long been keystone ideas in New England. While some questioned whether or not that would remain true as the nation descended into chaos with the outbreak of the second civil war - it appears that even in times of crisis, the New England faith remains as true as ever! After years of construction, the second largest church in New England was finally dedicated to the great happiness and satisfaction of Lewiston's French-Canadian population.\n\nDuring the mid 19th century, Lewiston experienced an influx of French-Canadians who came to work at the local textile mills. These Catholic migrants desired a place for worship, and for a time, the parishioners worshipped in the basement of St. Joseph's Church. Because of the large number of French-speaking parishioners, the weekly mass was moved to the nave of St. John's in 1870. But the number of parishioners simply outgrew the nave, and thus the construction for a new church began with the cornerstone of St. Peter's set in 1872. In 1881, the Dominican Fathers of Lille, France, and Quebec took over the administration of the church, and by 1889, the parish was known as S. Pierre S. Paul de Lewiston, Maine. By 1905, the parishioners numbered 10,000, and the splitting of the parish from 1907 and 1923 led to further delays on the project. Serious work on the project resumed in 1933 despite the ongoing Great Depression, and finally, it was completed in July of 1936.\n\nIts completion finished, now the church has finally been dedicated by the Diocese of Portland. The church's two organs, both made by Casavant Frères, a Canadian organ building company in Quebec, were also dedicated this year. Not only does the completion of the church reaffirm New England's traditional values of piety and religious freedom, but it also reflects the growing ties of the French-Canadians to their adoptive country."

# Sit Down Strikes
 new_england_events.18.t: "Supreme Court strikes down Labour case"
 new_england_events.18.d: "The right to free speech has always been a pillar of American democracy. While strikes and protests characterised much of the early 1930s, the government hardly cracked down on these acts of disobedience unless they grew violent. One of the techniques utilised by strikers would be the \"sit-down strike,\" a form of civil disobedience in which workers seized their workplaces by \"sitting down\" at their work stations.\n\nNonetheless, in a groundbreaking case made by the Supreme Court; the government of New England has ruled that participants of sit-down strikes could be fired and defeated a decision made by the National Labor Relations Board that declared that sit-down strikers could be reinstated. At the General Electric Plant in Schenectady, workers attempted to form a union. The company sent a labour spy into the union as the union began to clamour for a renegotiated contract. The company's continued refusal to compromise with the union led to the frustrated union to organise a sit down strike - shutting down a portion of the plant. After multiple attempts, police who were called to eject the strikers were finally successful. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered the company to reinstate the fired strikers, arguing that the company's actions before the strike were illegal. The case was brought to the attention of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes who ruled that \"sit-down strikes\" were \"good cause\" for discharging the workers and the NLRB did not have the authority to force the company to rehire the strikers. While it is not explicitly stated that sit-down strikes are illegal, the court's decision and wording implies that sit-down striking has been effectively subdued within New England."

# Baseball Hall of Fame
 new_england_events.19.t: "A Monument to the Heroes of Baseball"
 new_england_events.19.d: "While not much of old America remains due to the great calamity that tore apart the nation, from Manhattan to San Francisco, one thing remains true of all Americans - the love and appreciation of baseball. With an origin at the end of the first civil war, baseball has remained a long-time American tradition - dramatically escalating in popularity during the first twenty years of the 20th century.\n\nDespite the drone of military aircraft in the skies, baseball is still a popular pastime for people of all ages across the country, especially in New England. The New Englander philanthropist and businessman Stephen Carlton Clark is a great fan of the sport and aims to honour those who have shown excellence worthy of memorial. A native of Cooperstown in New York, Clark was pained to see the city struggle throughout the Great Depression and sought to increase the town's revenues by upgrading its cultural institutions. Designed to be a future pantheon of all baseball heroes, old and new - the hall had its most recent inductees, the class of 1936. In this roster are Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson. While the museum has recently just opened, fans are already pushing for their idols to be featured - proof of America's consistent love for the beloved sport even as the future for the American nation still remains uncertain."

 new_england_events.20.d: "A large explosion attracted many curious onlookers from Little Falls as they stumbled upon the wreckage of a derailed train. A survivor's account stated that the reason for the derailment was due to the sharp curve named the Gulf Curve. The train operator, 65 years old Jesse H Earl was running behind schedule due to the weather and a faulty engine. Hoping to make up time, he kept the train moving at too great a speed to safely pass along the curve. Such a shortcut would ultimately cost 30 passengers their lives as well as his own, just one month before he was scheduled to retire."

Earthquakes are not quite common in New Hampshire, although there were two strong earthquakes throughout its history during the 17th century.\n\nThe earthquake followed that of an earlier one on December 20th, and both of these earthquakes measured at a magnitude of 5.5 and maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (powerful). The earthquake lacked the destruction and size of the infamous 1906 one in San Francisco, but there were still damages to fix following its arrival. There were reports of fractured pipes, walls, and furniture, as well as fallen plaster near the epicentre. The earthquake caused damage to wells, turning the water brown, and even caused monuments in cemeteries to shift and an old house to move nearly 12 inches. Response teams were sent quickly to assess the damage, and thankfully the damages have proven to be just waves of minor damage."

 new_england_events.22.t: "United Service Organisation Formed"
 new_england_events.22.d: "Morale has always been an essential factor in the art of war. There is no secret that New England is indeed a "David" fighting against multiple goliaths - New England lacks the industry and manpower of the other civil war factions. With morale relatively low within the army, the Young Women's Christian Association president, Mary Shotwell Ingraham, has pushed President [NEE.GetLeader] to fund the creation of morale and recreational service for New England military personnel.\n\nWith the president's approval, multiple non-profit organisations combined to form the United Service Organisation. Churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, and even log cabins became recreational centres where GIs could rest and socialise. These establishments provided service members with a place to relax, have a dance, view films, and of course, a hungry GI could not deny the free coffee and doughnuts. The USO has been known for bringing concerts and events close to the frontlines to provide battle-weary troops with hope and encouragement in the desperate war to reunite the nation. Famous Hollywood refugees like Bette Davis and Spencer Tracey have joined the growing cast of current stars in the media to help the war effort by performing for the soldiers in the trenches. The USO has also seen a more significant influx of women volunteers - to provide a nostalgic hour for the weary soldier so he can talk and meet with the girl from back home in person. For many of these men, the girls they meet at USO events remind them of whom they are fighting for - bringing back to mind their loved ones and their sisters and friends they left behind to fight for American freedom."

# Captain America - WIP
 new_england_events.23.t: "Captain America Comics hit the shelves!"
 new_england_events.23.d: "In the chaos of the siege of New York City, cartoonist Joe Simon and Jack Kirby fled to Joe's hometown in Rochester, New York — hoping to escape the syndicalist red terror. Eager to aid young readers to enlist- Simon and Kirby brought their comic book creation \"Captain America\" into the hands of young Americans who quickly became infatuated with the patriotic character.\n\nMany eager recruits found resonance with the Captain's origins, as ordinary Steve Rodgers, who, despite his meager size, felt compelled to try again and again to enlist in the war against the radicals and revolutionaries that threatened America. At the encouragement of a scientist, Rodgers takes a super-serum in an experiment that dramatically enhances his physical abilities and size, transforming him into a near-perfect rendition of the human form. As "Captain America," Rodgers and his sidekick Bucky Barnes fight enemies of America such as the Syndicalists' Red Skull as well as the demagogues of MacArthur and Huey Long, who have been portrayed in the comics as warmongers intent on destroying all aspects of American life. While some have complained that Simon's character has been overly political, Simon himself has admitted that his character was a consciously political creation and that he and Kirby found themselves repulsed at the actions of the Silvershirts and the Red Guards. Captain America has found fans with many young Americans with nearly a million copies in circulation, reminding them that New England's government stands for the true America. With his ever-present vibranium shield adorned with the stars and stripes, \"Cap\" reminds the Yankee young reader that even the little frail boy from Brooklyn could become America's most outstanding soldier."

 new_england_events.24.d: "On June 11th, 1941, Daniel Carter Beard, founder of the Sons of Daniel Boone, which merged with the Boy Scouts of America, passed away.\nBorn in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1850 into a family of artists, Beard explored the woods of Painesville at a young age - making sure to take good notes and sketches of nature. An illustrator of the great American author Mark Twain, Beard eventually rose to the editor for the \"Recreation\" magazine. In 1905, he founded the \"Sons of Daniel Boone\", which merged with the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. Becoming one of the first National Scout commissioners, Beard served for thirty years - editor of the Boy Scouts' official magazine and inspiring generations of scouts to come. The recipient of the only gold Eagle badge, Beard was also involved with the Culver Academies in the Steel Belt - inspiring youths in a period of bitterly contested class tensions. Alas, the old scout has finally reached the end of his journey as Beard has passed away just short of his 91'st birthday at his homeland in Suffern, New York. In a rare break of national security, the government has allowed several young scouts from Chicago, the hotbed of American syndicalism, to participate in the 127 man honour guard. They will join a funeral procession with nearly 2,000 attendees in Monsey, New York, to honour the beloved youth leader who loved nothing more than to see a generation of American youth grow up with patriotism, kindred values, self-reliance, and courage."

 new_england_events.25.d: "It was just like any other summer night for the citizens of Newport on this August evening. A single-engine Royal Canadian Air Force training plane flew overhead, nothing out of the ordinary given the ties and proximity between New England and Canada. Suddenly, the plane began to spiral out of control, diving nose first into a lake on the west shore. Concerned citizens rushed to the wreck but to no avail, the lone occupant of the plane had been killed in what appeared to have been an accident.\n\nThe pilot was Willie McKnight, a 23 year old pilot for the RCAF. Born in Edmonton, Willie was known for his notorious rebellious streak, proving to teachers that despite his athletic prowess - he was known for causing trouble. His cockiness persisting into University, McKnight signed up for the RCAF to partake in the retaking of the Home Isles by the Entente government. His aircraft in combat bore a distinctive human skeleton image carrying a sickle in its hands under the cockpit, on both sides of the aircraft - a memento mori for all his opponents but perhaps even an ironic joke at his syndicalist enemies. Nonetheless, despite McKnight's spectacular record of 17 victories it appears that fate does not favour the young pilot."

# Lackawanna Wreck - WIP
 new_england_events.26.t: "Lackawanna Train Wreck"
 new_england_events.26.d: "On a warm summer evening in August, the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad's New York to Buffalo passenger train suffered a severe accident when it collided with a freight train. Carrying 500 passengers from Hoboken, New Jersey, the train left Binghamton, New York, 30 minutes behind schedule while the freight train was traveling from Elmira to Mount Morris. The freight train had backed into a siding to allow the passenger train to pass, but then it moved back onto the mainline while switching cars. The freight train had ignored a stop signal and had moved onto the track of the passenger train. At 17:22 p.m, the passenger train sideswiped the freight train's engine and derailed with the locomotive of the freight train scraping the sides of several cars. The resulting impact tore open the side of the car, and boiler steam from the freight engine filled into the coach.\n\nMany people found themselves frantically trapped in the coach, and some could escape by breaking windows. All but one of the 29 fatalities were caused by internal or external scalding of the boiler steam. Thanks to the rapid response by a local sheriff, first responders were able to deploy rapidly to the scene, including firemen and the medical services. Many of the passengers on the train were army servicemen, and thus they formed a little police unit to keep spectators and onlookers away until sufficient policemen had arrived. Around 114 people were injured, with nearly 56 requiring hospitalisation. An official inquiry from the Interstate Commerce Commission and the New York Public Service Commission declared the incident to have been an accident, although the DL and W railroad had to install derailing devices as an added safety measure."

# BEANO

 new_england_events.27.d: "While most of our soldiers are accustomed to the traditional MK II grenades, our military staff received an exciting proposition from none other than the Eastman Kodak Corporation based in Rochester, New York. The BEANO \"T-13\" grenade is a spherical grenade with the weight and size of an ordinary baseball. The men at Kodak argue that due to its size and shape, the grenade would be perfect for our servicemen - as any young American man should be able to properly throw a grenade with accuracy and distance.\n\nWeighing at 12 ounces, the T-13 grenade is designed with a pressure trigger and in-flight arming device. It was intended to be literally thrown like a baseball, and it could be held with two fingers on its weighted \"butterfly cap.\" Once in the air, the cap would detach from the grenade, and a nylon string would unwind until a secondary arming pin attached is pulled - allowing the grenade to detonate upon impact. While the Kodak Corporation has praised the grenade as the future of the American infantrymen, our initial trials have proven to be disastrous, with more sudden accidents than successes. Our high command remains unimpressed; it seems like the T-13 won't make the cut."

 new_england_events.28.t: "Xerography Breakthrough"
 new_england_events.28.d: "An exciting development made in the field of printing, a man named Chester Carlson has approached numerous businesses with his successful patent - a technique of dry photocopying that he has given the name \"xerography.\" His story is a remarkable one - one that reflects the truth of the American dream.\n\nBorn in Washington State in 1906, Carlson worked various odd jobs in his youth due to his family's struggling financial situation. The principal provider of his family, Carlson often turned to his own interests in inventing; he was heavily inspired by the success story of Thomas Edison. To Carlson, the idea of invention is alluring as it could provide an escape from his meager social status. Carlson attended the California Institute of Technology, a hard-working young man, where the school's tuition placed him further in debt. With the height of the Great Depression hitting the states in 1930, Carlson found himself out of work and out of money.\n\nIn 1936, Carlson began to study law at the New York Law School in Tribeca amidst the chaos that engulfed the American nation. Spending long nights at the New York Public Library, he grew tired of copying law books by hand due to his inability to afford them. This seemingly endless task led him to read an article in an obscure German scientific journal from Pál Selényi regarding the nature of copying machines. He conducted experiments after experiments in his tiny apartment - often smoky and smelly and sometimes even explosive. Despite developing arthritis of the spine, Carlson persisted - working with an Austrian immigrant, Otto Kornei. Finally, on October 22, 1938, the men achieved their breakthrough Kornei wrote: \"10-.22.-38 ASTORIA\" in ink on a slide which then had an electrical current generated and then transferred onto wax paper. In the hands of the two men was the world's first xerographic copy. While Carlson has already filed for a patent, it remains unknown whether or not businesses will approach Carlson for his invention. The Army Signal Corps has already expressed great interest in dry copies produced alternatively than the traditional photographic techniques."

 new_england_events.29.d: "The tiny hamlet of Town Line in Erie County, New York, has long claimed to have seceded from the United States. With the great conflict upon New England, on a ceremonious occasion, Town Line has officially declared their re-entry into New England in the sense of unity and commonwealth - to declare their support to the New Englander war effort.\n\nThe tale of secession takes place during the first American civil war. In 1861, the men of the hamlet gathered at an informal meeting at a schoolhouse and passed an 85-40 resolution to secede from the United States. While the reasons for the vote are unknown, some have pointed out that Town Line's residents were motivated due to their willingness to avoid the military draft. Nonetheless, because Town Line was never an incorporated municipal entity and had no well-defined borders, the Confederacy and the Union did not recognise secession. Now, the residents have decided to ceremoniously vote once more, and this time, with 90 votes to 23, Town Line has rescinded their 1861 secession."

 new_england_events.30.t: "And to think that I saw on Mulberry Street"
 new_england_events.30.d: "A new book may soon be in the hands of New Englander school children, although its publication has been indeed troubled. Rejected by nearly 20 publishers, \"And to think that I saw on Mulberry Street\" was finally published at Vanguard Press. The book is a rhythmic children's story featuring a child's fanciful imagination while strolling through Mulberry Street (perhaps inspired by the actual Mulberry Street in Springfield, Massachusetts) while colourful and expressive illustrations dot each page.\n\nWriting under the moniker \"Dr. Seuss\", the author is Theodore Geisel, a 33-year-old New Englander of German descent with nearly ten years of writing and illustrating experience. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, where he rose to the editor-in-chief of the humour magazine \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern.\" Geisel continued his education by attending Oxford University in the Union of Britain to achieve his Ph.D. in English literature, where he met his future wife, Helen Palmer. Leaving Oxford in 1927 without finishing his degree, Geisel began to submit drawings and illustrations to make a living - achieving breakthrough success with a commercial piece for Flit, a bug spray. In 1936, after returning from a European voyage, Geisel felt inspired by the rhythmic sounds of the ship's engines which encouraged him to develop the rhyme scheme that makes up his latest book.\n\nFleeing New York City, as one of many American refugees - Geisel has returned home to his native New England in the hopes of escaping the tragic plight shared by many in the former United States. According to Geisel, the frustration of being consistently rejected led him to nearly burn his manuscript of Mulberry Street until he ran into an old Dartmouth classmate. The chance encounter gave way to its eventual publication at the hands of Vanguard Press, and although sales are modest, the reviews have been quite favourable."

#Captain Courageous
 new_england_events.31.t: "Captain Courageous"
 new_england_events.31.d: "Amidst the civil war tensions, the New England film company has been busy at work with none other than a hit at the box office with \"Captain Courageous.\" Filmed and set in New England, the film is based on the Rudyard Kipling 1897 novel, an emotional story of maritime camaraderie among the treacherous New England waters.\n\nThe film's protagonist Harvey Cheyne (played by child actor Freddie Bartholomew), is the spoiled son of an American business tycoon. Shunned by his classmates and suspended at boarding school, Harvey is sent on a European excursion with his father to fall overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. He is then fatefully rescued by a Portuguese-American sailor, Manuel Fidello (played by the handsome Spencer Tracy), and taken aboard a Massachusetts schooner. Onboard the "We're Here," Harvey finds that his status as the son of a wealthy New York socialite means nothing, and despite his spoiled acts, the boy is still offered a temporary crew membership until the boat returns to the States. He befriends the captain's son Dan (played by Mickey Rooney), and he grows closer to Manuel, with Manuel becoming an almost surrogate father for the young boy. In the movie's climax, the schooner races against a rival vessel when Manuel climbs to the top of the ship's mast. The mast cracks, and Manuel is plunged into the icy sea, much to the horror and sadness of Harvey. Returning to the States, Harvey is reunited with his father, who is in awe of his son's growth in maturity over the past months. They offer a solemn moment of remembrance at the Fisherman's Memorial in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with bouquets and wreaths - the closing shot being the memorial and a smiling Manuel.\n\nCritics have praised the movie for acknowledging the naturally formed bonds made at sea and the tribulations the waves have to offer. For many, it is indeed a reflection of the times with New England's position in the great American Civil War and a reminder of the natural New Englander spirit to continue on despite the hardships."

Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Massachusetts, "Betty" (a name she has had since her youth) began her acting career in the theatres of Broadway and then the screens of Hollywood. Described as beautiful and bubbling with charm, Davis' film career began to rise with breakthrough roles in films such as "The Man who Played God" and "Of Human Bondage." Fleeing the nation as one of many American refugees with the outbreak of the civil war, Davis returned home to New England where she helped play a role in the growing New England film industry. Her forthright manner, idiosyncratic speech, and always present cigarette has contributed to a greater public persona.\n\nIn particular, Davis has achieved a main role in the 1939 New England box office success "Dark Victory." One of the highest grossing films of the year, her role in the movie paved the way for stardom. With the outbreak of war, Davis has also achieved frontline popularity especially among servicemen with her natural charisma and beauty — selling nearly 2 million in war bonds within two days as well as a picture of herself for 250,000. Willing to perform for black serviceman, Davis pushed for a sort of "Hollywood Canteen" for the soldiers where famous actors and actresses can entertain the tired troops. While in her film career, she has preferred to play antagonistic or villainous roles; she has been placed in more feminine roles as a result of the war - as a way to distract the female audiences from the reality of their lives."

# Remington Rand
 new_england_events.33.t: "The Conclusion of the Remington Rand Strike"
 new_england_events.33.d: "Since May of 1936, the CIO has been helping a union in the towns of Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse strike against the Remington Rand company. Inspired by the syndicalist strikes across the steel belts, the workers reached the pinnacle of their anger when the company began spreading rumours that they would be bought by a firm that would not recognise the union. After the union threatened a strike, the company distributed its own strike ballots, which led to anger as union members seized and destroyed company ballots while also intimidating managers.\n\nSpurred on by the radical rhetoric of John Reed and his SPA, the union members became increasingly violent as the protests escalated. Local police and private security forces were called up by Remington Rand on numerous occasions to break up the strikers. As the frustration of the strikers grew, so did their tactics. Emboldened by Red Guard militias, strikers had begun to create homemade bombs and hurl large iron balls at the police. Blood has been shed, as some of the strikers have even been shot by the police.\n\nWith no compromise in view, an obvious choice would be to send in the National Guard. Putting down the strikers and regaining the police force's discipline would ensure that this rabble would finally be dealt with. However, some stress that this may only fuel more tensions among our workers. The Syndicalists are right on our border, and they will no doubt capitalise on this strike to further paralyse our nation. Instead, they suggest that we approach the strikers in negotiation - this will also help us earn the trust of the striking workers."

The protestors who had been growing more daring in the past weeks of striking began to hurl not just insults but projectiles at the National Guardsmen. Nobody knows who fired the first shot, but the strikers and Guardsmen were drawn into a chaotic swirl of violence and rage, leading to scores being injured.\n\nReinforcements of National Guardsmen had arrived in Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse at the request of the state governor. Severely outnumbered, the strikers began to disperse, but the guardsmen began arresting strikers en masse, placing strike leaders in chains. The response from the National Guard was surprisingly effective. Faced with the strength of the military, the strikers agreed to end their strike, but serious concerns have been raised towards President [NEE.GetLeader]. The strikers will undoubtedly use this act as an excuse to garner support from the Syndicalist elements in Chicago. The governor has faced criticism from the press and the state of New York for the repression, with many claiming the use of the national guard was a precursor to tyranny."

The strikers were appeased, and their rights to unionise were officially granted by Rand. Many of the strikers who had been arrested during the strikes were rehired.\n\nWhile many nationwide are hailing this as a success among the working classes, the strike's victory has worried some. If workers continue to be radicalised and organise deadly strikes that cripple the already exhausted economy, who knows how long before New England falls to the syndicalist menace. While the factories are reopening and the strikers finally return to work, many in the government wonder if New England will be safe from the tide of revolution."

These strikers, many of whom come from French-Canadian descent, began demanding higher wages, conditions, shorter workweek, and union representation, with the number of the protests growing to the thousands. Shortly after the strikes began, the manufacturers offered a 10% wage increase to fulfil the strikers' demand - but these offers were quickly put down.\n\nWith the protests growing increasingly violent and with no signs of the strikers backing down, President [NEE.GetLeader] has requested that the governor of Maine deal with the situation at hand. The governor can call in the National Guard, which may involve further altercation and outright violence, although the protests will definitely be quieted. Alternatively, the governor can negotiate with the strikers although this would be a serious loss of face for the New England government to handle its own people."

Many of the protestors were women, eager to stand up for their working rights.\n\nThe National Guard and police immediately got to work in the fights with the strikers, and the strikers soon found themselves fleeing the scene. The Lewiston Evening Journal described the event as simply "Red Wednesday" due to the violence of the incident. Strike organisers such as Powers Hapgood were immediately arrested and sentenced to short-terms, and for nights, the guardsmen patrolled Lewiston and Auburn. While the President congratulated the governor for his initiative in subduing the unrest, the civil unrest, especially among Maine's French-Canadian population, has only grown in response to the harsh crackdown."

Finally the strikers agreed to be supervised by company unions at the cost of having the rest of their demands fulfilled. The Lewiston Evening Journal summed the negotiations up as a much needed relief in these uncertain times.\n\nNonetheless, the governor's negotiation with the strikers has led to doubts as to whether or not he is capable of leading the state of Maine. Many in the nation do see syndicalism as an ever present threat and surely pleasing the workers would only encourage their radical ideas to spread further. Criticism from Democrats in Maine have been aimed at the governor's seemingly soft stance claiming it as a \"surrender to syndicalism.\""

The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the WCA into our hands.

President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter.

 new_england_events.62.t: "Cocoanut Grove Fire Traced Back to Tobin"
 new_england_events.62.d: "Located at 17 Piedmont Street in the Bay Village neighbourhood of Boston, a few blocks south of the Boston Public Garden, the Coconut Grove is well known among Bostonians as a popular hangout spot given the number of celebrities that frequent it. Visited by GIs, movie stars, celebrities, and even politicians such as Maurice Tobin — the nightclub also has been rumoured to have links with the Mafia and organised crime. Initially a garage and a warehouse, the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a \"South Seas\" like a tropical paradise with support columns made to look like palm trees and fixtures made to look like coconuts.\n\nAt 10:15 pm on the evening of November 28th, however, a young soldier removed a lightbulb in the lounge to give himself and his date some privacy. A young busboy was called to replace the lightbulb; unable to find the bulb, he lit a match, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses would report that soon after, flames burst from palm fronds beneath the ceiling. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the fire simply spread throughout the nightclub, racing faster than patrons could move and covering the entire establishment with smoke. The building's main entrance was a single revolving door which became useless as the patrons panic. By the time firefighters had arrived, 492 lives were lost. Perhaps more grotesque was that some bodies were discovered with drinks still in their hands as the fire and toxic smoke had overtaken them too quickly.\n\nThe owner of the club Barney Welansky was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter due to his failure to follow the city's loose restrictions. Welansky was missing on the night of the fire due to a heart attack, but he has been known to have boasted of his relationships with Mayor Maurice Tobin and the Mafia. Investigators also discovered that the club lacked licenses for serving liquor and food, and the remodeling was done by unlicensed contractors. Some in the city are even calling for Tobin's resignation in outrage of this horrific tragedy."

# Niagara Bridge Collapse - Possible Expansion
 new_england_events.65.t: "Historic Bridge collapses across the Niagara Falls"
 new_england_events.65.d: "Thousands of onlookers gathered together to watch the final collapse of the Honeymoon Bridge today. Large gusts of wind coming from Lake Erie sent a massive amount of ice pouring over the falls. Nearly 100 feet of ice came crashing down on the bridge's abutments, ultimately compromising the structure. Not even the 24 feet tall fortifications added in 1899 after an ice bridge threatened to push the bridge over could prevent the collapse. Luckily the cold temperatures deterred most visitors to the falls, and thus, no one was injured.\n\nThe Northeastern states are currently experiencing one of the severest cold waves of winter. Sub-zero winds followed by a harsh blizzard have swept southwards from Canada, bringing New England to a two-year record for frigid weather. In some parts of the country, thermometers are reading 24 degrees below zero. For many New Englanders, the cold weather and snow blankets are signs of troubled and unassured times as the civil war rages on across the country."

# Chocolate Chip Cookie
 new_england_events.66.t: "Fresh from the Oven"
 new_england_events.66.d: "Established in 1930, the Toll House has become a rather fashionable New England staple, in particular the inn's matron has been renowned throughout the country for her delicious recipes including what she describes as the \"chocolate chip cookie.\" A favourite spot for the young, the old, and even those in politics like Joseph Kennedy Sr, Ruth Graves Wakefield embodies the New England mother in her passion and dedication evident from her baking.\n\nBorn Ruth Jones Graves, Wakefield grew up in Easton, Massachusetts and worked as a home economics teacher and a hospital dietitian. In 1930, Wakefield and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield bought a tourist lodge in Whitman in Plymouth County. A junction located halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers traditionally paid tolls, changed horses, and ate home-cooked meals. Ruth cooked and served all the food at the inn, gaining a cult following of fans who enjoyed her lobster dinners and desserts. But indeed, it is her cookie that has earned her national fame.\n\nNicknamed the \"chocolate chip cookie\", Wakefield claimed that she added chopped bits from a Nestle semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. While reporters incorrectly stated the move was a mistake, Ruth claims that she intentionally sought to create a cookie with a delicious bite of chocolate. The cookie has reached soldiers stationed in Massachusetts, many of whom have written letters requesting it from their families while at the frontlines. The nation then became infatuated with the cookie with Wakefield agreeing to give Nestle the rights to the Toll House cookie name for one dollar and a lifetime's supply of Nestle. Indeed, they have become a national favourite - enjoyed by Americans young and old!"

 new_england_events.67.d: "Stretching 8.5 miles (13.7km), the industrial marvel connecting the borders of New England and Canada has finally finished construction - connecting the state of New York to Ontario. On this day, President [NEE.GetLeader] officially dedicated the bridge to New England, declaring that it marked a period of continued friendship and camaraderie between the Americans and their northern neighbours. With his blessing and dedication, the bridge will soon open, much to the cheer of Canadian and American onlookers.\n\nThe brainchild of Dr. David Steinman and Dr. Holten Robinson, refugees from New York City, the bridge's construction authority is shared by the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority and the Federal Bridge Corporation Limited of Canada. The bridge's construction rate was incredibly fast and ten weeks ahead of schedule, taking only sixteen months for completion - a fantastic feat and testament to the cooperation between the nations. The design of the spans fit the regional topography producing beautiful bridges with artistic grace and attention to detail, with the colours chosen to match the surrounding environment. Following the president's dedication, the first civilian and military vehicles began across the bridge - the first of many as the bridge serves its intended purpose as an indestructible physical bond between the Canadian and American people."

Even prominent [NEE.GetAdjective] politician David Walsh of the Democratic Party was seen in attendance at several America First rallies. The America First Committee has outlined clear points such as building an impregnable defence for America and that American democracy can only be preserved by not involving New England in Europe's wars. As the national crisis continues to escalate, many are undoubtedly thankful for Canada's protection and aid, but many are also wary of Canada's growing presence in American affairs. The Provisional Government of New England exists only because of Canada's intervention, and thus it will take time and effort to legitimise the government of New England as the true successor to the United States. Isolationists or not, no one in New England wishes to witness the return of the British in Boston, and while the Canadians have assured New Englanders that they are safe, only time will tell whether or not the occupation is temporary."

# Dark Victory
 new_england_events.69.t: "\"Dark Victory\" hits the Cinema!"
 new_england_events.69.d: "An instant hit at the box office and mentioned by critics throughout the country, many claims that \"Dark Victory\" will be in the running for an Academy Award - with multiple articles praising actress Bette Davis' performance and claiming her performance is award-worthy. The film is a telling and dramatic piece of New England's upper society and has come when societal tensions are at an all-time high. In particular, the film's themes of mortality and all-star cast have proven to be reasons for the movie's success at the cinema.\n\nSet in New York City, Judith \"Judy\" Traherne (played by Bette Davis) is a young and carefree hedonistic Long Island socialite and heiress with a passion for all things expensive and vices such as smoking and drinking. Despite her outgoing lifestyle, she begins to experience headaches and blurred vision, and after multiple incidents, she visits a doctor at her friend Anne King's recommendation. She meets Dr. Frederick Steele (played by Irishman George Brent) who is reluctant to aid the antagonistic Judy, but upon a further inspection, Steele realises that Judy is even beginning to experience short-term memory loss. In a surgical operation, Steele realises that Judy has a malignant glioma brain tumour that cannot be removed and that Judy will die within a year but not before she experiences total blindness. To give her false hope, Steele lies to Judy and Anne to allow her to live with happiness. Although Anne discovers the truth, she agrees to keep it a secret. As time passes, Steele and Judy become romantically involved, but eventually, Judy finds out Steele's diagnosis by accident. The two experience a short break in which Judy reverts to her old habits. After a conversation with her stablemaster, Judy decides that she will go out with dignity and returns to Steele, where the two move to Vermont. The film concludes with an ending that leaves audiences in tears as Steele heads off to present a potential cure for Judy's cancer while Judy finally becomes fully blind. The final dialogue between Steele and Judy has been praised by the people of New England for its reassuring tone in the time of national crisis. Calm and composed at the end, in contrast to her actions in the earlier parts of the film, Judy lies motionless on her bed as the screen fades to black."

 new_england_events.71.d: "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerrilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathisers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bob's fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob travelled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."

Statements overheard about the illegitimacy of [ACW_WAR_TAG.GetNameDef]'s claim to national legitimacy, an opinion not too uncommon throughout the nation, has taken on new life.\n\nProminent politicians like Theodore Green have been vehement about an expansion of the navy and army in spite of the overwhelmingly isolationist stance of much of New England. In public speeches, Green would often warn of the dangers that faced the Provisional Government if it failed to act. Without proper buildup, the peoples of New England may find themselves crushed under the [ACW_WAR_TAG.GetAdjective] boot, or one of the other factions vying for power in the Second American Civil War.\n\nThe latest headline which has placed the government in a tough spot, calls for increased duty to be performed by the Provisional Government. If [ACW_WAR_TAG.GetNameDef] isn't a legitimate successor to the United States, as our propaganda machines have been instructed to inform the public of, the only way we could tout any authority on the matter was if we were a legitimate successor, ourselves.\n\nAs such, it seems that the political needle has swung away from isolation, and with the Provisional Government entering the war against [ACW_WAR_TAG.GetNameDef], pressure is mounting for the government to stake its claim as another contender in the Second American Civil War!"

After a two week programme of rigorous physical activity and training; a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the first experimental paratrooper platoon made up of ten volunteers. Taking off from Syracuse Army Air Base, the first man to make the jump was none other than the Massachusetts native Lt. Col Cornelius E. Ryan. All ten volunteers successfully made the jump and had a successful touchdown with the ground where they quickly reached their rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals.

Col Ryan, the military has been surveying the infantry for volunteers. Even though the high training standards and high mortal risk led to only a small batch of volunteers initially, the army has authorised a triplication of the wage of the paratrooper to gain more volunteers. With a more significant influx of volunteers, the 509th Paratrooper Regiment was formed, and after a week of recruitment, five paratrooper battalions were also raised. While these battalions remain untested in actual combat, the idea of vertical envelopment will undoubtedly aim to aid in developing our military doctrine - the high command is eager to see this investment pay off."

New England bombers have been instructed to target aircraft factories to weaken and cripple the [395.controller.GetAdjective] war effort while also harassing the morale of their civilians. By targeting aircraft factories, the Army Air Force hopes to draw out the [395.controller.GetAdjective] fighters into action - hoping that we will drain their air strength in a protracted war of attrition.

 new_england_events.77.t: "Government Rifle Contracts"
 new_england_events.77.d: "As the Provisional Government of New England finds itself on the doorstep of war, the question has been raised by businesses and the army as to which company the government will align itself with. To reclaim the rest of the nation means that New England infantrymen will have to be equipped with the most modern rifles - the old dusty national guard rifles hastily handed out will not do. Two names for an officially sponsored government contract have been consistent throughout the endless debates - the Springfield Armory and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\n\nScouted and approved by George Washington himself in 1777, the Springfield Armory is an obvious candidate. Briefly, the only government manufacturer of arms during the first American Civil War, choosing the Springfield Armory carries a symbolic resonance, especially as New England claims itself to be the last bastion of American democracy on the continent. An industrial powerhouse responsible for mass producing and developing the M1903 rifle, the Springfield Armory also features a curious new weapon designed by New Englander John Garand. Garand has been developing a semi-automatic rifle since 1919, and although many of his designs have failed to meet the army's specifications, his latest design, the \"M1, calibre 30,\" has shown to be extremely promising in initial tests. With the M1 in plans to be fully adopted within our armed forces, perhaps we should consider supporting the Springfield Armory.\n\nThe Winchester Repeating Arms Company has also been brought up in discussion. Founded in 1866, the company is responsible for the successful \"Model 1873\" known as the \"Gun that Won the West,\" named as such for its iconic use on the Great Plains. Since its early days, the Winchester Company has continuously released self-loading rifles in the many years of its operation. While the Great Depression had severely weakened the company, company vice president John M. Olin pushed a new company tradition of producing only the finest and well-crafted deluxe rifles and shotguns. Since its hard times, the company has bounced back, and their craftsmanship would surely come in handy for our uses. If Winchester secures the government contract, our soldiers will have their hands on sturdy and durable rifles."

Such a shift was effective in getting more men through completion of the programme but came at a cost. Comparing the results of the pre-war class to the hastily recruited 37ers, shows a vast disparity. Individual marksmenship fell by as much as 31% during the hasty training period.\n\nAccordingly, the syllabus for the Marine training course temporarily ran out of New London, Connecticut has been restored to a full 7 week length. Additional specialisation and training are to take place before new recruits are to be placed in with their units.

There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
 new_england_events.90.d.choice: "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
 new_england_events.90.a: "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
 new_england_events.90.b: "We should rejoin America."
 new_england_events.90.c: "No, this is not in our best interests."

 new_england_events.91.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
 new_england_events.91.d: "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
 new_england_events.91.a: "Then we wish them well."
 new_england_events.91.b: "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
 new_england_events.91.c: "No, we cannot permit that."

 new_england_events.92.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 new_england_events.92.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
 new_england_events.92.a: "Wonderful news!"

 new_england_events.93.t: "Reunion with New England"
 new_england_events.93.d: "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
 new_england_events.93.a: "Excellent!"

 new_england_events.94.t: "The Canadian Concern"
 new_england_events.94.d: "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British sphere - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
 new_england_events.94.a: "We'll see where this goes..."
 new_england_events.94.b: "We're fine with that request."
 new_england_events.94.c: "No, they have no right to make that demand."

 new_england_events.95.t: "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 new_england_events.95.d: "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
 new_england_events.95.a: "Might amenable of them!"

 new_england_events.96.t: "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 new_england_events.96.d: "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against radical forces, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
 new_england_events.96.a: "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
 new_england_events.96.b: "Very well, let them go."
 new_england_events.96.c: "Then we refuse."

 new_england_events.97.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 new_england_events.97.d.forced: "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
 new_england_events.97.d.choice: "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
 new_england_events.97.a: "So be it!"
 new_england_events.97.b: "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
 new_england_events.97.c: "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

 new_england_events.98.t: "New England Dissolves"
 new_england_events.98.d: "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy. The region is once again under our control, and very possibly may lead us into a war with [requester.GetNameDef]."
 new_england_events.98.a: "So be it!"

 new_england_events.99.t: "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 new_england_events.99.d.exists: "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere. Many within our government are enraged, and wonder if New England's citizens feel the same as its government... or, perhaps it is better to say, the British?"
 new_england_events.99.d.notexists: "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown. With their refusal to allow New England to choose its own destiny, the New England government has collapsed and been re-absorbed into [CAN.GetNameDef]."
 new_england_events.99.a: "Then it's war!"
 new_england_events.99.b: "We'll deal with this later."

 new_england_events.100.t: "New England's Betrayal"
 new_england_events.100.d: "While our government had refused New England's right to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], it seems they eventually decided to do so anyhow. Our forces in the region have pulled out as American forces moved in, and there appears to be nothing we can do - unless we choose to force the issue and make this a matter of war."
 new_england_events.100.a: "Then it's war!"
 new_england_events.100.b: "Let them have it."

 new_england_events.102.t: "The Fires of War"
 new_england_events.102.d: "What we hoped to avoid in 1937 has finally engulfed the nation! New England has found itself drawn into the conflict. Accordingly, many of our industries are shifting into wartime production to provide for our troops in the field. As the army's needs rapidly swell due to the conflict, whatever lingering effects of the Great Depression remained are quickly swept away. Unemployed men and even some women are being conscripted into the armed forces or the factories as they replace others sent to the frontlines. Together, we must ready this storm!"

 new_england_events.103.a: "Rally to the flag!"

 new_england_events.104.t: "Preparations for war"
 new_england_events.104.d: "When the great civil war broke out, the government of New England found itself divided regarding participation in the war. With the popularity of isolationist groups, many New Englanders hoped to wait out the war that threatened to consume the New World. As the Great Depression persisted, the economy of New England struggled immensely, and it was not until the Second Square Deal under President [NEE.GetLeader] that the economy of New England began to show signs of recovery and growth.\n\nWith its economy on the road to total recovery, the factories once producing shoes and cars are now producing military trucks and uniforms as the threat of war grows nearer every day. Many in New England have begun to see the conflict for what it truly is - a battle for the true America, and New England cannot sit away from the war idly. The time has come to reclaim the country from those who drove it into chaos. Air raid drills are being practised daily across the schools in New England, and young men and women flock to recruitment centres - eager to serve their country in its hour of need. The odds are heavily stacked against New England - most of the other factions have far more enormous manpower reserves and industries. Nonetheless, history has always favoured the bold, and the industrial might of the American Northeast should not be underestimated. Our factories on the ground will churn out more and more while our planes above will ensure our skies remain free and safe. Like our ancestors in 1776, we will not be intimidated by the odds as the tree of liberty will not fall to the reactionaries and revolutionaries that seek to defile it!"

#NEE-ACC
 new_england_events.134.t: "Send Cable to [ACC.GetNameDef]?"
 new_england_events.134.d: "Once regarded as a successful experiment of democracy, the American nation had collapsed into a violent and destructive civil war for the second time in its history. Despite the international community's neutrality to the events in the United States, the Canadian Army crossed the American border in the opening days of the war. To many New Englanders, the Canadian intervention in those chaotic early days gave hope that America's northern neighbour was eager to protect democracy in the New World.\n\nHowever, it appears that is no longer the case. Perhaps in a desperate bid to muster men for the hopeful return of the British Exiles, the Canadian government's enactment of full conscription infuriated the Quebecois leading to mass protests and riots across the country. In a move unsurprising to demagogues such as MacArthur, the Canadian government's implementation of the War Measures Act has brought what many regarded as the last stable democracy of North America to its knees in face of authoritarianism. With Canada's commitment to democracy a liability, President [NEE.GetLeader] has consulted his cabinet regarding a potential alliance between the Provisional Government of New England and [ACC.GetNameDef]. If the Canadians are not willing to safeguard democracy in the New World, then perhaps a united democratic front against socialism and authoritarianism will guarantee the preservation of freedom."

However, a cable from Boston had been received in Sacramento regarding the possibility of a joint and determined effort to liberate America from the terrors of socialism and authoritarianism.\n\nProtected by the presence of the Canadian Army and the Entente, as the civil war raged on, the Provisional Government of New England remained neutral. With Canada's descent into authoritarianism, we can no longer count on the Entente to aid us in our recovery of American democracy. Our manpower is precious, and our ability to wage war can never reach the industrial capabilities of the Steel Belt. An alliance between the Provisional Government and [ACC.GetNameDef] gives us a chance at taking our country back from the radicals who stole it from us. Of course, New England's size and its armed forces may be a liability in the battles to come. We can refuse their offer and declare ourselves the sole legitimate bastion of freedom."

# Coconut Fire
 new_england_events.150.t: "Coconut Grove Fire Claims 492 Lives!"
 new_england_events.150.d: "Located at 17 Piedmont Street in the Bay Village neighbourhood of Boston, a few blocks south of the Boston Public Garden, the Coconut Grove is well known among Bostonians as a popular hangout spot given the number of celebrities that frequent it. Visited by GIs, movie stars, celebrities, and even politicians such as Maurice Tobin - the nightclub also has been rumoured to have links with the Mafia and organised crime. Initially a garage and a warehouse, the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a \"South Seas\" like a tropical paradise with support columns made to look like palm trees and fixtures made to look like coconuts.\n\nAt 10:15 pm on the evening of November 28th however, a young soldier removed a lightbulb in the lounge to give himself and his date some privacy. A young busboy was called to replace the lightbulb, unable to find the bulb he lit a match, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses would report that soon after, flames burst from palm fronds beneath the ceiling. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the flames simply spread throughout the nightclub, racing faster than patrons could move and covering the entire establishment with smoke. The building's main entrance was a single revolting door which became useless as the patrons stampeded in panic. By the time firefighters had arrived, 492 lives were lost. Perhaps more grotesque was the fact that some bodies were discovered with drinks still in their hands as the fire and toxic smoke had overtaken them too quickly.\n\nThe owner of the club Barney Welansky was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter due to his failure in following the loose restrictions of the city. Investigators also discovered that the club lacked licenses for serving liquor and food and the remodeling was done by unlicensed contractors. The mayor of Boston, Maurice Tobin has come under fire for his connections to Welansky with some calling for his resignation."

# VT-NH Border Transfer
 new_england_events.151.t: "A Long Dispute Settled"
 new_england_events.151.d: "Today, map makers from the Geological Survey rejoiced as the long-standing border dispute between Vermont and New Hampshire has finally been settled.\n\nThe new settlement fixes the boundary between the two states for 200 miles along the Connecticut River. New Hampshire's jurisdiction begins with the original low water line on the west bank of the river. For nearly 150 years, the two states had been arguing where the line ran. Both states collected taxes from property owners, and there was a recurrent debate between the states as to which state would control the bridges and control powerhouses.\n\nA.F. Hassen, chief of the cartographic section of the Geological Survey, said that some map changes in the past twenty years have been significant enough to change in the geographic text but obscure enough to mostly only affect scientists, road builders, and engineers. Most of these changes happened as a result of rivers changing course. Following the fixture of the Vermont-New Hampshire border, the Geological Survey began to look for other erratic rivers that may have changed course and, therefore, could drastically change the boundary lines."

# Grew Event
 new_england_events.152.t: "A Prince from the Land of the Rising Sun"
 new_england_events.152.d: "A curious visitor was spotted at the residence of Joseph Grew, the ambassador to Japan before the Civil War. The bespectacled and short visitor greeted Grew with a bow, and to the surprise of onlookers, Grew returned the favour. Grew then invited the guest and his entourage into his home, where it is reported that the men shared a delicious drink of tea.\n\nThe visitor is Prince Tokugawa Iesato, the first head of the Tokugawa Clan after the overthrow of the Tokugawa Bakufu and the ensuing Meiji Restoration. A youth in England gave Iesato the respect of the Entente Powers - during the Weltkrieg, Iesato had organised a condolence booklet in concern for the enormous death and destruction in Europe. Despite the tense relations between Japan and the United States, Iesato and Grew had come to treat each other as close friends and sought to encourage goodwill between the two nations. In recognition of Japan's gift of cherry blossom trees in 1912, Iesato had travelled to New England in a goodwill event despite the great civil war that now divides the United States.\n\nWhile their conversation was limited to only those who were present, there are rumours that the two men discussed the ongoing situation in the Pacific. For a long time, the United States had competed with Japan for domination of the great ocean. Now with the civil war plaguing the United States, the Japanese stand virtually unopposed in the Pacific. Even if Iesato himself is committed to peace, the Japanese nation certainly has ambitions in Asia - ambitions that it will now feel comfortable to pursue without the industrial giant of America present. While no open conflict has yet emerged between the two countries, only time will tell whether or not peace will reign in Asia."

# War Referendum Killed
 new_england_events.153.t: "War Referendum killed in the House"
 new_england_events.153.d: "It is revealed to the public that administration leaders in the New England Congress received a surprise when a new possible war referendum was brought to the debate. The bill proposes that a national referendum should be held before Congress can declare war, thus giving the ordinary men and women the chance to have a direct vote on their country's involvement in foreign conflicts. However, in the case where the nation is attacked first, a referendum would not be held.\n\nThe controversial bill has secured the 23 votes needed to bring the bill into the House. Many Irish-American delegates are eager to support the bill, believing that this will give New England the ability to stay away from aiding the former British Empire. These delegates and the people they represent are wary of the British, with the memories of the Great Famine and the War for Independence still fresh in their minds. Nonetheless, with the decision of 35 congress members in the balance, congressman James Farley rallied his fellow Irish-American congressmen to shut down the bill. Farley believes that America's place in the world is to help it and not to stay away from the world's affairs. His efforts have been successful; the possible war referendum act has been shut down.\n\nInterestingly enough, a parliamentary question was raised late tonight by the discovery that the list of signers bore the name of William P. Connery Jr, a representative from Massachusetts who had died by the time the petition was being presented. The rule requires that a discharge petition be signed by a majority of the membership of the House. But the law says nothing about the signature of a dead member and the question remains for now unanswered."

# Garbage Truck Maims Three
 new_england_events.154.t: "Garbage Truck Maims Three"
 new_england_events.154.d: "In a horrific accident today, three GIs were struck by a passing junk truck in the afternoon. The three men were native New Yorkers; Aaran Rivenavich, Thomas Luzzo, and Michael Malito served in the 244th Coastal Artillery. The soldiers are former refugees from New York City who had escaped the war-torn city to enlist in the army of the provisional government. When a projecting piece of load struck them, the men were returning from Port Ontario at Oswego, a prominent military base and refugee camp.\n\nAll three men were severely cut, and Luzzo is said to have a broken arm. The driver of the junk truck was held on charges of third-degree assault and improper loading. While the incident has attracted outrage from the victims' families, the state of New York has vowed to increase standards and measures for its junk disposal transportation."

# Kennedy Recalled
 new_england_events.155.t: "Ambassdor Kennedy Recalled"
 new_england_events.155.d: "Today, a shift in the foreign departments has occurred as Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr, ambassador to the Canadian government, has effectively been recalled and replaced with John Winant.\n\nThe recall happened after Mr. Kennedy gave a long and rambling interview regarding New England's commitments to the Entente with newspaper journalist Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe. In the ensuing speech, former Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war to liberate the Home Isles was not about saving democracy from the tide of Syndicalism.\n\n\"It's all a question of what we do for the next six months. The whole reason for aiding Canada is to give us time...as long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that she's fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting to restore the monarchy over the subjects who rejected her. I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy's words attracted nothing more than outrage from the President of New England and the Canadian government. The President has replaced Kennedy with John Winant, the former governor of New Hampshire. In his first official statement as the new ambassador to the Dominion of Canada, Winant has declared that \"We the people of New England are determined to help by action to ensure total victory over socialist aggression.\" Perhaps signalling a period of increased American and Canadian ties, Winant stressed that between the Canadians and Americans exist \"a bond of common sympathy and understanding, common purpose and devotion which will live on long after Syndicalist tyranny.\""

# Currency Powers Fought
 new_england_events.156.t: "[NEE.GetLeader]'s Power on Currency Fought"
 new_england_events.156.d: "As the Provisional Government of New England struggles to rebuild the economy after years of the Great Depression, the issue of the President's power on currency has come up multiple times in Congressional debates. The Secretary of Commerce Charles W. Tobey and Vice President H. Styles Bridges have put together a joint resolution to repeal President [NEE.GetLeader]'s ability in current law to issue up to $3,000,000 of additional paper currency. They declared that this latent power could endanger small investors, holders of insurance, wage earners, and those with fixed incomes. In addition, the resolution also plans to curb inflation by placing tighter restrictions on who and how much money can be printed at once."

# Hopkins under Fire
 new_england_events.157.t: "Hopkins Under Fire"
 new_england_events.157.d: "From a sickbed in the North County Community Hospital, where he is recuperating from a throat infection, Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins has again answered "definitely no" to allegations that he belongs to the Socialist Party of America. In the days following Hopkins' implementation of Work Progress Administration relief programs, Hopkins has come under fire within elements in Congress, with some denouncing him as a syndicalist disguised in sheep's clothing.\n\nIn a speech to the House, Democratic representative John J. Connor from New York State declared that the \"head of one of our great departments is a registered socialist.\" When Connor was asked whether or not he referred to Hopkins, Connor shrugged his shoulders and replied that \"one must draw their conclusions.\" While Hopkins and his son have reiterated orally that Hopkins does not belong to the Socialist Party, this particular incident has illustrated the paranoia among congress members regarding the so-called \"Red Menace\". Those who are fiscally conservative are wary of the increasing role of the government in the economy and have come to see socialism as the nation's greatest enemy, both politically and morally. Even in the workplace, there are reports that those suspected of having leftist leaning beliefs or those speaking favourably of Reed's movement in Chicago are being fired and discredited. Throughout New England, many in private are referring to this mass hysteria as a \"Red Scare,\" and some even jokingly remark that it is \"better to be dead than red.\""

# Hopkins WPA
 new_england_events.158.t: "The Work Progress Administration Under Hopkins"
 new_england_events.158.d: "In response to the continued economic woes from the Great Depression, Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins has announced an additional wage increase for workers in Work Progress Administration (WPA) agreements for workers in the rural areas of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The programme now sets the new wage at $3.90 a month to more than 82,000 workers.\n\nIn the rural areas of New England, Hopkins argues that the wage earners there are only 45 per cent of the national average but with this new increase they will be getting 53 per cent of that average. This gives the impression of comparative underpayment in the North on the WPA. Nonetheless, opposing congressmen who are opposed to government intervention in the economy, find Hopkins' legislation too radical. Critics find themselves uncertain as to whether or not Hopkins' wage increase will actually benefit the rural farmer, especially since WPA wages can be determined by a single person. To quell doubt among the working class and politicians, Hopkins has helped organise the Community Mobilisation for Human Needs - an organisation dedicated to sharing the costs of relief between local, state, and federal governments."

# St Lawrence Waterway

 new_england_events.159.d: "In a brief conference today at St. Lawrence in Canada, the Canadian and American engineers met to discuss the possibility of a two-stage plan of power development. President [NEE.GetLeader] met with the Canadian Prime Minister to discuss the planned industrial project outlined by the American members of the Joint Board of Engineers in 1926 - hoping to foster good will and intentions between the nations.\n\nThe project plans to construct a proposed dam on Barnhart Island, with one power station being built near Massena, New York on the American side and another power house built on Cornwall on the Canadian side. While plans have indeed been drawn up, it is unknown as to when construction on the dam will actually begin. The meeting's successful conclusion and friendly atmosphere however has solidified relations between the two nations and there is no doubt that the future will see further cooperation between the American and Canadian nations."

 new_england_events.160.d: "At a conference in Montreal, prominent ambassador to Canada from the United States, John Winant gave a speech praising the goals of the Entente alliance. The British dominions and their allies are fighting together against a system that represents a perversion of social justice. The socialists who currently control the Great Britain have gone too far in their pursuit of a noble ideal. In their efforts to raise up the working class, they have destroyed the natural order of society and turned the world upside down.\n\nLooking to the future, he said that when the war is done and arms are laid down, he is hopeful that the peoples of not just Britain but the whole world will rebuild democracy in a more perfect likeness than it has ever been done before."

# Snell SSA Revision
 new_england_events.162.t: "Revision of the Social Security Act"
 new_england_events.162.d: "In a sweeping revision of the Social Security Act, Secretary of Commerce Bertrand Snell has effectively pulled back provisions granted by the previous rendition of the Act. While Snell has pledged that this \"will eliminate unnecessary reserve funds,\" he has also promised that this revision would be done \"without weakening the benefits of the Act.\"\n\nEstablished as part of the Second Square Deal, the Social Security Act issued direct payments to the elderly who were struggling with the woes of the Great Depression. The programme was later expanded to include an unemployment insurance system and a national healthcare programme - assisting those hit hardest by the economic problems of the late 30s. Nonetheless, with the Great Depression a distant memory, Congress' rollback of some of the provisions of Social Security has attracted controversy among some citizens who still find themselves reliant on the system. According to Snell, the Amendment is designed to prevent \"wasteful and disruptive discord between employer, employee, and labour organisations.\" Snell believes that the revision will help limit government competition with private enterprises so that businesses might create jobs with some certainty as to the future. While time will tell whether or not Snell's prediction will come true, the move has undoubtedly sparked anger among the working-classes of America."

# National Church Association Incorporated
 new_england_events.163.t: "National Church Association Incorporated"
 new_england_events.163.d: "An American entrepreneur, economist, business theorist - Secretary of Commerce Roger Babson has promoted establishing his so-called \"National Church Association Inc,\" a volunteer network where persons of any faith will have space to pause and worship.\n\nRepresenting the tenth generation of New Englanders, Babson heavily researched his ancestors - finding himself to come from a lineage of farmers, merchants, midwives, and sea captains. Holding the belief that traits are hereditary, Babson hopes to emulate the lives of his ancestors in his words and actions. After studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in engineering and a brief stint working on Massachusetts highway projects, Babson turned to a career of work as an investment banker. From there, his career expanded into economics advising, a brilliant financial forecaster keen on helping young and upcoming investors - Babson earned the distinction of being the first financial forecaster to predict the German economic collapse on Black Monday.\n\nSurviving what seemed to be an inescapable diagnosis of tuberculosis, Babson credits his recovery to his unshakeable faith. According to the Secretary of Commerce himself, Babson's most profound experience was his religious conversion at fifteen. From 1936 to 1938, Babson served as National Church Moderator for the General Council on the Congregational Christian Churches. During his tenure, he employed his fondness for statistics to showcase the church's weakness in attendance - fearing that a decline in church attendance would lead to a decay in society's morals. His appeals to chart a morally correct course for church and society were met with threats and defiance - ultimately ending his tenure as a moderator in disappointment.\n\nNevertheless, Babson refuses to give up. Now, as Secretary of Commerce, he has charted the course to open church doors for every day and hour. Babson's churches will be opened to peoples of all faiths so that all will have the space to express praise and worship to their most high. The opening of the first such establishment in Wellesley, MA, will be the first of many national churches for all Americans to practise their religions freely."

# Moderate Prohibition Agenda
 new_england_events.164.t: "A Moderate Prohibition Agenda"
 new_england_events.164.d: "Having entered the world of politics, Babson and his supporters have pushed for a morally conservative society. Babson himself has long belonged to the Prohibition Party and has expressed his great desire to see America return to its \"moral past.\"\n\nRepresenting the Prohibition Party, Babson's party members believe in outlawing gambling, alcohol, narcotics, pornography, and other indecent publications. The party has also expressed its desire to pass legislation to conserve natural resources, reduce debt and taxation, aid farmers, and assure workers and consumers of industry's products and profits. As the new Secretary of Commerce, Babson has used his platform to denounce America's "decaying moral order" and petition the American people to return to the churches.\n\nWhile the total prohibition on the vices may not be a reality any time soon, Babson's party has undoubtedly achieved a victory with new legislation promising to help small rural farmers. These farmers will receive government stimulus and will have their taxation reduced to help them prosper. Babson himself has acknowledged that his party's size prevents it from becoming as relevant as the Democrats and the Republicans, but he has declared that he hopes that the people of America will take notice of his movement."

 new_england_events.165.d: "Today, January 25th, 1943, is a sad day as the ambassador to Canada, Jay Pierrepont Moffat, passed away. Just two and a half weeks after his 47th birthday, the ambassador passed away with complications from surgery for phlebitis.\n\nBorn on January 7th, 1896, in Rye, New York - Moffat was a lineal descendant of the famed John Jay, the first Chief Justice and a negotiator at the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. A professional diplomat, Moffat served as private secretary to the US Ambassador to the Netherlands from 1917 to 1919 and as secretary of the American Legation in Warsaw from 1919 until 1921 and in Tokyo from 1921 to 1923. From 1925 to 1927, he served President Lowden as a ceremony officer, and at the end of his assignment, he married Lila Cabot Grew, the daughter of American diplomat Joseph C. Grew.\n\nSince 1940, Moffat has served as the ambassador to Canada - bridging the differences between the American and Canadian governments. In his obituary, the New York Times laments \"that even in war, when death is knocking at such a multitude of doors, the loss of a trusted public man in the flower of his ages and his powers is lamentable.\" His funeral in Christ Church Cathedral was attended by the Canadian Prime Minister and other Canadian officials.

# Noble Trade Agreement
 new_england_events.166.t: "Edward Noble Proposes Tariff Amendment"
 new_england_events.166.d: "Proposed by the Secretary of Commerce Edward Noble, the Reciprocal Tariff Act of [GetYear] has been put forth granting the President the ability to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce tariffs in return for reciprocal reductions in tariffs in the United States for up to 50%.\n\nThey were signed into law by President [NEE.GetLeader], the act will now give the president the power to negotiate bilateral, reciprocal trade agreements with other countries, bringing liberalisation to American trade policy around the globe. Ever since the first American Civil War, tariffs in the United States have been at an all-time high. In response to the decades-long Great Depression and Black Monday, tariffs in the United States and the nation embraced a trade policy of protectionism. The Reciprocal Tariff Act aims to bring down these barriers, bring down duties on foreign products, and encourage trade between nations.\n\nBefore establishing the Reciprocal Tariff Act, if Congress wanted to enact a lower tariff - it would act unilaterally and tackle the foreign country's tariff rate as fixed. Congress would choose a tariff rate that was either a little lower or higher than the median preferred tariff, depending on the composition of Congress. Individual members of Congress were under tremendous pressure from lobbyists to raise tariffs to protect them from the adverse effects of imports. The Reciprocal Tariff Act now ties US tariff reductions to foreign tariff reductions, giving Congress the ability to approve the tariffs with a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority. With the President given the authority to negotiate the terms, we will undoubtedly see a more liberal trade policy in the near future."

 new_england_events.167.d: "Rapid progress has been made on the \"Wilbur Cross Parkway,\" a four-lane parkway connecting Merritt Parkway over the Housatonic River at the town line between Milford and Stamford. Named after the former Governor of Connecticut and the Provisional President of the Government of New England Wilbur Cross, the project plans to expand the infrastructure of the state of Connecticut and to alleviate the stress of traffic. The ambitious project aims to be the longest vehicular tunnel in all of New England.\n\nThe first section of this parkway, which acts as a continuation of the Merritt Parkway, was opened on Labour Day last year and directly connected with the Boston Post Road at Milford. As construction begins linking the Nutmeg State and the Bay State, engineers and advisors are hopeful that motorists will make use of this famous parkway. Since the opening of the first section of the Merritt Parkway, the route has witnessed a steady increase in the number of cars passing through it. It is with great hope and anticipation that more passengers will utilise the highway to the fullest - allowing for safe high-speed traffic."

 new_england_events.168.t: "Secretary of State Dulles rails against the Third Internationale"
 new_england_events.168.d: "A fiery speech was just delivered by the acting secretary of state for [NEE.GetNameDef], John Foster Dulles. He denounced the totalitarian regimes across the Atlantic that hold the peoples of Europe in bondage. Their society is highly materialistic, atheistic and unconcerned by the concept of a moral law. Instead they claim that laws are merely the means whereby those in power carry out their will. God-given unalienable rights are a foreign concept to them where every protection that a man can have can be stripped away by the government's will.\n\nWhile some good has been done for the proletariat in the nations overseas, this was only made possible through the coercion, terrorism, and liquidisation of those whose reason or conscience compelled them to resist the changing regime. There are some similarities in the professed end goals of both the Socialist States of Europe and America, yet, the methods employed are utterly dissimilar.\n\nThe Totalitarian regimes in Europe are not wholly a government of peace and liberation, as much as they wish to tell the world through their propaganda machine. It may not, and it is my hope that it does not wish for international war. Such devastation in the modern age would be completely unthinkable. Even if this is the case, the peoples of [NEE.GetNameDef] must remain ever vigilant against the prospects of foreign agents infiltrating the country to stir up the seeds of class warfare amongst the free citizens of the West."

The power of Western liberalism and democracy is the ability to bring about largely peaceful changes to better society. [NEE.GetNameDefCap] can not afford to cling to the past simply because the past solutions proved reliable. Innovation and risks drove development across the world.\n\nDuring the last 150 years, the political institutions of the free societies of the West have brought about immense leaps in social and economic developments that the people living back then could hardly believe what a life we live today is like.

The horrors of the second American civil war showed the dire state of transcontinental travel across the nation. While some improvements were made to help the various factions supply their armies deeper into enemy territory, the time it takes a unit to cross the United States is still largely the same as back in 1919 when the Motor Transport group first attempted a crossing using the Lincoln Highway. With most major reconstruction projects coming to completion, Weeks was able to secure congressional approval to levy a federal gas tax to support the expansion of the Interstate Highway system. The act will provide a thirteen year programme to build 41,000 miles of modern highways for civilian and military use subsidised up to 90% by the government."

Such a loan would help rebuild the world trade that suffered due to the collapse of the British, American, and German markets in the preceding decades. As countries moved towards retrenchment, global cooperation took a nosedive. Furthermore, the conflict of the Second World War saw multiple factions attempt to corner a market of resources solely for themselves.

The fight against the menace of syndicalism had been a victorious one, but the price had been painful. American newsreels and newspapers have been broadcasting daily scenes of the horrendous plight of the British; families crammed in bomb shelters, buses in craters, and the endless fires.\n\nThe American ambassador to Canada, W. Averell Harriman, announced today that he and other members of the American embassy planned to give "the greatest possible consideration" for immediate aid to the United Kingdom. In his first conference as ambassador to the Canadian nation, he acknowledged the United States' full commitment to the restoration of the United Kingdom." The American people have the greatest sympathy for the British people who have suffered so much.

In stark contrast to the loud clamours of isolation during the years following and during the Weltkrieg, Atherton's rhetoric petitions the free nations of the world to work together instead of against each other.\n\nIn his statement he declared that "The immediate expressions of this internationalism will be economical and political but both economics and politics are children of education, and the parent must teach the child." Asserting that education was the only means of eradicating the lure of socialism, he said that "if the evil ideas, the sins of socialism live on, if they penetrate our own society, if we permit radicalism and terror, unthinkable prejudice to colour our lives, then the Syndicalist philosophy shall have triumphed after all.""

In its third major war, the German Kaiserreich has finally lost its place in the sun, and the American occupation of Germany has begun.\n\nAs the occupation of Germany begins, US Secretary Henry Morgenthau has announced his \"Morgenthau Plan\" to push for a period of peace and stabilisation in Europe while also ensuring that Germany's ability to wage war would never be used again. His Disarmament Program aims to cripple Germany for generations so that war will never be brought again to Europe while also hoping to quell the flames of Prussian militarism. The Ruhr, the so-called heart of German industrial power, is to be stripped of all existing industries so that Germany can never again have the power to wage war. Morgenthau has not been shy about his desire to effectively turn Germany into an agricultural and pastoral nation, although this has led to significant controversy among American leadership.\n\nArguments have arisen over the humanitarian concern of the Morgenthau Plan, with some estimators believing that the Plan will lead to the starvation of millions of Germans.

Two of these new cabinet members; Dean Acheson and W. Averell Harriman had known each other since their days at Yale University and in their early Wall Street careers. They are also joined by Charles E. Bohlen, a younger but Harvard graduated diplomat with experience serving with the Syndicalist regime of France.\n\nInfluenced by former Secretary of State Henry Stimson, the group was formed due to the President's lack of expertise in foreign policy. The group's divisive members allow it to be non-partisan, with the men striving for pragmatic American internationalism and an aversion to ideological fervour. The men tend to be practical, realistic, and non ideological - hoping to bring America back onto the world stage after the destructive civil war. With their expertise in diplomacy, it has been reported that the President values the group's advice, especially in containing syndicalism from corrupting the rest of the free nations of the world. It can be assumed that successor presidencies will take advantage of these wise men of foreign diplomacy to use America's strength and industry for the benefit of the free world."

 new_england_events.177.d: "Tragic news reached the State Department today as the Canadian government informed us that Ambassador Laurence A. Steinhardt had been unfortunately killed in an early morning plane accident near Ramsayville, Ontario. In addition to Steinhardt, the plane accident also took the lives of several American servicemen and Alan Harrington, a twenty-year old son of a United States minister who had been visiting his parents in Canada. The plane was a C-47 used by the ambassador for business flights and en route to New York, no foul play has been suspected so far. Witnesses saw the plane emitting heavy smoke shortly after leaving the Rockcliffe Airport before falling and exploding into flames. Only one American serviceman escaped by parachute, it remains uncertain whether or not the parachutes had either malfunctioned or that the men were hesitant to jump. Regardless, the incident is being investigated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and a United States investigation team sent from [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nBorn on October 6, 1892- Steinhardt grew up in New York City and served a brief stint in the army in the 60th Field Artillery. A member of the Republican Party, he ascended into politics with a close friendship with President Baldwin. Entering the world of international relations, Steinhardt served as the American Ambassador to Sweden where he was given the Order of the Polar Star by King Gustav V in 1936. The civil war in America forced Steinhardt to return home and he decided to offer his allegiance to the Provisional Government in New England. Following the great war, Steinhardt served as the American ambassador to [RUS.GetName] until his most recent and unfortunately final appointment as ambassador to [CAN.GetName]."

# Death Knell of Maine Klan

 new_england_events.179.d: "Since its inception as a compromise between the divided congress of the American antebellum, the northernmost state of Maine has long been considered a land of moderation and tranquility. To this end, the political trends in Maine are a good measure of the national mood, with its September gubernatorial election widely considered a predictor of the following national elections. In recent years, however, a new wave of immigration from French Canada to the mill-towns of central Maine has disrupted the homogeneity and tranquility of the state. With a growing community of devout Catholics in the state, the entrenched Protestant majority increasingly turned to charismatic magician turned Ku Klux Klan Leader F. Eugene Farnsworth, who developed a deep web of Klan patronage and community which threatened to subsume the ruling Republican Party.\n\nThese tensions would come to a head in 1926, when a clique of pro-Klan Republicans led by Governor Owen Brewster were soundly defeated by the old guard of the party, which joined forces with their Democratic enemies to secure the election of an anti-Klan senator. In the wake of this electoral defeat, the Maine Klan suffered a number of legal and monetary setbacks, leading to a near universal collapse. While the Klan itself has all but dissolved, a more insidious legacy remains. A number of sheriffs and municipal administrators across the state were put in place by the Klan more than a decade ago, and continue to maintain Klan values in much of the state.\n\nAs far as official membership goes, on the other hand, all that remains are the Women of the Klan, who continue to fund a collection of local chapters through bake sales and church meetings."

The already rural south faces a greater need for reconstruction compared to the rest of the country as thousands are left homeless and penniless with the South's second defeat in recent history.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, Frances Perkins has called for greater labour standards in the new reconstructed social order of the South following the conclusion of the civil war. She was joined by Roman Catholic social justice advocate Francis J. Haas (dean of the School of Social Science of the Catholic University of America), a proponent of an occupational labour group system somewhat along the lines of that established by American railroads - management and workers as the machinery for a sound social order. In a panel discussion held at the Catholic Committee of the South in Richmond, Virginia - the two discussed labour, family life, and industry in the postwar South.\n\nPerkins in particular has called for a rebuilding of the labour standards as she deems the pre civil-war labour standards to be \"inadequate.\" She declared that it was necessary that in every nation \"no matter how much we should be pressed by the day to day problems of survival, we shall dedicate a portion of our resources to continuous study and planning of this post-war period.\" Furthermore, she noted that in addition to revising labour standards, there must be a great extension of public \"responsibility\" in the postwar era of public responsibility in health, nutrition, and housing."

# Formation of National Ski Patrol
 new_england_events.181.t: "Formation of the National Ski Patrol"
 new_england_events.181.d: "An experience of ski tragedies shook the worldview of amateur skier and insurance agent Charles Minot Dole in 1936 that would lead him to spearhead a national organisation dedicated to ski safety and rescue. On a ski trip in Stowe, Vermont, Dole fractured his ankle, and he had no one to save him but his friend Frank Edson who just happened to pass by. Two months later, Edson went on his own ski race and fractured his ribs and arms while also suffering from lung collapse. The severe injury led to Edson's unfortunate death - and would have a lasting impression on Dole.\n\nThe president of the National Ski Association, Roger Langley, asked Dole to chair a ski accident study for the NSA and set up patrols for the 1938 National Downhill and Slalom Races. The success of this little project convinced Langley to ask Dole to charter a provisional patrol on a national basis throughout the United States. Dole took heavy inspiration from the Parsenndienst, a Swiss patrol in Davos, Switzerland, forming his own ski patrol. However, unlike the Swiss patrol, members of the American patrol did not charge for rescue or care. His \"National Ski Patrol\" is centred around the motto \"Service and Safety,\" with patrollers mandated to take extensive courses to fulfil Dole's requirements and standards for effective and efficient patrollers. Since the organisation is entirely voluntary, Dole created an awards programme based on local and national levels. The awarding programme covers various commendable skills and achievements such as leadership, first aid, skiing, mountaineering, and avalanche training."

As American aid and relief continues to pour into war-torn Europe, isolationists and critics of American foreign policy have pushed to cut relief efforts. Acheson mentioned that he had heard that the European peoples seeking assistance were not hard-working and were instead reliant on American support.\n\nTo these critics of American overseas aid, Acheson argued that Europeans were not lazy - pointing out the rise in pre-war production in France and Britain. Acheson further admonished that if [NEE.GetNameDef] failed or refused to help the governments of Western Europe restore order; the citizens of these countries can easily fall sway to the seductive lure of syndicalism and socialism once more. To Acheson, the continued relief shipments to the European free world reflected America's strong commitment to global democracy and freedom - a commitment it intends to keep."

# Wells calls for the death of isolation
 new_england_events.183.t: "Wells Calls For The Death of Isolationism"
 new_england_events.183.d: "The past history of the United States has shown the futility of taking the isolationist stance. Despite a quick colonial war at the turn of the century with the fading power of the Spanish Empire, the United States began a shift in foreign policy towards isolation. While this trend successfully kept our young men from dying needlessly in the fields of Flanders over a European scuffle, American global interests were devastated. The collapse of the Third French Republic was to be a quick showcase of the tremors that were to come in the next half decade. Five years later, when the British Empire collapsed and the stock exchange plummeted, America found itself in its darkest hour since the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. As the Germans pushed the Americans out of the greater European market, and with longstanding American allies falling to socialist revolts, the United States was forced to turn inwards in hopes of outlasting the storm. This isolationist stance saw a decreasing American presence abroad until finally the fires of the second American civil war consumed America once more.\n\nIn a speech given to the New York Times, Secretary of State Sumner Wells decried that \"Isolation, in its earlier form, as an issue, is I believe, dead.\" If America wishes to see prosperity in the world, they can not make it happen while staying inside their borders at home. America must take an active approach to seek out allies and expand their presence. The way to secure future peace is through action, not merely words. Only then can the world know the strength of Democracy that spent much of the last two decades fading away in face of Authoritarianism and Socialism."

They claim that this would allow them to quickly face any potential instigators of unrest that would negatively affect the defence of [NEE.GetNameDef]. Prominent politician Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, a vibrant opponent of the proposed census, went as far as to decry the proposal as an attempt to \" transform the 1940 census into the most complete police list in the history of the world.\" With the president's approval, this proposal could pass but if he takes a stand against it, the proposal will be delegated to the dustbin."

For the second time in its history, the city's once-mighty avenues and monuments were nothing more than mere shells of their former selves. Intense street-to-street fighting had led to each building in the city turned into a fortress - a depressing fate for what was once the heart of American democracy.\n\nWith order being restored across the nation and the world recognition of the reunified United States of America, the question of the nation's capital has arisen. Despite being utterly ruined, Washington, D.C. is a powerful candidate. The return of a President to the White House and the Congresses held in the Capitol would legitimise the Provisional Government of New England as the heirs to American democracy. On the other hand, the city of Boston also poses a powerful argument. The birthplace of the American Revolution and the temporary capital during the nation's darkest days, Boston has undoubtedly proved its worth as the nation's capital. And finally, there is the proposal that the nation's capital should be moved westward, to the middle of the country.

Marion Dickerman, Nancy Cook, Caroline O'Day, and other contacts from the Democratic Party in New York helped finance the project at the Roosevelt Estate. Val-Kill Industries hoped to capitalise on the popularity of the Colonial Revival by creating items such as furniture, pewter, and homespun cloth using 18th-century methods.\n\nWith Nancy Cook's failing health and the lingering effects of the Great Depression still being felt throughout New England, Eleanor made the hard decision to close down the factory.

 new_england_events.189.d: "A congressional hearing organised by the House Unamerican Activities Committee was held today in Los Angeles, and while the hearings were initially held behind closed doors to avoid undesired attention, news of a so-called \"Hollywood Blacklist\" has emerged from the investigations.\n\nThe congressional committee met with prominent anti-syndicalists in Hollywood, including members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA), an organisation of high profile conservative members of the film industry to defend the film industry from reactionary and socialist infiltration. At the committee, many members of the MPA, such as John Wayne, have argued that radicals in the film industry have been inserting propaganda onto the silver screen to incite labour union violence, manipulate voting behavior, and raise money for Syndicalists worldwide. The committee believed that enough evidence existed and expressed concern about \"everyone in the movie industry who might be used as agents of a foreign power to destroy our country.\" Popular actor Ronald Reagan, president of the Screen Actors Guild, testified that a small clique within his union was using "syndicalist" like tactics to steer union policy.\n\nAs subpoenas have begun to fill the mailboxes of movie writers, directors, actors, and executives - the fear of censorship has strengthened the liberal front in Hollywood. In response, a group of anti-syndicalist liberals formed the Committee of the First Amendment, arguing that the investigations violated the Bill of Rights. The Committee of the First Amendment argued that the American film industry - through its patriotic political mobilisation - had defended democratic America in the media during the civil war. Nonetheless, as paranoia continues to grow at a congressional level, the celebrities and stars of Hollywood find themselves increasingly investigated and scouted by the government they had helped to defend months prior."

# Hollywood 10
 new_england_events.190.t: "The Hollywood Ten"
 new_england_events.190.d: "Several movie executives met at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. They issued a public statement condemning the actions of the \"Hollywood Ten\" who have refused to show up to testify before the House Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC). The statement declared that these ten men and women had been a \"disservice to their employers\" and have impaired their usefulness in the industry. All ten were dismissed from their employment contracts, and the executives pledged that studios would never knowingly employ a syndicalist.\n\nThe ten include Alvah Bessie, Herbert Bibberman, Lester Cole, Edward Dmytryk, Ring Lardner Jr, John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel Ornitz, Adrian Scott, and Dalton Trumbo. Officially blacklisted, the ten have tried to argue against HUAC and the Supreme Court but to no avail. Charged with contempt of Congress, they have been fined $1,000 each and sentenced to prison terms of six months to a year.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Congressman Hamilton Fish III and film director Myron Coureval Fagan issued a brief statement confirming that HUAC will continue to thoroughly investigate the American media industry for more signs of syndicalist infiltration. Fish and Fagan assured the American public that more subpoenas would be sent out within the coming weeks to cleanse Hollywood of red intrusion thoroughly. It is uncertain how many syndicalists HUAC believes to have infiltrated the film industry, but federal agents can be seen patrolling movie sets and studios in Los Angeles. Most film studios and their owners have all declared their support to American democracy and have promised to fire staff that has shown their sympathies for syndicalism or the syndicalist regimes around the world."

# Learned Hand
 new_england_events.191.t: "The Selection of a Chief Justice"
 new_england_events.191.d: "With the court system in complete shambles, legal scholars have approached the [NEE.GetLeader.GetSurname] administration about appointing a new Supreme Court to begin to build a federal court system for New England. Their choice was unanimous, the former federal judge Learned Hand.\n\nBillings Learned Hand was born in 1872 and grew up in upstate New York. He was initially appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1909 by William Howard Taft. After 12 years as a district judge, and with a strong progressive reputation he was promoted to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals by President McAdoo in 1921.\n\nAs a judge for the 2nd Circuit, Judge Hand has shaped every area of the law including contracts, torts, copyright law, and especially free speech law. His progressive leanings are obvious, but that has not stopped him from being a fair and brilliant jurist.\n\nSome particular legal scholars support Judge Hand because of his sympathetic views towards a revolutionary piece of legislation which has been only conceived of in the last few years: the Uniform Commercial Code. As the Great Depression was ripping its way through the United States, some legal scholars believed they could incentivise further economic activity by streamlining the rules governing commercial contracts. Per the constitution, the federal government may only govern interstate commerce, not commerce that is done within one state. The UCC would establish universal contract principles as agreed on many legal scholars, and then would be adopted by each of the several states which would make contract law predictable and consistent across the country. That predictability would decrease legal fees for nationwide companies and would further incentivise commerce, and strengthen the recovery.\n\nWhile the code has not even entered the drafting phase, Judge Hand is a proponent of such a code, and thus many pro-business people support his nomination as well. It's fair to say that he has the experience and the qualifications."

 new_england_events.200.t: "The [GetYear] Provisional President"
 new_england_events.200.d: "The outbreak of the Second American Civil War separated New England from the rest of the nation. In the absence of a responsible government, the local state governments have organised a vote to determine who shall lead as the provisional president of New England. In hopes of shoring up some of our legitimacy, the provisional president will only serve until 1940, when a normal election cycle will occur. The convention has come up with three options.\n\nThe Republican Party has put forward their candidate of Lewis Barrows, a longstanding Republican committeeman and just recently elected into the governorship of Maine in 1936. Running alongside him is Styles Bridges, the former governor and current senator for New Hampshire. While they have promised to work with Democrats to bring about social relief for those still suffering under the Great Depression, they remain committed to fighting what they view as excesses in unionisation and welfare subsidies.\n\nRunning against them for the Democratic Party is David Walsh, the former Governor of Massachusetts and current senator of the same state. While he has not been supportive of large government projects ever since his political defeat in 1924, the party has chosen his running mate accordingly. Prospective vice-president Theodore Green, recently elected Senator of Rhode Island, is a fervent defender of big government. He has already delivered speeches outlining plans to ensure relief reaches the people and enacting wage and rent reform to keep the bottom line up.\n\nFinally, in an unorthodox approach for an equally unusual election, moderates from both the Democratic and Republican Party have pushed forward the option of Joseph Martin Jr, a member of the House of Representatives for Massachusetts for over the last decade. He has agreed to have Joseph Ely as his running mate, which will mark the first time since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson's election in 1796 that members of opposing political parties will run together. Promising a middle ground where both parties have equal input on national policy, they hope that the moderates can carry their way into the presidency."
 new_england_events.200.a: "The Republicans come out on top."
 new_england_events.200.b: "A compromise cabinet is needed at this time!"
 new_england_events.200.c: "The Democrats win the vote."

 new_england_events.201.t: "An Alliance between Labor and the Democrats"
 new_england_events.201.d: "As the 1940 election rolls ever closer, the Democrats seek to sweep the president's office from the incumbent Barrows. To help their chances, the Democratic Party has sought after the Progressive Party's influence and their ties to the American labour movement. They plan to present themselves as the ally of the poor worker. If Perkins and her allies can rally together enough Progressive votes to ensure the Presidency does not remain in Republican hands, she will earn a cabinet position as the secretary of commerce in the Democratic cabinet should they win the 1940 election."
 new_england_events.201.a: "For the people!"

 new_england_events.202.t: "An Alliance between Prohibition and the Republicans"
 new_england_events.202.d: "With the 1940 election just around the corner, the Republicans have made plans to take office for themselves. Since the provisional elections, David Walsh and the Democrats have controlled the presidency. To give themselves the edge over the Democrats, the Republicans have reached out to the Prohibition Party in search of votes. They hope to woo the Prohibition Party by offering Roger Babson, their proposed Presidential nominee, a position in the cabinet in 1940 should the Republicans win the election with the Prohibition voters' additional help."
 new_england_events.202.a: "To a more moral America!"

 new_england_events.209.t: "Congress Back In Full Swing"
 new_england_events.209.d: "With the 1940 Presidential Election and the end of the interim President's cabinet - the [NEE.GetName] government has decided to reconvene the former Congress of the United States. The 1940 Congress will be held with much anticipation in the nation's capital of [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] - the first Congressional meeting since the national disaster.\n\nThe idea of the Congress is one highly tied to the values of American democracy. The First American Civil War would be the watershed event to resolve slavery amidst the endless debates held between the Democratic and Republican parties. During the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century, lobbying activities intensified as lobbying groups became an increasingly prominent force in American politics. The division between American political groups and the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, and the woes caused by the Great Depression led to the radicalisation of Congress in the 1930s. Congress became a battleground in the days before the Second American Civil War, with national unity rapidly disintegrating.\n\nThe 1940 Congress plans to rebuild the faith of Americans in the legislative branch of government. With the radicals gone from the halls of Congress, the party system is now restored to its antebellum days - a Congress once more divided between the Republican and Democratic Parties. Passing legislation from one of the two will undoubtedly strengthen their dominance in the government, and therefore, a balance must be held between the two parties to ensure national unity. With this national unity, we will keep the American political machine moving once more - and restore our people's faith in American democracy."
 new_england_events.209.d.1944: "With the recent legislative elections, the makeup of Congress has differed enough to give it a fresh start once more. In the highly anticipated Congress of 1944, congressional leaders and representatives are on their way to [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to attend the Congress.\n\nAmong the issues anticipated to be discussed are labour reform, education reform, and national construction projects. In particular, the Republican Party seeks to regulate the labour movement to not fall into the seduction of socialism while also trying to provide security for the thousands of veterans left broken by the great conflict. The Democratic Party will be pushing for increased government intervention in the nation's economy - hoping that with the government's hand, the nation's economy will rebuild. Their platform will hope to see the return of the Works Progress Administration and the implementation of fair labour policies. A house divided against itself cannot stand, and therefore, an effective Congress must balance Republican and Democratic policies. We must make sure to keep this tense balance so that our nation's political machine continues to move along steadily."
 new_england_events.209.a: "Towards unity!"

 new_england_events.210.t: "Attack the Depression"
 new_england_events.210.d.barrows: "Unlike the rest of the nation that switched into wartime production, the Great Depression continues to plague New England. Unless meaningful government intervention is taken, the problems of the Depression will continue to slow down New England's economic growth and render any attempts at claiming national legitimacy useless.\n\nThe recently appointed Secretary of Commerce, Harry Hopkins has brought up the notion of a \"The Second Square Deal\" to newly elected President Lewis Barrows' attention. Arguing that the government should play a new interventionist role in New England's crippled economy, the second square deal aims to follow Roosevelt's original Square Deal from several decades ago. Hopkins has assembled a team of government officials to chart out a new plan dedicated to the conservation of natural resources, strengthening the control of corporations, and enhancing consumer production. While a fiscal conservative like Barrows is sceptical of large government projects, Barrows understands that the Provisional Government's precarious position gives little room for a divided nation. As such, Barrows agrees not to block congressional legislation to pass the Second Square Deal and to initiate the hopeful road to economic recovery."
 new_england_events.210.d.comp: "Vice President Joseph Ely working closely with the prospective Vice President for the Democratic ticket, Theodore Green have brought a request to the desk of the President. Ely favours a debt based public works programme in an effort to attempt to solve the rampant unemployment. While President Martin Jr has made it known that he has issues with this \"The Second Square Deal\" programme, he has agreed in the spirit of compromise to not block congress from passing the legislation."
 new_england_events.210.d.walsh: "On the president's desk lay a manila folder entitled \"The Second Square Deal\". It was delivered personally by vice-president Theodore Green, the biggest backer of the project. Inspired by Roosevelt's Square Deal several decades ago, Green has assembled with him a team of government officials to chart the best course out of the long depression.\n\nGreen has had his work cut out to convince president Walsh to support his agenda. Ever since his electoral loss in 1924, Walsh had grown to distrust activist government. Over the last decade, many of his speeches have criticised plans made by ambitious democrats who seek to enlarge the government massively. Green proposed that this enlarged government would be better suited to support and provide for its people but may become overly bloated if left unchecked."
 new_england_events.210.a: "We need a united legislature!"

 new_england_events.211.t: "Mail Campaign"
 new_england_events.211.d: "Several state governors and representatives have encouraged their constituents to write into the president's office in Boston. Most of these government officials fall into the Democratic large government camp who wish to see a significant expansion in their available resources. Leading the charge in upstate New York is Representative George Bradshaw Kelly. Ever popular with his support base of industrial union workers, he has held several speeches centred on what he refers to as \"The great mail campaign.\" Every citizen of the United States deserves to be heard at all levels of government office! Together, the people must write in to [NEE.GetLeader] and implore that he takes action to combat the Depression even if at the cost of increased government expenditures."
 new_england_events.211.a: "Let our voices be heard!"

 new_england_events.212.t: "[NEE.GetLeader] agrees to the Second Square Deal"
 new_england_events.212.d: "For decades, the Great Depression has crippled the industry of the North. The lines of people queued at soup kitchens and businesses closing became a norm as the American economy continued to decline.\n\nWith its second civil war in recent history, the American industry across the nation has exploded as production has turned to war material. However, the provisional government of New England continues to lag behind due to our nation's neutrality amidst the chaos and the storm. In the face of such outright aggression, President [NEE.GetLeader] has announced his plan to revitalise New England's industry and prepare the country for all that is to come. The free market will be unable to solve New England's economic woes, the government will have to take an active and dynamic approach in solving the crisis. With the help of government-sponsored work programs, Congress aims to bring New England's people to the factories as the nation prepares to fight through America's darkest hour."

 new_england_events.213.t: "Housing Act of [GetYear]"
 new_england_events.213.d: "Working under the Secretary of the Interior, the young Robert Weaver has pushed the government to reduce the prices of the cost of living. With the approval of [NEE.GetLeader], Weaver has drafted the United States Housing Program to provide financial support to local housing departments. Of particular focus for this programme, Weaver hopes that this housing programme can provide subsidies for his fellow African-American brothers and sisters. They have been particularly affected by the prolonged depression. As some of the first workers laid off from farms and industrial plants, many are currently struggling to provide housing and food to their families."
 new_england_events.213.a: "Let us provide a roof for every head!"

 new_england_events.214.t: "Rural Electrification Administration"
 new_england_events.214.d: "Many large cities throughout [NEE.GetNameDef] have access to electricity. The rural Northeast can not say the same. Dense forests and poor infrastructure have left many of our citizens in states like New Hampshire or Maine in the dark. Before the outbreak of the civil war, as little as 11 per cent of the United States had access to electricity. With most power distribution lying in private companies' hands, there was no impetus for companies to create far-flung infrastructure across the country. Many companies had quoted prices of nearly 2,000 dollars per mile to build the needed power lines.\n\nThe Rural Electrification Act of [GetYear] seeks to remedy this issue. Loans are to be made available for large-scale projects such as new power plants or power lines and individual homes. The interest rate on these loans shall be kept low by tying them to the federal government borrowing rates. Furthermore, repayment plans can be extended up to 25 years to help bring affordable modernity to rural America!"

 new_england_events.215.d: "After nearly a year of intensive labour and hard work, the boys of Eagle Lake have finished creating some of the first hiking trails of a new national park in Maine. While much remains to be done in the region, the young men employed through the CCC have created much beauty in the region of Acadia. Sections of forest have been cleared or trimmed to provide material for other construction projects while enabling visitors to explore the forest properly. Of particular note are the large granite blocks weighing upwards of one ton in weight which were cut and laid by hand along the path."
 new_england_events.215.a: "Have you seen the view from there?"

 new_england_events.216.t: "Army Reform Debate"
 new_england_events.216.d: "With the civil war consuming the rest of the nation, each side has found itself rapidly militarising. The emergency national guard units called up to maintain security on our southern border may not be adequate to defend [NEE.GetNameDef]. Two prominent sides have formed among the general staff on how to approach the army of [NEE.GetNameDef].\n\nMerritt Edson and his fellow marine officers propose greater training of the special forces. A small core of highly mobile, professional soldiers would act as America's sword and shield to blunt any blows made by the enemy as well as take the fight to them! They propose that the national guard and our Canadian allies take control of the border's general defence.\n\nMeanwhile, George Kenney advocates for a general enlargement of the military, including conscription. Relying on Canada to defend our borders places us at the mercy of Ottawa. With a large population in the Northeast, [NEE.GetNameDef] has plenty of potential recruits for the armed forces. Kenney argues that our position and industrial capabilities allow our forces to grow in size without large shortages."

 new_england_events.217.t: "Congress debates child workers"
 new_england_events.217.d: "As the Industrial Revolution arrived in the United States, factory owners would hire young workers for various tasks. Especially in the textile mills that categorise much of New England, finding children in the factories has not been uncommon. Children tend to work in factories and mines as their small statures make it easy to handle machinery and navigate tight spaces. Since 1870, the number of children in the workforce increased, and now with New England attempting to rebuild its industry - that number has not stopped growing.\n\nNonetheless, the implementation of children in the workforce has attracted a substantial degree of controversy. Factory work is dangerous, and children find themselves exposed to the chemicals and machinery of the industrial workplace that often leads to horrible accidents or death. Activist groups such as the National Child Labor Committee (formed in 1904) have risen up in response to child labour, often publicising young people's lives and working conditions. The Syndicalist cause has also seen efforts to reduce the number of children in the workforce and instead create state compulsory education laws to keep children in schools rather than at work. With New England's industry beginning to recover, Congress has now brought the issue of child labour to its latest debate. While some argue that children are needed to help struggling families and help New England's industry compete with the rest of the American continent, many believe that the practice of child labour is inhumane. Instead, they have pushed Congress to provide compulsory universal education laws nationwide, following the age-old New England tradition of education. Doing so would significantly enhance our research and intellectual capacity as we create a new generation of scientists and researchers, although this would cost fewer hands in the factories."
 new_england_events.217.a: "Keep them at work"
 new_england_events.217.b: "Restrict their hours during the school day"

 new_england_events.218.t: "Congress debates implementing wage reform"
 new_england_events.218.d: "The substantial rise of syndicalism across the nation occurred due to the agitation of labour to the seemingly oppressive practices of the industrial barons that dominated the nation's economy. While Congress is indeed wary of the totalitarian and pervasive radical nature of socialism, the latest Congressional debate brings the issue of wage and labour standards to the table.\n\nThis proposed new law aims to amend the labour agitation in the country while also keeping the populace far from the allure of syndicalism. Supported by individuals within the Bureau of Labour Standards and Congresswoman Mary T. Norton, the proposal plans to formally adopt an eight-hour workday, a forty-hour workweek, and a wage for overtime hours. The act declares that workers must be paid a minimum wage and that the overtime wage must be one-and-a-half times what workers would usually be paid. The act also aims to cover younger workers and declares that workers under eighteen are exempt from specific dangerous jobs. Critics of the proposed law argue that it is nothing more than syndicalism in sheep's clothing and that the law dramatically strengthens workers and unions who may use the act as motivation to demand more. On the other hand, proponents of the law are confident that the passage of such protection will guarantee worker loyalty - ensuring that the issue of labour rights is dealt with for the time being."

 new_england_events.219.t: "An Unpleasant Scandal"
 new_england_events.219.d: "\"SCANDAL\" bleeds the headline of every newspaper across the country, with reporters furiously surrounding the Walsh residence in the wake of a nationwide election scandal. Having served two terms as President of [NEE.GetNameDef], Walsh has been acclaimed among many as the saviour of the Democratic Party following the civil war that tore the nation apart. Despite his roaring successes in successfully combating the Great Depression and ending years of woe for New Englanders, Walsh seeks a third presidential term - unheard of and completely breaking with American tradition. No president in American history has served a third term - with George Washington himself leaving office after two, setting what many consider to be a precedent. Among the critical voices of the opposition are even those within Walsh's party, men like James Farley.\n\nNevertheless, before Walsh's campaign can even take off, it would appear that it is destined for failure. On a particular evening, OSS spies were dispatched to a male brothel after being informed that syndicalist spies were hiding amongst the patrons. The OSS found not just the syndicalist spies but also an immensely embarrassed David Walsh. His reputation is utterly in shambles among not just his party but the entire nation; Walsh will no longer represent the Democratic Party. Instead, the Democrats have decided to replace Walsh with the esteemed Massachusetts politician Joseph P. Kennedy."
 new_england_events.219.a: "A Time For Greatness?"

 new_england_events.220.t: "Yet Another Scandal"
 new_england_events.220.d: "With Kennedy replacing Walsh on the Democratic Party's ticket, it would appear that the Democratic party would bounce back. However, once again, another scandal rocks the Democratic ballot - one that could potentially shift the election heavily in favour of the Republicans. Such a loss will end the two terms of Democratic dominance in [NEE.GetNameDef] political scene.\n\nDocuments and witnesses report that Joseph P. Kennedy has been in league with the former mayor of Boston, James Curley. Due to their shared Irish-Catholic heritage, the two men are pretty close and often seen together within the Massachusetts political scene. It would appear that Joseph Kennedy has paid off Curley for political favours - no doubt in efforts to secure Democratic support for Kennedy's presidential run or perhaps to secure a spot in Congress for Kennedy's son, Joseph F. Kennedy. With Joseph P. Kennedy disgraced, the Democratic Party again has another scandal to deal with and no presidential candidate to contest the Republicans. They have hastily nominated Maurice Tobin to win over their voting base, although it appears that for now, the Republicans possess a tremendous advantage in winning the election of 1944."

Flynn, Thomas, Foster, and Browder...these names were read over and over in the courtrooms, with each verdict yielding either "Treason" or "Guilty" over and over. [WCA.GetLeader], the former first and only President of [WCA.GetNameDef], was brought out as well, although his lawyers argued fervently that he is currently unable to defend himself due to his ill health. Reed, they argued, was trying to protect the common working class of America. Indeed this has been a mighty rallying cry for the defenders of the former WCA, that the SPA was only fighting for the rights of the working class and hoping to alleviate years of economic depression. And yet, what can explain the countless acts of senseless violence committed by the Red Guard that led to refugees abandoning homes and families for asylum in New England? While some are passionately pleading for amnesty or light terms for members of the former WCA, some believe that these men and women were traitors in our nation's worst crisis. The final decision rests with the jury."

 new_england_events.251.d: "The trial of [APG.GetNameDef] began in earnest today in [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with many onlookers curious to see whether or not the South would be punished for a second time. Huey Long was not present, having fled the nation in the final days of the Civil War, and in his stead were scattered members of his party, including Charles Coughlin, Charles Lindbergh, and George Moseley. While their lawyers argued passionately that these men fought to preserve true American democracy and to defend it from falling into radicalism and socialism, the acts of Huey Long and his cohort did nothing but drive our nation further into dissolution. Their leader was nothing more than a demagogue, and many in their ranks espouse racist rhetoric, words that do not belong in our country. In addition, these men fought for an impure form of democracy, and there are plenty of eye-witness reports of Minutemen organising lynching mobs. While some are pleading for amnesty or light terms for members of the former APG, some believe that these men and women were traitors in our nation's worst crisis.

 new_england_events.252.d: "Held in [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the trial of the former [ACC.GetName] began today amidst quite some controversy. Many have argued that [ACC.GetNameDef] fought for true American democracy as the nation crumbled around them. Already, the lawyers of Merriam, Gellatly, and Johnson are petitioning the jury to understand that the leaders of [ACC.GetNameDef] truly hoped to keep American democracy alive, and they did nothing more than defend the Constitution. Such arguments certainly have had their sway, but it cannot be denied that [ACC.GetNameDef] fought against us in the Civil War and that New England blood was shed fighting against them. Surely they must be punished for their rebellion and refusal to accept us as the remaining haven of American democracy. Their participation in the Civil War was ultimately treason, such treason that can not be so lightly addressed. The final decision rests with the jury."

This was because they witnessed the trial of the former United States of America; even the former President [USA.GetLeader] was forced to sit trial. The prosecution declared that the former president's inaction and surrender of power to demagogues such as MacArthur led to the national crisis that drove our nation to its Second Civil War. Their inability to combat the economic problem that left millions of Americans workless was added to their list of crimes. While the prosecution desires harsh penalties for the former leaders of the United States, some argued that they tried their best to help the nation from a nearly impossible situation. They have pleaded for amnesty in the hopes of what they see as an eventual reconciliation and forgiveness of the former regime. The final decision rests with the jury."
 new_england_events.253.d.mac: "Held today in [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the highly anticipated trial of Douglas MacArthur and his military junta finally began much to the curiosity of onlookers and the press. The prosecution went straight for the facts; there was no doubt about it - when confronted with a national crisis, MacArthur had executed a coup that challenged the very nature of American democracy. While he and his cohort claimed the mantle of the former United States of America, the prosecution argued that this was no more than a Military Junta that threw the ideas of the Constitution out of the window. MacArthur himself was nowhere to be seen, having fled the United States in exile after the defeat of his Federal Army. His representatives argued that the old and exhausted General wanted nothing more than to retire in peace. They claimed that the nation was headed towards a radical path that would throw the country into utter anarchy, and MacArthur simply attempted to restore order and preserve American democracy. While many call his actions tyrannical, there are certainly those who believe that MacArthur wanted nothing more than to see an end of radicalism in our country. While the rest of his military clique's fate will be decided in a later trial, the final decision rests with the jury."

 new_england_events.254.t: "Trial of the Federal Army"
 new_england_events.254.d: "With the conclusion of the Federal Government's trial, the military tribunal regarding the fate of the former United States Military has begun. The prosecution pointed out that the military of the former Federal government took steps that intentionally endangered the civilian population and that the lives of many New Englanders were lost due to the actions of the former Federal Army. In addition, members of the prosecution indicated that the judgment should also extend to those in the former United States Navy - the punishment for most of these men would be years behind bars. However, their lawyers have defended the generals and admirals of the former Federal Army by claiming that they only sought to uphold their Constitutional duty and that most were simply following orders. A passionate defence for the former General Eisenhower was made from our very own General Mark Clark. He argued that Eisenhower was genuinely faithful to the ideas of America and that he only fought for the federal government due to his loyalty to defend the American constitution. Advocates of amnesty have argued that their expertise and devotion to the American constitution would be helpful in the reconstruction. However, the prosecution has pointed out that Clark and Eisenhower have been long-time friends since their West Point days, and there is undoubtedly bias in that regard. Ultimately, the final decision rests with the jury."

 new_england_events.255.d: "With the conclusion of the trial of [APG.GetNameDef], the military tribunal regarding the fate of their former military has begun. The prosecution pointed out that the generals of [APG.GetNameDef] were all traitors who rebelled and sought to dismantle American democracy. They have also expressed the atrocities committed by the soldiers of [APG.GetNameDef] and have indicated that they want nothing more than long, punishing sentences for the generals and admirals who served for [APG.GetNameDef]. While amnesty for Patton is out of the question given his leadership of the forces of [APG.GetNameDef] during the war, some generals and admirals such as General Robert M. Danford and Admiral John McCain Sr have expressed their greatest regret for serving on the wrong side. Advocates for amnesty have pointed out the men's curious devotion to American values of freedom and their willingness to take up arms against syndicalism. These men are willing to serve the American armed forces once more, and perhaps their expertise is needed to rebuild the [NEE.GetName] military and navy.

 new_england_events.256.d: "With the conclusion of the trial of [ACC.GetNameDef] finished, the military tribunal regarding the fate of their former military has begun. The generals and admirals in question were not questioned for their loyalties as [ACC.GetNameDef] rose up in response to MacArthur's coup of the former American government. Their devotion to values and ideals of America were not put into question, but the prosecution pointed out that they opposed the legitimacy of New England during the Civil War and that plenty of New Englander blood was shed in subduing the western states. While the prosecution intends to assign sentences or force a permanent retirement on some generals of [ACC.GetNameDef], some generals and admirals such as Marshall and Nimitz have expressed regret for serving on the wrong side during the war. Their lawyers have pleaded for amnesty, citing their utmost devotion to American democracy and their desire to see the ideas of the Constitution upheld in the face of autocracy. Indeed, their skills and expertise would prove valuable in our efforts to rebuild the [NEE.GetName] military and navy. Ultimately, the final decision rests with the jury."

 new_england_events.257.d: "Recognising the need for the installation of electrical distribution systems to serve the rural areas of [NEE.GetNameDef], this morning President [NEE.GetLeader] signed Executive Order 7037 into legislation. Also referred to as the Rural Electrification Act of [GetYear], the legislation aims to provide federal loans for the rural areas of the nation. Like the Homestead Act before it that sought to give the common man an "equal chance", President [NEE.GetLeader] expressed that it was his desire to see the descendants of homesteaders have access to electricity - already the norm in the majority of American cities. While some doubt if it is even feasible to bring power to remote areas, the cooperatives working with the Rural Electrification Act have switched to a 7200 volt distribution network to help the transition. The act also has political implications as there is no doubt the American government is aiming to restore relations with the populace with the scars from the civil war still present."

 new_england_events.258.t: "Protests in the South"
 new_england_events.258.d: "The anti-Jim Crow laws passed by Congress have been met by fierce opposition by staunch segregationists, especially in the South. Riled up by individuals such as Mrs. J.E. Andrews of the Women's National Association For the Preservation of the White Race have accused the government and the NAACP of ruining the \"pure white race\" and that white women and girls are under threat from the African-Americans. Their loud clamours and leaflets in the streets have turned into blatant protests, and ever since the bills' implementation, African-Americans have been voicing out constant reports of crimes directed towards them. Despite the efforts of the federal government to erode the poll taxes and grandfather clauses that plague the voting systems of the South, these state and county legislators have promised to their people that Jim Crow will persist.\n\nThese protests have also been supported by remnants of the Longist regime in Louisiana, such as Leander Perez, who have outright refused to accept the government's anti-Jim Crow measures - denouncing them as bills made by \"carpetbaggers, scalawags, and the NAACP to integrate schools.\" One of the most prominent voices for segregation is Theodore Bilbo, a former Longist Senator and open member of the Ku Klux Klan. Denouncing Congress, Bilbo's controversial work Take Your Choice, Separation, or Mongrelisation has found fans within the radical elements of the South. With rhetoric screaming for self-defence and lynching to \"save the white race,\" the protests have only gotten violent, with many saying that it is a repeat of the Red Summer of 1936."

 new_england_events.259.d: "Enough is enough. Declaring that resistance to the new bills would amount to treason, President [NEE.GetLeader] federalised the National Guard - announcing a hardline towards protestors of integration. National Guard units quickly made their way throughout major cities in the South, arresting the rabble-rousers such as Bilbo, Perez, and Andrews. Federal law enforcement conducted a heavy act of suppression across the South, arresting many in white supremacist linked groups such as the Women's National Association for the Preservation of the White Race and the Ku Klux Klan. With much of their leadership behind bars and their organisations shattered, those who have opposed the bill have finally stopped their agitation. Denouncing segregation as \"a powerful venom that poisons the minds of many Americans,\" the President has officially declared that schools must integrate and segregated facilities must come to an end.\n\nThe NAACP and the foreign press have praised the President's actions who have commended President [NEE.GetLeader] for his strong stance against the protests. As federal troops begin to restore order in the southern cities, many acknowledge that the fight against racial hatred is not over yet. There are still reports of individual acts of violence and hate despite the federal crackdown. While the war against racism may not have ended, this was indeed a battle won."

Cities like Atlanta and Jackson have turned violent in the past days with looting rampant and civil disorder everywhere. The South burns vehemently in the flames of racial hatred and the foreign reporters are simply stunned at the chaos of the supposed \"Land of the Free.\"\n\nFinally the President has decided to take executive action. Placing the South under martial law, federal troops marched down into the southern capitals this morning. Some radical Longist remnants took up arms against our forces but in terms of size and numbers, they were no match. The damage has been done however, with many buildings and homes damaged in the chaos. The President's slow inaction has been condemned by not only groups like the NAACP but also the foreign press.

Canada's descent into authoritarianism has led to the United States being the sole bearer of the torch of freedom in the Americas. With that duty comes a great responsibility, to free the western hemisphere from totalitarian governments that are opposed to our values of freedom. To ensure that the countries of the New World remain free from the influence of Berlin and Paris, [NEE.GetNameDef] must take her place as the guardian of the Americas.

In Southeast Asia, the Germans will attempt to keep their little empire of the Pacific while the Land of the Rising Sun greedily looks towards China and our Pacific possessions. In our moment of national disunity, the Japanese brazenly declared our sphere dead and proceeded to seize our Pacific territories. With our military, industrial, and economic strength renewed and reinvigorated; it is time to put a stop to their imperialism.

The New World has always been America's domain, and now that our strength is restored, we can rebuild our presence in the Western Hemisphere. No more shall Europe interfere with the governments of the Americas, and we will not allow radicalism to foster and grow right beneath our eyes.\n\nOn the other hand, we cannot ignore the cries of help from the nations of Asia subjugated to foreign imperialism. The Pacific has long been our duty to protect and we should keep it free from the hands of belligerent nations.

# New Freedman's Bureau

 new_england_events.269.d: "In 1865, under an initiative by then-President Abraham Lincoln during the First American Civil War, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (known commonly as the Freedman's Bureau) was created to aid in the reconstruction of the South. While there is debate as to whether or not the legislation was actually successful, the Bureau effectively was abandoned in 1872.\n\nWith the conclusion of the Second American Civil War, Congress has decided to re-establish the Bureau, keeping the humanitarian spirit of its predecessor while also hoping to resolve the former's failures. The organisation has been officially renamed the \"Bureau of Refugees, Landless, and Orphaned\" - headed by none other than the native New Englander archbishop of Boston, Richard Cushing. A member of the NAACP and well known throughout Boston for his seemingly endless energy and desire for reform, Cushing has been noted for his extraordinary charisma that ties together Boston's Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant communities. In addition to economic and medical aid to those left stricken by the brutality of the Civil War, the newly Bureau also plans to provide land, education, and opportunity for those who lost everything. Not only will the Bureau help with rebuilding broken communities, but the Bureau will also aid in the large torrents of former refugees who fled to Canada and New England during the war. Many of these refugees lost their homes and possessions in the opening chaotic weeks of the war, and the Bureau hopes to compensate them for their properties. Cushing has announced his plans for repurposing former Longist and Syndicalist buildings to create schools, clinics, and new institutions to help heal the broken nation. By extending a hand of grace and charity to the former rebellious states of the Union, the Bureau hopes that in time the wounds and scars of war will finally heal."

However, thanks to the Labor Standards Act passed by Congress, local union leaders around the nation have applauded our efforts to salvage some of the reforms they fought for. While nothing radical like the reforms promised by the leaders of [WCA.GetNameDef], it seems our efforts have borne fruit, with the unions seeing our government in a new light. In time, the industrious efforts of the American people will finally return, and the extreme views of Reed and his cohorts put to rest at all."

Like its predecessor in the Amnesty Act of 1872, the new Amnesty Act clarifies that disqualifications in local office or politics for the former rebels have been removed, allowing the country to reunite once more. President [FROM.GetLeader] has officially signed the bill into law today and has directed district attorneys in charge of prosecutions of the former rebels to discontinue them. While the top leaders of [WCA.GetNameDef] and [APG.GetNameDef] will still be put on trial, many of their former servicemen and lower-ranking officials have been granted the presidential pardon. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, the American colossus has begun to pick herself up after stumbling in the chaos of civil war. The memories and trauma of the war will not quickly fade, and the road to reconstruction will still be a difficult one.

# WW2 Factory Riot

 new_england_events.273.d: "With its main building covering nearly eighty-two acres and over 30 city blocks, the Dodge Chicago Plant was at one time the largest building in the world. Designed by the so-called "architect of Detroit" Albert Kahn and his company, the Dodge Chicago Plant became a hotbed of radicalism during the civil war as it helped churn out weapons, equipment, and vehicles for the WCA war effort. Its innovative design featured an extensive network of tunnels to facilitate foot and supply traffic while also providing shelter from the air raids above.\n\nAfter the war, the factory was moved into government hands and its former labourers employed. These workers had enjoyed extremely liberal conditions and benefits during their so-called revolution. They began to agitate and complain when they saw the former working policies of the WCA repealed and their old managers replaced. What started as an initial protest turned into a deadly strike, frightening the factory owners who had flashbacks of the years before the civil war. They called in local policemen to disperse the strikers, but the strikers only grew in numbers, and soon, the confrontations grew violent, with the strikers seizing tools and crafting homemade weapons to drive out the police. The strikers then barricaded themselves in the giant plant, with the governor of Illinois deciding to use the National Guard to suppress the unrest once and for all. The National Guard had difficulty storming the strikers who used the vast tunnels to hide and harass the guardsmen. As the soldiers breached into the plant, the strikers grew violent making use of their weapons to inflict casualties on the guardsmen. Against the superior firepower and strength of the guardsmen, the strikers found themselves simply outgunned; mass arrests were made of the surviving strike organisers and agitators."

 new_england_events.274.d: "The bloodshed at the Dodge Plant did not go unanswered. Enraged at the casualties of 97 Guardsmen, the National Guard began a brutal suppression of workers all across the Steel Belt. The riot in Chicago had provoked similar outbursts of working-right-related risings, all of which became quickly suppressed. Harsh curfews were enforced on Steel Belt cities, and the region has effectively been placed on martial law, with frequent night patrols roaming the streets in search of disturbances. While the actions of the police and National Guardsmen have attracted controversy among some media outlets, the President has justified the military's intervention in the crisis, arguing that the National Guard only intends to prevent future provocation from radicals and reactionaries alike. As the Steel Belt burns in flames, the rest of America wonders how much longer must the blood be shed before peace and order are finally restored."

Despite the efforts of Reconstruction, the South's resistance to black integration has only grown worse, with segregation at every lunch counter and even water fountains separated.\n\nAs Congress continues to pass laws to federally repeal Jim Crow legislation, their actions have attracted nothing but anger and rage among Southerners heavily resistant against change. Today, white mobs gathered in cities like Birmingham and Montgomery to protest integration and desegregation, with many proclaiming "Segregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow, Segregation Forever." Large numbers of Klansmen, cloaked in their familiar white robes and hoods, have been seen intimidating black families and churches throughout the South. As the South grows increasingly unsteady, the National Guard has been ordered to protect African-Americans fearful for their lives. Protest organisers and ringleaders have been arrested, although many can tell that the white unrest has not grown any weaker."

Birmingham, Alabama — the "Magic City" of the South and once renowned for its modern industrialisation is now associated with a wave of unprecedented terrorism.\n\nAs the South begins to desegregate and ringleaders of the resisting protestors are rounded up, the Ku Klux Klan has turned to their violent ways of terror. Following the end of the war and the nation's effort at desegregation, black families were encouraged to buy houses in formerly segregated white neighbourhoods. The Klan would make nighttime trips to these houses, firing shots and throwing bombs into black homes and, in some cases, even lighting one's door on fire. Due to the near relentless wave of violence, Center Street in Birmingham has been amusingly named by black residents as "Dynamite Hill," with many black residents remarking the violence is reminiscent of the bombing and shelling of the Civil War. The local police in Birmingham have been noted for being extraordinarily late, and their lack of patrolling has led the violence to go on without repercussions. As a result of the chaos, the National Guard has been sent to Birmingham, with guardsmen stationed throughout black neighbourhoods to deter the violence. Nonetheless, despite the terror, some brave black families have chosen to stay put - believing that their tolerance of the attacks will help speed up desegregation."

Violent strikes in the North and terror attacks in the South have become the norm as Longist and Syndicalist terrorists continue to fight their war despite their official surrender. With unrest in major American cities and states, Congress has officially repealed the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.\n\nSigned by then-President Rutherford B. Hayes, the Act limited the power of the Federal Government in the use of federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. The Act was designed to be passed in response to the Federal army occupation of the South during the twelve years of Reconstruction during the Civil War. In a sweeping form of legislation today, Congress has declared that the continued terrorism and violence of the remnant Syndicalist and Longist resistance movements must be crushed at all costs. The Act has officially been dissolved, giving the Federal Government the ability to use the military, air force, and navy to enforce its will. With the Army's tanks and trucks on their way to the major cities of resistance like Birmingham and Chicago, civilians have already begun to voice their concerns as the nation descends into complete martial law."

 new_england_events.279.d: "The military's hand is now fully drawn following the repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act in a significant federal attempt to crush resistance; the army has now focused on a prominent centre of Syndicalist resistance in West Virginia. Coal Mining had flourished in West Virginia during the late 1800s, and by 1917, the coal mining industry accounted for nearly 89,348,000 tonnes of coal. A hotbed of Syndicalist radicalism, areas like Mingo County and the Little Coal River became havens of socialist resistance, with miners and partisans stocking up in ammunition and arms.\n\nThe foggy and misty Appalachian Mountains proved to be a defender's paradise. The miners had access to tunnels and paths that they knew best, striking National Guard units with impact and surprise. Days of sporadic skirmishing and brief encounters led to nothing more than the frustration of the National Guard, although the miners became increasingly outnumbered. Lt. General Thomas J.H. Trapnell and Thomas Francis Hickey planned a coordinated assault involving artillery and air coordination to wipe out the Syndicalist resistance. The Federal Army had intelligence from the air with planes spotting the pockets of resistance in the air, and thus the Federal troops began to shell the Syndicalist resistance to break and weaken the Syndicalist morale. Despite the intense bombardment, the Syndicalists offered considerable resistance, primarily due to their knowledge of the terrain and entrenched positions. Nearly 157 federal troopers would lose their lives in the ensuing operation. However, the Syndicalist efforts would prove futile as their casualties increased and their supplies grew increasingly limited. After a week of intermittent fighting, the last of the miners and partisans began to climb out of their hiding positions, turning in their arms to the federal government."

 new_england_events.280.d: "For weeks, the Klan and remnants of [APG.GetNameDef] had holed themselves in swampy bayous such as the Bayou Corne sinkhole. Nestled among the alligators and the crawfish, these remnants from Long's tyrannical movement still continued to claim to fight for the "true America," and their resistance had become too strong for police and militia to handle.\n\nWith the military given full permission to subdue the last of the rebel resistance, the military command has begun to analyse the marshy terrain in the hopes of launching successful raids to wear down and eventually rid the region of the remaining traitors. Led by the West Point graduate Hamilton H. Howze, the army has decided to execute "Operation Eucalyptus," a coordinated strike of highly manoeuvrable units into the dense and deep Louisiana bayous. A fierce advocate for manoeuvre warfare and speed, Howze believed that the best way to crush the Longist resistance would be through repeated raids in an attempt to gradually weaken and demoralise the rebel remnants. After a week of enduring resistance, the cracks in the Longist defences were beginning to show. Isolated from supplies and reinforcements, their forces were being thinned out with each rapid Federal raid. With the help of the New England dockyards, small, fast, and inexpensive patrol torpedo (PT) boats were brought out to help navigate and scout out the swamps. Following a week of continued fighting in the swamps, the last of the Klansman and Longists offered their unconditional surrender - ending the previous significant remnant efforts to oppose the federal government."

 new_england_events.281.d: "After weeks of intense martial law and suppression of dissent and seditious activities, rebel resistance has been noted to be at an all-time low. The once mass protests have dissolved into smaller and less organised demonstrations, and there have been fewer incidents of terrorist attacks. The major remnant rebel forces have been successfully subdued, with much of their leadership in chains and their weapons captured. As the nation finally begins to heal from the wounds of the great civil war, the military forces needed to maintain the country's occupation have slowly withdrawn. Checkpoints across the country are being taken down and the curfews lifted in many American cities. With the return of state and local governments once more, America finds herself back up after a brief stumble - ready to take on anything that comes her way."

 new_england_events.300.t: "The Ogdensburg Agreement"
 new_england_events.300.d: "This morning the ambassador from [NEE.GetNameDef] brought a request to our foreign office in Ottawa. The [NEE.GetName] government requests that all American land seized by the Entente in 1937 at the outbreak of the Second American Civil War be returned to their control as well as the withdrawal from all Entente forces in American territory. While they have expressed the highest gratitude toward our government for safeguarding them, America finds itself whole again and no longer needs the Entente in American lands. Realising our relationship's importance and value, the American government has proposed a mutual non-aggression pact between our two nations.\n\nWhile the Canadian government can certainly make use of our occupied American territory (and do we trust a war-torn country), the American diplomats have expressed that they would not accept a more protracted Entente occupation. Failure to comply with this will most likely result in a war with our southern neighbour - one we may not possibly afford."
 new_england_events.300.a: "Very well, let the withdrawal begin"

 new_england_events.301.t: "Canada Returns Puerto Rico to the Americans"
 new_england_events.301.d: "This morning, the governor was informed from the Foreign Office that our administration of the island of Puerto Rico has come to an end. During the chaos and conflagration of the Second American Civil War; forces of the Entente occupied the former American territory of Puerto Rico. Administered under our government given our proximity to the islands; the conclusion of the great American conflict has led the [NEE.GetName] government to declare that the territory must be returned to [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. With minimal fanfare; we will announce to the island; the cessation of the occupation and we will honour the arrival of the Americans - with a flag raising ceremony."
 new_england_events.301.a: "It was an honour to safeguard the island."

 new_england_events.302.t: "Canada Returns Puerto Rico to the Americans"
 new_england_events.302.d: "This morning, the Canadian government announced to us that the island territory of Puerto Rico would be promptly returned to the Americans following the conclusion of their civil war. The Entente alliance occupied the island due to the chaos of the Second American Civil War. Following a diplomatic arrangement between [CAN.GetNameDef] and [NEE.GetNameDef], the Americans have made it clear that the territory of Puerto Rico must be returned to the United States at once. The Canadian government has agreed, and already the Entente has begun a withdrawal of our island."
 new_england_events.302.a: "Our occupation was brief but honourable. (Play as Canada)"
 new_england_events.302.b: "We reassert ourselves once more. (Play as [NEE.GetNameDef])"
 new_england_events.302.c: "And we weren't consulted? We shall never submit!"

 new_england_events.303.t: "Canada Returns the Panama Canal to the Americans"
 new_england_events.303.d: "Following negotiations after the Second American Civil War, the Americans have stressed the importance of the return of the Panama Canal. Occupied by the Entente government during the chaos of the war, the American government has petitioned the Entente government to withdraw its forces from Panama. Respecting the terms of the agreement, the [CAN.GetAdjective] government has fully agreed to the request, and the American colours will soon once again fly over the Canal."
 new_england_events.303.a: "Very well, we accept Ottawa's decision."
 new_england_events.303.b: "We shall never submit!"

 new_england_events.304.t: "Results of the Buffalo Conference"
 new_england_events.304.d.return: "The representatives from [CAN.GetNameDef] have agreed to the terms offered by our proficient diplomats. The withdrawal process has begun, and the territories seized by the Entente government will soon be promptly returned to our hands. Both nations have agreed to a mutual non-aggression pact; this is a declaration to the world that the Canadian and American governments will oversee the return of peace, order, and democracy in the New World once more!"
 new_england_events.304.d.partial: "Despite our persistence at the negotiation table, the representatives from [CAN.GetNameDef] have made a counteroffer. Citing Canada and the Entente's desperate need for resources to reclaim the Home Islands, the Canadians have requested that we allow them to retain the territory they seized for the duration of the conflict. While we sympathise with their cause greatly, their prolonged occupation is cause for concern. Shall we allow this temporary lease of American territory, or shall we take a more aggressive stance?"
 new_england_events.304.d.total: "Outrage. No better word sums up the reaction of our representatives after they stormed out of the Buffalo Conference. The arrogant representatives from [CAN.GetNameDef] has rejected our proposal to return American territory in exchange for peace along the 49th parallel. A danger to the freedom of the New World; the imperialist ambitions of the British Empire show no limits, and it is clear that all negotiations have failed. We have no choice but to see their return through the force of arms!"
 new_england_events.304.a: "The Entente needs all the help they can get."
 new_england_events.304.b: "An aggressive stance with [CAN.GetNameDef]!"
 new_england_events.304.c: "Let's back down."
 new_england_events.304.e: "To a prosperous future!"

 new_england_events.305.t: "[NEE.GetNameDefCap] Threatens War over the American Territories"
 new_england_events.305.d: "The envoys from the Buffalo Conference have urgently cabled the Foreign Office in Ottawa to inform the government of the threat of war. It seems that relations are at the breaking point and that all negotiations have failed. Their hurried voices on the other end of the line suggest that the Americans are not making idle threats at this point. Canada finds herself in a precarious position and a war with [NEE.GetNameDef] may not necessarily be in our favour."
 new_england_events.305.a: "We can't afford this. Back down and agree to their terms."
 new_england_events.305.b: "It's a bluff. We'll drive the Yanks back just as we have done before."

 new_england_events.306.t: "The [CAN.GetAdjective] Response"
 new_england_events.306.d.peace: "A feeling of relief was felt across the nation today as the Canadian government has decided to hand over the territories they seized at the outbreak of the Second American Civil War. Recognising our renowned military and economic strength, the Canadian government has stressed that they desire nothing more than restoring peace and democracy in the Americas. While their initial response may have been belligerent, this has been a significant diplomatic victory for our country."
 new_england_events.306.d.war: "Faced with the threat of invasion, the arrogant Canadian government has still refused to hand over the territory they seized. While we do not want to bring our nation to war, we have no choice but to see through the threat we delivered at the end of the Buffalo Conference. With our resurgent military and economic strength, we will deal the British Empire a final crippling blow and see to it the end of their so-called \"empire.\""

Despite the brief return to our independence this morning, the Foreign Office in Ottawa has informed us that their protection over our islands has ended with the restoration of a unified America. While some are willing to embrace the returned status as an American territory, some yearn for an independent Hawaii, free from rule in [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

Yet, instead of promises of mutually assured security, we were met only with outrageous demands.\n\n"
 new_england_events.308.d.end: "Furthermore, they demand the immediate restoration of the \"unlawfully seized\" American oil rights, as well as a thorough demobilisation of our armed forces in exchange for their \"protection\".

While war hawks have requested that we immediately ship supplies and men to protect the Mexican nation from this capitalist imperialism, some dissenting opinions have suggested that war with the Americans may strain our already exhausted resources."

For now, peace reigns between our countries, and democracy has been restored to Mexico."
 new_england_events.311.d.mex_deny: "Despite our nation's best intentions - the Mexican delegates at the Santa Fe Accords have informed us that they will not accept our demands. They will continue to persist in their undemocratic traditions and refuse to return what was ours. As we will have a radical neighbour that seeks nothing more than the weakness and dissolution of our nation, hardliners are asking Congress to declare war on the Mexican government formally. However, moderates are asking us to back down, given that our country may not afford a war at the moment."

While the canal was constructed under American oversight and placed under American control, the civil war in America led Panama to seize control of the canal. With the strength of America reinvigorated, some in our government are pushing for us to return control of the canal to [NEE.GetNameDef] although we can always refuse their demands."

However, today the [685.owner.GetAdjective] ambassador handed us a note from the [685.owner.GetAdjective] government indicating that the government of Panama is willing to part with the Canal peacefully. This is a tremendous moral and diplomatic victory for [NEE.GetNameDef] as we rebuild our strength in the Americas."

It seems that if the [685.owner.GetAdjective] nation does not listen to reason, they will listen to the power of the American army.

As a response to our preservation of democracy, [NEE.GetNameDef] has approached our nation with the prospect of joining the Organisation of American States. However, due to the nature of collective security in the OAS, the Americans have simply asked that we split into our original constituent nations."
 new_england_events.327.d2: "The American collapse led to the destruction of the Monroe Doctrine that held the countries of Latin America together. In that period of instability and unrest, the Central American Republic unified Central America to prevent the nations of Central America from falling into the hands of radicals. With the strength rebuilt; [NEE.GetNameDef] has approached our nation with a position in their alliance. However, they have asked us to split our republic into our original constituent countries and be led by pro-American democratic governments."

Seeing a dramatic improvement in their lives caused by the influx of wealth from the American investors of a liberal nation - the people have started to gather and demand a shift to a democratic government. What had begun as simple, peaceful protests have escalated into further violence as our police cannot handle the growing unrest. While the army has not been called yet, injuries and looting are becoming increasingly frequent. While we had hoped to avoid taking decisive action, the American media has not been helpful, and many nations are condemning our police action and telling us to open up elections. Moderates and liberals in our government are begging our government to negotiate with the protests. However, conservative military members have advocated that we instead install martial law to fully crackdown on the protestors."

The unrest stems from the liberal influence of our investors, who have significantly improved their quality of life. While the demonstrations were initially peaceful, they became more violent due to the aggressive nature of the government's response. Finally, after weeks of unrest, the [FROM.GetName] government has announced a hardline to the protests and has announced their declaration of martial law. This has also escalated to the seizure of American investments as the American economic ties to [FROM.GetNameDef] has been denounced as the reason for the surge in unrest. American businessmen have been forced to flee from the country, and our embassy is also prepared to evacuate."
 new_england_events.332.d2: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has repeatedly stymied American interests in their country. Owing to our aggressive attempts to project economic power in [FROM.GetNameDef], American investors and citizens abroad frequently face persecution, exclusion, and potentially expulsion from the country. Programs ran by the government have spun the populace against us subtly encouraging citizens to \"defend their country\" against our \"scheming hands\" by whatever means are necessary. Following a press leak in which a reporter claimed that one of our businessmen in [FROM.GetNameDef] referred to the nation as a \"backward hive of autocracy and incompetence\", anti-American riots have broken out across the country.

Despite the growing civil unrest, it appears that tact has won the day as the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has bowed to the desire of the people.

We have received news that [NEE.GetNameDef] has officially stated to the world that we are now under their protection.

# PT 109 resuce
 new_england_events.374.t: "A Tale from the Pacific"
 new_england_events.374.dgea: "From its periscope, the submarine U-99 sailing on behalf of the German East Asian Navy, undertaking a reconnaissance mission near German Samoa, spotted an unusual sight. Beached on a deserted island were a group of men and a canoe. Without resorting to headquarters and breaching protocol, the crew of U-99's Kapitänleutnant Otto Kretschmer immediately organised a party, including himself, to investigate. Upon reaching the island, they found that the men were American crewmen from a torpedo boat named PT-109 that had been destroyed in an attack by the Japanese. After ensuring the American crew was fed and clothed, Kretschmer immediately radioed his superiors to ensure they were sent home.\n\nThe commander of PT-109 was none other than the handsome son of the acclaimed New England congressman Joseph P. Kennedy. Lt. John F. Kennedy had been ordered to bring PT-109 to scout and survey Japanese naval movements near German Samoa. However, on a dark and moonless night, their ship was caught off guard and rammed suddenly by a Japanese destroyer - cutting the entire vessel in half. With the wreckage of a crew and two dead crew members, Kennedy gave his men the order to fight or surrender. The brave sailors chose to fight to the end and swam 3.5 miles away from the wreckage of their ship to find safety. The brave lieutenant swam through the water despite an injured back, towing a badly burned crewman with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth. Kennedy made other mile-long swims to hail passing PT boats or search for supplies for his exhausted crew. He and his executive officer then made the long swim with their crew to a nearby island where they found edible coconuts but no freshwater. Thus, Kennedy and a crewmate made a one-hour swim to find supplies, where they found a canoe with drinkable water and food. Two days later, paddling back to his crewmates, they were discovered by and were rescued by U-99, much to their relief.\n\nLt. Kennedy has returned home a hero, although he has continued to thank Otto Kretschmer and the crew of U-99 for their hospitality. He has returned home, hailed as a hero, decorated with the Purple Heart and Silver Star Medal. With his natural charisma, many are wondering if he, too, will continue a career in politics like his father."
 new_england_events.374.dnogea: "A fantastic story of survival, courage, and the American spirit has emerged from the Pacific War - astounding the nation. Native coastwatchers near the Solomon Islands discovered an exhausted and thought to be missing crew on some islands in Samoa. After alerting the local coast watcher and then the PT base on Rendova before bringing the rescued American crew back to safety.\n\nIn a surprise southern thrust, Japanese naval forces pushed towards Samoa and PT crews were sent to scout and report on their movement. This particular crew was commanded by Lt. John Fitzgerald Kennedy son of the acclaimed New Englander politician, and eager to serve his country in the war with Japan. However, on a dark and moonless night, their ship was caught off guard and rammed suddenly by a Japanese destroyer - cutting the entire ship in half.

Paddling back to his crewmates, two days later, they were discovered by the coastwatchers and were rescued by the Navy, much to their relief.\n\nThe brave and selfless act of this congressman's son has not gone unnoticed. Lt. Kennedy has returned home, a hero, and decorated with the Purple Heart and Silver Star Medal. Speaking warmly of his men and not of himself in front of the press, Lt. Kennedy has charmed many with his natural charisma - with some remarking that perhaps he may follow in the path of his father."

Kennedy after the turbulent 1944 election and the scandal that rocked the Democratic party in New England, it would appear that another Kennedy has entered the political sphere - perhaps in a bid to redeem the Kennedy name.\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy, national war hero following his intense tribulation in the Pacific has announced his desire to run for the House of Representatives - representing his home state of Massachusetts. A popular young man, well acknowledged for his warm charisma and his wartime medals - observers and polls indicate that Kennedy will definitely seize this election.

 new_england_events.400.t: "Rebuilding Order in Seattle"
 new_england_events.400.d: "During the height of the Great Depression, the failure of former President Lowden's policies to alleviate the economic crisis led to the creation of \"Lowdenvilles\" in Seattle, Washington. These desolate shanty towns that sprang up to house those who had become homeless due to the Depression reflected the American nation's lack of social safety. Following the victory of democracy in the Second American Civil War, President [NEE.GetLeader] and an entourage, including General Lemuel Shepherd, have arrived in Seattle to assess the damage done by the great civil war and encourage national unity.\n\nThe City of Seattle had become a haven of socialist resistance and sentiment during the early 1900s. One of the largest state affiliates of the Socialist Party of America in the Western States of America, Washington boasted more than 62,000 paid members. When the civil war broke out and [ACC.GetNameDef] seceded, socialist demagogues like Anna Louise Strong helped lead the treacherous Seattle Commune in a seditious uprising against the Union. For days, anarchy and chaos plagued the streets as the city became yet another front in the great war. Constitutionalist troops under General Alexander Vandegrift placed the city under siege, and after a week of heavy street-to-street fighting, the last of the remaining syndicalists surrendered. The orchestrators of the rebellion including Strong were tried and convicted by the Constitutionalist court, all of them receiving imprisonment for their sedition.\n\nEven though the rebellion had been crushed in the early days of the war, the devastation caused by the ensuing battle could still be seen. President [NEE.GetLeader] gave a brief speech thanking the city of Seattle for its loyalty to American democracy and thanked them for their perseverance during the war despite the horrible conditions. [ACC.GetAdjective] General Vandegrift and New England General Shepherd were also present; both men were seen sharing a private talk, perhaps reminiscing their times together in the Marine Corps. The nation they had served in their youth that seemed to collapse had risen back on its feet once more."

 new_england_events.401.t: "President [ACC.GetLeader] Addresses New England"
 new_england_events.401.d: "For a week in Massachusetts, Bostonians celebrated with ticker-tape parades, barbeques, fireworks, and reunions. The national crisis was finally over. The radicals and revolutionaries that threatened to tear apart the fabric of America had been defeated at last. In America's darkest hour, [ACC.GetNameDef] and New England fought side by side as not only Americans but brothers-in-arms.\n\nIn a radio address to the Provisional Government, President [ACC.GetLeader] praised the government in Boston for its speedy economic recovery amidst the Great Depression. He mentioned New England's tactfulness and strength in building up their industrial powerhouse before joining the fray. Above all, he thanked the men and women who helped build the weapons that would end up being sent to [ACC.GetNameDef]. The President's speech was met with praise and approval in newspapers all across New England. The fire that threatened to destroy the soul of the American nation had been quenched by the place where the American country had been born. In a seemingly divine form of irony, once again, the people of New England had begun the fight for freedom."

# Armed Forces Integration
 new_england_events.402.t: "Integration of the Armed Forces"
 new_england_events.402.d: "Side by side, the young men of New England and [ACC.GetNameDef] had fought and died together. From the battles at Chicago, New Orleans, and Denver - young men from states like Rhode Island and California answered the national call of duty to save America in her hour of need. In San Francisco, a joint ceremony was held between the Armed Forces of New England and the Armed Forces of [ACC.GetNameDef] to mark the official integration of both armies. Representing [ACC.GetNameDef] would be General George Marshall and representing the Provisional Government would be General Mark Clark. Friends that had been split apart from the war and had found themselves fighting for the true America were able to embrace each other once more. No longer were they Irish Catholic militia or Nisei Japanese-American volunteers. They are now soldiers of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThe President of [NEE.GetName], [NEE.GetLeader] praised [ACC.GetNameDef] for their early entry into the great civil war. Refusing to accept MacArthur's so-called \"Federal Government,\" they had joined the fight to preserve American democracy from the clutches of a military junta. As New England rebuilt and developed in isolation, [ACC.GetNameDef] fought alone. Like our forefathers did against King George, they had taken up arms against the odds - and against the odds, they succeeded. The nation's reconstruction will be difficult, but both governments pledged to meet in St. Louis to officially reunify the United States of America."

# commitment to Democracy
 new_england_events.403.t: "A Commitment to Democracy"
 new_england_events.403.d: "After much anticipation across New England, President [ACC.GetLeader] had finally arrived in Boston to meet the people of New England in person. In a nationally televised event, he gave a speech thanking the provisional government in front of the City Hall on 45 School Street. The Provisional Government of New England was hastily formed in the spring of 1937 during the national crisis by the aid of the Canadian Government and the Entente. In America's darkest hours as thousands fled from the violence that consumed the country - New England was a bastion of freedom and democracy. New Englanders saw the Entente as the greatest rival towards radicalism and the Canadian government as the bearer of the torch of liberty in the Western Hemisphere. As America became torn apart in the civil war, the people of New England hoped that the nation would be reunited with the Entente's support once more.\n\nHowever, in a move that shocked the government of New England - the Canadian government fell to authoritarianism and the iron rule of the English king. They had cast away the shield of liberty and had become as autocratic as the very revolution that had driven the British into exile - for this [ACC.GetLeader] claimed America owed an unpayable debt. He ended the speech by declaring that [ACC.GetNameDef] and New England governments would begin rebuilding democracy across the nation from sea to shining sea."

A city of paramount strategic importance and value during the Civil War, the city had been heavily damaged during the civil war. However, President [NEE.GetLeader] and President [ACC.GetLeader] believed that the city's location in the middle of the country would serve as a symbolic form of reconciliation. Congressmen from all over New England and congressmen on the West Coast arrived at St. Louis City Hall to discuss the reunification. In a televised broadcast to the world, the two Presidents signed a treaty that officially confirmed the reunification of the United States of America.\n\nAmidst the sunlight beaming from the French-inspired ornamental dormer windows, the governments of New England and [ACC.GetNameDef] agreed to a signed promise directed at the entire American nation. The sister governments petitioned the exhausted American people for peace and unity in the reconstruction. The statement continued by declaring that all Americans are Americans in this challenging period - no matter political beliefs, or the colour of one's skin, or the issue of wealth, all Americans find refuge in the stars and stripes. The future lies not with the past differences that had torn apart the country but rather with shared value and trust in American democracy. In the darkness, amidst the rockets' red glare and the bombs bursting in the air - the banner of American freedom refused to fall. From coast to coast, Lady Liberty's torch would be lit again. The nightmare that consumed the American nation was finally over.\n\nThe national proclamation was read on the radio and found in newspapers nationwide. Many met the statement with approval and praise, although some will continue to resist and terrorise their fellow Americans in their radical beliefs. Nations across the world have reached a mutual conclusion that the colossus of the New World had finally stood back up!\n\nTo cap off the conference, President [ACC.GetLeader] has given a speech praising the conduct of [NEE.GetLeader] in bringing the second American civil war to a successful conclusion.

 new_england_events.451.d: "Today in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, [NEE_Ambassador_name] and an entourage of military and government officials arrived on behalf of [NEE.GetNameDef] government. A crowd gathered in anticipation of the much-awaited speech by the American diplomatic mission in front of the Beaux-Arts adorned embassy on 100 Wellington Street. While the building formerly served as the American legation, events on the rest of the continent have allowed the legation to transition into a full embassy.\n\n[NEE_Ambassador_name_cap] began his speech thanking the Canadian people for its protection and commitment to democracy in the New World. He made it clear that should the United States ever be reunified and rebuilt to its pre-war strength, it would make a great effort to repay America's debt to the Canadian peoples. The speech was made with great appraise by all those present, and it was reported that the British King himself later paid a personal visit to the ambassador. Canadian and New England newspapers spoke warmly of the goodwill mission, with both nations finding themselves drawn closer in their shared goal and dreams of a free world against syndicalism."

While the President of [NEE.GetNameDef] elected to stay home and attend to domestic affairs, the British King, his Exiles, and the Canadian Prime Minister were in attendance.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the government of [NEE.GetName], [NEE_Ambassador_name] spoke warmly of the Canadian government's continued support and recognition of American democracy in the Northeast. He remarked that the changing world order meant that the old world powers could finally have a chance to return home once more. While it will take a while for America to heal and recover from the civil war that has torn the continent apart, the might of a restored United States will gladly support the goals and ambitions of the Entente. In return, the Canadian Prime Minister assured the ambassador that the free world of the Entente would stand behind the government of New England in America's darkest hour. He reiterated Canada's continued recognition of [NEE.GetNameDef] government as a legitimate democratic and that henceforth the ties between the two countries should continue to grow closer."

 new_england_events.453.d: "In the act of goodwill and friendship, [NEE_Ambassador_name] visited the Royal Canadian Army at CFB Picton in Picton, Ontario. He was seen in attendance with Canadian generals such as General Guy Simonds, but he was also seen in deep conversation with generals of the exiles such as Bernard Montgomery.\n\nNonetheless, the highlight of his visit would be his address to the men of the Canadian Army. [NEE_Ambassador_name_cap] thanked the soldiers of Canada directly, praising them for their brave commitment to restoring democracy to Europe and wishing them success on the eventual homecoming. He emphasised that the Canadian military's role in the intervention of 1937 was instrumental in protecting the people of New England from falling into the chaos and destruction that destroyed the American nation. Finally, he concluded that should the day ever come when Canada needed help, American soldiers would be more than willing to risk life and limb for the freedom of the Canadian and British peoples. The ambassador's visit to the Canadian military was received warmly by the upper echelons of the Canadian army and has elicited great approval from the Canadian troops themselves who never expected to have themselves addressed by [NEE_Ambassador_name] himself."

 new_england_events.454.d: "Established in 1904, the Ford Motor Company of Canada, based in Walkerville, Ontario, is a famous American Ford Company subsidiary. The company was initially founded with a $125,000 investment from Henry Ford at the McGregor wagon factory across the Detroit River from his original plant in Dearborn, Michigan. The company had gained all Ford patent rights and selling privileges to all parts of the former British Empire, excluding Great Britain and Ireland. The plant would see Canada's first car "the Model C" wheeled out, and the coming years would see continued production of vehicles for civilian and military use.\n\nTo strengthen American and Canadian business ties, [NEE_Ambassador_name] paid a visit to the Walkerville plant. Escorted by the owner of Ford Canada, the American ambassador was seen strolling through the steamy assembly line and conversing with the assemblers. In a brief speech to the workers, he praised their efficiency and remarked that aside from the United States, the work ethic of the Canadian worker was unparalleled. No wonder why Canada has been able to bounce back from years of economic depression and has turned itself into an industrial giant. The workers gave the ambassador a rambunctious round of applause, and as thanks for the American visit, Ford Canada pledged to send 80 of their Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) trucks in a gesture of goodwill."

The ambassador even had the chance to step inside the Avro bombers, where he could see for himself the durability and strength of Canadian engineering.

 new_england_events.457.d: "Today, [NEE_Ambassador_name] paid a visit to C.D. Howe, the great Canadian businessman, engineer, and politician at his home. Howe himself always had a soft spot for [NEE.GetNameDef]; the Canadian had been born in Massachusetts and had attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A businessman and an engineer, Howe's business expanded into engineering consulting and general contracting, with his firm dominating the grain elevators of the Canadian West.\n\nThe two men discussed how to tighten the business and cordial ties between the two nations. Howe proposed a relatively undeveloped plot of land near Port Arthur, Ontario, that could serve as a building ground for a joint Canadian-American factory. The factory in Canadian lands would be staffed with Canadian and American workers, improving employment in both countries while allowing the two nations to reap the profits. It was also reported that upon meeting one another, both men talked for a long while about the situation in America and Canada's role in the intervention. The two men were seen raising a toast to a new era of North American friendship, perhaps a testament of future days of cooperation to come."

The long queues outside of the soup kitchens are finally becoming a figment of the past and unemployment levels are the lowest they have ever been. As we continue along this path of economic recovery, our government has suggested that we invite industrial experts from our Canadian ally such as Arthur Blaikie Purvis and Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook.\n\nClosely tied to the economy of the former United States, the Canadian economy faced an even more harrowing issue when the German economic crisis on Black Monday further exacerbated Canada's economic woes. However, thanks to the aid of prominent industrialists and economists, the Canadian economy is now on the road to recovery especially with the help of government organised projects and ventures such as labour camps and the IEDC. In order to boost our own economy, let us send out invitations to Canadian industrial experts and businessmen so that we too may emulate Canada's economic recovery."

Not only does the speech hope to reach American civilians and soldiers on the continent who are locked in the brutal civil war but the Montreal conference room featured representatives from the Reichspakt who are eager to hear New England's voice.\n\nIn this broadcasted speech, [NEE_Ambassador_name] declared that no matter how long it may take, the \"American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.\" The ambassador stressed the confidence New England had in its armed forces and that of the Entente in liberating not just America but also the Old World from the red menace. No longer would America be subjected to division. The time had come for New England to reclaim the United States and to liberate the country their forefathers had sacrificed so much for.

 new_england_events.460.d: "The brainchild of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, the Northwest Mounted Police (NWMP), was formed following the passage of the Mounted Police Act in 1873. The forerunner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Northwest Mounted Police force enforced territorial acquisitions of Canada's westward expansion and served alongside forces of the British imperial forces internationally. The Mounted Police received their \"Royal\" title after service in the Second Boer War and merged with the Dominion Police to officially form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This new organisation is charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories of Canada as well as assuming the role of national counterintelligence. As part of its duties, the RCMP has infiltrated political or ethnic groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. In its recent years of operation, the RCMP, in particular, has had to deal with a large number of syndicalist sympathisers and spies that have smuggled their way across the Canadian-US border.\n\nDue to their expertise and experience with strikebreaking - the Government of [ROOT.NEE.GetNameDef] has petitioned the Canadian government for garrison and repression assistance as the armed forces of New England begin the national liberation. In a brief speech to the RCMP, [NEE_Ambassador_name] praised the efficiency and discipline of the RCMP in maintaining order and stability on the Canadian border as the American nation fell into civil war. The speech was met with great applause, and the commissioner of the RCMP assured the ambassador of all the men and equipment from the police force that New England will need."

Both parties have been hard at work churning out campaign messages to convince the people of [NEE.GetNameDef] to vote for their candidate.\n\nIn the Republican camp, the press has been running endless stories of how President Barrows and his cabinet pushed through legislation to get America back on her feet. For nearly a decade, America wallowed under the effects of the Great Depression, but Barrows has led our nation into prosperity! The Great Depression's worst effects are far behind her, thanks to the programs enacted by Barrows. Accordingly, Barrows has promised that his second term will be devoted to balancing the budget now that the Depression is fading while looking to rededicate those resources to better connect the rural regions.\n\nRunning against them, the Democratic camp is quick to call for an increased government. The Square Deal projects' effectiveness under Barrows is commendable, and those initiatives should continue. Charles Hurley and his running mate Peter Gerry have been touring the nation and speaking to those whose lives have been directly impacted by projects such as the Civilian Conservation Corps. They promise a continuation of relief funds and continued funding of programs such as the WPA.\n\nAfter a flurry of activity at the polls; the election results have come back in..."

Large crowds of workers and farmers show up to these speeches supporting the duo responsible for delivering much-needed relief. For over a decade, the political establishment of Lowden and Smith was content to let the market \"fix itself\" instead of stepping in to help the people directly like Green's policies advocated.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Republican camp, business owners and bankers have centred themselves around former New Hampshire governor John Winant. While a Republican, he was active in the Square Deal policies of the Walsh government. He helped serve on the Social Security Board and ensure that the CCC reached full capacity in New Hampshire to ensure relief made it to the people.

Like Barrows before him, Baldwin is a proponent of a balanced budget and an avid opponent of corruption in the workplace.\n\nRising to meet him at the polls is the mayor of Massachusetts, Maurice Tobin. Labour unions have backed Tobin after his advocacy for legislation to prevent racial discrimination in hiring processes.

Both parties have taken great effort to ensure their side makes it into the presidency this year.\n\nThis campaign season has not been kind to the Democratic Party. First, Walsh's reputation was tarnished by the scandal involving his suspected involvement at a brothel and his suspected homosexuality brought into the public light. Nothing to mention of the other syndicalist parties who were involved in the raid on the brothel. Following this event, Walsh agreed to drop his aspirations for a third term and hand them off to Joseph Kennedy Sr. However, this plan turned to nothing in short order as well. Another scandal erupted following James Curley's arrest. Following the investigation, news broke out that showed links between him and Kennedy with the latter purchasing political favours as bribes from the former mayor. With little time to spare, the Democratic hastily nominated Maurice Tobin as their candidate. However, with most of the campaign funding going to clean up their image, many predict a Republican victory.\n\nIn contrast to the chaos of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party seems to be an oasis of calm in the storm. While the Democrats did work wonders to get the country out of the worst of the Great Depression, Raymond Baldwin and Irving Ives are looking more and more appealing as scandals keep rocking the Democratic boat.

He once was energetic and a close friend with the King in Canada and former lord of the admiralty Winston Churchill, Winant is now more content to slink away towards a more depressed state. He has elected not to run for a second term but to nominate Raymond Baldwin in his place. Graciously accepting the offer from his ailing president, Baldwin has campaigned for better protections for veterans and the creation of committees to help oversee the transition of factories back to civilian goods rather than war materiel.\n\nRunning against Baldwin for the Democrats is the ticket of Maurice Tobin and James Farley. Hailed as one of the Square Deal heroes, prospective vice-president James Farley has attracted large crowds of supporters wherever he goes. His guidance helped shape many social programs that reached out to the poor across New England during the Great Depression.

Rising to politics in a longtime Republican district as a Democrat, Walsh proposed increased government responsibility for charity work and the mentally ill and pushed for censorship of the racist film "Birth of a Nation." Indeed, Walsh is a staunch opponent of the racism that pervades American society; in the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he condemned the Ku Klux Klan. A champion of modern labour standards, Walsh has found a robust voting base among the working classes of New England.\n\nNoted for his political populism and seemingly luxurious lifestyle, Walsh served successful terms as Massachusetts's first Irish-Catholic senator. When the great civil war broke out, Walsh quickly ascended to the head of the Democratic Party in New England. A prominent advocate of isolation during the Weltkrieg, Walsh has attracted the annoyance of his Canadian neighbours due to his anti-imperialist views. While Canadian-American ties are ever closer, Walsh's anti-interventionist stances will surely bring conflict between the two nations.\n\nServing alongside President Walsh is none other than former Rhode Island Senator Theodore Green.

The success of his political run convinced him of greater political aspirations, and he ran successfully for governor in the 1936 election. As the nation descended into chaos, the Irish-American governor sought to resolve tensions between Yankee Protestants and Irish-American Catholics. In the wake of the destructive 1938 New England Hurricane, Hurley oversaw the relief and rebuilding efforts for the city of Boston.\n\nNow the newly elected 33rd President of the United States finds himself in a much greater position, the defender of American democracy in the wake of radicals and reactionaries.

His immense wealth painted Harriman as an enemy in the eyes of the Syndicalists during the years leading up to the civil war. During the ensuing chaos, Harriman fled north for the Provisional Government of New England, where he joined the Committee of Canadian-American Relations and helped coordinate the joint war effort between New England and Canada. Through this position, Harriman gained the experience necessary to become the American ambassador to Canada - helping aid in the close relations between the two nations.\n\nReceiving the nomination of the Democratic Party and following his victory in the 1948 election, Harriman has become the 35th President of the United States of America. The new President has a lot of work cut out for him as the full signs of recovery are beginning to show, and the years of reconstruction are finally coming to an end. Serving alongside Harriman will be the former congressman from Massachusetts, John W. McCormack.
