### Characters ###
 AMA_joaquim_de_magalhaes_cardoso_barata: "Joaquim de Magalhães Cardoso Barata"
 AMA_joaquim_de_magalhaes_cardoso_barata_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 2nd, 1888, in Belém, Pará, Empire of Brazil§!\n§YBackground:§! §LJoaquim de Magalhães Cardoso Barata has served with distinction in the Brazilian army for decades, having a long career in the forces. He is however more well known for his multiple tenures as an administrator in the state, as he is the leader of the local military faction in that state that supported São Paulo in the interstate war. His tenures were usually stable, even during election year he often found himself at odds with other major political factions and actions, such as his main rivals in the Sodré family, who accused Barata of voter fraud on multiple occasions, but the political union with Amazonas and other northern states should give him some more room to manoeuvre. As president of Pará, Barata is also commander-in-chief, and his influence with the newly formed military should not be underestimated, for he has taken close attention to the formation of this military force. Having for so long struggled to maintain political control of the region, Barata now finally has Pará marching under the beat of his drum.§!"

 AMA_lauro_nina_sodre_e_silva: "Lauro Nina Sodré e Silva"
 AMA_lauro_nina_sodre_e_silva_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 17th, 1858, in Belém, Pará, Empire of Brazil§!\n§YBackground:§! §LLauro Nina Sodré e Silva had left political behind him after the interstate war, but the current situation of Pará as an independent nation brought him back to the forefront, this time as its head of state, not merely as its governor; the old man is more than just a powerful and veteran politician, but also perhaps the oldest active politician in Pará. Also a military man, like many of the leaders in Brazil during the times of the old republic, he took part in the Vaccine Revolt in Rio, being arrested in the process, and after that, continued his career as a multiple-time representative for his state in that city. While his years may be running out, he is preparing the new republic's political system to stay aligned with his family and allies, while also balancing foreign demands and repairing wartime damage to the vital port infrastructure across the states he now rules over.§!"

 AMA_valdemar_pedrosa: "Valdemar Pedrosa"
 AMA_valdemar_pedrosa_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 29th, 1888, in Manaus, Amazonas, Empire of Brazil§!\n§YBackground:§! §LValdemar is the son of Jônatas de Freitas Pedrosa, a former senator and state president of Amazonas with a famous and divisive legacy in the region. As per usual with members of wealthy political families in Brazil at the time, Valdemar entered law school early and pursued a career in law before officially entering politics, primarily in teaching and administrative positions in the University of Amazonas. His official entry to politics is somewhat recent, and much of it rides in the coattails of his father's political legacy during the Old Republic as the previous structures rapidly shifted as the 1930s began. While now finding himself in a privileged position as head of state, he now faces many challenges as the newly established federal structures are being disputed aggressively by politicians and landowners from Pará and his own home state of Amazonas, while also having to handle pressures by foreign powers for resources on the young republic.§!"

 AMA_alvaro_botelho_maia: "Alvaro Botelho Maia"
 AMA_alvaro_botelho_maia_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LFebrurary 19th, 1893, in Humaitá, Amazonas, United States of Brazil§!\n§YBackground:§! §LÁlvaro Botelho Maia moved while still young to the provincial capital of Manaus to finish his studies, and quickly found himself involved in local newspapers and later followed on into politics, but he is also a poet and a writer in his free time. While his career so far has been a string of relatively unimportant appointed positions in smaller territories of the defunct Brazilian government, his growing frustration of his lack of power to properly reform the northern reaches of the country was immense even before the war, and now he sees himself in a prime position to modernise Amazonas' still young economy, education and political infrastructure. However, being both a reformer and not of a traditional political family puts him in a collision course with powerful landowners and rubber barons, and he will have to spend significant effort to see these changes through even with foreign backing.§!"

 AMA_efigenio_ferreira_de_salles: "Efigênio Ferreira de Salles"
 AMA_efigenio_ferreira_de_salles_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 16th, 1877, in Serro, Minas Gerais, Empire of Brazil§!\n§YBackground:§! §LEfigênio Ferreira de Salles was at the helm of the state of Amazonas at the start of the interstate war, and when the news of the war reached the north, he opted for a 'wait and see' stance, which resulted in him being ousted from office after the rebels successfully ousted president Bernardes on that occasion; since then, he occupied relatively minor positions as a representative and worked as a teacher, his primary job for much of his life. However, the result of the war Brazil found itself in has made his political destiny take another unexpected turn, as he is now the president and head of state of the newly founded republic of Amazonas, a position both powerful and precarious, as his influence in Belém and outside of Amazonas in general is severely limited, especially after so many years out of the upper echelon of the great game. However, his experience, allies in Manaos and foreign backing almost ensure that in any contentious matters, his voice will be the last one heard and the one truly heeded in the young republic.§!"

 AMA_siseno_ramos_sarmento: "Siseno Ramos Sarmento"

### National Focuses ###
 AMA_the_great_riverland: "Land of the Great River"
 AMA_the_great_riverland_desc: "The Amazon is the largest river in the world and the focal point of our new nation - indeed, Belém, our greatest city lies next to its great mouth. Upstream, however, there has always been a lack of political control. We must succeed where Brazil had failed and properly govern the riverland."

 AMA_political_restructurong: "Political Restructuring"
 AMA_political_restructurong_desc: "Our government has inherited severe inefficiency from Brazil. While changing this reality will take time, we must begin the process."

 AMA_tracking_and_exploration: "Trackers and Explorers"
 AMA_tracking_and_exploration_desc: "The Amazon is dense and foreboding, with much of its verdant catacombs unexplored. We should recruit men with experiencing navigating the jungle and pass their knowledge to our armed forces and civilian administration."

 AMA_seize_brazilian_assets: "Seize Southern Assets"
 AMA_seize_brazilian_assets_desc: "Many industries, owned by companies and individuals from the south, continue to pillage our nation for their own gain. This must end - these enterprises must serve our nation."

 AMA_state_protection: "Defence of the State"
 AMA_state_protection_desc: "While in the cities, our new nation has consolidated its control rapidly, the influence of the state dissipates quickly in rural areas. To combat this, we should fund the creation and population of new communities centred around heavily subsidised light industry. These beacons of civilisation shall naturally become small nexuses of governance."

 AMA_land_reorganization: "Land Reorganisation"
 AMA_land_reorganization_desc: "Our new system of land management is insufficient to handle significant expansion. However, the virgin lands which our explorers have mapped cannot sit idle. We must do whatever necessary to administer and distribute these lands."

 AMA_development_program: "Development Programme"

 AMA_prime_directive: "First Contact Policy"
 AMA_prime_directive_desc: "While contact with civilisation may bring some benefit to the most isolated native groups, it also would surely bring a myriad of problems, especially disease and culture destruction. We must institutionalise a pro-active yet socially conscious contact policy."

 AMA_governmental_reform: "Governmental Reform"

 AMA_reach_into_the_jungle: "Reach Into the Jungle"
 AMA_reach_into_the_jungle_desc: "The most remote areas of the Amazon lack many basic governmental services. A letter from the border with Peru may take weeks to reach its intended destination! Let us bring these facets of modernity to every patch of rainforest."

 AMA_belem_manaus_railway: "Belém-Manaos Railway"
 AMA_belem_manaus_railway_desc: "Situated in the centre of the Amazon, despite its considerable population, Manaos is reachable only by riverboat or aircraft, isolating its population.

 AMA_manaus_roraima_railway: "Manaos-Roraima Railway"

 AMA_manaus_rio_branco_railway_desc: "Accessible by rail only from territories not under our control, the Rio Branco, and the Acre region with it, is at risk of slipping from our grasp.

 AMA_manaus_fonte_boa_railway: "Manaos-Fonte Boa Railway"
 AMA_manaus_fonte_boa_railway_desc: "Nearly to the Colombian border, any army advancing from the north would surely sweep through Fonte Boa. We must connect this strategically important city to the rail network."

 AMA_port_of_belem: "The Port of Belém"
 AMA_port_of_belem_desc: "Belém is the largest port for many hundreds of miles and the undisputed gateway to the Amazon. Unfortunately, the city lacks sufficient facilities for our warships. We must not allow our nation to so easily be brought to its knees. A great base must be built."

 AMA_leite_do_pau_desc: "Just a few decades ago, rubber producers set their sights on the Amazon region. With demand for rubber higher than ever, this 'Amazon Rubber Boom' must be replicated. Let us work closely with these producers to see to it."

 AMA_long_rage_flights: "Long Range Flights"
