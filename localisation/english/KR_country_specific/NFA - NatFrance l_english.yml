 NFA_mobilise_population_for_war: "Mobilise Population For War"
 NFA_mobilise_population_for_war_desc: "A deeply unpopular measure, particularly amongst those whose homes or workplaces were affected by the horrors of the Second Weltkreig, if we ever hope to fully liberate the whole of France, difficult choices must be made."
 until_we_complete_PFW_tt: "§gUntil we complete the focus §YPrepare for War with Germany§!, completing this decision will have the following effect:§!\n"

# Seize Morocco #

 NFA_seize_morocco_decisions: "Seizing Moroccan Territories"
 NFA_seize_morocco_decisions_desc: "Since the nineteenth century, we have fostered ambitions on Morocco. Now that the other powers that have a stake there are in turmoil, it is time to take these lands for our own. Vive la France!"
 NFA_seize_real_morocco: "Take back the Moroccan Kingdom!"
 NFA_seize_real_morocco_desc: "The Germans have lost the war in Europe, and it is now our time to strike and take back what was ours!"

# Fight for Influence #

 NFA_fight_for_influence_cat: "The Lion and the Bear"
 NFA_fight_for_influence_cat_desc: "Philippe Pétain and Henri Mordacq, the Lion and the Bear, the man who held at Verdun and the hero of the defence of Arras, two legends of the Great War, two men who despite everything else respect and admire each other, are now opposed in an ever escalating political battle. To emerge victorious from this power struggle, they now scramble to reinforce their influence over our nation.\n\nIn order to win the fight for influence, §CPétain and his government§! must have more influence than §gMordacq and his followers§!. However, seeking influence through §Runscrupulous means§! is a sure-fire way to gain the §Rire of the populace§! who may look unfavourably upon the current regime!\n\n§CPétain's Influence§!: [?Pet_influence]\n§gMordacq's Influence§!: [?Mor_influence]\n§RPétain's Corruption§!: [?Pet_corruption]"

 Invest_Construction: "Invest in Civilian Industry"
 Invest_Construction_desc: "Our industry has managed to reimplement itself in the aftermath of the Exile thanks to the help of the Marshal's government: this has created enormous goodwill towards Pétain among industrials, who know better than anybody that government contracts are the source of much of their prosperity. A few more tactical investments will make sure that goodwill is fostered.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these companies may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."
 Invest_Arms_Factory: "Invest in the Arms Industry"
 Invest_Arms_Factory_desc: "Thanks to important government investments, the arms industry has thrived as readiness for the reconquest of the mainland has been on the mind of every Frenchman since the Exile. However, demand for armament is ever growing, especially considering war with the Commune is around the corner: investing in companies of known loyalists will strike two birds with one stone, helping us deal with the inside and outside enemies.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these companies may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."
 Support_Loyal_Business: "Reward Loyal Companies"
 Support_Loyal_Business_desc: "In an effort to cement our influence, it would be a wise idea to reward the loyalty of civilians staying true to the Marshal's side in these troubled times: a few government contracts here, a construction permit quickly awarded there, some silly judicial matter quietly dropped for others, will ensure the support of much of the industrial class and help convince those still on the fence about supporting us.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these companies may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."
 Back_Newspaper: "Back Loyal Newspaper"
 Back_Newspaper_desc: "The press has proven instrumental in this political struggle, and the support of those loyal to us will not go unnoticed: by quietly awarding funds to a newspaper who has backed our cause, giving access to previously unknown information, or promising an easier time dealing with censorship in the future we can make sure that this paper will continue to help us convince our people of the foolishness of Mordacq.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these newspapers may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."

 Mordacq_takes_to_the_waves: "§RMordacq and the Radio!§!"
 Mordacq_takes_to_the_waves_desc: "The Bear is planning on delivering a speech broadcast to our nation: this could prove to be disastrous, bringing his seditious messages directly to the homes of many of our compatriots: preventing him from speaking on-air would only confirm his rhetoric, instead we must find a way to prevent this speech from having too much impact."
 Mordacq_parade: "§RA Bear on the March§!"
 Mordacq_parade_desc: "Henri Mordacq and his democratic supporters are planning a protest in a major city, hoping to voice their discontentment about the regime that they consider stagnant and corrupt. If they are joined by too many people, this could prove to be a bad blow to the government, giving the illusion that support for the Bear is widespread and thus making many more fall into his grasps: something must be done."
 Mordacqs_Speech: "§RMordacq's Big Speech§!"
 Mordacqs_Speech_desc: "Mordacq will give a speech in front of a large audience soon, which could bring more people to his side. The government is divided on how to properly respond to this, some arguing that the debate should just run its course, others proposing that the Marshal could give a speech on the same day, in a close location: either way, a choice must be made."
 Mordacq_In_The_Barracks: "§RWhispers in the Great Mute§!"
 Mordacq_In_The_Barracks_desc: "The political turmoil is slowly making its way to the heart of the regime, the armed forces, usually called 'la Grande Muette', the Great Mute, for its restraint from participating in the political life of the Republic. If there was one place where democratic drivel must not take root, it's there: thankfully even the humblest infantryman is still full of respect for the hero of Verdun, but dissident literature has recently been found in barracks and officer loungers: something must be done."

 NFA_Call_For_Moral_Order: "Call for Moral Order"
 NFA_Call_For_Moral_Order_desc: "As outrageous allegations of corruption have begun circulating, the Marshal must take a stand: he will take to the airwaves to call our citizens to act in an exemplary manner in these difficult times and denounce any accusations against the government as mere propaganda spread by syndicalist agents."
 NFA_Make_Corruption_Crime: "Fight Corruption"
 NFA_Make_Corruption_Crime_desc: "To prove to our people that the Marshal is blameless in the recently surfaced corruption scandals, we will start a large scale anti-corruption campaign at all levels of society, encouraging our citizens to denounce any corrupt official they might have witnessed or fallen victim to. This is a titanic effort, but it will be worth it."
 NFA_Scapegoats: "Creative Ways to Fight Corruption"
 NFA_Scapegoats_desc: "Even our most earnest efforts at fighting corruption has not given enough results to satisfy our people, and as such we might have to become laxer in finding proof of alleged corruption or be more proactive in getting confessions from suspected individuals. They probably did something wrong, or they might be Communard agents, or something else: who cares, really?"

# AF trials Decisions #

 NFA_decision_AF_trials_cat: "Deal with the Republican Remnants"
 NFA_decision_AF_trials_cat_desc: "At last, we have taken down the Republic. And work to get rid of her pernicious influence on our great nation is now underway. However, there are still some who believe the 'Gueuse' is something worth defending: as long as there are remnants of republican influence, we cannot truly get to work to reform France. As such, a purge of the French body is necessary.\n\nFinishing these decisions will remove the §YRepublican Remnants§! idea and will give another idea depending on your choices."
 NFA_Public_Humiliation: "Public Humiliation of Republicans"
 NFA_Public_Humiliation_desc: "For minor offenders, such as journalists who eagerly defended the Republic or supported the parades, or unjust critics of de Gaulle's government, a more educational approach will suffice. They will be forced to publicly disavow their previous writings and the Gueuse, swear fidelity to the new government, and then be sent safely on their way."
 NFA_Arrest_Republican_Leaders: "Arrest their Politicians"
 NFA_Arrest_Republican_Leaders_desc: "Many politicians tacitly supported the 'paradeurs', merely waiting for the right moment to strike against the Maréchal government, to plunge us even deeper into republican mediocrity. Many supporters of Mordacq have already been arrested, while other parliamentarians seem increasingly upset with de Gaulle's government. A thorough investigation will help us discern those who may still hope for the Republic to endure."
 NFA_Cleanse_the_Police: "Clean up the Ranks of the Police"
 NFA_Cleanse_the_Police_desc: "On the fateful day of the last parade, some police officers tasked with keeping order joined the protestors as the day turned bloody. This might be indicative of a deeper rot in the public function that we thought previously, and an investigation into our police force might reveal unsavoury secrets."
 NFA_Purge_the_Military: "Purge the Military"
 NFA_Purge_the_Military_desc: "The military, the supposed 'Great Mute' made far too much noise in recent months. Though some of our men were among the early 'paradeurs', it's sadly clear that some men were eager supporters of Mordacq, and might not be reliable as officers in the armies of our King. The Army has traditionally been a reactionary bastion under the Gueuse, and it should stay that way. A thorough investigation will take place, and anyone suspicious will have to be questioned, rifleman or general."
 NFA_Those_Who_Slither: "Those Who Slither in the Dark"
 NFA_Those_Who_Slither_desc: "There is one last place where we haven't looked for potential traitors: the Deuxième Bureau, our intelligence office. Between Mordacq's escape, and the democratic camp seemingly always knowing our next move, we know there is a mole, but so far haven't been able to figure out who it is. We will have to act in utmost secrecy to finally trap the source of our woes."

# Colonial Decisions #

 NFA_fate_of_french_africa_cat: "Fate of French Africa"
 NFA_fate_of_french_africa_cat_desc: "For too long the colonies of France have been seen as little more than land and people to be exploited. It is our sacred duty to reach out to and uplift our fellow brothers and sisters. We shall bring the light of Christianity and civilisation to the natives who have stumbled in the darkness for too long!"

 NFA_transahara_cat: "Trans-Sahara Railway"
 NFA_transahara_cat_desc: "What remains of France is effectively split into two parts. Algeria and Tunisia are isolated from French West Africa by the vast expanse of the Saharan Desert. A journey by foot takes over two months of solid marching. This is unacceptable!\n\nWhile for now we can ship supplies, men, and resources through the Atlantic, this arrangement would be made difficult to impossible if a future enemy were to heavily patrol the Atlantic or even worse, close the Strait of Gibraltar to our ships. We must not allow anyone to exploit our current condition! If we finish this project, we will also be able to show the world that France is still on par with the great nations of the globe and is to be respected."

 NFA_rebuild_legitimacy_cat_desc: "After two decades, the fires of revolution have finally been extinguished, and France is once again at peace. However, our people remain deeply divided: some welcome us as liberators, others lament the fall of the Commune, and most are simply in shock, exhausted by the war, their lives upended for the second time in a generation. We have reconquered the 'métropole', and it will now be an immense effort to conquer the hearts and minds of our countrymen.\n\nFully coring the 'Métropole' will remove the §RLingering Communard Influence§! national spirit.\n\nTo fully secure our hold back over the métropole we must rebuild our image in the eyes of the people who have seen us depicted as demons for the last twenty years.

Of course, it is impossible to erase the past and some things will never be undone, and as such we will keep the good, tear down the bad, bring justice to those who deserve it, and ensure that never again our people are tempted by syndicalism.

The civil war ravaged our nation turning buildings into debris and leaving the countryside ravaged with the horrors of modern warfare.

While many businesses and industries that fled during the civil war have begun relocating back into the 'métropole', several, however, have decided to stay where they are.

A patriot and pious Catholic, he remained loyal to the government as the revolution broke out.

He was among those who actively defended a return to normal democratic life following the bid of Marshal Pétain for power but quickly found himself somewhat isolated.

There was born his speciality: advocacy for aeronautical development, and precise technical knowledge. Indeed, Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British.

By 1914, Philippe Pétain was on his way towards retirement before the Great War destroyed any hope of that. From the early days of the War, he distinguished himself as a capable and charismatic leader and quickly shot up the ranks, replacing officers who had failed before him. Then came Verdun, where he issued his iconic order: 'Be strong, we'll get 'em!', granting him national fame. His care for proper logistics and morale contributed heavily to the victory, and from then on he was 'the Lion of Verdun'. Having earned the respect of the many men that served under him, he was able to restore order during the mutinous mood of 1916, and stabilise the front in 1918. His ideas and presence on the field prevented a total rout but was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nGiven the honorary rank of Marshal before going into semi-retirement, he remained silent as the Republic descended into parliamentary chaos. But in 1926, supported by veterans, he stepped in, strong-armed the Parliament into being elected president and declared a state of emergency. Seen as an apolitical, unifying figure, this move was welcomed by many. Since then, the Marshal has worked tirelessly to prepare France for the inevitable conflict ahead.

 NFA_charles_de_gaulle_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 22nd, 1890, in Lille, Nord, French Republic\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born in a well-off, Catholic, royalist family, Charles de Gaulle was raised with a taste for hard work, discipline, and profound love for France. At the age of 15, he wrote a story starring a 'General de Gaulle' leading French troops to victory against Germany, avenging the loss of 1870: he has spent his whole life working towards making this dream a reality. An average but hard-working student, he was well-liked by his peers, earning the nickname 'the Rooster' for his capacity to assert his authority. He graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy before joining the ranks of the Army as an officer, under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. There he would become his lifelong protégé, serving under Pétain at Verdun, where he was wounded and captured by the Germans. Escaping captivity later on in the War, he became a national symbol of resistance against the aggression of the Boches.\n\nWith the Defeat and Exile, he became a renowned military theorist and lecturer, remaining close to Pétain and becoming the leader of the 'Young Guard', a clique of younger officers deeply loyal to the Marshal and favouring the military reform ideas of de Gaulle. At the same time, witnessing the parliamentary chaos of the early exile, he became further convinced by the arguments of the Action Française, coming to believe that for France to be reborn, the Republic had to be sacrificed. As such, he entirely supported the initiative of Marshal Pétain to seize power, hoping that in time his mentor too would see the truth in the AF's arguments, and would abolish the Gueuse. A decade later, this hasn't happened, but de Gaulle remains hopeful that as he grows in influence, he will be able to restore the monarchy before freeing the nation from the Anti-France."

 NFA_jean_iii_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 4th, 1874, in Paris, Seine, French Republic\n§YPolitical Career:§! Jean d'Orléans was for long the picture of aristocratic aloofness, far down the line of succession of the House of France. Barred from service in the French armed forces, he joined the Danish Army for some time, as King Valdemar was his brother-in-law, before eventually settling in Morocco hoping to promote French interests in the region. The Great War would, however, transform him: once again barred from joining the armies of the Republic, he joined the Medical Service of the Red Cross, transforming his French château into a hospital and personally taking care of the wounded. Though with initially little interest in politics, the Defeat and break out of the Revolution would bring him closer to the Action Française. In 1924, following the death of his cousin Philippe d'Orléans, he was acclaimed by royalists as the rightful pretender to the throne of France. In exile in now Spanish Morocco, he would continue the cooperation with the Integralists started by his predecessors. Royalist efforts were now entirely concentrated around the AF, particularly as the Catholic hierarchy went past their issues with the movement, deeply shocked by the anticlerical violence of the Revolution. In 1933, he issued a manifesto calling for a 'royal government' to save France, instead of a 'government of parties', a clear shot at Pétain's regime: this would further enhance his political profile in a France-in-exile where the prestige of the Republic was at its lowest and the Marshal's junta was rapidly losing support.\n\nWith the triumph of Charles de Gaulle against democratic and reformist forces, few were surprised that the new head of state called for a restoration of the monarchy. King Jean III now leads France as it struggles to purge the remnants of the Republic from the nation, and prepares her, the Eldest Daughter of the Church, to the holiest of struggles, a crusade to reconquer the métropole from the Reds."

Soon, however, he would be with his father in his château-hospital, being exposed to the horrors of the War, before having to flee from the wrath of the revolutionaries. This incident would prove deeply traumatic for Henri, sowing the seeds of a later political awakening. Back in Morocco, he was tutored by the best European tutors, who would introduce him to Integralist thought, which resonated deeply with the youth: not just in its deeply reactionary rhetoric, but most particularly in its advocacy of strict adherence to the Social Doctrine of the Church and economic reform along with corporatist thought. Furthering his studies in Belgium, he discovered for the first time the crowded housing, poor working conditions and terrible anonymity of the lives of the European working poor, as he was attending to their needs as part of Catholic charity efforts. When his father became the head of the House of France in 1924, he became its Dauphin, immediately surrounded by advisors who sought to shape the young man into a worthy King of France. As heir presumptive, now banned from France, the dashing Dauphin nevertheless fully dedicated himself to the royalist cause, working closely with the Action Française despite his personal enmity towards Charles Maurras, as he could recognise that the growing movement was the best chance for restoration of the monarchy. His marriage to his cousin Isabelle de Orléans e Bragança in 1931, and the birth of their son Henri in 1933 created further enthusiasm among royalists: the future of the House of France secured.\n\nOften making discreet trips across the border from Morocco to meet with royalist leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Henri was instrumental in the struggle that led to the restoration of the monarchy. In the early years of the renewed kingdom, he assisted his ageing father in every way and was often seen as the real power behind the throne, attempting to outmanoeuvre the Action Française about as often as he worked with them. Now in power, King Henri hopes to continue the rebirth of France, to build a monarchy that will last for another thousand years."

#Initial Ideas

 NFA_anti_communard: "Anti-Communard"
 NFA_anti_communard_desc: "After our defeat in the Great War, the Reds rose up and abolished our cherished Republic. Thankfully, many of the most important figures of the Republic have retreated to Algeria where they organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"

 NFA_native_unrest_2: "L'Indigénat"
 NFA_native_unrest_2_desc: "The various laws and regulations of the 'Indigénat' system (literally, 'indigenous') remain firmly in place. Never fully codified and thus particularly easy to abuse, imposed on the native populations of the empire, they enshrine their inferior legal status despite them being technically French citizens. Collective punishment, a parallel justice system, forced labour and service in the armed forces, enforced by native elites under the guise of modernisation and spread of civilisation: to say that the Indigénat has created resentment would be an understatement. However it has proved to be a sure source of labour for the colonial effort and is supported by many prominent voices in government who argue that maintaining this status quo is necessary to prepare for the Reconquest."

 NFA_internal_unrest: "Internal Unrest"
 NFA_internal_unrest_desc: "Years of inaction and political stagnation have caused many elements within the Army and the population to become radicalised and lose faith in the current regime. Although it is suppressed, contestation is slowly but surely growing within the French Republic."

#Colonial Ideas

 NFA_native_unrest_1: "L'Indigénat"
 NFA_native_unrest_1_desc: "The 'Indigénat' is a cornerstone of the empire, that allows us to extract as many resources as possible out of Africa. It must not be dissolved."
 NFA_native_unrest_3: "L'Indigénat"
 NFA_native_unrest_3_desc: "While the 'Indigénat' has provided beneficial labour for Europeans in the past, we must look towards reforming it so that the distinction between European and African is less pronounced."
 NFA_native_unrest_4: "L'Indigénat"
 NFA_native_unrest_4_desc: "While the 'Indigénat' has provided beneficial labour for Europeans in the past, we must look towards reforming it so that the distinction between European and African is less pronounced."

 NFA_recent_revolt: "Recent African Revolt"
 NFA_recent_revolt_desc: "In the aftermath of the brief uprising in French Soudan following the poor harvest in the autumn of 1935, additional resources have been allocated to pacify the colonies and ensure that another such uprising is to be avoided."

 NFA_small_native_revolt: "Minor African Revolt"
 NFA_small_native_revolt_desc: "A small scale revolt has broken out inside of our territory. Fortunately for us, a policy of divide and conquer means that the forces opposing us are weak and disorganised. In order to keep our prestige intact, we will handle this ourselves!\n\n§gIf more than three colonies revolt against our rule, this National Spirit will invalidate and we will be able to call in the rest of the alliance.§!"
 NFA_revolts_getting_out_of_hand: "With the situation in Africa getting out of control, we must swallow our pride and accept the help of our allies if we wish to survive!"

All across [NFA.GetNameDef], fanatics have taken to the streets to commit violence upon Freemasons, Protestants, Jews and Metics.

##Second Political Trees Ideas

#AF

 NATFRA_Return_Monarch_1_idea: "A Returning Monarch"
 NATFRA_Return_Monarch_1_idea_desc: "The France that we have returned to is not the one that we left behind decades ago. The Communard government has drilled years of propaganda into the peoples' heads blinding them to who built France into the country she is today! The monarchy built France in days past, and now the monarchy will rebuild France!"
 NATFRA_Cercle_Proudhon_1_idea: "Cercle Proudhon"
 NATFRA_Cercle_Proudhon_1_idea_desc: "The Cercle Proudhon, a think-tank made up of pre-war national-syndicalist leaders is now working with the Crown to help our people understand that national integralism and the King are the true way to fulfil the destiny of France."

 NATFRA_Province_Parliament_idea_desc: "The 1789 Revolution had stripped away the autonomy of the French provinces, denying their rights, privileges, and local identities.

 NATFRA_Social_Doctrine_idea: "Enforced Social Doctrine"
 NATFRA_Social_Doctrine_idea_desc: "The Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church demands that the state and the faithful ensure human dignity. By enforcing it, the King is not only showing his personal piety and leading our long-suffering people towards holier lives, but also making sure that they are not tempted ever again by godless socialism."
 NATFRA_Integral_Monarch_idea: "An Integral Monarch"
 NATFRA_Integral_Monarch_idea_desc: "Much work remains to be done, it will take years to undo the damage done by the revolutions, but we are finally on the right track. France is once again led by a pious monarch, who has restored the Pays Réel and is ready to guide us towards further glory. France is no longer held down by the Gueuse or the Reds: the rightful Sacramental Kingdom is reborn."

#Redressement

 NATFRA_Nat_Revita_1_idea: "National Revitalisation"
 NATFRA_Nat_Revita_1_idea_desc: "The Redressement Français, an apolitical group of patriotic, reform-minded industrials and intellectuals have proved an invaluable help for the Marshal when he needed to secure his hold on the exiled France.

 NATFRA_New_Politics_1_idea: "New Politics"
 NATFRA_New_Politics_1_idea_desc: "The Third Republic was weak, divided by petty party dynamics and personal interests. The future of French politics must be free from parties and the mediocrity of the politically ambitious. Thanks to deep reform, France will have a new, efficient, virtuous and competent political and electoral system, most capable of taking on the arduous task at hand."
 NATFRA_Red_Virus_idea: "Dismantle The Red Virus"
 NATFRA_Red_Virus_idea_desc: "Decades of syndicalist and borderline socialist administration of France has destroyed her economic strength and rotten the very mind of our populace, who sheepishly believe in never ending state intervention.

 NATFRA_Admin_Reorg_1_idea: "Administrative Reorganisation"
 NATFRA_Admin_Reorg_1_idea_desc: "Our administration was infamously bloated, weighing down on the whole of French society and hampering enterprise. This is the opportunity to undertake a deep reform of the system to make it more streamlined, rational, efficient, productive."
 NATFRA_Technocrat_State_idea: "A Technocratic State"
 NATFRA_Technocrat_State_idea_desc: "From the ashes is rising a new France, a France thinking forward and moving forward.

 NATFRA_Comite_du_Salut_National_desc: "Henri Mordacq has formed with representatives from the democratic forces as well as the armed forces a Committee of National Salvation, a transitional authority before full restoration of democracy: indeed, we cannot allow our nation to be divided in this critical time, as the hour of reconquest grows ever closer."
 NATFRA_Commisariat_au_Plan: "Commissariat Général au Plan"
 NATFRA_Commisariat_au_Plan_desc: "To ensure that the home-front is perfectly well organised for the coming national effort, a commission made up of civilians and military men has been created to plan and coordinate the various initiatives for war readiness, the mobilisation of all the nation's resources towards our sacred duty."
 NATFRA_War_Credits: "War Credits"
 NATFRA_War_Credits_desc: "There is a popular saying: 'l'argent est le nerf de la guerre', 'money is the sinews of war': indeed, the state must invest all that it can into the war effort and entice our people, rich or poor, to do the same, through war bonds and private investments. Our people must understand that this is after all a last ditch effort, and the full, enthusiastic participation of all is necessary."
 NATFRA_Army_Supervision: "Army Supervision"
 NATFRA_Army_Supervision_desc: "The Committee of National Salvation is a common effort between civilians and the armed forces, but who could better understand the needs of our armies than themselves?

 NATFRA_Aim_For_SelfSustainability_desc: "Though our allies in the Entente have assured us of their full support, we cannot simply hope for the best and rely on their generosity: everything must be done so that France can fully equip its forces using its own resources.

 NATFRA_Dam_Construction: "Dam Construction"
 NATFRA_Dam_Construction_desc: "Our access to coal is limited, and oil must be saved for the armed forces: to make sure our people and industries have access to power, we will greatly invest in hydroelectric power.

 NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates: "War in our Plates"
 NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates_desc: "All resources must be diverted towards the armed forces, for the liberation of France. This includes food, as before the war even starts we must create vast stockpiles of non-perishables goods: no soldier can fight on an empty stomach. As such, a gradual rationing of essential goods will be implemented."
 NATFRA_Policy_and_Strategy: "Policy and Strategy"
 NATFRA_Policy_and_Strategy_desc: "Many of our Members of Parliament and state officials have some military experience, France is after all a nation of citizen-soldiers. However, they need to fully understand the stakes of the effort that is being asked of us all: frequent reports from the armed forces, as well as briefings on strategy and logistics, will ensure they have the tools to best serve the nation."
 NATFRA_Our_Morale_Forces: "Our Moral Forces"
 NATFRA_Our_Morale_Forces_desc: "Unfortunately, towards the end of the Great War many soldiers felt betrayed by their commanders and their government, leading some to even rebel and embrace socialism. To prevent such a situation from happening again, a new department has been formed, entirely dedicated to keeping morale high and making sure even the lowest of the infantrymen knows exactly why he fights."
 NATFRA_Militarise_Society: "Militarise Society"
 NATFRA_Militarise_Society_desc: "Since 1789, France has been a nation of citizens-soldiers, and military service is required of all men. We must draw on this tradition, on the 'levée en masse' that saved the Republic when it was surrounded by tyrants and facing insurrection at home: strict discipline, respect of hierarchy and full mobilisation is to be expected of all our citizens."
 NATFRA_Time_for_Action: "Time for Action!"
 NATFRA_Time_for_Action_desc: "We can't afford the stagnancy of the Pétain regime, the Comité will have to take decisive action to ensure we are ready for our sacred duty. However, unlike the byzantine junta, we will strive for transparency and utter efficiency, keeping our people informed of what is to, and must, be done."
 NATFRA_Extended_Powers: "Extended Powers"
 NATFRA_Extended_Powers_desc: "Now is not the time for petty disagreements and personal ambitions to hamper our efforts: the Committee has been granted a wide mandate by the representatives of the people to do what must be done for France's salvation, and we intend to take full advantage of it. Rule by decree and bypassing long parliamentary sessions for now, yes, but to ensure a future for democracy and France's salvation."
 NATFRA_Same_Blood_Tax_For_Everyone: "Same Blood Tax For Everyone"
 NATFRA_Same_Blood_Tax_For_Everyone_desc: "Conscription is an old and proud institution in France, something few could escape. However, these few exceptions, no matter small their number, created a narrative of elites being affected to easier duty for made-up medical reasons; of outright draft-dodgers: this ends now, we will fiercely combat any loophole so that our men know that each and everyone of them can count on their fellow citizens."
 NATFRA_Salux_Patriae_Suprema_Lex_Esto: "Salus Patriae Suprema Lex Esto"
 NATFRA_Salux_Patriae_Suprema_Lex_Esto_desc: "'The Salvation of the Nation is the Supreme Law': if we were to fail in our sacred mission to retake our homeland, this would be the end of the Republic, the end of France. This cannot be allowed. Our nation now finally, truly united is ready to endure any and all sacrifices for the salvation of France, the highest priority of any true Frenchman."
 NATFRA_Civilian_Heroism: "Civilian Heroism"
 NATFRA_Civilian_Heroism_desc: "Not everyone can be a soldier: some are too old or work critical jobs, some are wounded veterans of the Great War, some are still too young, some are even women! But this does not mean that they cannot serve France, and we must officially recognise their efforts on the home-front, as after all without them nothing could be done."
 NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity: "Rewards for Productivity"
 NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity_desc: "In line with our effort of recognition of home-front, a system of rewards for exemplary productivity is being rolled out, starting with vouchers for better access to rations and bonus pay for exceeding quotas, all the way to medals and national recognition for exceptional workers: those on the home front might not shed blood for France, but sweat and tears are a worthy sacrifice to the Patrie."
 NATFRA_Devoir_France_Devouement: "Devoir, France, Dévouement"
 NATFRA_Devoir_France_Devouement_desc: "Duty, France, Dedication, these three words must be the focus of every single one of our citizens, in complement of the traditional Republican motto of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. To finally be able to once again proudly proclaim the latter in the métropole, we must focus for now on the former."
 NATFRA_Devoir_Idea_tt: "Combine and upgrade the §Y$NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates_idea$§! and §Y$NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity_idea$§! national spirits into"
 NATFRA_National_Narrative: "National Narrative"
 NATFRA_National_Narrative_desc: "The Republic had conquered her own people through education: from our ancestors the Gauls, through the kings of the Middle Ages, to revolution, the destiny of France was clear: the creation of an enlightened republic, a shining beacon of liberty, equality and fraternity. Now one more chapter of this narrative must be written, together, thanks to our efforts: the reconquest of the métropole."

 NFA_Full_Infra_tt: "No more Infrastructure can be built in Algeria, Corsica, and Oran"

# Redressement #

 NATFRA_Revolution_Nationale: "Révolution Nationale"
 NATFRA_Revolution_Nationale_desc: "To the surprise of many, Pétain has held on to power thanks to swift help by the 'French Revival'. Democrats and reactionaries thought they could outmanoeuvre the Lion of Verdun and destroy France at this critical hour: they have been proved wrong, and now Pétain and the Redressement are free to implement the reforms needed for us to retake our home."
 NATFRA_Give_Petain_ful_powers: "Give Pétain Full Powers"
 NATFRA_Give_Petain_ful_powers_desc: "Pétain's government has always attempted to maintain the illusion of normalcy, and had to compose with the differing sensibilities of our people. To finally let him truly carry out the reforms France needs, parliament will convey one last time to give him full powers, particularly constitutional powers, before voting to dissolve itself until the situation is stable enough."
 NATFRA_Control_all_the_newspapers: "Control all the Newspapers"
 NATFRA_Control_all_the_newspapers_desc: "The Mordacq crisis has proved that for too long the government has left factious and unpatriotic elements in control of the press: with careful control of what is allowed to be published and careful screening of journalists, we will make sure that our people are properly informed."
 NATFRA_Rally_Nationalists: "Rally the Nationalists"
 NATFRA_Rally_Nationalists_desc: "The new regime has to prove itself to the most ardent nationalists, as many fear that it will simply perpetuate the stagnancy of the previous years: we will reach out to the most prominent patriotic voices to reassure them that the Marshal, now finally in full control, is and has always been the right choice for France, hopefully leading to a surge of volunteers to reclaim the Métropole."
 NATFRA_Crush_the_Dissent: "Crush Dissent"
 NATFRA_Crush_the_Dissent_desc: "Though pro-Mordacq forces have been defeated and many now see that Pétain will lead us to victory, the Lion still faces dissent on all sides: democrats, royalists, even former loyalists who fear the influence the Redressement National has on the Marshal, uncertain of how much power he truly holds. By now, we can't consider these people simply concerned citizens: they will be treated as traitors."
 NATFRA_Replace_the_Constitution: "Replace the Constitution"
 NATFRA_Replace_the_Constitution_desc: "A new constitution has been drafted by the Marshal's government, evidently strongly influenced by the National Revival's theories. Overhauling the decadent parliamentary democracy, enshrining technocratic and corporatist elements, this constitution grants near unlimited power to the 'Head of the French State': Philippe Pétain."
 NFA_rename_french_state: "The country will be renamed 'French State'"
 NATFRA_Order_and_Discipline: "Order and Discipline"
 NATFRA_Order_and_Discipline_desc: "Sadly, we must recognise that the Army once so loyal to the Lion has been one of the sources of the recent crisis, as men foolishly followed Mordacq. As the backbone of the regime, a thorough effort to root out agitators, reward loyalists and reinstate the strictest of discipline will be made. The war of reconquest looms, we cannot afford instability within the armed forces."
 NATFRA_Notre_Grand_Pere_a_Tous: "Notre Grand-Père à Tous"
 NATFRA_Notre_Grand_Pere_a_Tous_desc: "Philippe Pétain, the Lion of Verdun, is a man who gives himself entirely to France and her people, like a caring patriarch, firm but loving, experienced and ready to make all the sacrifices for his family. The Marshal, who has led us through the storm of the exile, will continue to do so until our patrie is reborn, and the French nation finally truly united behind him."
 NATFRA_Redressement_Francais: "Redressement Français"
 NATFRA_Redressement_Francais_desc: "The French Resurgence group has proved an invaluable help to the Marshal in managing the recent crisis, and they have by now well earned the favours of Pétain, who has appointed these most competent men to the positions of influences needed to implement their reform efforts, thanks to which France will no doubt be led to victory."
 NATFRA_Economic_Reform: "Economic Reforms"
 NATFRA_Economic_Reform_desc: "France has always badly managed her economy, letting political passions control much of economic policy. The State must rebuild a trusting relationship with Capital, create advisory commissions of industrialists, shrink the bureaucracy, reform our fiscality, protect property, and once and for all stop its interference in a field it has proved again and again it simply does not understand."
 NATFRA_Gives_Back_Companies: "Give Back Companies"
 NATFRA_Gives_Back_Companies_desc: "To deal with the titanic war effort of the Great War, the government was forced to nationalise many companies, and often managed them incredibly badly. Though the Pétain regime has been very supportive of the Exiles in their implementation in Algeria, it has also often employed these barbarous tactics, with little care for property rights or efficiency: it's time to right these wrongs."
 NATFRA_Class_Collaboration: "Class Collaboration"
 NATFRA_Class_Collaboration_desc: "French political discourse has often veered into unproductive discourse blaming the rich or the indigent for one societal ill or another: fertile ground for socialist agitation. But in the end, we are all French, united by our burning desire to free our countrymen. The government will promote groups advocating for class collaboration, and make sure those daring to speak of class war remain in the shadows."
 NATFRA_Technological_Innovations: "Technological Innovations"
 NATFRA_Technological_Innovations_desc: "It's common sense that competition is the best way to stimulate innovation, and yet France has relentlessly tried to meddle in research and development, leading our great nation to lag behind the United States, Britain, and even Germany in the technological race. Let private enterprise and the market naturally weed out useless projects, before swooping in and bankrolling the worthy."
 NATFRA_Private_Cooperation: "Private Cooperation"
 NATFRA_Private_Cooperation_desc: "The State now finally contained within reasonable boundaries, the private sector can finally surge, fully support our cause and give back a thousandfold, full of thanks for the Lion who freed them from their stately shackles and moved by ever more intense patriotic fervour."
 NATFRA_Social_Reform: "Social Reforms"
 NATFRA_Social_Reform_desc: "The Redressement is made up of more generally wealthy people, that is undeniable. And though they have all certainly shined by their individual altruism, they recognise that as a class they should do more for the common man: as such a wide range of social reform agreed upon by committees made up of industrials, unions, and government representatives will be implemented."
 NATFRA_Housing_Programms: "Housing Programmes"
 NATFRA_Housing_Programms_desc: "Though it has been more than a decade since the exile, many of our citizens who were forced to flee still live in unpleasant conditions, in overcrowded coastal cities: the government will buy empty land, encourage the building of decent housing, and give loans with advantageous rates to families and young couples to purchase their new homes."
 NATFRA_Chantiers_de_Jeunesse: "Chantiers de Jeunesse"
 NATFRA_Chantiers_de_Jeunesse_desc: "To support our youths and teach them useful skills, strong moral values, and respect of authority, we will make mandatory a months-long stay in youth camps inspired by scouting, where teenagers will accomplish community work, build strong bonds far from their usual lives, and prepare their mind and bodies for their years of military service once they reach adulthood."
 NATFRA_Get_support_from_the_Clergy: "Get Support from the Clergy"
 NATFRA_Get_support_from_the_Clergy_desc: "The Lion has maintained decent relations with the Church, but many among the clergy found themselves supporting our democratic or royalist opponents in the recent crisis, while others are sceptical of the economic aims of the Redressement. To try to win the Church over entirely, we will make sure to put an emphasis on our respect for religious liberty, and our hope for a moral state."
 NATFRA_Rebuild_The_Morale_Order: "Rebuild the Moral Order"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_The_Morale_Order_desc: "The Third Republic and its reckless liberalism and deeply anticlerical policies had degenerated into a corrupt, immoral mess that led France to defeat, that is plain to see. France must not fall into this pitfall again: we will work towards rebuilding order at all levels of society, crushing radicalism, and encouraging religious, moral education."
 NATFRA_Travail_Famille_Patrie: "Travail, Famille, Patrie"
 NATFRA_Travail_Famille_Patrie_desc: "Work, Family, Fatherland, these are the words on the mind of all true Frenchmen, this is the motto that must sweep away the excesses of the old Republic and bring forward the new State, so that one day we might accomplish our sacred duty: the liberation of France from her red shackles, thanks to the guidance of the Marshal, the Lion, the Hero of Verdun beloved by all, Philippe Pétain."

# Action Française #

 NATFRA_Politique_Dabord: "Politique d'Abord!"
 NATFRA_Politique_Dabord_desc: "After months of political instability, the Action Française stands triumphant: Charles de Gaulle has asked in front of parliament the Duke de Guise to seize the crown and for the kingdom to be reborn. Finally, the Republic will be swept away, and led by our king we will once again rise to glory."
 NATFRA_Restauration: "Restauration"
 NATFRA_Restauration_desc: "Vive le Roi ! The Kingdom is reborn, and though much work remains to be done, we are almost ready to take the first step towards the salvation of France: the coronation of Jean d'Orléans as rightful king of France. A sumptuous ceremony and nationwide public celebrations are hastily being planned, following as closely as possible the traditions of the French crown."
 NFA_restauration_focus_tt: "The focus will automatically be completed after the crowning ceremony is organised.\n"
 NATFRA_Bring_back_Aristocracy: "Bring Back Aristocracy"
 NATFRA_Royal_Dictatorship: "Royal Dictatorship"
 NATFRA_Royal_Dictatorship_desc: "In this critical hour, a dictatorship must be set up to lead the difficult transition away from the decadent Republic. Not a dictatorship of parties, of elected officials, which would quickly fall into despotism and the very same corruption the republic suffered from, but a royal dictatorship, above petty party quarrels, tempered by a millennium of traditions and paternal care for public interests."
 NATFRA_Decentralisation: "Decentralisation"
 NATFRA_Decentralisation_desc: "The Revolution did all it could to destroy the structures of the kingdom of France: power was taken away from the provinces, and concentrated in the hands of \"representatives\" sent to Paris. This proved to be prone to corruption and inefficient to address local concerns. We will start to right the wrongs of our forefathers by systematically devolving power away from the capital."
 NATFRA_Protective_Inequality: "Protective Inequality"
 NATFRA_Protective_Inequality_desc: "The demagogic liberals pretended to make all men equal: this was of course folly. Instead, the State must work towards a repartition of societal roles that is beneficial to all, encouraging traditional and natural structures while preventing any excesses that might foster resentment among the lower classes: not out of a pipe dream of 'equality', but out of a lucid sense of care for our subjects."
 NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter: "The Eldest Daughter of the Church"
 NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter_desc: "France is the Elder Daughter of the Church, home of countless saints and faithful heroes, defending the Faith at every turn, even blessed with saintly kings like Saint Louis. That is, until the revolution and the 1905 Laws: we must repent for these errors and restore the Church to her rightful position. From godless republic, we will be reborn as a sacramental kingdom."
 NATFRA_Localism: "Localism"
 NATFRA_Localism_desc: "We will restore the institutions of the French Kingdom: municipal councils, regional parliaments, professional assemblies, guilds, etc. The Crown will set policy and decide what no one else could, but anything that could be decided on a local level should be so. Furthermore, justice and policing will be handled locally, following local laws and local traditions."
 NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures: "Protect the Provincial Cultures"
 NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures_desc: "The Republic sought to destroy regional cultures and languages, dialects were forbidden for anything official, particularly education, while in the empire little respect was shown to local traditions, seen as oddities soon swept away by so-called 'progress'. But it is the Republic that has been swept away, and so we will follow a policy of promotion of the diversity of France and her people."
 NATFRA_Corporatism: "Corporatism"
 NATFRA_Corporatism_desc: "The Social Doctrine of the Church rejects socialism and unrestricted capitalism, and supports workers' rights to organise. Inspired by this and traditional institutions, our subjects will come together to form corporations, in the spirit of the guilds of old. In the past, the King protected the lower classes, and when they were abandoned, they became slaves of worshippers of Mammon: we say, no more!"
 NATFRA_Clacissism: "Classicism"
 NATFRA_Clacissism_desc: "The origin of the revolution lies in the Reformation and the Enlightenment: instead, we will foster their opposite, classicism, refining of the genius of the ancient Greeks and Romans through a thoroughly French lens: the stoic sobriety and wisdom of the Ancients will prevent decadence from taking root again in France."
 NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism: "End Parliamentarism"
 NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism_desc: "The Third Republic was weak, ineffective in times of crisis and incapable of conducting the policies needed for France to maintain her rank among nations. France suffered from a lack of clear direction, her people divided: the king has ended this petty squabble masquerading as democracy, and will lead from now on his subjects towards glory."
 NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel: "Le Pays Réel"
 NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel_desc: "We are getting ever closer to freeing the \"pays réel\", from its shackles imposed by the 'pays légal', a few thousand individuals, speaking for millions, more concerned with their little quarrels between mediocre so-called elite. But the real country, once artificially divided, its roots slowly undermined, once fooled by the 'Gueuse', is now united under the king: the damage done since 1789 will be undone."
 NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy: "Exalt the Aristocracy"
 NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy_desc: "The nobility has given us many great heroes who never hesitated to fight for the kingdom and the Faith. Stripped of their privileges and persecuted, many nobles have fallen into passivity, merely keeping the dream of the kingdom alive. This changes now: worthy nobles will be restored to their natural positions and noble and peasant will reform their holy bond to once again take on the Gueuse."
 NATFRA_National_Solidarity: "National Solidarity"
 NATFRA_National_Solidarity_desc: "The Reds promote class warfare: though their defence of labour is just, this is deeply contrary to the Faith, pitting brother against brother and ultimately achieving nothing but the destruction of the social fabric. Instead, we will promote national solidarity; thanks to the watchful guidance of our king we will ensure that all acquire a just reward for their labour so that they may be able to live in dignity."
 NATFRA_End_Republican_Demagogy: "End Republican Demagogy"
 NATFRA_End_Republican_Demagogy_desc: "By promising equality, the republicans deeply undermined France. The people, hoping for an unattainable dream, reduced to mere cogs, called to vote so that decisions might be taken far away from them, were easily seduced by the rhetoric of the Reds. Who could blame them? Remaining republicans will atone or we will make sure they are not able to disgrace France any longer."
 NATFRA_Colony_To_Province: "From Colony to Province"
 NATFRA_Colony_To_Province_desc: "The influence of native elites proved crucial in order to secure power, and they now expect their customary privileges and rights restored. We will oblige: no more will France trample tribal and Islamic law, attempting to transform these men into Frenchmen. Instead, the Indigènes will now thrive under the careful watch of these dedicated servants of the empire."
 NATFRA_Rely_on_Ourselves: "Rely on Ourselves"
 NATFRA_Rely_on_Ourselves_desc: "Though we know we can count on our allies in our crusade to retake France, our Latin and Catholic brothers, and yes, even the Rosbifs, we must not rely on foreign help. The empire is rich in resources, and populated by millions of proud Frenchmen ready to fight and die for the patrie: we simply need a strong drive for development and technological advancements, and nothing will be able to stop us."
 NATFRA_Take_back_our_Resources: "The King's Resources"
 NATFRA_Take_back_our_Resources_desc: "Our African dominion is full of riches. So far privately exploited, we cannot afford to let any inefficiencies get in the way of extracting resources vital to the coming war effort. The Crown will take direct control of the various mines, oil fields and refineries dotting our possessions, develop the infrastructure necessary for them to thrive and extensively fund the drive to look for more resources."
 NATFRA_La_Contre_Revolution: "La Contre-Révolution"
 NATFRA_La_Contre_Revolution_desc: "The effort to destroy the Gueuse is finally over. But we have never lost sight of our goal: the fires of one revolution have been extinguished, it is now time to extinguish the fires of another. So that France may be whole, so that her people might be free, so that the dynasty might lead us to a brighter future, we will prepare, wait for the opportune moment, and then fight to the bitter end.\nMontjoie Saint-Denis ! Vive le roi et vive la France !"
 NATFRA_Egoism_of_each_helps_all: "Egoism of Each Helps All"
 NATFRA_Egoism_of_each_helps_all_desc: "Though the king's influence must be felt throughout society, day to day local decision-making must be done by associations between the individual and the State, freely constituted and ruled by consensus, trade associations or municipal councils. As each strives for their best interests, a mutually beneficial accord will be found, with the Crown acting as an arbitrator to prevent any injustices from taking place."

 NATFRA_Second_Union_Sacree: "Second Union Sacrée"
 NATFRA_Second_Union_Sacree_desc: "After months of political instability, Pétain has fallen and the Republic endures. After his election by the Parliament as president of the French Republic, General Henri Mordacq has chosen to take a step back and let a government of national unity headed by Colonel de La Rocque take charge, hoping for a return to normalcy after years of rule by a military junta."

 NATFRA_the_concentration_republicaine_theory: "The \"Concentration Républicaine\" Theory"
 NATFRA_the_concentration_republicaine_theory_desc: "From the very start, the Third Republic was unstable, facing pressure from the reactionary right and revolutionary left, as republicans stood divided. Much like then, Republicans of all stripes must unite and endure, setting aside their differences at least temporarily to make sure the Republic endures in these crucial times."
 NATFRA_reinforce_the_republican_school_system: "Reinforce the Republican School System"
 NATFRA_reinforce_the_republican_school_system_desc: "Originally a product of the more liberal urban upper-middle class, the Republic took generations to truly take root. One of its greatest weapons had been free, mandatory education, educating even the poorest and making sure that all receive republican values. Thanks to the 'Black Hussars of the Republic', teachers, we will renew trust in our democratic system."
 NATFRA_new_senatorial_elections: "New Senatorial Elections"
 NATFRA_new_senatorial_elections_desc: "Dominated by older, more conservative members of parliaments, elected under pressure by Marshal Pétain, the Senate went only reluctantly with his removal from office and could prove unwieldy to truly heal the Republic. Though it is still too early for national elections, the Senate is elected by the Assembly: an election will make sure that most Pétain appointees lose their seat."
 NATFRA_electoral_reforms: "Electoral Reforms"
 NATFRA_electoral_reforms_desc: "To ensure the survival of our renewed democracy, electoral reform is needed: parts of Algeria and Senegal have always sent representatives to the parliament, but there simply wouldn't be enough of them as it stands. Districts will be redrawn, the privileges of the Four Communes extended to much of Senegal, and the number of parliamentarians will be brought down."
 NATFRA_parliamentary_suppremacy: "Parliamentary Supremacy"
 NATFRA_parliamentary_suppremacy_desc: "The Fourth Republic was born in chaos, and its new constitutional laws mostly officialise the accepted practices of the Third: that is, parliamentary dominance, the president choosing to stay confined to a largely ceremonial, unifying role. To prevent takeover from strongmen, we will enshrine the supremacy of parliament further."

 NATFRA_le_franc_algerien: "Le Franc Algérien"
 NATFRA_le_franc_algerien_desc: "During the Great War the Franc lost much of its value, and the exile made the situation worse as war debts seemed unlikely to be repaid. Thorough monetary reform has been necessary for years, but put off by a Pétain regime hoping for a return to the Franc's pre-war value. No more: it might prove unpopular, but the Franc will be severely devalued."
 NATFRA_bailout_french_companies: "Bailout French Companies"
 NATFRA_bailout_french_companies_desc: "Thanks to heavy investments by the state, many of the companies displaced by the revolution managed to reimplement themselves in Algeria smoothly. However, the recent waves of unrest have made the economic situation volatile: the government has announced that it will bailout companies to prevent further crisis, privately hoping to restore the friendly ties between state and industry enjoyed under the junta."
 NATFRA_attract_investments_from_the_entente: "Attract Investments From the Entente"
 NATFRA_attract_investments_from_the_entente_desc: "Our allies overseas have supported us through thick and thin, and many see this restoration of democracy as a great omen: with promise of support and advantageous contracts, as well as greater economic cooperation with allied nations, the government will attract further investments from the Entente."
 NATFRA_reinforce_business_ties: "Reinforce Business Ties"
 NATFRA_reinforce_business_ties_desc: "Pétain had built a strong network of support among the industrial upper classes, thankful for his support in the exile and more than a little sceptical of parliamentary democracy. We must restore business confidence in the new state of affairs and reach an understanding with the economic elites: the wave of bailouts sent a strong message, new government contracts will hopefully do the rest."
 NATFRA_solidarist_welfare_reforms: "Solidarist Welfare Reforms"
 NATFRA_solidarist_welfare_reforms_desc: "The Republic must show an open hand, not a closed fist. Theorised by the Radical Léon Bourgeois as a response to both socialism and liberalism, solidarism guided much of the social reforms of the last decades, such as a right to healthcare and insurance, free education, or income tax. We will continue these initiatives, to better the lives of our citizens and prevent unrest."

 NATFRA_nationalize_weapons_manufactures: "Nationalise Weapons Manufactures"
 NATFRA_nationalize_weapons_manufactures_desc: "To make sure we are ready for the coming war, the government will nationalise part of the armament industry, making sure it is well prepared for the large effort necessary and that once the conflict is finally upon us, the delivery of our troops' equipment goes as smoothly as possible."
 NATFRA_deepen_cff_cooperation: "Deepen CFF Cooperation"
 NATFRA_deepen_cff_cooperation_desc: "To prepare for the coming war, the government will meet representatives from the Foundry Committee, an organisation of leaders of the metallurgical industry, who had coordinated the armament industry during the Great War to great effect. With the silent threat of nationalisation hanging over their head, we will ensure their full cooperation to the war effort."
 NATFRA_republicanization_of_the_army: "Republicanisation of the Army"
 NATFRA_republicanization_of_the_army_desc: "Though the Army played a critical role in the removal of Pétain from office, it is still a hotbed of reaction, as both junta loyalists and monarchists quietly resent the new state of affairs. Though we must avoid a new Affaire des Fiches, we will ensure that little by little men truly loyal to the Republic will be promoted, following Mordacq's example."
 NATFRA_emprunts_de_la_defense_nationale: "Emprunts de la Défense Nationale"
 NATFRA_emprunts_de_la_defense_nationale_desc: "War is inevitably coming: we must prepare and the people must contribute. War bonds will be issued, and the government will ask for loans from the population, asking them to contribute part of their savings, to be reimbursed on the long term, hoping to prevent dependence on creditors."
 NATFRA_begin_civilian_mobilization: "Begin Civilian Mobilisation"
 NATFRA_begin_civilian_mobilization_desc: "France has been since the revolution a nation of citizen-soldiers, each man ready to be conscripted, fight for and die for the Republic. It's time to partially mobilise, now that war is on the horizon. Furthermore, thanks to the Pétain régime, we are well prepared to switch to a war economy: we will begin preparations to fully mobilise civilian industry for the war effort."

 NATFRA_merge_unions_into_the_cspf: "Merge Unions Into the BSPF"
 NATFRA_merge_unions_into_the_cspf_desc: "After the exile, socialist unions were banned, and more traditional unions proved ineffective, leading to a lack of representation for workers. As such the government has created a Bureau of French Professional Unions, inspired by the PSF's own union, and has strongly encouraged unions to merge with the Bureau, something more radical unions were told they had little choice but to agree with."
 NATFRA_secure_labor_agreements: "Secure Labour Agreements"
 NATFRA_secure_labor_agreements_desc: "The absorption of the vast majority of unions into the BSPF has led to a large number of renegotiations of local agreements between employers and workers. Indeed, whereas unions had formerly been de-fanged and isolated by state pressure, they can now count on a large support network and make demands without fearing repression, the Bureau making sure these demands remain reasonable."
 NATFRA_societe_nationale_du_transport_saharien: "Société Nationale du Transport Saharien"
 NATFRA_societe_nationale_du_transport_saharien_desc: "Reliably crossing the Sahara has long been a dream of the colonial authorities. Travel by sea is time consuming, while air travel is still precarious and not suited to transport large amounts of goods: a land route is necessary, to link Algiers to Dakar, to bring prosperity to the interior. Following in the footsteps of the Estienne brothers, we will develop Saharan infrastructures and make this dream a reality."
 NATFRA_promote_technocratic_management: "Promote Technocratic Management"
 NATFRA_promote_technocratic_management_desc: "Too often under the Pétain regime, it was not the worthy who were promoted but the most loyal: this led to tensions and general mediocrity in management, in both the private and public sector. The government will instead promote decision-making by experts in their fields, leading by example within government to encourage companies to seek the opinion of the most-skilled."
 NATFRA_work_charter: "Work Charter"
 NATFRA_work_charter_desc: "The BSPF, the government, and representatives from big business have finally reached a national agreement: thanks to promises of important state support and restriction of disruptive union activities, particularly striking, concessions from the industrial elites have been extracted, a new work charter which will be sure to better working conditions and wages for much of our population."

 NATFRA_expand_the_mass_party: "Expand the Mass Party"
 NATFRA_expand_the_mass_party_desc: "The new government is dominated by the French Social Party, a post-exile mass party: instead of catering to the politically-minded middle and upper classes, the party organised in local cells welcomes the masses, coordinating a large amount of activities, ranging from soup kitchens to summer camps. Now in government, the party will grow further and propose even more opportunities for its adherents."
 NATFRA_merge_the_rightist_parties: "Merge the Rightist Parties"
 NATFRA_merge_the_rightist_parties_desc: "Many minor right wing parties exist, and their efforts often get dispersed in petty factionalism: to work towards the goal of lasting national unity and to ensure that the Republic is well armed to fight both the far left and the AF who still lurks, the PSF will make overtures to both the moderate conservative and mass right parties to merge under the PSF, an initiative strongly encouraged by de La Rocque."
 NATFRA_allow_militarization_of_the_croix_de_feu: "Jeunesses Sociales et Patriotiques"
 NATFRA_allow_militarization_of_the_croix_de_feu_desc: "The successes of the PSF's youth wing in creating upright, dynamic youths, has led to a proposal to create a similar organisation on the national level, the Social and Patriotic Youths. It will inculcate young people with patriotic ideals, encourage physical activity, group cooperation, and useful skills such as camping, cooking, or the handling of weapons."
 NATFRA_regularize_relations_with_the_church: "Meeting With the Church Leadership"
 NATFRA_regularize_relations_with_the_church_desc: "The Republic was famously anticlerical, but the war, which created a renewal of popular faith, and Pétain's regime deepened the ties between Church and State. The fall of the junta created fear of renewed hostility: the government will meet prominent Catholics to reassure them, ensuring they steer away from reaction and know the name of their new benefactor: de La Rocque."
 NATFRA_glorify_the_colonel: "Glorify the Colonel"
 NATFRA_glorify_the_colonel_desc: "Colonel de La Rocque is an exceptional man. A war hero, grievously wounded during the Great War but choosing to return to the front, he received numerous decorations for his bravery. After the exile, he put his natural proficiency for leadership to good use, first among veteran groups and then in founding the PSF and in government, already bettering the lives of millions. He deserves our admiration."

 NATFRA_cement_the_coalition: "Cement the Coalition"
 NATFRA_cement_the_coalition_desc: "To the surprise of many, the traditional republican elites and the PSF have managed to work together in relative harmony: the government of national unity, this sacred union, seems well-disposed to last, as the party involved caters to different needs of the new political landscape, mass appeal and traditional republican legitimacy. A new, hybrid system is born."
 NATFRA_neutralize_the_psf: "Neutralise the PSF"
 NATFRA_neutralize_the_psf_desc: "The old guard of the Third Republic has managed to outmanoeuvre de La Rocque. The PSF remains an undoubtedly major force, but the traditional parties have managed to reimplement themselves after their loss of legitimacy following the exile: the spirit of the Third Republic endures and no strongman will be able to co-opt the state."
 NATFRA_constitutional_referendum: "Promise of a Referendum"
 NATFRA_constitutional_referendum_desc: "Colonel de la Rocque and the PSF now dominate the government of national unity, their brand of politics leaving the traditional republican elites behind and displeased. De la Rocque can now take advantage of this to unveil the next step, the promise of a constitutional referendum to strengthen the role of a president elected by universal suffrage."

 NATFRA_Establish_Supreme_Command: "Establish the Supreme Command"
 NATFRA_Establish_Supreme_Command_desc: "The Bear of Arras, Henri Mordacq has been given a free rein to reform the armed forces, something that he has proven is deeply necessary in his now-famous 'Lessons of 1914 and the Next War'. With such a fine mind leading the charge of change, our victory is certain: first of all, the different branches of the armed forces will be merged under one Supreme Commander to enforce greater cooperation."
 NATFRA_Principles_of_Strategy: "The Great Principles of Strategy"
 NATFRA_Principles_of_Strategy_desc: "Though creating a rigid set of strategies to be employed in the field would be folly, under the direction of Mordacq we will make sure to at the very least codify a number of principles for our officers: stay on the offensive, economise your forces, follow established strategy or take initiatives but not dawdle, and most important follow the new mantra of our armed forces: Mass. Speed. Destruction."
 NATFRA_Strategic_Initiative: "Strategic Initiative"
 NATFRA_Strategic_Initiative_desc: "One thing is certain, the war must be ended as quickly as possible. By developing innovative strategic plans and training our officers to react quickly to changing situations, we can make certain that we always keep the initiative and never find ourselves on the back-foot."
 NATFRA_We_Win_Wars_with_Trucks: "We Win Wars with Trucks"
 NATFRA_We_Win_Wars_with_Trucks_desc: "Horses have been part of warfare since times immemorial, and they are still widely used in our army for everything from reconnaissance to logistics. But the reformed French armed forces have to be a modern, fast army: the roles of our equine companions will gradually be filled by much faster, and much more resistant, trucks."
 NATFRA_Chars_d_Assault: "Char d'Assault"
 NATFRA_Chars_d_Assault_desc: "Tanks will play a crucial role in our reformed army, acting as the tip of our offensives, smashing through enemy lines with sheer firepower, acting in deep cooperation with air support and closely followed by the courageous French rifleman: our current dispositions might limit our production capacities, but each char we have will be used perfectly."
 NATFRA_Tactical_Support: "Tactical Support"
 NATFRA_Tactical_Support_desc: "The use of aerial support proved crucial in the last days of the Great War, and will prove even more important in the coming war against the Commune. New designs specialised in close air support of infantry units are being developed, and we will make sure to make full use of them, softening up our enemies before sweeping them away in one decisive advance."
 NATFRA_Manoeuvre_Warfare: "Manoeuvre Warfare"
 NATFRA_Manoeuvre_Warfare_desc: "The coming war will be a war of movement: the attrition battles of the Great War, the trenches of Verdun belong to another era of warfare and the Bear has understood it perfectly, and we cannot afford a long war in any case: we will quickly outmanoeuvre the enemy and crush him before the enemy commanders even know what hit them."
 NATFRA_Logistic_Support: "Logistic Support"
 NATFRA_Logistic_Support_desc: "Motorising our army is all well and good, but a war isn't won on an empty stomach, or an empty fuel tank: a massive effort is to be undertaken to make sure our men never have to slow down, or worst of all stop in their tracks, due to poor logistics."
 NATFRA_Armored_Cars: "Armoured Cars"
 NATFRA_Armored_Cars_desc: "Armoured cars saw limited use on the Western Front of the Great War, but were found to be effective on the vast expanses of the Russian steppes and since the exile, providing light support and protection to infantry units and proving to be excellent tools for reconnaissance and unrest suppression."
 NATFRA_Coordinated_Strikes: "Coordinated Strikes"
 NATFRA_Coordinated_Strikes_desc: "An extremely effective tactic in the last days of the Great War was a concentrated combined assault of armoured forces, aerial support, artillery fire, closely followed by infantry advances, taking the enemy by surprise with and neutralising him before he could even react. A new generation of officers has fully understood the incredible potential of these strikes and will be instructed to make full use of them."
 NATFRA_Ineluctable_Advance: "Ineluctable Advance"
 NATFRA_Ineluctable_Advance_desc: "Henri Mordacq has finally imposed his vision of modern warfare: armoured units, integrated artillery and aviation support and the eternal might of the French rifleman, working as one to destroy the enemies of France. Nothing will be able to stop the might of the French armed forces: the reconquest of the métropole is only a matter of time."

 NATFRA_Aeronavale: "L'Aéronavale"
 NATFRA_Aeronavale_desc: "War at sea is an inevitability, as with our allies we must first get rid of syndicalist naval presence in the Western Mediterranean if we want to finally start the reconquest of the métropole: though current doctrine preconise ever larger ships, we will also develop our naval aviation, using sea planes as both reconnaissance and to target enemy vessels from the air."
 NATFRA_War_of_Communications: "War of Communications"
 NATFRA_War_of_Communications_desc: "If all the branches of the Army are now under one commander-in-chief, miscommunication in the field could still jeopardise our plans: we will invest heavily in radio communication, making sure each unit is fully aware at all times of the greater tactical objectives they might strive for and that the days of blind, generalised confusion under fire are truly over."
 NATFRA_Mass_Concentration: "Mass Concentration"
 NATFRA_Mass_Concentration_desc: "Our offensives must be decisive, and as such we will make sure that each of them proves unstoppable for our enemies. In short, everything will be used to overwhelm whoever stands against us, most importantly, men. Determined, well trained masses of men following an armoured spearhead, destroying any resistance mounted against us."
 NATFRA_Form_the_Reserves: "Form the Reserves"
 NATFRA_Form_the_Reserves_desc: "Along with a core of professional soldiers, every man has to serve in the Army for some time, and can be called to serve up until his forties, undergoing re-training and manoeuvres every year. To make sure that we are truly ready for the coming war, we will create more reservist units made up of men still active in civilian life, but required to occasionally train and serve alongside professional units."
 NATFRA_A_Cheap_Navy: "A Cheap Navy"
 NATFRA_A_Cheap_Navy_desc: "Naval doctrine since the Great War and the new dominance of the German navy favours bigger, ever more heavily armed, and ever slower ships, true fortresses of the sea: almost as if our Teutonic friends have something to compensate for! We simply cannot afford such heavy investment, and French naval doctrine has always preferred smaller, faster ships anyway."
 NATFRA_Specialised_Training: "Specialised Training"
 NATFRA_Specialised_Training_desc: "We cannot field the vast armies of the Commune, instead through arduous training we must make sure every French soldier is worth ten Red poor bastards, and at the very least twenty Boches. Furthermore, by creating more specialised units, marines, mountain troops, or paratroopers, we can make sure we always have specialists ready for whatever the coming war throws at us."
 NATFRA_Forces_Preservation: "Forces Preservation"
 NATFRA_Forces_Preservation_desc: "Our manpower is precious: every man will serve in some way his country, and we cannot afford to waste a single life. By embedding top-notch medical units within our forces, we will make sure that each wounded soldier will be treated as promptly and effectively as possible, to make sure that he might live to fight another day."
 NATFRA_Equipement_Improvements: "Equipment Improvements"
 NATFRA_Equipement_Improvements_desc: "As war looms, we must make sure the equipment of the French soldier stays on par with the latest advances: a specialised military research department working in cooperation with our allies will be funded. The French infantryman, already the bravest the world has known, will also be the best equipped: nothing will be able to hinder him."
 NATFRA_Develop_Counter_Measures: "Develop Counter Measures"
 NATFRA_Develop_Counter_Measures_desc: "Mordacq is of course not the only one who has understood the value of aerial support in the coming war: our air force will of course fight to hell and back to protect our infantry units, but by equipping our men with anti-aircraft guns, they will not be defenceless against aerial assault should they find themselves vulnerable."
 NATFRA_Enemy_Destruction: "Enemy Destruction"
 NATFRA_Enemy_Destruction_desc: "Destruction, destruction, destruction, this what must stay on the minds of our officers and soldiers: no longer is war a gentlemanly affair, no longer is war an affair of positions with long stretches of inaction in-between carnage. Such conflicts must be left in the past: our strategy now relies on rapid action, total war and the utter crushing of our enemy before they can take action against us."
 NATFRA_Trade_Warfare: "Trade Warfare"
 NATFRA_Trade_Warfare_desc: "The Internationale might still hold on the mainland, but their war machine cannot run without the resources sent to them from all over the world by syndicalist allies or unscrupulous neutral nations: by targeting ships transporting vital war resources bound for the Commune, we will easily be able to stall their red horde."

 NATFRA_Total_War_desc: "Much like the revolutionaries of 1792, we stand against overwhelming odds. And yet, they triumphed. Just like then, the entire nation will be mobilised for the coming war effort, so that one day we might be able to free France from her red shackles: millions of French are ready to give everything to achieve this dream, or die trying."
 NATFRA_War_of_Production: "War of Production"
 NATFRA_War_of_Production_desc: "Since the Exile, the industrial capacity of the Empire has been greatly developed, but it's still not enough to fulfil the needs of our armed forces: a great effort will be asked of our citizens, they will have to work harder and better than ever before to give our fighting men a chance. But we can promise one thing: in the end, this will all be worth it."
 NATFRA_War_in_the_Minds: "War in the Minds"
 NATFRA_War_in_the_Minds_desc: "War is not just won on the battlefields or even in the factories. Spirit is also crucial: the morale of the infantry must of course be kept up, but on the homefront too we must make sure that each and every one of our citizens is keenly aware that every one of them has a role to play in the war effort. It's only once the entire nation is united in spirit, working towards victory, that we will be able to achieve our destiny."
 NATFRA_Factories_Investments: "Factories Investments"
 NATFRA_Factories_Investments_desc: "Of course, hard work alone cannot be enough to boost our production capacities: we will heavily invest in industries important for the war effort, opening new factories and developing already existing ones, all the while training the working men and women how to use newer machinery, specialised to fit our needs."
 NATFRA_Ressource_Management: "Resource Management"
 NATFRA_Ressource_Management_desc: "Not just the people, but the very soil of our nation must be put to contribute to help towards the war effort. Thankfully, we have access to the vast riches of the empire. Private war resource exploitations will be heavily monitored to make sure that everything needed for the armed forces gets into the right hands and no delay is tolerated."
 NATFRA_Mobilise_Every_Man: "Mobilise Every Man"
 NATFRA_Mobilise_Every_Man_desc: "France is a nation of citizen soldiers and each man from age 20 to 45 knows his duty: those not needed in critical industries will be ready for active duty at a moment's notice. These brave men, heroes all, some who saw the horrors of the Great War, some too young to even remember the beauty of the mainland, will fight to the end to free their compatriots."
 NATFRA_Use_Everything: "Use Everything"
 NATFRA_Use_Everything_desc: "More, we need more, always more. More guns, more war materials, more men. Everything must be thrown in this ultimate effort. Some might consider this desperation, but we know the truth: this is the drive of men denied their birthrights. Like our ancestors sung as they fought the armies of the tyrants of Europe: \"Sachons vaincre ou sachons périr !\" Let us know victory, or let us perish."

 NATFRA_Firestorm_Doctrine: "Firestorm Doctrine"
 NATFRA_Firestorm_Doctrine_desc: "Firestorms are a terrifying thing, advancing hundreds of metres in mere seconds, destroying all in their path, only leaving a world of ash behind them. If France is to be saved, our armed forces must take on the Communard forces like a firestorm, destroying all in their wake without leaving the enemy a second to compose themselves, decisively destroying everything in their path until the métropole is freed."
 NATFRA_Rain_of_Shells: "Rain of Shells"
 NATFRA_Rain_of_Shells_desc: "Artillery has been one of the prides of the French Army for decades, and our expertise proved incredibly effective in the Great War. It would be foolish to abandon that heritage: we will make it an integral part of our new tactical considerations and blow apart anyone that stands against us."
 NATFRA_Incineration: "Incineration"
 NATFRA_Incineration_desc: "If we want to win this war, we must hinder at all costs our enemies' war capacities. Long range bombers will make sure that the enemies of France cannot live in impunity: we will target strategic sites with heavy aerial bombing, raising to the ground wherever might be used in the war effort against us."
 NATFRA_Incineration_idea: "Incineration"
 NATFRA_Death_and_Ruin: "Death and Ruin"
 NATFRA_Death_and_Ruin_desc: "War is a tragedy. As such it must be quick, so that the orgy of violence can remain relatively limited. However, we cannot afford to let sentimentality get the better of us in these critical times, when the very salvation of France is at stake: our war will be quick, because nothing will be held back: each artillery barrage, each bombing, each offensive will be decisive, no matter the costs for our enemies."

 NATFRA_Ministry_of_War_desc: "The Ministry of War is responsible for responding to the needs of our armies and more generally with organising and coordinating the war effort, from intelligence to logistics. As such, it plays a crucial role: now free from civilian interference and petty politicking, it can fully dedicate itself to our sacred duty: the liberation of the métropole."
 NATFRA_General_Estienne_Legacy: "General Estienne's Legacy"
 NATFRA_General_Estienne_Legacy_desc: "General Jean Estienne brought critical innovation to the French Army, pioneering aerial reconnaissance, and developing modern tactics to improve the coordination and effectiveness of artillery units. He was the first to recognise the potential of tanks and theorise their tactical and strategic use. He had brought us so close to victory in the Great War: if not for Nivelle's hasty dismissal, his presence and not just his legacy might live on in our forces today."
 NATFRA_Professional_Army: "Professional Army"
 NATFRA_Professional_Army_desc: "The French Army has traditionally relied on conscription, France being a nation of citizen-soldiers. However, we must adapt to our current situation: our manpower and resources are limited. We won't renounce conscription, but we will heed de Gaulle's advice and greatly expand our already existing core of professional troops."
 NATFRA_Char_de_Rupture: "Char de Rupture"
 NATFRA_Char_de_Rupture_desc: "We must focus our efforts on the development of medium-sized tanks, powerfully armed and well-armoured but mobile enough to lead the efforts of our infantry and force the enemy to retreat by their mere presence on the battlefield."
 NATFRA_Char_Forteresse: "Char Forteresse"
 NATFRA_Char_Forteresse_desc: "We must focus our efforts on the development of super-heavy tanks, with terrifying firepower and thick armour, true land battleships, a more mobile artillery that will pound the enemy forces into the ground, turning into dust any fortification that stands in its way."
 NATFRA_Primacy_of_the_Manoeuver: "Primacy of Manoeuvre"
 NATFRA_Primacy_of_the_Manoeuver_desc: "The coming war will be one of movement, our strategists, de Gaulle first among them, are certain of this.

 NATFRA_Queen_of_the_Battlefield: "Queen of the Battlefield"
 NATFRA_Queen_of_the_Battlefield_desc: "The infantry is the queen of the battlefield, without her nothing could be achieved: thankfully the French infantryman is the finest in the world, motivated by his \"élan\", a burning desire to fight for the Patrie. To reconquer the métropole, our troops must then be perfectly drilled, impeccably equipped, and confident in the sacred cause they are fighting for."
 NATFRA_Investments_in_Hotchkiss: "Investments in Hotchkiss"
 NATFRA_Investments_in_Hotchkiss_desc: "Hotchkiss a large industrial conglomerate, focused primarily on the production of shells and artillery. A long-time provider of our armed forces, the company successfully reimplemented itself in Algeria following the exile: their cooperation in the coming war effort will help us modernise our armaments."
 NATFRA_Heir_to_the_old_75: "Heir to the old 75"
 NATFRA_Heir_to_the_old_75_desc: "The 75 mm field gun, in service since 1898, was the wonder weapon, the perfect light anti-personnel artillery piece and the pride and joy of our armies. The Great War however showed its limitations as heavier guns proved critical in trench warfare, and though light it is not suited to motorised warfare: a worthy successor will be designed."
 NATFRA_Ammunition_Innovations: "Ammunition Innovations"
 NATFRA_Ammunition_Innovations_desc: "The Ministry of War, in cooperation with the armament industry, has started a wide-ranging research and development effort, aiming for faster production of shells and ammo, ideally taking less resources as the metals required are rare in the empire, and more generally ammunition better suited for our needs. Our manpower is precious, and any advantage our men can attain in the field will be critical."
 NATFRA_Colonial_Special_Force: "Colonial Special Force"
 NATFRA_Colonial_Special_Force_desc: "Our colonial force, familiarly called \"la Coloniale\", made up mostly of Frenchmen and usually the first to be deployed overseas, was decimated in the Great War. But they spearheaded last century's conquests, and their proud tradition is very much alive: with some reorganisation and recruitment effort they will one day be the first to land on the beaches of mainland France."
 NATFRA_Tactical_Studies_Center: "Tactical Studies Centre"
 NATFRA_Tactical_Studies_Center_desc: "The French Army has traditionally left officers little room for initiative, focusing instead on strict adherence to orders, but our experience of the Great War has proved to us that tactical spontaneity is sometimes necessary. As such, our officers will be taught how to respond to a variety of situations in a more autonomous manner, and given the tools to make critical choices on the battlefield."
 NATFRA_Research_Improvements: "Research Improvements"
 NATFRA_Research_Improvements_desc: "As war looms, we must make sure the equipment of the French soldier stays on par with the latest advances: a specialised military research department working in cooperation with our allies will be funded.

 NATFRA_Young_Guard_Officers: "Jeune Garde Officers"
 NATFRA_Young_Guard_Officers_desc: "A new generation of senior officers has been born, following the example of Charles de Gaulle and his ideas for reform of the armed forces. This \"Young Guard\", as it has been nicknamed, an informal clique of heroes of the Great War who fought with their men in the trenches will now lead our nation to victory."
 NATFRA_Fire_and_Movement: "Fire and Movement"
 NATFRA_Fire_and_Movement_desc: "To replace the vast infantry waves of the Great War which led so many good men to their deaths for little tactical and strategic results, we will instead adopt new squad-based tactics, using heavy suppressing fire and mobile units to outmanoeuvre then neutralise the enemy."
 NATFRA_Infiltration_Tactics_desc: "Infiltration tactics, that is the use of experienced units to bypass strong-points and better attack them from a more favourable point were used with great effect by German storm troops in the latter part of the Great War. It would be foolish of us to ignore such an innovation, and with our new focus on highly professional troops we will ensure that our men are well acquainted with these tactics."
 NATFRA_Ministry_of_the_Air: "Ministry of the Air"
 NATFRA_Ministry_of_the_Air_desc: "The Ministry of the Air is tasked with both organising our aeronautical efforts, such as civilian air transport, and our air forces, which proved so useful in the Great War and which according to our military thinkers will prove even more critical in the coming war, as technological progress enables new air tactics and strategy."
 NATFRA_Total_Air_War: "Total Air War"
 NATFRA_Total_Air_War_desc: "Many of the younger generation of officers argue for large scale use of air support for the infantry, but others have also suggested that we should not shy away from using our air force to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry in a more generalised manner: we are not in a position to avoid total war, and turning the enemies' resources to rubble can only help us."
 NATFRA_Air_Coordination_Center: "Air Coordination Centre"
 NATFRA_Air_Coordination_Center_desc: "We will create a dedicated command centre for our air forces, so that they are best assigned according to their strength and weaknesses instead of letting them be potentially misused by commanders with less experience of air tactics, and to ensure that the status of our forces in the air be monitored and controlled as best as possible, for example to mount rescue missions."
 NATFRA_DEM_Barrage: "D.E.M Barrage"
 NATFRA_DEM_Barrage_desc: "To coordinate offensive and defensive efforts in the air, the ministry will generalise the use of Electromagnetic Detection, immense antennas placed in strategic points using electromagnetic waves to detect aircraft."
 NATFRA_DCA_Network: "DCA Network"
 NATFRA_DCA_Network_desc: "To prevent any air forces from attacking us on our own soil, particularly in Corsica so close to the red mainland, we will develop a network of anti-aircraft artillery batteries and searchlights, highly coordinated by the Ministry of the Air."
 NATFRA_Aircraft_Production: "Aircraft Production"
 NATFRA_Aircraft_Production_desc: "The aircraft industry exploded during the Great War, and the government has made sure to generously subsidise it to facilitate its implementation in Algeria. Since then preparations for the next war have not stopped, especially since colonial conflicts have given us the opportunity to test our aircraft. With war finally on the horizon, we will mobilise the industry to the fullest."
 NATFRA_Long_Range_Fighter: "Long Range Fighter"
 NATFRA_Long_Range_Fighter_desc: "Corsica might be a floating airfield from which our planes can easily reach the mainland, but we nevertheless need fighters capable of patrolling the vast expanses of the Mediterranean as well as escort our bombers deep into red territory to destroy the Commune's industry. The Ministry will ensure that the development of heavy fighters is not neglected."
 NATFRA_Tactical_Bombers: "Tactical Bombers"
 NATFRA_Tactical_Bombers_desc: "Our military thinkers have realised the importance of coordinated air-land efforts, with infantry heavily supported by tactical air support, against defensive structures, enemy personnel or infrastructure. To implement these tactics, the Ministry of the Air will support the development of tactical bombers."
 NATFRA_Transmitting_Knowledge: "Transmitting Knowledge"
 NATFRA_Transmitting_Knowledge_desc: "France has a proud history in aeronautics, and the Great War produced many heroes of the air. But you can't learn to fly on the ground, and pilots are a rare commodity: we'll ensure our best aces become even better instructors and teach a younger generation how to exceed them."
 NATFRA_New_Air_Tactics: "New Air Tactics"
 NATFRA_New_Air_Tactics_desc: "The field of military aviation is a rapidly changing one, and our pilots must adapt their skills to ever changing technology: with new aircraft come new possibilities of offensive and defensive manoeuvres, new ways of coming out of a tense dogfight: extensive training in these new tactical advances will give an edge over our enemies."
 NATFRA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs: "Ministry of Naval Affairs"
 NATFRA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs_desc: "The Ministry of Naval Affairs, once tasked with overseeing the administration of both our colonies and our naval forces, is now solely dedicated to the needs of the Navy: control of the Mediterranean will be essential to retake the Métropole, as such the ministry will make sure that our navy can stand up to the Internationale."
 NATFRA_A_World_Class_Navy: "A World-Class Navy"
 NATFRA_A_World_Class_Navy_desc: "Most of the French Navy accompanied our government in exile to North Africa, as such our navy is large but many of our ships are outdated. In its current state, the navy could defend our shores, but it is uncertain how it would fare if someone were to attempt to contest our hold on the Western Mediterranean. We will strive for a large-scale overhaul."
 NATFRA_An_African_Toulon: "An African Toulon"
 NATFRA_An_African_Toulon_desc: "Toulon was the primary base of the Mediterranean fleet before the war, but since the exile it has been stationed on Lake Bizerte, a lagoon in northern Tunisia intensively developed by colonial authorities, with in particular a large arsenal in Ferryville. To meet our ambitions, Bizerte will be overhauled and developed further."
 NATFRA_Heavy_Destroyers: "Heavy Destroyers"
 NATFRA_Heavy_Destroyers_desc: "France's navy has always been developed with the assumption that it would fight a superior force. In the last century, a movement called the 'Jeune École' advocated for the use of many smaller ships instead of large dreadnoughts: this idea is now outdated. The ministry will instead encourage the development of well-armed destroyers, a middle ground between our traditional doctrines and the international trends."
 NATFRA_Aviation_Cruisers: "Aviation Cruisers"
 NATFRA_Aviation_Cruisers_desc: "The field of naval aviation has been somewhat left behind by the international community, locked in a permanent arms race: this is a race we could not win, instead we will radically change our doctrine and encourage the use of air power in naval warfare, for reconnaissance and precision strikes."
 NATFRA_Sea_Leviathans: "Sea Leviathans"
 NATFRA_Sea_Leviathans_desc: "We might not be able to compete with Germany or Japan in the naval arms race, but we certainly can attempt to knock out any of our Mediterranean opponents with well armed heavy battleships: this might go against previous doctrines, but our current situation means it is time for some innovation."
 NATFRA_Air_Carriers: "Air Carriers"
 NATFRA_Air_Carriers_desc: "The current naval arms race is misguided: by developing aircraft carriers, we will ensure that we can keep control over the Mediterranean by bombing our enemies and sinking them to the depths of the sea before we are even within range of their guns."
 NATFRA_Preparing_Our_Return: "Preparing Our Return"
 NATFRA_Preparing_Our_Return_desc: "To reconquer the métropole, we need to land on its shore, a fight that the Commune has been expecting for two decades: it will be anything but simple. We must prepare as much as we can, as there will be no second chance. The Ministry will invest in the development of anything that could help our amphibious assault."
 NATFRA_Invasion_Logistics: "Invasion Logistics"
 NATFRA_Invasion_Logistics_desc: "However, the amphibious assault is merely the first part, we must ensure that our troops can secure a lasting bridgehead. And for this, there is only one way to prepare: impeccable logistics, so that the men lucky enough to be the first to set foot on the sacred soil of the Patrie can hold back any counterattack the Reds might attempt."

 NATFRA_The_U_Boat_Menace_desc: "The Commune lacks many resources essential to the modern war effort, most importantly, oil. Keeping control of the Mediterranean will be a strong step towards isolating them from their allies or neutral states willing to trade with them, but a large fleet of submarines will give us the capacity to harass their convoys even more efficiently."
 NATFRA_Battaile_Escadres: "Bataille d'Escadres"
 NATFRA_Battaile_Escadres_desc: "The battle for the Mediterranean won't be won with a single engagement, and we need to think strategically. By creating task forces, we will ensure our ships have clear roles and that they will be easily more coordinated, and our naval commanders will be taught how to think on a larger scale."

 NATFRA_Fate_Equatorial_Africa: "Fate of Equatorial Africa"
 NATFRA_Fate_Equatorial_Africa_desc: "With great mourning, we signed away most of French Equatorial Africa at the conclusion of the Great War. We had hoped that it would only be a temporary affair, but with discontent brewing at home, we had no choice but to acquiesce to the Germans. While a capable administrator, Raphaël Antonetti has declared his intention to step down from office forcing us to face the reality of the situation."
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Sudan: "Rebuild French Sudan"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Sudan_desc: "Recent unrest has destroyed much of the infrastructure of the French Sudan, as famines and discontent at our policies led to popular revolt. The unrest was quelled with some difficulty by native elites and our armies, but to go back to normal we need to restore the means of communication with the arid interior of our empire, and restart economic life."
 NATFRA_Sahara_Society: "Saharan Infrastructure Society"
 NATFRA_Sahara_Society_desc: "Our hold over our sub-Saharan colonies relies upon the safe passage of our ships through the straits of Gibraltar and down the coast of Africa unhindered. Neither of those outcomes can be assured in any future wars. We must focus on the construction of a rail line to link up Algeria with French West Africa below us!"
 NATFRA_Expand_Communication: "Expand Communications in the Colonies"
 NATFRA_Expand_Communication_desc: "As the radio becomes more widespread, it can be used as a tool to help us effectively govern over the territory we control. We must work towards getting radios into the hands of government officials across our country, so that even the most isolated villages of the Sahel know they are a part of France and ready to serve the interests of the motherland."
 NATFRA_Riches_of_Africa: "The Riches of Africa"
 NATFRA_Riches_of_Africa_desc: "This a continent of great untapped potential. From the arid Sahel to the mountains of the Atlas and the more lush Senegal, we must double our efforts to see that more resources be extracted to participate in the coming war effort and help us liberate the Métropole!"
 NATFRA_Reform_Code: "Reform l'Indigénat"
 NATFRA_Reform_Code_desc: "France remains free within her colonial territories. However, unrest is growing among the native population: with the loss of the mainland, the French colonial empire is weaker than ever, and some natives see this as an opportunity to end once and for all the French subjugation of their people. We must reform the 'Indigénat'!"
 NATFRA_Promote_Foreign_Legion: "Promote the Foreign Legion"
 NATFRA_Promote_Foreign_Legion_desc: "In order to retake the Métropole, we need more recruits to land on the beaches and push into the heartland of occupied France! To entice more soldiers into the Army, a propaganda line shall be spun with promises of increased conditions and rights for those who enlist within the Foreign Legion to fight and liberate France."
 NATFRA_Colonial_Extraction: "Colonial Extraction"
 NATFRA_Colonial_Extraction_desc: "While some believed that we ought to ease the burdens on our colonial populace due to our shared circumstance of our exile, that plan is foolhardy. If we are to retake the Métropole, we must double down in our extraction of the resources from the colonies and make room for additional factories to produce what we need to return home!"
 NATFRA_Meet_Local_Chief: "Meet With Native Chiefs"
 NATFRA_Meet_Local_Chief_desc: "In order to facilitate the process of assimilation of the peoples of the colonies into French society, we must reach out to and contact native leaders. If we can teach them of our ways and get them to live according to our customs, they can act as lighthouses to their neighbours showing the benefits of becoming assimilated into French culture!"
 NATFRA_Civ_Mission: "Push the Civilising Mission"
 #Expand this talking about the Civilisation Mission:
 NATFRA_Civ_Mission_desc: "It is our ultimate purpose to be beacons of society to the people of this continent. We must be the city on the hill that they look to for inspiration."
 NATFRA_Promote_Autonomy: "Promote Autonomy"
 NATFRA_Promote_Autonomy_desc: "One of the greatest crimes committed by the Third Republic was colonialism undertaken with the purpose of making sure that the Germans didn't get ahead of us in terms of global influence. Far too long have we spent trying to force our civilisation upon the natives of Africa. They must be granted greater autonomy from [NFA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"
 NATFRA_Algiers_Conference: "Algiers Conference"
 NATFRA_Algiers_Conference_desc: "With our return to the Métropole it is time to call together a gathering of senior officials from our colonial government to decide upon how we will govern them in the future. We will assemble native elites, administrators, representatives from the economic forces and missionaries to hash out a better colonial policy as the exile ends."

 #Big PP:
 NATFRA_France_indivisible: "France Indivisible"
 NATFRA_France_indivisible_desc: "Since the revolution, France has been divided by ideology. But no more, we have won this struggle through sheer force of will. It will take time and effort to stabilise the nation and return to our rightful place on the world stage, but nothing is impossible for the united French people."
 #Work on gaining cores:
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Legitimacy_Whole: "Rebuild Legitimacy"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Legitimacy_Whole_desc: "For many of our people, we are still enemies, an occupying force. Two decades of Communard propaganda does not go away in a few weeks: we have reconquered most of France, we still need to reconquer the hearts and minds of her people."
 #Lower Resistance from Communards:
 NATFRA_Endear_Population_Whole: "Endear the Population"
 NATFRA_Endear_Population_Whole_desc: "Now is not the time for a closed fist, but an open hand towards our reunited brothers. We will engage in a wide-scale relief effort, and make sure our people know that we are here as liberators of the French nation, not conquerors."
 #The trial events:
 NATFRA_Commune_Trials: "Trials of the Commune"
 NATFRA_Commune_Trials_desc: "The leaders of the revolutionary rabble must be put on trial for their treason. Some are still on the run, either in foreign countries or in the pockets of resistance against us, some have willingly surrendered: all will be brought to justice and they will answer for their innumerable crimes."
 #Property event:
 NATFRA_Return_Exile: "The Returning Exiles"
 NATFRA_Return_Exile_desc: "Slowly, a mass of exiles is arriving in Toulon, in Marseilles, having left behind Algeria, that they had to call home for so long. None of them know what they will find in their homeland, what has changed and if their lives could simply restart where they had left them decades ago: they only know one thing, that they want to return to their Motherland."
 NATFRA_Reconstruction_Commission_desc: "France is in ruins, with many of its cities and infrastructure deeply affected by the fighting, sabotage by retreating Communard troops or our resistance networks, and campaigns of aerial bombings. A commission will be granted all the funds and power needed to kickstart the rebuild of our nation."
 #Move exile factories back home:
 NATFRA_Relocate_Algerian_Industry: "Relocate Algerian Industry"
 NATFRA_Relocate_Algerian_Industry_desc: "Most of France's industrial elites went into exile when the revolution succeeded. They took their expertise and capital with them, and thanks to government support successfully relocated to the Algerian departments. Now it is time for them too to come home."
 #Add building slots for resistance/stab hit:
 NATFRA_Reverse_Collectivisation: "Reverse Collectivisation"
 NATFRA_Reverse_Collectivisation_desc: "Most of France's industry has been collectivised, along with much of its land. Radically challenging this status quo so soon would no doubt lead to revolt. But, little by little, we must and will carefully undo this injustice."
 #More resources:
 NATFRA_Resource_Extraction: "Expand Resource Extraction"
 NATFRA_Resource_Extraction_desc: "The Commune was inefficient in extracting the natural resources of France for the war effort: isolated, it partially led to their defeat. We won't make the same mistakes. Thanks to our expertise in getting the most from our arid dominion, we will ensure that the natural riches of the nation serve us adequately."
 #Some factories in Southern France:
 NATFRA_Rebuild_South_Whole: "Rebuild the South"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_South_Whole_desc: "Focusing on the port infrastructure of the cities on the Mediterranean and the south-west Atlantic coast will help us smooth the transfer of people and industry from the colonies as well as receive help from our allies."
 #Some factories in Northern France:
 NATFRA_Rebuild_North: "Rebuild the North"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_North_desc: "The bulk of the French industry is in the north of the country, on top of its coal and metal mines, and all roads and railroads lead to Paris. Already damaged by the heavy fighting of the Great War, the recent conflict was certainly not kind either to the region. Our rebuilding efforts must be intensified to ensure France is ready to stand tall as an economic power once again."
 #Post War Economic Boom:
 NATFRA_Rebirth_From_Ruin: "Rebirth From The Ruins"
 NATFRA_Rebirth_From_Ruin_desc: "There is much to be done still, and total reconstruction will take years, maybe even a decade or more. But the national effort for the revival of the nation is finally truly underway, and our people are industriously working to make France a great, proud power once again."

 #Training time and more men in the Army:
 NATFRA_Reorg_Forces: "Reorganise the French Forces"
 NATFRA_Reorg_Forces_desc: "In exile, even with the important contribution of the Indigènes, our manpower was strictly limited. Despite such odds, we have triumphed: now that the mainland is reconquered, many Frenchmen are ready to take up arms to fight for the motherland. Some reorganisation will be needed to accommodate them, but soon France will be able to field numerous armies once again."
 #Mil Factories:
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Mil_Complex: "Rebuild Military Complexes"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Mil_Complex_desc: "Much of the industry needed for the war effort was destroyed in the conflict, either through strategic bombing or through sabotage. The future is uncertain, and further conflict is not unlikely: we will rebuild our industrial capabilities to be prepared should such a conflict arise."
 #Pardoning some low level officers:
 NATFRA_Officer_Amnesty: "Officer Amnesty"
 NATFRA_Officer_Amnesty_desc: "Not all of the men who served the revolution are irredeemable. In particular, many of the younger officers were simply indoctrinated in serving the revolution, or even worse, simply believing this was the best way to serve France: after a suitable period of desyndicalisation, many will join our ranks."
 #Allowing former communards into the Army:
 NATFRA_Reintegrate_Red_Army: "Reintegrate the Red Army"
 NATFRA_Reintegrate_Red_Army_desc: "We cannot afford to waste good officers: despite its terrible organisation, the Communard Army was full of brave men serving France in the best way they knew. Now that the revolution has been defeated, many are realising their mistakes and hope to continue to defend the patrie. We won't refuse their help."
 #Land doctrines:
 NATFRA_Lessons_Second_War: "Lessons of the Reconquête"
 NATFRA_Lessons_Second_War_desc: "The war was a gruelling experience, pitting brothers against brothers. But it has also permitted us to put our doctrinal theories to the test, and develop numerous new ones in the heat of the fight. As we drastically expand our armed forces and retrain officers, we will learn from their and our experiences of the fight, and further, develop our doctrine."
 #Tanks:
 NATFRA_Remodel_Tanks: "Remodel Tank Production"
 NATFRA_Remodel_Tanks_desc: "The Commune's strategists and tacticians had fully embraced the use of armour on the battlefield, influenced by our successes in the latter days of the Great War: with access to the riches of the mainland, we will be able to make use of their expertise to develop new, better tanks that will serve us well in the future."
 #Research Slot:
 NATFRA_Science_Amnesty: "Amnesty for Scientists"
 NATFRA_Science_Amnesty_desc: "In exchange for amnesty, many of the scientists who served the cause of revolution are ready to mend their ways. As long as they swear fidelity to the new status quo, we will welcome them so they continue furthering France's renown and developing new technological prowesses."
 #Special Forces buff/research:
 NATFRA_Special_Forces: "Troupes de Choc"
 NATFRA_Special_Forces_desc: "The war has proved to us the usefulness of specialised troops, such as paratroopers or marines, in securing limited objectives critical to the success of larger operations, especially when dealing with limited manpower. We will further develop their training regimen and study the experience of the Commune in this domain to develop even better shock troops."

 #Navy Doctrine:
 NATFRA_World_Navy: "World Class Navy"
 NATFRA_World_Navy_desc: "A strong state deserves a strong navy. Though we are unlikely to catch up to our British friends, we must further increase our naval strength to maintain our hold on the Mediterranean and ensure the link with the colonies."
 #Ports:
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Toulon: "Rebuild Toulon"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Toulon_desc: "Toulon has been the base of our Mediterranean navy for centuries: its port and arsenals were damaged in the conflict and needs repairs to be able to renew its long legacy. We will take the opportunity to expand the base as well, as our priorities have shifted towards control of the sea."
 #Carriers:
 NATFRA_Ocean_Focus: "Focus on the Oceans"
 NATFRA_Ocean_Focus_desc: "With the reconquest of France, we now have access to numerous ports on the Atlantic. Having focused for so long on the Mediterranean, our navy is simply not well equipped to contest control of the Atlantic Ocean. There might be a time where we cannot rely on our British allies, and so we must develop an ocean-going fleet, in particular aircraft carriers."
 #Battleships:
 NATFRA_Sea_Focus: "Rule the Seas"
 NATFRA_Sea_Focus_desc: "We can rely on the British for control of the Atlantic, instead, we will focus on enhancing even further our stranglehold on the Mediterranean: should any conflict arise, our enemies will not be able to rely on shipping lines through our sea."
 #More ports in colonies:
 NATFRA_Mr_Worldwide_Base: "Worldwide Bases"
 NATFRA_Mr_Worldwide_Base_desc: "France stretches across Europe and the Americas: we must use this strength to the fullest. By dotting bases all over our overseas possessions, we will be able to vastly expand our range of action."
 #This is a tech bonus for DD's and CL's:
 NATFRA_Sea_Protect: "Protect the Sea Lanes"
 NATFRA_Sea_Protect_desc: "To defend our vast empire should hostilities break out once again, we must defend our shipping and communication lanes, taking inspiration from our expertise in fighting back against Communard attempts at disrupting our trade."
 #More range:
 NATFRA_Project_Further: "Plus Oultre"
 NATFRA_Project_Further_desc: "If we want to entertain hopes of maintaining control over the empire, we cannot rely on allied or neutral ports to refuel and repair our ships. As such, developing the operating range of our naval forces is essential, to go always further beyond."
 NATFRA_New_Aircraft_idea: "Old Skies, New Fighters"
 #Airports in Corsica and Algiers:
 NATFRA_Med_Airway: "Mediterranean Airway"
 NATFRA_Med_Airway_desc: "Travelling by sea between mainland France and the Algerian departments is time-consuming, especially as the Mediterranean is known to be capricious, particularly in winter. Now that the métropole has been freed, we will establish regular air travel between us and our overseas possessions."
 #Fighter Tech:
 NATFRA_Old_Sky_New_Fighter: "Old Skies, New Fighters"
 NATFRA_Old_Sky_New_Fighter_desc: "With access to more resources and Communard research and expertise, we will be able to develop better fighter planes to defend the skies of the homeland, should war rear its ugly head once again."
 #Bomber Tech:
 NATFRA_Bomber_Dev: "Bomber Development"
 NATFRA_Bomber_Dev_desc: "Air bombardment proved crucial in the war, destroying both infrastructure and morale. There is no doubt that strategic and tactical bombing will continue to be exceedingly important in the future, and as such we must stay on the edge of progress in this domain."

 #Expand intelligence:
 NATFRA_Expand_Bureau: "Expand the Deuxième Bureau"
 NATFRA_Expand_Bureau_desc: "Intelligence was critical in the last conflict, as we worked together with loyalists within the Commune to create ideal conditions for the reconquest. Covert operations and counter-intelligence will no doubt be just as important in the future, and so our intelligence services will have to be expanded."
 #Nuclear Tech Boost:
 NATFRA_Nuclear_Science: "Salvage Damocles"
 NATFRA_Nuclear_Science_desc: "The Internationale had started developing nuclear research, in the hopes of creating an ultimate, war-ending weapon. They were defeated before they had time to unleash this, but we will salvage this research and further it, so that atom might serve the greatness of France instead of the revolution."
 #Rocket Tech:
 NATFRA_Rocket_Science: "Develop the Fusées"
 NATFRA_Rocket_Science_desc: "Rockets played a minor role in the war, either mounted on trucks or even carrying flying bombs without the need of a pilot. The latter is certainly a concept to expand, as this could mean being able to strike distant targets in near impunity."
 #Jet Tech:
 NATFRA_Rocket_Planes: "Réaction Propulsion"
 NATFRA_Rocket_Planes_desc: "Plans for jet-propelled planes had been made but never came to fruition: the exile had divided French resources in the development of military aviation, but we are now reunited. We will develop planes capable of outmanoeuvring any of our enemies and assert their air superiority no matter who we face."
 #Strong Anti Air defences:
 NATFRA_No_More_Incursion: "No More Incursions"
 NATFRA_No_More_Incursion_desc: "The airspace of the patrie must be an impenetrable fortress, so that our people never again have to endure bombings again."

 #France back as a global player:
 NATFRA_Renewed_Diplomacy: "Renewed Diplomacy"
 NATFRA_Renewed_Diplomacy_desc: "With our return to the Métropole now looking considerably more solid, we can finally return to the world stage! Our time in exile has shown us the need to avoid diplomatic isolation, and so we will reach out to both our allies and the Germans, despite our enmities."
 NATFRA_Verdun_Memorial: "The Verdun Memorial"
 NATFRA_Verdun_Memorial_desc: "The end of the Second Weltkrieg reminded many of the results of the first. Again, millions of people died in the war, villages were razed and the economy was destroyed. Opening a shared memorial for the French and the German peoples in Verdun to commemorate the losses of the Weltkrieg could be the first step towards a mending of tensions with the Germans."
 #Cool the relations:
 NATFRA_Franco_German_Thaw: "Franco-German Cooperation"
 NATFRA_Franco_German_Thaw_desc: "With the first step done, it may be time to work deeper towards burying the hatchet with the Germans. Their help, much as we loathe to admit it, was necessary for us to return to the Métropole, and plunging Europe into another war we would struggle to win might be folly. Now must be the time for peace."
 #Trade Up with Mitteleuropa, slightly down with Entente:
 NATFRA_Franco_German_Trade: "Franco-German Trade"
 NATFRA_Franco_German_Trade_desc: "It is undeniable that the German Empire is now the dominant power in Europe, both militarily and most importantly economically, despite the recent economic meltdown. As we strive to reposition ourselves on the world stage, perhaps aligning ourselves with Mitteleuropa is the right choice for the prosperity of France."
 #Joint Factories with GER if they agree:
 NATFRA_Franco_German_Business: "Franco-German Business"
 NATFRA_Franco_German_Business_desc: "In the hope of making the current détente with the Germans a lasting one, several businessmen have approached our government requesting that we help them find contacts in the German sphere to create cross-national corporations for the benefit of both of our nations."
 #Event chain working towards NAP or continuing the rivalry:
 NATFRA_Congress_of_Verdun: "Congress of Verdun"
 NATFRA_Congress_of_Verdun_desc: "Germany and France have long been rivals: no place is a better representative of this than Verdun, this gate between two great nations where so many fell in 1916. It is also where in 843, France and Germany were first separated by the heirs of Charlemagne. Many diplomats are hoping it could also be where a congress for lasting peace is called, and perhaps where a new Franco-German relationship could be born."

 #Strong bond with the Brits:
 NATFRA_Indestructible_Bonds: "Indestructible Bonds"
 NATFRA_Indestructible_Bonds_desc: "Throughout the exile, the British always remained at our side. Together, we fought through the reconquest of our home territories to return to our birthright. Our rivalry from hundreds of years ago has been put to rest through the fires of the last few decades of friendship between our two nations! Long live the Entente Cordiale!"
 #Colony Trade:
 NATFRA_French_New_World: "French New World"
 NATFRA_French_New_World_desc: "With our return to the Métropole secured, we can look outwards towards the New World once more. During the exile, our colonies abroad largely fell under the protection of the British. Now it is time to request their return!"
 #Move to free trade law:
 NATFRA_Anglo_French_Free_Trade: "Anglo-French Free Trade"
 NATFRA_Anglo_French_Free_Trade_desc: "While our nations are no longer the globe-spanning behemoths that they were before the Great War, our influence together is still vast. We must move towards a policy of free trade amongst our combined Anglo-French spheres."

 ENT_france_agree_mittel_tt: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to enter Mitteleuropa"

 #Add radars:
 NATFRA_Guard_Channel: "Guard the Channel"
 NATFRA_Guard_Channel_desc: "The channel is the lifeblood that connects France and Britain. We must work towards keeping it secured against any threat that prowls. A system of long-range radars to scan for threats is the first step to securing the channel."
 #More recruitable pop:
 NATFRA_Re_Conscription: "Reimplement Conscription"
 NATFRA_Re_Conscription_desc: "France has always been a nation of citizen-soldiers. Frenchmen all serve a few years in the armed forces, a tradition that was kept alive both in the Commune and in exile. This service had recently been suspended to free up men for reconstruction: in light of recent tensions, we will reactivate mandatory military service."
 #Add forts along German border:
 NATFRA_Secure_Eastern_Front: "Secure the Eastern Border"
 NATFRA_Secure_Eastern_Front_desc: "The failures of 1919 must never be repeated! Our lines must hold firm in any future wars against the Germans on our eastern border. We must build stronger fortifications to repel their advances wherever they come from."
 #Surrender limit:
 NATFRA_Never_Fall_Again: "Never Shall We Fall Again"
 NATFRA_Never_Fall_Again_desc: "The exile has taught us a harsh lesson! Never again will France fall to invaders or revolutionaries. We shall redouble any effort to defend the patrie with all that we have. France will always stand tall and proud against any threat!"
 #Attack and Defence boost against Germany:
 NATFRA_Prepare_For_War: "Prepare for War with Germany"
 NATFRA_Prepare_For_War_desc: "The Boches have proved time and time again that they are forever the enemies of the people of France. The atrocities they committed against us in the last two wars and their current attitude make any hope of reconciliation null. If a third war is needed, we will be ready to avenge our heroes and destroy the monstrous chimaera known as Germany!"
 #Make this better than Alsace or War:
 NATFRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine: "Demand the Return of Alsace-Lorraine"
 NATFRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine_desc: "Since 1870, the Germans have occupied the French territory of Alsace-Lorraine. We must right this wrong and demand that it be surrendered to France! If the Germans refuse our terms, we will have no choice but to renew our fury against these enemies of peace and civilisation!"
 #Request Naval Doctrine from ENT leader:
 NATFRA_English_Doctrine: "Joint Franco-British Naval Strategy?"
 NATFRA_English_Doctrine_desc: "Long have the British ruled the seas. With our friendship and alliance between our two nations, we have the opportunity to request the aid of some naval experts to help teach us their tactics and work together to ensure better coordination between our task forces in any joint operations that we undertake in the future."

 NATFRA_Kings_Made_France: "The Kings Made France..."
 NATFRA_Kings_Made_France_desc: "France was born in 508 with the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks: since then, his descendants have reigned upon France and led her countless times to glory. France was built by the tireless efforts of her kings, and without them she was nothing: orphaned, she erred and fell. But this tragedy is over, long live the King!"
 NATFRA_Pays_Naturels: "Recognise the Pays Naturels"
 NATFRA_Pays_Naturels_desc: "In an effort to destroy the true France, the Republicans in their manic obsession with rationality created entirely artificial administrative subdivisions, denying any local identities, dialects and traditions, going as far as imposing the Parisian dialect as 'proper' French. We will undo this injustice and recognise the various natural and cultural regions within France."
 NATFRA_Province_Parliament: "Restore the Provincial Parliaments"
 NATFRA_Province_Parliament_desc: "The realm had traditionally been divided between various provinces, each with their own assemblies tasked with administering their area according to local rights and privileges, ensuring that each part of France was ruled in a perfectly tailored way. These provincial parliaments were of course abolished by the Revolution, ending centuries of harmonious autonomy: they will be restored."
 NATFRA_Expand_Camelot: "Expand the Camelots"
 NATFRA_Expand_Camelot_desc: "The Camelots du Roi, youths originally tasked with selling the Action Française newspaper, have evolved into an intensely loyal paramilitary force. By making membership mandatory for youngsters and organising youth camps inspired by scouting to teach useful skills as well as instil strong religious values and respect of authority, we will be able to undo the damage inflicted by the Commune upon the young generation."
 NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny: "Authority not Tyranny"
 NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny_desc: "Much like subordination is not slavery, authority must not be tyranny. The King must and will be akin to a loving father, firm when needed, ready to give impartial justice, but otherwise leaving his children, the people, free to enjoy their natural rights and exercise their traditional privileges and freedoms."
 NATFRA_Honour_House_France: "Glorify the House of France"
 NATFRA_Honour_House_France_desc: "The House of France, that is the royal family, have proved time and time again their personal qualities. Brave, pious, intelligent, caring, each a worthy descendant of Saint Louis and model for all of us. Some of our freed countrymen might still be coming to terms with the restored monarchy, we must make sure they know how lucky they are to be once again led by the Dynasty."
 NATFRA_Social_Doctrine: "Enforce the Social Doctrine"
 NATFRA_Social_Doctrine_desc: "The Social Doctrine of the Church is a wide ranging compendium of teachings related to the Common Good of society. More than political ideas, they are a moral imperative for any true Catholic to follow, demanding subsidiarity, solidarity, and human dignity. As the monarch of the Eldest Daughter of the Church, the king will ensure that these principles are scrupulously followed by all."
 NATFRA_Consecrate_Heart: "Consecration to the Immaculate Heart"
 NATFRA_Consecrate_Heart_desc: "Since 1638, France has been consecrated to the Virgin Mary, now eternal Queen of France. But to show our gratitude towards the Holy Mother for her protection which permitted us to reconquer her kingdom, we will renew this vow, this time consecrating the realm to her Immaculate Heart, symbol of her compassionate love for all people."
 NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse: "Blame the Gueuse, Accuse the Boches"
 NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse_desc: "Because of the pathetic elites of the Republic, the war was lost. Then, much like the Germans had encouraged the existence of the Gueuse to weaken France in 1871, they inoculated the nation with the socialist plague during the Great War. They wanted France weak and divided: no more! The king has finally returned, our misled people have awoken, and the Anti-France, republican or syndicalist, has been cast out."
 NATFRA_Coopt_Cercle_Proudhon: "Found the Cercle Proudhon"
 NATFRA_Coopt_Cercle_Proudhon_desc: "We will create a 'Cercle Proudhon', a think-tank made up of National-Syndicalist leaders inspired by the works of Proudhon, Sorel, and, more surprisingly, Charles Maurras. They are the most amiable of the syndicalist factions: we will make use of their popularity to help our people make peace with the new order."
 NATFRA_Prole_no_More: "Proletarians no More!"
 NATFRA_Prole_no_More_desc: "The 1789 Revolution stripped our people of their traditional rights and privileges, turning them into an exploited class, the proletariat at the mercy of Capital. The Anti-France capitalised on their righteous anger, leading them further astray. No more! Their rights restored, there is no longer a single proletarian in France, only proud artisans, proud peasants, proud workers."

 NATFRA_Remember_Verdun: "Rekindle the Memory of Verdun"
 NATFRA_Remember_Verdun_desc: "Though Pétain has been viciously slandered by Communard propaganda for years, even this effort could not make Frenchmen forget that he is the man who led them towards victory at Verdun and greatly improved living conditions at the front. An entire generation still vividly remembers his fateful call: \"They shall not pass!\". We will make full use of this to reconcile our people with the new regime."
 NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom: "Restore Religious Freedom"
 NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom_desc: "The deeply anticlerical leftists sought to break the Church. Though state atheism was too much of a risk for the Reds to take, the faithful were derided and bombarded with propaganda, religious education was banned, and public expression of religion was hardly constrained. No more: though France remains a secular state, this antagonising of religion will immediately stop."
 NATFRA_Incentivise_Philanthropy: "Incentivise Philanthropy"
 NATFRA_Incentivise_Philanthropy_desc: "The State will always be inefficient to meet the people's needs, and a welfare state would only encourage parasitism: instead the more philanthropic among our people will be encouraged by tax breaks and honours to donate to and care for the needy, so that one day state socialism will be fully dismantled."
 NATFRA_Denounce_Party_Politics: "Denounce Party Politics"
 NATFRA_Denounce_Party_Politics_desc: "The Third Republic fell into instability, which led us to our defeat in the Great War, while the Marshal had to put a stop to the petty infighting of the exiled Republic. Clearly, party politics are to blame for much of this, as individuals chose their group interests over what was best for France. Elected officials will no longer affiliate with parties, and instead will have to shine of their own merit."
 NATFRA_Perm_Advisors: "Apolitical Permanent Advisors"
 NATFRA_Perm_Advisors_desc: "Too often, the French governments and lawmakers put in place legislation without knowing the first thing about the topic in question, whether that be industry, science or the economy. As such the Marshal will appoint permanent, apolitical technical advisors to every committee, every commission, to ensure that the uninformed mistakes of the past do not occur again."
 NATFRA_Electoral_System: "Streamlined Electoral System"
 NATFRA_Electoral_System_desc: "The Republican electoral system was far too prone to being abused by the whims of a people easily whisked into frenzy. To prevent the instability that led to the downfall of France, we will deeply reform it. Longer mandates, less MPs, merely partial renewal of parliament, of course empowering the executive or creating a Supreme Court will surely make for more rational politics."
 NATFRA_Disinterested_Experts: "A Government of Disinterested Experts"
 NATFRA_Disinterested_Experts_desc: "No longer will France be run into the ground by inept professional politicians, instead it will thrive under the guidance of pragmatic men, free from the influence of any parties, no longer slaves to political passions, who have worked and succeeded on their own before being called to serve France."
 NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus: "Dismantle the Red Virus"
 NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus_desc: "Like an insidious malady, socialism has spread over the last century in French consciousnesses, from deranged intellectuals, to politicians, to the humblest of labourers. It first led to economic stagnancy, then instability, and finally revolution and civil war. If we want to avoid reliving the same nightmare, this red plague must be fought in every aspect of life, meticulously rooted out."
 NATFRA_Admin_Reorg: "Administrative Reorganisation"
 NATFRA_Admin_Reorg_desc: "The pre-war administration was simply a waste. Too many subdivisions, too many bureaucrats, using too many resources and creating too many regulations, which led to increased taxes, less productivity, less production. Simply put, administrative red tape merely stifled the best and brightest while only increasing the burden on others: it's time to cut it down to the minimum."
 NATFRA_End_State_Meddle: "End State Meddling"
 NATFRA_End_State_Meddle_desc: "The French Republic has countless times pathetically attempted to participate in the economy, leading more often than not to embarrassing failure: bureaucrats who have hardly ever held a real job are simply not well versed in the subtle art of profit. It's time to end this masquerade and restrict the role of the state to what it does best: hold up the rule of Law."
 NATFRA_Marshal_Above_Liberty_Below: "Marshal Above,\nLiberty Below"
 NATFRA_Marshal_Above_Liberty_Below_desc: "Thanks to the caring guidance of the Lion, France is ready to go forward. Much work remains to be done, but Frenchmen can finally rest easy, knowing that the brightest and most competent minds of our era have been assembled to undo the damage done by syndicalism and avoid the errors of the bloated quasi-socialist Third Republic. Never again will the rule of law be threatened."

 NATFRA_Marshal_idea_flip_tt: "Replace §YNational Revitalisation, New Politics,§! and §YAdministrative Reorganisation§! with §YA Technocratic State§!\nEffective net change:\n$MODIFIER_RESEARCH_SPEED_FACTOR$: §G+2.50%§!"

# Democratic #

 NATFRA_Republic_In_Charge: "The Republic Back in Charge!"
 NATFRA_Republic_In_Charge_desc: "After years of struggle at home and abroad against tyranny, the French Republic is one and indivisible again. Much remains to be done, but the free people of the world can celebrate this triumph of democracy and liberty!"
 NATFRA_Prepare_New_Elections: "Prepare New Elections"
 NATFRA_Prepare_New_Elections_desc: "The mainland reconquered, we must show that our promises of democracy were true. The French people will express their sovereign will in the first legislative elections in years, so that their representatives may be elected and get to work on the arduous task of rebuilding our nation."
 NATFRA_Colonel_Coup: "The Colonel's Gambit"
 NATFRA_Colonel_Coup_desc: "France is still deeply unstable: parliamentarism is what led her to her downfall more than two decades ago, and we will not make the same mistake again. To ensure the future stability of the Republic, de La Rocque has appealed to the heroes of the reconquest and stepped in to maintain order until a new, more stable democracy is crafted."
 NATFRA_Radical_Reconciliation: "Radical Reconciliation"
 NATFRA_Radical_Reconciliation_desc: "The left-wing of the Radical party had backed the revolution, before being largely sidelined by more radical socialists. They have now seen the errors in their ways and the reunited Radicals have won the day: social reform will help our people more smoothly transition back to republicanism."
 NATFRA_Maintain_Concentration: "Maintain the Concentration"
 NATFRA_Maintain_Concentration_desc: "To protect the reunited Republic against radicalism and tyranny from both right and left, moderate Republicans have formed a broad moderate coalition and won the day, ensuring a return to normalcy after decades of troubles: the spirit of the Third Republic lives on."
 NATFRA_Revive_National_Bloc: "Revive the National Bloc"
 NATFRA_Revive_National_Bloc_desc: "It is the duty of every Frenchman to stand tall against the ever-lurking socialist threat: a broad coalition of right-wing parties, from more traditional Catholics conservatives to the PSF, has won the day, decisively showing that our people want to once and for all put behind them the errors of the past."
 NATFRA_Maintain_Military_Rule: "Maintain Military Rule"
 NATFRA_Maintain_Military_Rule_desc: "France is simply not yet ready to return to democracy, too many threats seeking to tear apart the Republic are lurking. Our armed forces so recently crowned with the laurels of victory will temporarily hold on to power until stability is fully restored and democratic life can safely resume."

 NATFRA_Administrative_Decentralization: "Administrative Decentralisation"
 NATFRA_Administrative_Decentralization_desc: "Attempting to undo decades of syndicalist efforts in decentralisation would be simply foolish: while France has since the dawn of the Republic been a very centralised nation, there is nothing stopping us from simply adapting to this new status quo, and reform it to better fit the restored order."
 NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms: "Legitimise Reformist Unions"
 NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms_desc: "Denied reform, workers turned to violence and class warfare in the hope of bettering their conditions, and thus was born the revolution. To prevent such tragedy, dialogue between capital and labour must happen and reform must be possible: unions that officially renounce revolutionary rhetoric will be welcomed back within workplaces, even if they profess some form of socialism."
 NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws: "Negotiate New Labour Laws"
 NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws_desc: "Under the auspices of the government, labour and capital, as well as representatives from various parties and interest groups, have joined together to discuss reforms to labour laws, often sidestepped in the wake of the syndicalist defeat. Our people can and must be confident in the Republic's tireless defence of their interests."
 NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty: "Abolish the Death Penalty"
 NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty_desc: "In 1791 already our forefathers had passionate debates relating to the end of capital punishment, and since then our great men, such as Hugo, Gambetta, Clemenceau, Jaurès have tirelessly advocated for the abolition of the death penalty. It is finally time to take this step forward: the bloodlust of the guillotine has been satiated by these decades of fratricidal conflict."
 NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services: "Nationalise Public Services"
 NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services_desc: "Desyndicalisation has occasionally strayed zealously and aggressively far, in some domains leading to a drop in quality of life of our citizens: to correct this error, some public services will be nationalised, in order to deploy them according to the public interest and not profit."
 NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms: "Expand Welfare Reforms"
 NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms_desc: "Continuing and expanding the solidaristic welfare programmes in the vein of the Radical traditions will ensure that our people, still reeling from the war and struggling to rebuild our nation, will still be able to live decently and won't find themselves falling into nostalgia for the syndicalist regime."

 NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions: "Protect Secular Traditions"
 NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions_desc: "The 1905 laws on the Separation of the Churches and the State enshrined laïcité, strict secularism, as one of the pillars of the French Republic. This document, widely decried but ultimately born out of a spirit of conciliation, will be restored, ensuring that neither religious obscurantism nor far-left anticlericalism prevents the Republic from moving forward."
 NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos: "Disband the Dispos"
 NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos_desc: "The PSF's security service, the \"Dispos\" have teetered on the brink of paramilitarism for too long: they have had their use in defending our fledgeling reborn democracy, but we cannot tolerate that private citizens attempt to bypass legitimate law enforcement to maintain order. We will contact de La Rocque so that they can be quietly disbanded."
 NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School: "Reinstitute the Republican School"
 NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School_desc: "When the Republic was still young and fragile, it's mandatory, free education that solidified her position and conquered the hearts and minds of the French nation to Republican values and ideals. The Republic might be triumphant now, but much remains to be done to heal the scars of the last decades, and once again schools will be a critical battleground of ideas."
 NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech: "Enshrine Freedom of Speech"
 NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech_desc: "One of the fundamental rights outlined by the 1789 Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen was freedom of speech. Since then, this right has often been contested: both Communard authorities and the Pétain junta made liberal use of censorship, but no more! Freedom of speech shall be exalted as one of the pillars of the Republic."

 NATFRA_Reorganise_the_Departments: "Reorganise the Departments"
 NATFRA_Reorganise_the_Departments_desc: "The Commune had abolished the departments, the base administrative division of France. Designed to destroy feudal and cultural boundaries in 1789, they were decried as bourgeois, a remnant of the tyranny of so-called Reason. This abolition fostered regionalist sentiment: they will be restored, for a better, more efficient administration of France One and Indivisible, without caving to petty localisms."
 NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism: "Fight Regionalism"
 NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism_desc: "The federal nature of the Commune has emboldened regionalists, and some are openly asking for autonomy for their regions, particularly in Brittany and even in Corsica. Every inch given to these groups is one closer to separatism. Thankfully France has moved past such remnants of the past, she is One and Indivisible!"
 NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations: "Normalise Church Relations"
 NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations_desc: "Relations between the Catholic Church and the Republic have been tense, to say the least, and since 1905 separation of Church and State official diplomatic relations had broken down. However, the Great War and our common opposition to the Commune has brought us closer, and we must now seek appeased relations with the Holy See."
 NATFRA_Combat_Polarization: "Combat Polarisation"
 NATFRA_Combat_Polarization_desc: "Crypto-Communards to the left, reactionaries to the right, here we are in the centre and we must stick together to prevent either kind of despotism from toppling the Republic once again. Politics must not be allowed to fall back into violent rhetoric and irreconcilable oppositions: the name of the game is compromise and unity against radicals."

 NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness: "Privatisation Frenzy"
 NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness_desc: "So much was seized and collectivised by the Commune that there is no way that a functional economy could be rebuilt if we just accepted the status quo: mass privatisation must continue to help France recreate a market economy."
 NATFRA_Create_New_Elite: "Create a New Patronal Elite"
 NATFRA_Create_New_Elite_desc: "Much of the old industrial elites had compromised themselves by throwing themselves at the feet of the military junta, and some whispers that they had plans of outright taking over the state apparatus. Frankly, they can't be trusted. Through the strategic use of government contracts and investments, we will make sure that the right kind of Republican patriots succeeds in the future."
 NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie: "Expand the Gendarmerie"
 NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie_desc: "The Gendarmerie must be expanded and reinforced to enforce order on the rural areas of France, still occasionally plagued by Communard remnants and where the devastation of the war and de-collectivisation has left many in difficult situations, with some turning to crime and the Black Market."
 NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists: "Discredit Republican-Socialists"
 NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists_desc: "The left-wing of the Radicals, who had thrown their lot in with the Revolution, before being marginalised by more radical socialist elements, are attempting to come crawling back to the Republic: we mustn't let traitors and crypto-Syndicalists infiltrate the halls of power."

 NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers: "Reinforce Presidential Powers"
 NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers_desc: "The Third Republic was notoriously unstable: we cannot make the same mistakes as our predecessors, some sort of check on parliamentary power is needed. The president of the Republic must play a unifying role instead of being confined to a purely ceremonial power."
 NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare: "Catholic Social Welfare"
 NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare_desc: "According to the social teachings of the Church, Christian solidarity requires that the state protects the dignity and well-being of our fellow man. As such, extensive welfare reform must take place, and private charity efforts will be strongly encouraged and subsidised."
 NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists: "Integrate Christian Regionalists"
 NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists_desc: "The Church demands subsidiarity, that is to say, that political decisions should be taken at the local level whenever possible, and the centralising urge of the Republic is rather Jacobin in nature. It is only just to welcome those who desire to protect their local traditions, particularly their attachment to the Faith. France is One, but denying her local particularities is foolish."
 NATFRA_Christian_Unions: "Christian Unions"
 NATFRA_Christian_Unions_desc: "Pope Leo XIII outlined in the encyclical Rerum Novarum the mutual duties and rights of capital and labour: among these is the right to unionise, and since then faithful Catholic workers have come together to defend their rights in faith-minded unions. These must be heavily promoted, to counterbalance any kind of remnant of socialist rhetoric among the working class."

 NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures: "Establish Regional Prefectures"
 NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures_desc: "The prefects and sub-prefects are the direct representatives of the state at the local level, with many responsibilities such as law enforcement. They are meant to be neutral checks on elected local authorities, freely nominated by the government. To prevent any future risk of instability, their powers will be extended and their total loyalty to the Republic ensured."
 NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes: "Restore Churches and Parishes"
 NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes_desc: "Though the Commune was not an explicitly atheistic state, it was certainly ferociously anticlerical, and many of our churches have suffered from lack of resources, if not from hostile acts, and war. We will embark on a large-scale restoration effort, providing work and an opportunity to expiate the errors of the past for many."
 NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws: "Blasphemy Laws"
 NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws_desc: "With a new Concordat in place, blasphemy laws will follow. Freedom of speech is, of course, an undeniable right, but freedom ends where the rights of others start: an offence against the religion of the majority of Frenchmen cannot be tolerated, especially as freedom of religion was so often abused by Reds acting under the mask of secularism."
 NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat: "Sign a New Concordat"
 NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat_desc: "The 1905 Laws of Separation of Churches and State were a tragedy engineered by radicals: denying the Catholic nature of France is simply a denial of reality and a deep injustice. A new Concordat will be agreed to with the Holy See, and France once again will proudly deserve her title of Eldest Daughter of the Church, a first step to restoring the place of the Faith in our nation."

 NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree: "Rule by Decree"
 NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree_desc: "To counter the revolutionary threat, an efficient government is needed. The new military junta under Colonel de La Rocque will not bother itself with the pageantry of parliamentary democracy: until order and stability are assured, decisions will be taken and applied by the Colonel, on the advice of patriotic experts in their fields."
 NATFRA_Privatisations_For_Loyalty: "Privatisations For Loyalty"
 NATFRA_Privatisations_For_Loyalty_desc: "To rebuild a functional market economy, privatisation is needed. But to ensure that the best men reap the profits of the renewed greatness of the French nation, it is patriots, loyal to France and the Colonel, that will be prioritised in the sale of formerly public assets."
 NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists: "Hunt Down Crypto-Syndicalists"
 NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists_desc: "Thorough purges of syndicalist elements have already taken place, but among newly professed loyalists the Republic hides many crypto-socialists, waiting for the right opportunity to strike again. Radical-socialists, \"reformist\" unionists, pardoned officers, they will all be investigated and interrogated. Socialism will not be allowed to attack the French nation again."
 NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role: "The Social Role of the Engineer"
 NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role_desc: "The engineer is both a skilled technician and worker, and as such is the perfect link between the popular classes and capital. Engineers must add to their professional and technical skills a deep understanding of our institutions promoting class cooperation so that peace in the workplace can be guaranteed by patriots conscious of the importance of their duty to France."
 NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies: "Expand Corporatist Policies"
 NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies_desc: "France fell because of class conflict because neither capital nor workers respected their mutual duties to each other because they focused on ultimately petty issues of profit instead of their much greater mission: their duty towards their patrie. The government will ensure that these errors will not be repeated, and that class tensions are subjugated by Catholic brotherhood and love for France."
 NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System: "Patriotic Technical School System"
 NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System_desc: "The youths of France are distraught, lost in a new world: a system of patriotic technical schools will be created, for them to learn the practical skills that will be demanded of them in the workforce, as well as through apprenticeship and hands-on experience. From the lost children of the syndicalist cause, we will create a generation of workers proudly helping to rebuild the motherland."

 NATFRA_A_Social_Republic: "A Social Republic"
 NATFRA_A_Social_Republic_desc: "The Republic must be a loving, caring mother to her children and ensure to them all safety, well-being, healthcare, access to education, and a right to work. The syndicalist revolution was brought on by the terrible conditions of the working masses, leading France down towards a dark path out of desperation: the reborn Republic will not make the mistakes that tore her apart again."
 NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic: "A Liberal Republic"
 NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic_desc: "The Republic must be an impartial mother to her children, offering them all manners of freedom and liberty regardless of personal circumstances. Against all odds, the liberal ideals of the Third Republic have been kept alive despite anarchy and tyranny: the Republic reborn brandishes the torch of Liberty and once again shines bright, a true example to all lovers of Reason."
 NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic: "A Catholic Republic"
 NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic_desc: "In 1892, Pope Leo XIII had called on French Catholics to accept the Republic, to take France back from anti-Catholic forces. Despite unceasing persecution from liberals to socialists, the faithful have worked tirelessly, and half a century later, it has been done. Through our efforts, the French Republic has finally been baptised and never again will anyone question the piety of the Eldest Daughter."
 NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic: "A Strong Republic"
 NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic_desc: "The Third Republic fell because of its chaotic nature. This error led to defeat and exile: our reborn Republic will not allow the foolishness of the past to be repeated. Thanks to the leadership of the Colonel, under whom we are all united, France will rise again, her children united in a common purpose, the restoration of her glory.\nUnité!"

 NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic: "Proclaim the Fourth Republic"
 NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic_desc: "To refound the Republic on stronger foundations, leaving the past truly behind, a new constitution has been drafted. It will enshrine our recent reforms and lead the Republic towards a renewed age of prosperity and prestige.\n\nLiberté! Égalité! Fraternité! Vive la France!"
 NATFRA_Social_D_abord: "Social d'Abord"
 NATFRA_Social_D_abord_desc: "Colonel de La Rocque has led France through her darkest hour and will lead for the foreseeable future, to profoundly reforge the Republic and ensure that the tragedy that has torn apart our nation for the last decades never occurs again. Our people finally reunited will not let itself be divided again by the enemies of France.\nVive le Colonel! Vive la France!"

 NFA_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Defeated and facing revolution, the French government chose exile, expecting the newly-established “Federation of the Communes of France” to collapse. As months turned into years, however, the Republic slipped into parliamentary chaos. The armed forces stepped in, forming a thinly-veiled junta under Philippe Pétain. A decade later the regime has stagnated, held together by the ageing Marshal whose reputation is smeared by accusations of despotism and nepotism. With unrest brewing, the French Republic stands at a crossroads but one thing is clear: her sacred duty to free the Métropole. The Exiles prepare for any opportunity to strike..."

 NFA_country_intro_header: "The Situation of the French Republic - History"
 NFA_country_intro_content: "The Third Republic fell in the same way it came to be: in defeat by German arms and facing socialist unrest. As the civil war that followed the Revolution of 1920 came to a close, the government chose exile instead of surrender. They embarked with the Navy towards Algiers, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the Kaiser.\n\nNeither happened, and instead a peace treaty was concluded between the German Empire and the Commune, with little to no regard towards the exiled government. The Commune was recognised as the successor of the French Republic by most of the newly German-aligned world, while the Exiles remained seen as the legitimate government by those who had fought beside them in the Great War. But the refugees refused to be cowed: they renewed their claim as the legitimate government of all of France and her empire and their commitment to the Entente, preparing for any opportunity to strike.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the Exile proved highly unstable. The democratic forces were unable to form a lasting government, instead of descending ever further into petty squabbles, a situation made worse by tensions between Exiles and Pieds-Noirs colonists, and in 1926 the Army stepped in, declared a state of emergency, and formed a thinly-veiled junta under the Lion of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, supported by many heroes of the Great War, such as his protégé Admiral Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu and General Henri Mordacq. As supreme commander of the French military which holds a tight grip on the state, Pétain has total control over France, but the constitution has neither been amended nor annulled and as such the Republic and its institutions continue to exist on paper, though the Parliament does little more than rubber-stamp decisions made by the Marshal and his cadres.\n\nPolitical parties still exist and continue to operate to give to the population the illusion of democracy, though few are idealistic enough to believe they have any real power. The four main political parties are the Radical Party (RAD), the Democratic-Republican Party (PRD), an alliance born in exile of various traditional liberal-conservative parties, the French Social Party (PSF), and the French Action (AF)."

 NFA_country_intro_header_1: "The Situation of the French Republic - Political Situation"
 NFA_country_intro_content_1: "Marshal Pétain is convinced that authoritarian rule is needed for the salvation of France. While the prestige of the Radicals and the PRD is low, as they are seen as holding a share of responsibility in the Defeat and the Revolution as the main parties of the Third Republic, they still enjoy some popular support while the PSF created after the War by veterans is seen by many as striking the needed middle way between democracy and a strong rule: as such banning the parties would create more instability at a time when the Republic cannot afford it.\n\nOn the other hand, none of the democratic parties are strong enough to impose anything on the Marshal, still widely popular among veterans who see him as the Lion of Verdun, while the armed forces see him as the only one able to properly prepare France for the fight against the Internationale. But the regime's balancing act cannot last forever: the more democratically minded are beginning to lose confidence in the regime, while the royalists of the Action Française believe the salvation of France will only come through a toppling of the Republic and its institutions, an idea many within the Army and among traditional French and native elites are worryingly receptive to. To put it simply, the junta is slowly but surely losing political credibility and is now mainly held together by the prestige of Pétain."

 NFA_country_intro_header_2: "The Situation of the French Republic - Growing Concerns"
 NFA_country_intro_content_2: "As if this lack of civilian support wasn't enough, trust in the Marshal is starting to erode within the Army, the backbone of the regime. Pétain's favouritism towards his protégés has put many in key positions, and though they certainly are competent, many officers are left behind while others worry that this could encourage doctrinal rot, that Pétain is surrounding himself with yes-men. Some within the Marshal's entourage have however been openly critical of this state of affairs, such as General Mordacq, and for now, this discontentment within the Army is limited to debate, as many hope that Pétain will eventually listen to his more reform-minded protégés. One thing is clear, however, an escalation of these divisions would prove disastrous for the regime.\n\nThe most important problem facing the nation, however, is simply its situation, in exile. Though in Algeria, officially annexed as part of France as an overseas department last century, Exiles and Pieds-Noirs settlers make up a significant part of the population, in some major cities even making up a majority, overall Europeans are still a small minority ruling over millions of natives, who despite being considered Frenchmen are essentially second-class citizens, subject to heavy taxes and forced labour, with rule from Algiers enforced by native elites and the Army.\n\nSince the defeat in the Great War, the colonial situation is precarious: unrest is ruthlessly put down, recent famines were badly managed, syndicalist and pan-Arab agents spread propaganda against colonial authorities. However, most traditional native elites are still loyal to France, and there exists a growing class of French-educated natives and native war veterans who despite wanting reform remain loyal. But one thing is clear: if the government is careless, further unrest and perhaps even revolts are bound to happen.\n\n§RBe careful! A failure to keep the resistance in non-core African states under 80 will result in revolts.§!"

# Intro and starting politics

 nfa.4.t: "Death of a Friend"
 nfa.4.d: "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, friend of France, our great ally during the Great War and since the Exile, as well as a personal friend of Marshal Pétain since the two met on the battlefields two decades ago has died today at 70 years old.\n\nThough the situation is unfortunately tense at home, given the magnitude of the event it is important for the Entente that the Lion attends the funeral of George V and the coronation of his son Edward, and more personally for Pétain it is important to mourn a friend and ally, who like him oversaw the exile of his people after bloody revolutions in their homelands, and like him was wholeheartedly dedicated to one day come back and retake what is rightfully theirs. And so Marshal Pétain embarked on a special trans-Atlantic flight, ready to honour the memory of a friend but celebrate a new era of Anglo-French friendship."
 nfa.4.a: "The King is dead, long live the King!"

 nfa.5.t: "The Lion in Canada"
 nfa.5.d: "After a long transatlantic flight, Marshal Pétain arrived in Ottawa, greeted by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and a large crowd of Canadians, mostly Québécois who see this state visit as a renewal of Anglo-French cooperation. They then drove to Windsor, where late King-Emperor George had asked to be buried. After a grandiose and emotional ceremony where Pétain was finally able to say farewell to a personal friend and ally, he took a tour of Ontario and Québec, greeted all along the way as a friend of the Empire, before meeting with King Edward VIII.\n\nIn a pre-planned move, the two men shook hands in front of the media of the world, and the new king declared that no matter the struggles the future holds, the French and British nations would always fight side by side in this great crusade against the syndicalist threat. Later on, the two men held a private talk, discussing current issues facing the Entente, the policies that both men were planning on undertaking, as well as the inevitable prospect of war. The mutual undying commitment of both nations to each other was, of course, renewed, announcing even stronger bonds within the Entente."
 nfa.5.a: "Time to return home."

 committed_to_return_home: "Committed to return home"

 nfa.6.t: "Disagreements within the Armée"
 nfa.6.d: "After the Great War, two schools of thoughts have emerged among the younger superior officers to explain the military defeat. If both conclude that the defeat was primarily caused by inefficiency, personal feuds and a general lack of coordination within the military high command, wasting the bravery and blood of the French infantryman as well as the strategic and tactical innovations of then-General Philippe Pétain, they disagree on what caused those issues and most importantly on what should be done to correct them.\n\nTwo men have emerged as the leaders of these factions within the French Army, and both are planning to release books explaining their point of view. They have sent copies to the Marshal in hopes of getting some public support for their work over the opposition."
 nfa.6.a: "Let's see what they wrote."

 nfa.7.t: "The Bear or the Rooster?"
 nfa.7.d: "Henri Mordacq, nicknamed 'the Bear', an infantry general who shot up the ranks during the Great War through sheer bravery and commanding ability, particularly in the desperate defence of Arras. Close to Pétain but a critic of the military establishment, he believes the War was lost due to the lack of experienced officers and an out of touch high command. He plans to release 'Lessons of 1914 and the Next War', detailing his experience of the War and his proposals for the coming conflict. Among those proposals, the retirement of all officers older than fifty-six years old and a merging of all branches of the armed forces could prove controversial, effectively reorganising the Forces Armées from scratch.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, nicknamed 'the Rooster', recently promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. A fellow veteran of the War, he bravely led his men at the battle of Verdun before being wounded and captured. Escaping captivity, he became a symbol of resilience against German aggression. Particularly ambitious, he became a protégé of the Lion of Verdun and a renowned theorist, making similar observations regarding the Defeat but advocating for greater cooperation rather than reorganisation, a greater use of armour with air support, autonomy for officers, and creating alongside the traditional conscripted army a more important core of professional soldiers. These proposals have found support among officers, but de Gaulle is planning to release another essay, simply entitled 'The Discord'. Simply presented as a collection of observations on the confusion reigning among officers during the War, to some it seems to endorse the stab-in-the-back theory popular among civilians, soldiers, and officers alike. Especially considering de Gaulle's proposal to prevent confusion at critical times is the submission of the military to 'moral' civilian power.\n\nMarshal Pétain could choose to support the publication of either of those books, effectively setting the course of reforms within the armed forces, or simply let the debate run its course."
 nfa.7.a: "Support the Bear, while we disagree on some issues, something radical has to be done."
 nfa.7.b: "Support the Rooster, reform is needed but the real issue lies outside of the armed forces."
 nfa.7.c: "The Lion does not need to take sides! Debate is healthy, support neither."

 nfa_lessons_1914_chosen: "Our officers are taught tactics out of Mordacq's book 'Lessons of 1914 and the Next War'."
 nfa_discord_chosen: "Our officers are taught tactics out of de Gaulle's book 'The Discord'."

 nfa.8.t: "Les Leçons de 1914 et la Prochaine Guerre"
 nfa.8.d: "Supported by Marshal Pétain, 'Lessons of 1914 and the Next War'" by General Henri Mordacq has become a best-seller among officers and the general public: after all, most are veterans. While upper-ranking officers grumble about Mordacq's proposal of a sweeping reorganisation of the armed forces, all can see the acuteness of his analysis and enjoy the scathing denunciations of both Kaiser and Reds. The Bear's calls to action, to reform, to be able to stand ready to strike against the Commune at the first opportunity, echo throughout the Republic.\n\nMany are even starting to consider Mordacq a potential political leader, and his calls for reorganisation are being assimilated with a more general discontentment with the political structures of the nation."
 nfa.8.a: "Could the Bear's call really bring change?"

 nfa.9.t: "La Discorde"
 nfa.9.d: "Supported by Marshal Pétain, 'The Discord' by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Gaulle has become a best-seller, praised by critics for its thought-provoking telling of the confusion reigning among officers during the War. While it is nothing new to those that lived through it, many, particularly the younger generations, discover dumbfounded this uncomfortable truth: the Defeat was by our own doing more than anything else. While the tactical and strategic reforms proposed in this essay by de Gaulle have been acclaimed by officers, it is the larger societal reform the Rooster hints at in his work that struck a chord for many, from the veteran and the infantryman to the Lion of Verdun himself. All those sacrifices, so much bloodshed, so many lives lost, how could they have not been enough to beat back the 'Boches'? The issue must lie primarily elsewhere, in the government, too weak to impose its will upon the armed forces and far too willing to let them fall into fatal discord. Perhaps a stronger, moral civilian power is needed.\n\nIn any case, de Gaulle, already a celebrated war hero and influential officer, is becoming an even more popular figure, as many of those touched by his call to reform feel he is the perfect example a new generation of officers must aspire to be like, while some see in him the perfect man to help carry out those larger reforms, though the lieutenant-colonel himself is quick to defer any praise towards his 'mentor', Philippe Pétain."
 nfa.9.a: "Un ordre moral ? Sounds familiar."

 nfa.10.t: "Run on the Bookshops"
 nfa.10.d: "Marshal Pétain having chosen to let this debate among officers run its course, both Mordacq and de Gaulle's books were published on the same day. Both highly anticipated, 'The Discord' and 'Lessons of 1914 and the Next War' have instantly become best-sellers, most bookshops running out of stock quickly and publishers barely being able to keep up with demand. While both essays have been highly praised by critics and the general public alike, their simultaneous publication has prompted comparisons between the two works and become the number one topic of discussion in cafés, family dinners and officer lounges alike. Debates sometimes get heated as they drift from literary to political questions, as people wonder aloud about the implications of the proposed reforms of the two officers, some are starting to see both the Bear and the Rooster as potential political leaders."
 nfa.10.a: "Surtout, n'en parlons pas !"

 nfa.11.t: "Ils en ont parlé..."
 nfa.11.d: "While the debates gripping the nation after the simultaneous publications of Charles de Gaulle and Henri Mordacq's essays had thus far stayed relatively civil, they seem to be spiralling out of control. Last evening, an informal talk about the topic among veterans in an Algiers café turned first into a fight, then a brawl, and, finally, as police were called in to calm the situation, into a small riot. While only light injuries and property damages have been reported, evidently this literary debate has crystallised much deeper issues in our nation and media, officers, and regular citizens alike feel compelled to choose a side. Marshal Pétain has privately asked the Bear and the Rooster to make a joint statement calling for peaceful debate, as both men grow ever more influential."
 nfa.11.a: "A passionate people we certainly are, but this is going too far!"

 nfa.12.t: "La Discorde"
 nfa.12.d: "Despite a lack of support from his patron Marshal Pétain, Charles de Gaulle had his latest book, 'The Discord', published. The Rooster's colourful descriptions of the confusion reigning among officers during the Great War has seen moderate success and received praise by critics, primarily the newspaper Action Française, as an eminently insightful dive into the issues plaguing the armed forces.\n\nHowever, de Gaulle's calls to reforms, though certainly not falling on deaf ears especially among the higher-ranking officers, are overshadowed by the ever-growing popularity of Mordacq's ideas."
 nfa.12.a: "A good read, but not much else."

 nfa.13.t: "The Other Marshal Retires"
 nfa.13.d: "Marshal Franchet d'Espèrey announced his retirement today. He was the only other remaining Marshal in the French military besides Pétain himself, and served as Pétain's right-hand man as vice-president of the Superior War Council, in charge of military affairs when Marshal Pétain was too preoccupied with more stately business. Now that he is gone, the Marshal will have to choose who will serve as his replacement.\n\nHis two protégés, Charles de Gaulle or Henri Mordacq, are expected to be chosen to ascend to these highest of responsibilities. Such a promotion will be seen by many as appointing a successor for the Lion of Verdun, now an old man. Should Mordacq be appointed, it is likely that he would be seen as Pétain's successor, and the move would be perceived as a clear endorsement of Mordacq's plans for sweeping military and political reform. Picking de Gaulle, a much younger man, closer to Pétain and a known sympathiser of the Marshal's unabashed distrust of parliamentarianism, would certainly be perceived as a way to hold on to power for some more time while better preparing his eventual heir to succeed him.\n\nAlternatively, Pétain could simply not appoint a successor to Franchet d'Espèrey, guaranteeing that the hero of Verdun would once again take an active interest in military matters, and centralise power around himself."
 nfa.13.a: "Only the Bear is fit to lead the armies of France."
 nfa.13.b: "The Lion does not need to divide his prerogative."
 nfa.13.c: "We need an officer of the Young Guard, bring in de Gaulle!"

 nfa.14.t: "Les Leçons de 1914 et la Prochaine Guerre"
 nfa.14.d: "Henri Mordacq had his 'Lessons of 1914 and the Next War' privately published, finding moderate success and critical praise for its acute analysis of the defeat, though the sweeping reorganisations proposed by the Bear have proven controversial, among higher officers for being too radical and among the general public for on the contrary not doing enough to tackle the real problem exposed by de Gaulle's essay. However, those less enthusiastic about 'The Discord', particularly those anxious of what a more 'moral' civilian order might entail, have found in Mordacq an alternative and see in the general a potential political leader, someone to go against the grain of the stab-in-the-back fever currently sweeping through the nation."
 nfa.14.a: "An interesting read, shame the Bear fails to see the real issue."

 nfa.16.t: "Maréchal, Merci !"
 nfa.16.d: "Early this morning, Marshal Philippe Pétain signed a short, laconic statement announcing his immediate resignation as head of state of the French Republic. Though this retirement has been carefully prepared by the Lion, and no one in either the government or the administration is surprised by this decision, for many this is the sudden end of an era. Though some are openly rejoicing, most are simply stunned: after all the younger among them have never known a different political situation and for those old enough to remember the Mainland the Marshal has been the centre of political life for more than a decade.\n\nTo prevent any kind of panic and alleviate fears for the future, the hero of Verdun then decided to give a speech in front of the assembled Senate and National Assembly, broadcast on radio: citing his old age as the primary reason for his retirement, the surprisingly cheerful Pétain then proceeded to thank all those that supported him in the troubled times since the Great War, in particular veterans, making less than subtle references to the Bear of Arras, Henri Mordacq, though never naming him.\n\nHis closing statement calling for a peaceful transition of power and reaffirming his full trust in the people to continue the fight to retake the métropole, Marshal Pétain ended his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from his iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: 'Courage, on les aura !'", 'Be strong, we'll get ‘em!'", immediately followed by thunderous applause and a long-standing ovation.\n\nAs the applause died down, a voice cried out: 'Maréchal, merci !', 'Marshal, thank you!', a breach of protocol that all in the room immediately happily imitated. Outside the building, the population had spontaneously come together to say goodbye to the saviour of France, regardless of class and status, exiled, Pieds-Noirs and Algerians, and all repeated this cry, thanking Philippe Pétain as he was leaving on foot, as all the frustrations, all the anger of the past few weeks and years at least momentarily disappeared."
 nfa.16.a: "Maréchal, au revoir !"

 passed_the_torch_tt: "The Marshal will encourage his supporters to back the new regime\n"

 nfa.17.t: "Le Triomphe de l'Ours"
 nfa.17.d: "After a short break, the president of the Assembly invoked Article 7 of the restored Constitutional Laws: in case of vacancy, a new president is to be immediately elected by both chambers of parliament. This special congress already assembled, no name was proposed other than that of general Jean Jules Henri Mordacq. Elected almost unanimously, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio thanking Marshal Pétain for his service, reaffirming his commitment to immediate reform and the mobilisation of the nation to retake the mainland from the Reds.\n\nThough some are still anxious that this transition of power is too sudden and others would have preferred it didn't happen at all, the people already assembled in Algiers to say goodbye to the Marshal and all those all over the republic glued to their radio posts broke out in spontaneous celebrations that lasted long into the night. This morning, only one thing is certain: this is surely the dawn of a new era."
 nfa.17.a: "Général, bienvenue !"

 #Fight for Influence:
 nfa.19.t: "Le Lion et l'Ours"
 nfa.19.d: "Philippe Pétain and Henri Mordacq, the Lion and the Bear, the man who held at Verdun and the hero of the defence of Arras, two legends of the Great War, two men who despite everything else respect and admire each other, now opposed by political issues. While Mordacq has emerged as the leader of the more democratic forces within the nation, Pétain believes a strong, moral rule is needed for the salvation of France. While Marshal Pétain has the support and admiration of many, particularly veterans and more generally the upper classes, Mordacq can count on popular discontentment caused by the tight grip the Army has kept on French society since the defeat. While this is all still a game of political chess, some fear this conflict could escalate. In any case, the tension is palpable as both men scramble to find support."

 nfa.20.d: "The democratic camp has the support of many prominent journalists and intellectuals, and as such Henri Mordacq has come close to dominate public discourse, appearing on the front-pages of a newspaper or another every day, having his speech broadcast on radio to hundreds of thousands of listeners, while the government and Pétain struggle to keep up, used to deal with a usually much more compliant mass media, happy to simply publish whatever the government feeds them. Some in the entourage of the Marshal argue that we should simply let the man speak, let the debate run its course, that this is at most a small upset that would soon blow over. Others argue that, on the contrary, every second that the Bear is free, the regime is a little more in danger, considering him a dangerous, certainly Commune-backed revolutionary. The Marshal himself would instead prefer to go on a media counter-offensive: he after all was known to bolster morale with fiery speeches during the Great War.\n\nWhat should be done?"

 nfa.21.t: "The Airwaves Bounce Back"
 nfa.21.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the competing speech broadcasted by Henri Mordacq has proved more popular than the speech delivered by Marshal Pétain: thousands of listeners tuning in all of the empire to listen to the words of the Bear of Arras, intently listening to his calls to reform and attack on a government supposedly too bloated and ineffective to properly lead France to her rebirth. We may have lost the battle, but not the war, though this setback certainly does not look good even to our most dedicated supporters."

 nfa.23.d: "The entourage of the Marshal is divided on how to deal with Mordacq's coming protest: some argue that these protests are entirely legal, and that banning them would simply prove the Bear's point, making Pétain look tyrannical. Others argue that this would certainly bring more people to his cause and make us look powerless: if Mordacq does not want to fall into illegality, he must get official approval for any mass gathering: it would be easy to find some way to prevent this protest from taking place, whether that be security concerns or some form not turned in on time."

What better way to find out who still has if not the favour, at least the interest of the French people, one would give a speech to a full house, the other to a few die-hard supporters. Unfortunately, this was a gamble, and Pétain lost it. Though a respectable number of people, primarily veterans, came to listen to the Marshal's speech, we must concede defeat: the speech given by Mordacq drew an enormous crowd, and that is all that will be remembered about this day. There is no other way to put it: this is a humiliation."

 nfa.25.t: "The Marshal Draws A Crowd"

What better way to find out who still has if not the favour, at least the interest of the French people, one would give a speech to a full house, the other to a few die-hard supporters. This was a gamble, and Pétain won big. Though a respectable number of people came to listen to Mordacq's speech, his supporters have to admit defeat: the speech given by the Lion drew an enormous crowd, primarily veterans who came to see the hero of Verdun once more. The Marshal urged the people to remain united in these trying times, focused on the coming war with the Commune, ending his speech by the now immortal phrase said at Verdun, two decades ago: 'Courage, on les aura', 'Be strong, we'll get 'em', though whether this was aimed at the Reds or Mordacq's supporters, no one knows."

 nfa.26.d: "Henri Mordacq is a charismatic man, and he has ceaselessly proved it these past few months. He now routinely gives fiery speeches in every venue one could think of, gaining more followers along the way. But Marshal Pétain can still count on the admiration and respect of much of our nation, particularly veterans, and as such some in his entourage propose that the Lion of Verdun too go on a tour of our nation to give competing speeches and draw attention away from Mordacq. Others argue that this could prove dangerous, both for the Marshal's health and for his reputation, making him seem desperate. Finally, there are some convinced that the Bear must be stopped at all costs: denouncing him a seditious individual working in concert with the Commune should do the trick and prevent him from legally giving speeches."
 nfa.26.a: "Just let him talk, he'll tire himself out."

 Deal_With_Political_Opposition_Barrack_desc: "Though the armed forces still overwhelmingly support the Marshal, some are proving receptive to the promises of Mordacq: the armed forces have traditionally stayed clear of political involvement, but the debate with the Bear is growing too important for the 'Grande Muette' to ignore. Something must be done to make sure the armed forces stay on the right side."

 nfa.27.t: "Whispers in the Great Mute"
 nfa.27.d: "Democratic pamphlets, editions of 'Lessons of 1914' and the agitation slowly spreading among civilians have been making their way to active duty soldiers. So far, these attempts by the democratic camp have proven somewhat unfruitful, but the armed forces are the backbone of the Marshal's regime: dissidence here cannot be tolerated. Of course, soldiers openly speaking against the Marshal will be punished, but some among the officer corp are arguing for more proactive measures. By staying vigilant of the mood in officer lounges and barracks alike, we can quietly deal with agitators by promoting our most loyal supporters or assigning opponents to patrols in the deepest parts of the Sahara where they can ramble without causing trouble, while tighter control of incoming mail will prevent factious literature from making its way into the wrong hands, though this might anger some and prove difficult to enforce. What should be done?"

 nfa.29.t: "Le Lion et les Exilés"
 nfa.29.d: "Already the most well developed of France's colonies, Algeria's economy greatly benefited from the exile of many Frenchmen, particularly much of France's elites, and the economic mobilisation required by the Marshal to keep the nation on the pied-de-guerre, ready for conflict with the Reds at any time. As such, as Marshal Pétain seeks increased support from diverse powerful groups in his struggle with Mordacq's partisans, he has found particular luck with the industrial upper classes, both grateful for the support that gave them the opportunity to strive after exile and deeply ideologically committed to the regime, believing a strong hand is needed to guide France towards salvation.\n\nHowever, to prevent these elites from being tempted by the more democratic forces within the Republic, many of Pétain's advisors are suggesting a campaign of increased support and strategic investments: not only would this develop the nation's economy and war capabilities even further, but by choosing carefully those who would benefit from these investments, for example both loyal supporters of the regime and those still tempted by Mordacq's rhetoric, the Lion's grip on power could be restored, maybe even increased."

 nfa.31.d: "As Marshal Pétain scrambles to get in touch with the powerful few, whose support he is most reliant on to stay in power, his machinations are ever so slowly coming to light to officers, those in the know, and finally the general population. While most dismiss these rumours for now, there are some on the contrary, who see in recent government contracts and official meetings, naked attempts by Pétain to bribe influential men, before an eventual confrontation with Henri Mordacq's democratic partisans. Perhaps a change in course is in order for the Lion, as, while effective, this consolidation of power could fuel the resentment of regular citizens and those influential yet not powerful enough to be considered for these \"gestures of goodwill\" by the Marshal."
 nfa.31.a: "Baseless accusations!"

 nfa.32.t: "Le Canard"
 nfa.32.d: "Today, a weekly satirical newspaper close to the democratic opposition has revealed many of the more shady dealings the government has been involved in since the game of political chess between Marshal Pétain and General Mordacq started. How they got this information is a mystery but the paper has gleefully promised new revelation in the coming weeks. These accusations have spread like wildfire throughout the nation, severely damaging the reputation of the Marshal as an incorruptible, moral man, greatly bolstering the claims of the democratic camp, and some whisper that the Lion of Verdun should step down. Alternatively, the government could shut down the paper, stay on the same course of action and try to weather the storm or on the contrary, come clean, or at least find a scapegoat and try to repair the damage."
 nfa.32.a: "Shut down this newspaper and let us weather this storm."
 nfa.32.b: "Perhaps this was a bad idea after all, let's come clean and try to repair the damage."

 nfa.33.t: "Opération Toccata"
 nfa.33.d: "The civil administration is paralysed by corruption, the state coffers are empty, and the Army is led by sycophants and pompous upstarts. The failure of Pétain's government is unacceptable, and unless we act, soon the country will sink into chaos and it will be the end of us all. This must not be allowed to happen.\n\nTo save the nation, a secret committee led by Mordacq, the head of all the democratic parties, and the generals on our side has been urgently created. We need to get rid of Pétain now, before it's too late! The plan is simple: Pierre Lelong of the Deuxième Bureau, will participate in Pétain's crisis meetings. He will bring a suitcase with him filled with explosives, which will explode as soon as he leaves the building, killing both Pétain and his most influential allies."
 nfa.33.a: "Let's pray for his success."

 nfa.34.t: "L'Incorruptible"
 nfa.34.d: "As Pétain's scramble to consolidate power is slowly becoming more and more apparent to the general public, the government has started to realise that while the majority of our nation still stands behind the Lion of Verdun, breaking the people's trust in the incorruptibility of the Marshal could bring more people towards Mordacq's camp... and possibly an end to Pétain's presidency. As such, the president's advisors have put together a plan to silence rumours of any wrongdoing: a large scale anti-corruption drive, at all levels of society. By making corruption an even more serious offence, encouraging denunciation of even the slightest hint of it and more generally enforcing a renewed moral order within the administration and public services, the government hopes that the public will turn a blind eye to Pétain's recent promises of support and investment to various groups, individuals and industries.\n\nHowever, a fair amount of resources will be needed to fuel this drive, and though this plan could help Philippe Pétain maintain power some in the government argue that these resources could be better used to try to find even more support for the regime, while others argue that these measures could alienate parts of the administration."

 nfa.35.t: "La Chute"
 nfa.35.d: "As the full scale of the deeply rooted corruption plaguing the Pétain government had been revealed over the last few weeks in the press, disbelief was replaced by anger. Protests calling for the president's resignation grew in size with each passing day. The Marshal, either unwilling or unable to take any radical action to protect his regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Palace in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the elites he had tried so hard to rally withering. All could see the writing on the wall, his rule could not last much longer, there was no going back: in the people's mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly willing to sell out the country to hold on to power, was left.\n\nToday, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of protests instead seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarters of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his government, invoking Articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relating to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the shady dealings revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with tense applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the President.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few guardsmen still loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."
 nfa.35.a: "At least he went down with flair."

 nfa.36.t: "Le Lion est mort..."
 nfa.36.d: "After a short break, the arrest of Marshal Pétain confirmed, the president of the Assembly invoked article 7 of the Constitutional Laws: in case of vacancy, a new president is to be immediately elected by both chambers of parliament. This special congress assembled late in the night, no name was proposed other than that of General Henri Mordacq, elected with a vast majority of votes, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Coincidentally present in the building, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio, promising to free the Republic of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, promising new elections in the near future and eventually a new constitution. Despite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters hope for radical reform and a more democratic future. Despite Pétain's best efforts, a new dawn is rising on the French Republic and the Bear's promised reforms can only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."
 nfa.36.a: "... Vive l'Ours !"

 nfa.37.t: "The Trial"
 nfa.37.d: "'The defendant, who appears today, has aroused for many years the most diverse feelings: an enthusiasm that you remember, a kind of love. On the contrary, he has also raised feelings of violent hatred and hostility.\n\nAt the start of this hearing, where these passionate feelings must be extinguished, I want to insist on this: we know only one passion, under three aspects. Passion for truth, passion for justice, and passion for our country. I therefore ask the public to remember that, while we are prosecuting a defendant today, History will judge the judges themselves one day.'\n\nWith these words, the president of the High Court opened the first hearing of a long trial to prosecute Pétain, accused of corruption, treason and conspiracy against the Republic. Determined to defend his honour, Marshal Pétain prepared both his defence and his memoirs from his cell in the Casbah of Algiers, only allowed visits by his wife and his lawyer. Appearing in court in full uniform, after a short statement on the first day of his trial asserting that all of his actions as president had been taken in the interest of the salvation of France and that he was only responsible in front of the French people and not the High Court, the former president stayed silent as witnesses after witnesses corroborated the accusations lobbied against him. After weeks of passionate debate, the sentence has finally been given: death. At this verdict, the Marshal who had stayed so stoic briefly showed weakness, lost his composure, briefly the Lion of Verdun turned into Philippe Pétain, a tired old man of more than 80 years of age.\n\nPublic opinion is incredibly divided, but it seems that if most wanted the Marshal gone from power, the majority thinks any sentence would be going too far, let alone the death penalty. Wanting to avoid making this trial too overtly partisan, Henri Mordacq has thus far stayed silent, however as president it is within his power to commute Pétain's sentence."
 nfa.37.a: "The High Court sentenced Pétain to death, and we won't interfere."
 nfa.37.b: "Commute his sentence to life in prison! He will not be a martyr."
 nfa.37.c: "Pétain is not a threat, commute his sentence to house arrest!"

 nfa.38.t: "Le Redressement Français"
 nfa.38.d: "As Marshal Pétain scrambles to rekindle his support among the upper classes, one group in particular has risen in prominence. Calling itself the Redressement Français, the French Renewal, part employers' association, part think-tank, part propaganda arm of the forward-minded upper classes, intent on 'bringing together the elites and educating the masses', fanatically anti-syndicalist and all dedicated to the Lion, they have proved extremely useful in the government's attempts at securing power and could prove to be the ally the Marshal needs to finally achieve his vision of a strong, renewed France, ready to take on the Reds.\n\nAdvocating for a reorganisation and streamlining of the administration and political system, a greater care of the upper classes for the social question as well as generally more class collaboration, strong property rights, a greater involvement of 'patriotic industrialists and intellectuals' in policy-making through specialised commissions, along with a healthy dose of scepticism towards traditional parliamentary democracy that they consider bloated and in part responsible for the revolution, they have been decried by the more liberal opposition as technocratic, condescendingly paternalistic, and corporatist. Nevertheless, their support and expertise has proved invaluable for the regime and Pétain has met repeatedly with representatives from the organisation, taking some of its members as special advisors to help him navigate the crisis currently unfolding and the ideas of the Redressement Français will no doubt have a tremendous amount of influence in the decisions taken by the Marshal going forward."
 nfa.38.a: "A nation ruled like a company, then?"

 nfa.39.t: "En Marche!"
 nfa.39.d: "The Republic is calm, surprisingly so. After months of turmoil, debate, protest, of media frenzy, it feels like everything is back in order. Marshal Pétain's gamble to hold on power has paid off: with the Redressement Français' precious help, he has managed to thoroughly secure the support of the upper classes, rekindle the admiration of the people, and calm down social unrest. The democratic camp still exists, but it has been severely weakened by media attacks and backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans, its support base greatly eroded by the government's promises of reform. It's rumoured that Mordacq himself has struck a deal with the government. Many thought this would be the end of his regime, and yet Philippe Pétain emerges from this crisis stronger than ever: The Bear's faction is no longer a threat, and the people once again have put their trust in the Lion of Verdun. While the Marshal has had a strong grip on politics since the revolution, it seems that now nothing can stop him from truly reforming the republic according to his wishes.\n\nOr, some whisper, according to the Redressement Français' wishes. Its help proved decisive: on an ideological level, as many of the reforms proposed by Pétain are lifted straight from their ideas, and on the material level, the Renewal having turned itself into the propaganda arm of the government during the crisis, funding and organising its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime's stabilisation came in large part thanks to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think tank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and, more importantly, with Pétain's trust and gratitude. They will no doubt have a large influence shaping the future of the Republic, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group's writings. In any case, now that the crisis is over the entire nation's attention is turned towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. The people now fully united behind Marshal Pétain, finally free from petty divisions, is ready to save the Patrie."

 nfa.40.t: "Opération Toccata"
 nfa.40.d: "It was around two o'clock, and most of Pétain's allies had arrived at the Grand Quartier Général. D'Argenlieu, de Gaulle, all hoped to find a plan to stay in power and avoid the fall of the Marshal. Only Lelong was missing from the call, he had just managed to take a taxi to his appointment.\n\nIn the car, he held his briefcase tightly like a soldier holding his gun as all the steps of Mordacq's plan were played out in his head. Everything had been carefully studied, the plans of the building had been analysed to ensure that the General could leave him alive, but he knew that there was no such thing as zero risk. He took a picture of himself with his wife and children out of his pocket, and put it back in his pocket a few seconds later, praying that the driver would not have seen anything.\n\nOnce he arrived in front of the HQ, Lelong got out of the vehicle, head held high, well aware that he could no longer reverse...\n\nArriving late in front of the building, he apologised to the officers who were guarding him, then went to join the meeting. After greetings and a series of apologies and explanations for his delay, he went to sit down and listened to the various proposals, having taken care to settle as close as possible to Pétain. The discussions and debates followed, then he pretended the need to go to the bathroom to get up and leave the room, leaving his briefcase behind him. Weygand intercepted him before he came out and asked him what he had brought with him. 'Confidential documents that were successfully stolen from Mordacq, we even found a plan to assassinate Pétain. I will open it when everyone has finished talking,' Lelong replied. Before leaving the room, he took one last look to see who was there."

 nfa.41.d: "Taking care to close the door behind him, he kept telling himself that the point of no return had been reached. Fear paralysed him for a few long minutes before he was able to come to his senses, and opened the toilet window, and began to come out.\n\nAn explosion sounded in his back and shook the whole building. The alarm was triggered and panic soon spread throughout the HQ. Through all the sounds of broken windows and overturned chairs, he could hear a voice screaming, 'He's not dead! He's not dead! He's not dead! Call a doctor,' and immediately recognised Charles de Gaulle's voice. As adrenaline flowed through his body, he ran to the meeting room, picking up a fallen soldier's rifle as he passed by one of the doors that had previously been guarded before the explosion. The door fell with a simple touch, and Lelong saw Pétain covered with blood but with wide open eyes and at his side de Gaulle. Panicked and determined to complete the mission, Lelong fired two bullets into the Marshal's chest, and a third went to lodge in the General's head beside him. Both collapsed to the ground, covered in blood. Lelong then threw his weapon away, and ran back to the toilet before speeding out through the window overlooking the back of the building. He then reached the door at the back, which was no longer guarded because the soldiers had been called inside. In the street, a car was waiting for him, in which he immediately jumped in the direction of the Mordacq headquarters..."

 nfa.43.t: "Put down the Bear"
 nfa.43.d: "At 6 am today, Henri Mordacq was arrested on charges of offence towards the Chief of State, conspiracy against the State and treason. Knowing full well resisting arrest would only be inviting the regime to put him down on the spot, the Bear went peacefully. Immediately transferred to a secret location near Algiers, news of his arrest was triumphantly spread by the government to the media, feeding them a colourful story of the fool Mordacq conspiring with Red agents to take down the Pétain government and invite the Reds in. While it's undeniable that some supporters of Mordacq had ties to the more left wing pre-war parties and some of those arrested have confessed under strong interrogation techniques to be on the Commune's payroll, the evidence of such collusion is light, at best. Despite being offered a generous deal in exchange for his confession, Mordacq himself so far refuses to admit doing anything wrong. Surprisingly, many are openly doubting the official story. Arresting such a popular war hero is not going well even among strong supporters of the regime, particularly veterans who remember very well the heroic defence of Arras, and even within the Army many who would have been at worst apathetic with repressing the democratic movement are now outraged that the government would go so far.\n\nIn any case, what Pétain feared happened: Henri Mordacq is now a martyr. Open contestation from the Army is unprecedented, and many within the government are starting to panic and advise a balanced approach: doubling down on the repression, going after those now protesting against Mordacq's arrest, while at the same time pulling back somewhat, transfer Mordacq out of hiding, and give him a public trial."
 nfa.43.a: "The sooner this is over, the better."

 nfa.44.t: "Ennemi Public Numéro Un"
 nfa.44.d: "As Henri Mordacq was being transferred from his secret holding location to a fort in Algiers for his trial, the police convoy transporting him was ambushed in a small street of the Casbah: as trucks moved in to block the street, dozens of masked, armed men in civilian clothes swarmed the convoy to free the Bear. Wanting to stay discreet, the escort had been kept to a minimum and was swiftly dealt with, those attempting to resist shot dead, Mordacq escorted to a car and the convoy set on fire all in the span of less than five minutes. Survivors of the attack describe the prisoner as being just as surprised as his escort that this was happening, but clearly someone coordinated this attack from the inside: not only was this transfer supposed to be a secret to even most of the government, but a fake itinerary had been disseminated by intelligence agents and a decoy convoy had been organised. Whoever leaked the information must have been either very well connected, or is very high up in the chain of command. An investigation has of course been launched and all police are on high alert, but while the violence of Mordacq's partisans has earned the regime some sympathy, this spectacular evasion has thrown the government in total panic: not only this shows to the eyes of the world that the regime is losing control, but it shows our people that the democratic movement has very influential friends. In any case, the few advisors still advocating for moderation when dealing with the democratic camp have been thoroughly disgraced with some even under heavy suspicion of being Mordacq sympathisers and those advocating for harsher repression now have the Marshal's ear."
 nfa.44.a: "How could this happen?"

 nfa.45.t: "A Post-Truth Society"
 nfa.45.d: "The regime has always had a strong hold on the media, and on many occasions in the past decades opponents of the regime have found their dirty little secrets, real or fabricated, plastered all over the daily newspapers. When political pressure and intimidation do not work, blackmail and social shaming generally did the trick. However, this treatment was reserved for civilians, as the government and intelligence services were careful to preserve the reputation of the armed forces, dissenters generally being simply sent on assignment in the middle of the Sahara where their concerns wouldn't bother anyone. However, with Mordacq's arrest shocking many, it's been decided that the large amount of information collected over the years by the intelligence services on soldiers and officers alike would be put to good use. The latest victim of such attempted blackmail is Admiral Lucien Lacaze, a known supporter of Mordacq and well liked, successful, and above all morally irreproachable officer. The man has refused to back down when approached by our agents, and denies any of the accusations lobbied against him.\n\nAs such, these shocking revelations will appear in an afternoon special edition in all newspapers. In fact, mysteriously, all those who have publicly stated their support for Mordacq seem to have been cursed to have their most private secrets revealed, which could of course severely hinder their careers and might just spurn them to resign in disgrace."

 nfa.46.t: "The New Affaire des Fiches"
 nfa.46.d: "It seems that despite our extensive control over the nation's media, some officers have managed to find out the truth about the recent wave of scandals hitting Mordacq sympathisers, spread the word about our extensive information gathering networks, and printed out leaflets handed out in barracks and officers' messes alike denouncing the regime and our attempts to prevent officers from speaking their minds. Admiral Lacaze has been made into a new martyr for the democratic camp, and though he retired in the wake of the scandal, it seems he is now in direct contact with Mordacq's partisans. Although this drastically hinders our plans to deal with dissent among the armed forces with some subtlety, there are far more worrying things: not only we have lost whatever trust officers still put in the regime, but the leaflets currently spreading like wildfire contain confidential documents concerning the fabrication of the various scandals, implicating in this defamation campaign high ranking officers as well many within the administration and in the government. There is only one possible conclusion: there is a mole among us and we need to catch her to prevent more leaks."

 nfa.47.t: "Les Parades"
 nfa.47.d: "The constitutional laws and the military code law both prevent the French armed forces, often called La Grande Muette, the Great Mute, to go on strike. But it seems that following the Lacaze Affair and the subsequent revelations leaked to soldiers, officers, and eventually the general public, many outraged officers have ignored this principle, and suddenly decided to walk down the streets to protest. While our forces were supposed to suppress any protest, many police and military officers are confused by this unusual situation and decided to simply stand aside to avoid fighting their comrades and friends. Many civilians are watching this protest out of curiosity, and it is now obvious for everyone that Pétain's rule is far from being popular even within the armed forces, traditionally the one place where the regime was most secure. Since protests are banned for active duty soldiers, the official version of events is that those officers are simply 'parading', a term that most opposition journals, underground or miraculously still being openly published, are now using ironically to designate these protests. The 'Parades' have been going on for days now, and it is time we choose how to deal with the situation. In the meantime; the Deuxième Bureau is still investigating to find the mole that created this ridiculous situation in the first place."

While the protests had so far been mostly about protesting the regime's policies, they have now taken a radical turn and openly call for the Marshal to step down, believing him unfit to rule even a second more, though many still hesitate to put the blame on him personally as some consider him senile and under control from his close advisors. In any case, the number of protestors is increasing each day, and our forces still refuse to take any active action against them, at best barring access to the way to the presidential palace and other important government buildings, with discrete but numerous gestures of solidarity between the two. The most radical forces within the regime believe it would be better to act immediately and that it might already be too late to stop Mordacq, still on the run."

The Marshal and his advisors, despite taking so many radical actions in the last few months now either unwilling or unable to do so to protect the regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Place in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the military that had stayed so loyal until not so long ago withering a bit more every day. All were expecting the Marshal to strike, many were ready to die in the streets, and yet, Pétain did nothing. If this was done hoping the people would calm down, it was foolish as there was no going back: in the people's mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to brutalise his people to hold on to power was left."

In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of parades instead joined the protests led by Mordacq himself and seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarter of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. Even if Pétain had tried to strike, this was in fact doomed from the start: most the Deuxième Bureau, the secret services, was compromised and cooperating with the Bear's partisans, the 'leaks' were entirely purposeful. In a short radio speech, the first since his arrest and subsequent escape, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq and freshly freed from jail, rose to deliver an improvised speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his tyrannical regime, invoking the Articles 6 and 12 of the suspended Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the numerous grievous crimes revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with thunderous applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only defended by a few presidential guardsmen still foolishly loyal to the Marshal.

 nfa.50.a: "We need to reform the République if we want to take down the Reds."

 nfa.51.t: "The Comité de Salut National"
 nfa.51.d: "The arrest of the Lion confirmed, a known supporter of Mordacq took the stand in front of the Assembly and proposed that in the interest of the stability of the nation a temporary Committee of National Salvation be created, made up of parliamentarians, experts and officers named by the legislative body, with broad powers to restore order after months of protests, repressions, and parades and deal with both remaining supporters of the Marshal and exterior enemies. While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favour of the proposal and no name other than that of General Henri Mordacq, hero of the struggle against the tyrannical Pétain, was proposed to head the committee, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the Republic of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilises and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nDespite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters are finally able to show themselves after months of repression. Despite Pétain's best efforts, a new dawn is rising on the French Republic and the Bear's promised reforms can only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."
 nfa.51.a: "Vive l'Ours!"

 nfa.52.t: "Une Politique se Juge par ses Résultats"
 nfa.52.d: "As the crisis unfolds, it's quickly becoming obvious that the regime has lost most of its base of support. Veterans are shocked by the actions of the man they have revered for so long, and the 'Grande Muette' is making herself heard loud and clear. The government desperately needs allies, and it seems at least one group in part might be interested in such a partnership: the royalist Action Française. Today Charles de Gaulle came to discuss privately with Marshal Pétain about a potential alliance of circumstances. The Rooster seems to have taken upon himself to act as link between his mentor and the party he has never hidden sympathies for. Though the integralists have been consistently and brazenly opposed to the Republic, considering Pétain's regime as barely a step up from the weak pre-war government, they share a common trait: distrust for parliamentary democracy and the liberal parties whose rule led to the fall of France in the first place.\n\nAs such, the Action Française is suggesting unofficial cooperation with the regime, at least until the crisis is over, a partnership that could prove salutatory for the Lion and his government. As an old, very well established party the French Action has many sympathisers among both the upper and lower classes, within the Church, the Army and even enjoys some popularity with the native population, drawn in by promises of decentralisation and respect of local customs. Its daily newspaper is among the most widely read in the nation, and the party controls a network of \"newspaper vendors\", the Camelots du Roi, the King's Camelots, a security service made up of youngsters and students that some describe as a paramilitary force, used to street brawls and crowd control. Finally, some of the more radical members of the AF have hinted at being willing to use every tool at their disposal to take more \"direct action\" against the democratic camp. All of this could be used to serve the regime and finally end the crisis once and for all.\n\nHowever this partnership could alienate the last few loyal partisans of Pétain, and there is no doubt that the services of the AF would come at the cost of compromise with them down the road. But the regime might simply not survive the next few weeks if we don't take this deal."
 nfa.52.a: "Fine, all is fair in politics."
 nfa.52.b: "Thanks, but we'll manage to get out of this by ourselves."

 nfa.53.t: "The Four Hundred Blows"
 nfa.53.d: "The deal made with the Action Française took effect immediately: the party's paper changed its stance on the regime, and the monarchist officers and soldiers participating in the parades simply stopped showing up. Using its vast network of influence in the upper classes and the armed forces, the party has managed to soothe some of the dissent coming from there, and the Camelots du Roi now show up every day to push back against the protests and secure key areas, not showing the same hesitation as the regular forces to fight those still parading and not having any care for regulations or avoiding injuries. It would seem like the regime can breathe a great sigh of relief, as Mordacq's movement is now far less ascendant.\n\nHowever, part of the loss of ground for the democratic camp is due to the brutal tactics of the more radical elements of the French Action, who have organised themselves in a highly structured, secretive and independent group to take direct action against the Bear's supporters, with little to no oversight by the party and none from the government. Intimidation, assassination, and even bombings, in the last few weeks it seems nothing is too far for them to take down the democratic camp. Nicknamed the Organisation des Quatre Cents Coups, the Four Hundreds Blows Organisation or less literally, Organisation to Raise Hell, it's impossible to deny that they have been incredibly effective in suppressing our opponents but the Lion himself is quietly horrified by the terroristic nature of the group."
 nfa.53.a: "This is going too far, let's end this deal, we cannot stoop this low."
 nfa.53.b: "We have no choice, this is all for the salvation of France!"

 NFA_400_coup_idea: "The 400 Blows"

 nfa.54.t: "The Lion's Solitude"
 nfa.54.d: "Having refused the French Action's offer, the Marshal is more isolated than ever and has holed himself in his quarters of the presidential palace overlooking Algiers, writing his memoirs, able to hear the distant sound of the parades from his office. Rejected, the AF has now thrown its weight against the government and even the dear protégé of Pétain, de Gaulle, has started disassociating himself from the regime. It seems many in the government are considering fleeing abroad, while it's rumoured that Mordacq himself has come out of hiding and has been seen at meetings with parliamentarians and Army officers. Many believe the end of the Lion's rule as imminent. However, despite his express order to his aide to not be bothered about affairs of state, a letter has found its way to Philippe Pétain desk, what should the Marshal do?"
 nfa.54.a: "What good would this do, let's just ignore it."
 nfa.54.b: "Why not, maybe it's from an admirer."

 nfa.55.t: "Le Redressement Français"
 nfa.55.d: "Coming from a group calling itself the Redressement Français, the French Renewal, part employers' association, part think tank, part propaganda arm of the forward-minded upper classes, intent on \"bringing together the elites and educating the masses\", fanatically anti-syndicalist and believing the Lion is the best choice to achieve their aims despite his recent missteps, the mysterious letter indicates that they are now offering their help to the regime in this desperate time.\n\nAdvocating for a reorganisation and streamlining of the administration and political system, a greater care of the upper classes for the social question as well as generally more class collaboration, strong property rights, a greater involvement of \"patriotic industrialists and intellectuals\" in policy-making through specialised commissions, along with a healthy dose of scepticism towards traditional parliamentary democracy that they consider bloated and in part responsible for the revolution, they have been decried in the past by the more liberal opposition as technocratic, condescendingly paternalistic, and corporatist. Nevertheless, their resources, expertise and extensive links to the elites could prove to be salvation for the regime, whatever is left of it. Asking the Marshal to form a new government filled with members of the organisation and essentially a free hand to reform the country according to their ideals, in exchange they promise that they will do everything in their power to end the crisis. While this would be an egregious offer at any other time, Philippe Pétain really has no other choice but to accept."
 nfa.55.a: "It's an offer we can't refuse."

 nfa.56.t: "The Old Lion"
 nfa.56.d: "After months of turmoil, of intense debate, of protest, of media frenzy, of violence, of parades, it feels like things are ever so slowly getting back in order. Marshal Pétain's gamble to hold on to power had almost failed, but when all seemed lost the Redressement Français' precious help saved the day. The group managed to first thoroughly secure to support of the upper classes, anxious over the crisis unfolding, and create a media offensive putting all the blame of the recent repressive and abusive decisions of the regime on sycophants taking advantage of the elderly Marshal, many of whom have already been arrested on treason and corruption charges, a lie that many in the nation are more than happy to believe, civilians, veterans, soldiers and officers alike. The democratic camp still very much exists, but through backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans and promises of reform, its support is rapidly eroding. The parades are still a daily event, but they are rapidly shrinking in size and it's rumoured that Mordacq himself is striking a deal with the government, with talks of total amnesty for his partisans and a comfortable retirement for himself.\n\nThough he is still of course the head of state, the political genius Pétain is long gone: only a tired old man rapidly distancing himself from day to day rule is left and some whisper he has merely become a figurehead for the Redressement Français. All the reforms proposed by the government are lifted straight from their ideas, and the Renewal has turned itself into the propaganda arm of the regime, organising and funding its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime's stabilisation is entirely due to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think tank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group's writings. In any case, now that the crisis is dying down the entire nation's attention is once again turning towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. Uniting behind the figure of the Lion of Verdun, the people will soon be ready to save the patrie, and the French Renewal has a free rein to reform the nation so that she is capable to do so."
 nfa.56.a: "La Patrie renaîtra !"

 nfa.57.t: "The Last Parade"
 nfa.57.d: "Today the last parade took place. Having been promised amnesty and reform, General Henri Mordacq personally came to the few soldiers and officers still protesting in Algiers and delivered a passionate speech thanking them for their support and sacrifices these past few months. Though he advised them to stay vigilant, he also advocated goodwill towards the reformed regime for the good of France, as after all the time to strike against the Reds is coming and the nation needs to be united in this critical moment. After an emotional goodbye to his partisans, the Bear took the first boat to Corsica, holding up the last part of his end of the bargain with the government: a peaceful retirement, far removed from politics and far away from Algiers.\n\nThe crisis that shook the regime is finally, truly over, and it's finally time to move on and reform the country"
 nfa.57.a: "Adieu Mordacq !"

 nfa.58.t: "La Journée Sanglante"
 nfa.58.d: "Between the wave of terrorist violence against the democratic faction and the presence of increasingly aggressive camelots on the outskirts of the parades, tensions were running high. One day some soldiers had brought their service weapons, pretexting a need for self-defence, the next the Camelots themselves were armed and in reaction to this both police and military deployed to maintain order brought out heavier weaponry. Furthermore, while the violence against Mordacq's partisans had intimidated many, it also brought them much sympathy from the general public and as such more and more civilians took part in the parades. What had started as a rather absurd display of anger by the Grande Muette was now a daily tense standoff from sunrise to sundown, with occasional brawls between protestors and camelots. Miraculously, despite the numerous injuries sustained in the daily brawls, no deaths had occurred at the parades.\n\nThat is, until today. As one of the usual fights broke out between protestors and camelots, a shot rang out, followed by a cry of pain. No one knows who fired it or where it came from, but after a split second of shocked silence, there was chaos. More and more gunshots came from each side, and with each one protestors, camelots, police and military fell to the ground, some wounded, some dead. Initially overwhelmed, the regime forces quickly regained their composure, the sight of their dead comrades shedding any feelings of hesitation they might have had towards fighting against fellow soldiers. Things quickly turned to street to street fighting, with barricades being hastily constructed by protestors engaging in what could only be described as a fighting retreat: most of them being active duty soldiers or veterans, there was certainly confusion, but no panic. Though they have been pushed back to the littoral, the protestors remain in firm control of much of centre of Algiers as the government forces await further orders."
 nfa.58.a: "Call for a meeting, we need to find a way to resolve the situation!"

 nfa.59.t: "Démocratie"
 nfa.59.d: "The strategy meeting had gone on for hours, and it was already evening. Deeply shocked by the events unfolding, Marshal Pétain had dismissed all proposals from the military, the police, ministers, advisors, even his protégé Charles de Gaulle, considering them all as risking too many lives. Talks with the protestors had gone nowhere, and the lack of central leadership among them would make any consensus impossible anyway. A tense silence had fallen on the conference room in the presidential palace, broken only by the sound of the occasional gunshots. Then, news came: the protestors have seized heavy machine guns, and chosen to fall back further and fortify a large plaza where a field hospital had been set up. Any assault would be extremely costly, and everyone in the room knew it. And then, quietly, almost a whisper:\n\n\"... shell them\".\n\nA young navy officer had broken the silence. He continued: 'We could shell them. The Liberté class dreadnought Démocratie is anchored a few miles from Algiers, if we wait until nightfall and order her to shell the plaza, it would create enough confusion to storm the camp while minimising damage to the city and losses for our forces. They're expecting an assault from land, certainly not from the sea'. After a few seconds of silence, the Lion of Verdun angrily stood up, but before he could speak Charles de Gaulle, the Rooster, intervened: 'I'm afraid we have no choice here. If we let the situation fester, we could wake up tomorrow morning to a general insurrection: we must nip this revolution in the bud and act fast. I'm sorry Marshal but now is the time of action, not debate.'".\n\nAnd so, as Philippe Pétain fell silent, the order was given."
 nfa.59.a: "The order is sent..."

 nfa.69.t: "Le Lendemain"
 nfa.69.d: "Massacre. Bloodbath. This is how the foreign press describes the events of Algiers. The proposed strategy was indeed incredibly effective, and as soon as the first shells hit, the protestors abandoned any kind of organised defence and fled in all directions only to run into our forces assaulting the plaza, where they either immediately surrendered or were promptly dealt with. Tales of mangled bodies, of brutal treatment of prisoners, of summary executions are being spread by communard agents, but our nation knows the truth: the next morning, the front page of all newspapers read: \"Attempted Coup Bravely Defeated\". The threat posed by these red traitors has finally been dealt with: the few remaining so-called democrats are now either in custody, awaiting trial for their crimes, in hiding, though they will be found sooner or later, or they lie dead in a mass grave slowly filling up as the plaza is being cleaned up. Henri Mordacq, or what was left of his body, was found and identified by his uniform: the Bear himself is dead and we can now breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMarshal Pétain is however deeply affected by what happened and has not left the presidential palace since, refusing to see anyone other than his wife and his confessor, only occasionally wandering outside of his quarters, mumbling to himself. As such, Charles de Gaulle has unofficially stepped in to help run governmental affairs for the time being: after all, who better than the Lion's protégé to make sure things go smoothly in these critical times? Having been promoted to the rank of general for his bravery and skill dealing with the crisis, France's stability is now the utmost priority of the Rooster, and as such he has launched a new large scale investigation to find and bring to justice any and all of those who might have been involved in this attempted coup. Much remains to be done, but all those who would dare endanger the patrie in these critical times are now warned: no longer will their traitorous behaviour be tolerated."
 nfa.69.a: "Thankfully the Marshal can count on de Gaulle's loyalty."

 nfa.73.t: "The de Gaulle Government"
 nfa.73.d: "After months of turmoil, of plotting, of violence caused by the enemies of the nation, it seems that things are finally looking up for France. Having formed a new government, Charles de Gaulle now president of the council of ministers was finally able to start dealing with much of the rot that had set in the administration and the armed forces: corrupt plutocrats and sycophants having taken advantage of the ageing Marshal, suspected communard agents, Mordacq sympathisers, and generally those setting back national interests are being dealt with, arrested, judged by special courts, and either put down or imprisoned. Though we could have feared instability after the Marshal's temporary condition had been made public, de Gaulle's energetic guidance, his status as a respected war hero, as protégé of Pétain, and his own personal prestige alleviated the fears of many. The sheer scale of the corruption has been dutifully reported by the media, and each day a new arrest, a new scandal shocks our people, who finally, truly understand this truth: just as the Rooster had described it in La Discorde, the worst threat facing us does not come from outside our borders, but from within. The defeats, the struggles, the sacrifices now all make sense: our efforts had been sabotaged, wasted by inside forces.\n\nHowever, our efforts to finally once and for all deal with the parasites plaguing the patrie are still being restricted by petty liberal concerns, and de Gaulle realises that extraordinary measures must be taken to ensure the salvation of France. As such he has come to Philippe Pétain with a proposal: for the Lion of Verdun to resign as president of the French Republic to enjoy a glorious retirement and be able to care for his clearly ailing health, and for a motion to be presented in front of the National Assembly granting the government full powers to create and promulgate a new constitution, better suited to defend national interests. Of course, the final decision is for the Marshal to make."
 nfa.73.a: "Of course, de Gaulle knows best and it's now time for the Lion to proudly retire."
 nfa.73.b: "No, we can deal with the crisis without going this far."

 nfa.74.t: "Le Chant du Coq"
 nfa.74.d: "A new dawn is rising on France. The Lion himself has come to make a speech in front of the National Assembly, broadcast on radio: citing his old age and ailing health, the tired Pétain announced his retirement, then proceeded to thank all those that supported him in the troubled times since the Grande Guerre, in particular veterans, making less than subtle references to Charles de Gaulle. His closing statement calling for a peaceful transition of power and reaffirming his full trust in de Gaulle to guide the nation in these troubled times and in the people to continue the fight to retake the métropole, Marshal Pétain ended his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from his iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: \"Courage, on les aura!\", \"Be strong, we'll get ‘em!\", immediately followed by thunderous applause and a long standing ovation. As the applause died down, a voice resonated: 'Maréchal, merci!', 'Marshal, thank you!', a breach of protocol that all in the room immediately happily imitated. Outside the building, the population had spontaneously come together to say goodbye to the saviour of France, regardless of class and status, thanking Philippe Pétain as he was leaving on foot, as all the anger, all the fears of the past few weeks and years at least momentarily disappeared. Pétain himself, usually so stoic, looked emotional and strangely enough, relieved.\n\nAfter a short break, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a clearly well rehearsed speech detailing the extent of the corruption recently unveiled and reminding his fellow congressmen of the orgy of violence that engulfed the nation, finally calling for extraordinary powers to be given to the de Gaulle government to be able to truly reform the patrie. The Assembly having been cleansed from much of the rot that had set since the exile, this too was met with thunderous applause and a motion was quickly put together."
 nfa.74.a: "Adieu Pétain, et vive de Gaulle !"

 nfa.75.t: "Le Lion est Mort"
 nfa.75.d: "Today, tragedy struck our nation. As Marshal Pétain was making to deliver a speech announcing the end of the crisis and the return to calm, the presidential car found itself in a hail of machine gun fire. The gunman was immediately killed by the presidential guard, but it was too late, Philippe Pétain was struck in the head and died minutes later. Though an investigation will surely help us understand the true circumstances of the assassination, the killer was identified as a young journalist who had been suspected of links to Mordacq's seditious faction and arrested but released due to lack of evidence.\n\nGeneral de Gaulle rushed to make a short but clearly emotional speech in front of the National Assembly broadcast on radio, calling for calm and order and solemnly vowing to bring those responsible for this atrocious act to justice, ending his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from Pétain's iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: \"Courage, on les aura!\", \"Be strong, we'll get ‘em!\", immediately followed by thunderous applause. After a short break, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a strangely well rehearsed speech detailing the extent of the corruption recently unveiled and reminding his fellow congressmen of the orgy of violence engulfing the nation, finally calling for extraordinary powers to be given to the de Gaulle government to be able to finally deal with the existential threats facing France and truly reform the patrie. The Assembly having been cleansed from much of the rot that had set in since the exile, this too was met with thunderous applause and a motion was quickly put together."
 nfa.75.a: "Vive le Coq !"

 nfa.76.t: "Résurrection"
 nfa.76.d: "\"The National Assembly gives full powers to the Government of the Republic, under the authority of de Gaulle, to promulgate by one or more acts a new constitution of the French State\". By this simple motion, adopted unanimously, the destiny of France has changed for the better. Everywhere the enemies of France still lurked, and Charles de Gaulle, finally given the tools to save France, continued the work already started to cleanse the nation. Everywhere he looked, more and more evidence of the incredibly deep rot affecting the Republic came to light. Tasked with saving France, the general had come to a simple conclusion, that today he exposed in a speech in front of the Senate.\n\n\"Trusted with the arduous task of guiding the nation in these hazardous times, I must put the patrie above all. Above my personal feelings, above petty convictions, above divisions. As such, I have come to the conclusion that a system born in the fires of revolution cannot extinguish the fire of another, and that any constitution my government could put together couldn't be enough to ensure the safety and future of our nation. As such, as chief of state of the French Republic, with the powers granted to me by the people, I hereby declare that to ensure the salvation of France we should look towards the fundamental laws, the laws that governed our nation and made her glory since times immemorial, the laws of the kingdom. As such, for the good of France and her people, as a subject, I hereby humbly ask monseigneur the Duke de Guise, heir of forty kings who over a millennium made France, to seize the crown and guide us towards the resurrection, the renewal of France.\"\n\nTruth is, no one was surprised by this speech. Neither the parliamentarians, nor the people. General de Gaulle's sympathies for the monarchy and the royalist Action Française were no secret, and forces loyal to the regime and the AF, in the media, the Church, the armed forces, had worked tirelessly to cement the idea of restoration in the public consciousness. The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the Republic, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her. The senators gave de Gaulle a long standing ovation, named him lieutenant-general of the reborn kingdom, regent in other words, before voting to dissolve the legislative chambers. Spontaneous celebrations broke out in the streets all over the country, but for most people the predominant feeling is relief: finally the crisis that shook the nation for months is over."
 nfa.76.a: "Vive le Roi !"

 nfa.77.t: "L'Enquête"
 nfa.77.d: "Today, the conclusions of the investigation into the events of the last few months have reached the desk of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom Charles de Gaulle. From monetary support to Mordacq to helping his escape, to encouraging the recent attempted coup, the results are incredibly damning for many among the old republican establishment and thousands are implicated, including many in the Army, the secret services, and the administration. While they will of course be promptly dealt with, some within the Action Française advise taking advantage of this crisis to finally once and for all cleanse the French body from the stain of republicanism and take down the parasitic groups dragging France down in one fell swoop."
 nfa.77.a: "Let us bring to justice the guilty, no need to rush."
 nfa.77.b: "Purge them all, they are all guilty of something or another anyway."

 nfa.78.t: "The Trials"
 nfa.78.d: "It's the trial of the century. Everyday, the audiences are broadcast on radio for the entire nation to listen to, while many in Algiers assemble outside of the courthouse to get as close as possible to the action. When the names of those accused of treason and conspiracy against the state for their involvement with Henri Mordacq and his partisans were published, and the treachery of so many respected statesmen, military men and public personalities was revealed, the public was deeply shocked. However, our people can finally put a name and a face on the deep rooted corruption that plagued the Republic, finally they can rest easy knowing that those that created the troubles of the past months, and by extension, much of the struggles they have gone through since the Grande Guerre will hinder France no longer, that they have finally been brought to justice. Finally, the patrie can move forward, first by reforming herself following our king's guidance, and then by setting her sights on the métropole, still reeling under communard oppression."
 nfa.78.a: "The enemy within has finally been defeated!"

 nfa.86.t: "For the Lord Knows Those That are His own"
 nfa.86.d: "It's the trial of the century, everyday, the audiences are broadcast on radio for the entire nation to listen to, while many in Algiers assemble outside of the courthouse to get as close as possible to the action. However, since the names of those accused were published and placarded everywhere, a new wave of violence has swept through the nation. Overzealous camelots have been targeting the family and friends of those on trial, as well as more generally all and any open republicans, with harassment and rapidly escalating violence. Yesterday, it was jeers and insults, today, beatings and property damage, but with the police rarely intervening, who knows where it will stop. The population, taken in the frenzy and wanting to make those responsible for France's suffering pay has started joining as well, often collectively proving more violent against the perceived enemies of the patrie than the most committed of the camelots. Some are fleeing, others hope the collective wrath will simply pass, though it is quickly becoming uncontrollable. The political disagreements of yesterday have turned into blind rage, and some are even taking advantage of the general frenzy to settle personal feuds, either joining the mob and influencing it into going after personal enemies, or denouncing as liberals, as Mordacq-sympathiser, as republicans whoever slighted them. However, this orgy of violence could prove cathartic for our people, as they can finally rest easy knowing the enemy within will no longer hinder. Finally the patrie can move forward, first by reforming herself following our king's guidance, and then by setting her sights on the métropole, still reeling under communard oppression."
 nfa.86.a: "... hopefully with this the republican nightmare will truly be over."

 nfa.89.t: "The Great Mute Grumbles"
 nfa.89.d: "Wasting no time, the Bear has started putting into place his deep plans for military reform. However, many of those reforms were already controversial atop the chain of command, and now that they are being implemented, they have put some within the armed forces on high alert regarding the next moves of General Mordacq. Furthermore, the call for deep reform by the new head of state is seen by many civilians as a prelude to the restoration of democratic life, though Mordacq has so far not challenged the state of emergency that has held France in democratic limbo for the last decade. The simmering hope has reached the ranks of the military, among which many already anxious at the prospect of the military reforms are at best sceptical of an eventual return to parliamentary democracy as war looms ever closer. A worry that their fellow reactionary officers have been quick to exploit, convincing some former Pétain loyalists that Mordacq was a poor choice over the much more conservative de Gaulle.\n\nIn any case, this barrack gossip is unlikely to have deeper consequences, Mordacq is a respected theorist and war hero, and the appointed successor of the Lion of Verdun. We could, however, contact the old Marshal, and ask him to briefly come out of retirement for a speech addressed to the troops not so subtly calling for more unity within the ranks."
 nfa.89.a: "Let the Lion rest, he has done enough."
 nfa.89.b: "Let's ask the Marshal for help."

 nfa.90.t: "The Lion's Last Roar"
 nfa.90.d: "One last time, Marshal Pétain has to keep France together as cracks in the unity of the armed forces are already showing. The Lion made a surprise appearance at a ceremony honouring soldiers being decorated for their heroic deeds patrolling the Sahara, gave their well-deserved medals to the men, before making a lengthy speech to the numerous assembly. Each and every one of them listened intently to the man who so recently still dominated the life of the nation, from the humblest of infantrymen to the most decorated officers present. They all heard loud and clear the message the Marshal was methodically laying out.\n\nTaking the tone of a disappointed grandfather, he compared the current situation of France to a lengthy trek across the hostile desert, where every resource is precious but the most important thing is cohesion within the group, for men to trust and rely on each other so that they may reach their destination. He strongly praised his successor and reaffirmed his trust in Mordacq's ability and deeply reform the nation and her armed forces, before announcing that he would fully retire from public life, an announcement that ushered a wave of shock and whispers across the room. Receiving a standing ovation no less sincere than the one he received when he resigned as head of state, the Marshal reminded his great call of Verdun, one, last, time."
 nfa.90.a: "On les aura !"

 nfa.91.t: "Troubles in the Garrisons"
 nfa.91.d: "An incident involving a large group of intoxicated soldiers on leave in Oran took place. The men publicly criticised General Mordacq and were overheard by civilians, who did not take kindly to insult, and the two groups rapidly came to blows. Law enforcement rapidly intervened, but not after multiple bars were trashed in the fighting that engulfed the whole street. Reportedly, the men called their opponents, and by extension the Bear, crypto-Communards, who would lead France down the road to parliamentary chaos and perpetual exile.\n\nThis matter could have been handled by local police, but the cause of the men has been taken up by the Action Française, who calls the drunkards patriots standing up against the interior enemies, and demands their immediate release. Local authorities have refused to comment on the situation, but this incident is a troubling sign of the tensions flaring up within the armed forces."
 nfa.91.a: "They'll latch on anyone causing trouble for us."

 nfa.92.t: "Murder in the Casbah"
 nfa.92.d: "This morning, Indigènes on their way to morning prayers found the bloody corpse of a superior officer in the narrow streets of the Casbah of Algiers. The man was seemingly brutally beaten before being shot numerous times and could only be identified thanks to the military identification he was carrying. In full uniform and carrying a substantial amount of money, a robbery gone wrong is unlikely: the man was, however, a known supporter of the General and has recently risen to some prominence by publicly supporting an end to the state of emergency and return to normal democratic life.\n\nAs such, the Deuxième Bureau has taken over the investigation, believing that this is the work of forces opposed to the regime. The democratic press has not waited for confirmation, however, and already calls the man a victim of the Action Française. The royalist newspaper, on the other hand, is all but celebrating the news, being quick to point out that the man's purpose in the seedy area remains unknown, peddling theories to besmirch the memory of the officer, ranging from a visit to the Casbah's brothels to ominous conspiracy with supposed Communard agents."
 nfa.92.a: "That's low, even for royalists."

 nfa.93.t: "The Sleeping Beauties"
 nfa.93.d: "Despite the suspension of the constitutional laws following the revolution, the regime was keen to at least preserve the illusion of democracy: the parliament remained in place, and though for a decade now it has only rubber-stamped the decision of the Marshal, his right to hold the rein of power still, in theory, comes from the people's representatives. As such, the various parties still exist, with a presidential coalition and an opposition publicly debating, though no one in the Republic is foolish enough to believe they hold any kind of real power. However, emboldened by the election of Henri Mordacq that they perceive as a friend to the cause of democracy, the long slumbering political parties have finally awakened. Though they would never dare publicly denounce the regime that they have dutifully supported since the exile, representatives from the main parties asked for a discrete private meeting with the Bear.\n\nThere, they explained their concerns to General Mordacq. While some among them spoke of the ideals of the Republic, of the moral duty to restore democracy, most had reached a much more practical conclusion: the people are losing trust in the regime, and its future seems bleak. For now, the popular hope for reform has focused around Mordacq. Despite his calls for deep reform, he remains largely politically aligned with the Pétain regime, with the same unflinching aim: retaking the métropole and taking down the Reds. As such, these deputies have proposed simply giving in to popular demands, declaring the state of emergency over, restoring the constitutional laws for the good of the stability of the republic, and calling for new elections, allowing a semblance of normal democratic life to flourish once again in the Republic.\n\nThe General was not unmoved by such arguments but has refused to give a straight answer regarding his intentions."
 nfa.93.a: "Is intellectual jousting in the hemicycle really what we need?"

 nfa.94.t: "La Rumeur"
 nfa.94.d: "Although Mordacq has been designated as the legitimate successor of Pétain, it seems that the Action Française and its allies, de Gaulle and D'Argenlieu, have not given up on their ambition to restore the monarchy in France. Although they officially respect and obey hierarchies, orders tend to get mysteriously lost, and the units under the control of known sympathisers seem to only tenuously follow the orders given to them. We believe they are the men behind the slaughter in the Casbah, and according to our infiltrated agents of the Deuxième Bureau, they are preparing their next move. If we are not careful, their influence could become strong enough to carry on a coup against our regime.\n\nBut we will not stay around idly, we must take proactive steps. With the help of the Deuxième Bureau, we might be able to counter their move and prevent a coup, but our success remains uncertain in these conditions. To better the odds, we could try to contact the leaders of the various parties represented in parliament: although they have de facto little political power, they still have deep connections to the financial and industrial elite of our country and might be able to successfully deprive the Action Française of its financial support. Furthermore, de La Rocque's PSF could provide invaluable help in preventing a coup. However, it is unlikely they will accept to do so without compensation, and we will have to negotiate for their support."
 nfa.94.a: "We need all the help we can get, contact the democrats."
 nfa.94.b: "Worry not, for we have the situation under control."

 nfa.95.t: "The Beauties Awaken"
 nfa.95.d.petainhelp: "If reports by the Bureau are accurate, the threat of a royalist coup is not to be taken lightly. In his eagerness to reform the military General Mordacq has alienated many of Pétain's supporters and appointees, while his ambiguous attitude towards ending the state of emergency and restoring normal democratic life has raised worry even beyond reactionary circles: for many, it is the petty bickering of the Third Republic that has lead France to defeat and exile, and restoring full democracy in the most critical situation the patrie has ever faced would be suicide. The Bear, whether he wants it or not, has been associated with the so-recently still somewhat alienated partisans of democracy, and he is quickly running out of allies, though the recent intervention of Marshal Pétain has soothed the worries of some.\n\nAs such, a discreet meeting was called with the head of the various parties, in the hope of finding a solution to the current situation. To the surprise of Mordacq, the president of the PSF had a concrete proposal: he would use the vast reach and infrastructure of his mass party to support the General and his reform, while the more traditional parties would throw their resources into the fight to counter the current media offensive by the Action Française against the regime. In exchange, the General would announce an end to the state of emergency, publicly promise a return to normal within a reasonable time-frame. Furthermore, a new government would have to be formed, a new Union Sacrée, a broad coalition of Republican parties working together to ensure the future of the Republic. It's an ambitious plan: despite Mordacq being a long-time believer in democracy, he shares popular concern over immediate restoration. However, thanks to the renewal of Pétain's endorsement, this transition might be easier than one might think. And the General might have little room to negotiate anyway... What should be done?"

 nfa.96.t: "The New Union Sacrée"
 nfa.96.d: "Under threat of a coup by royalist forces, and with strong encouragement from General Mordacq, the various parliamentary groups have agreed to form a grand republican coalition, a new Union Sacrée. The head of state delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio, promising to free the Republic of corruption, to restore the fundamental liberties, new elections in the future and the formation of a government of a national union headed by the PSF's François de La Rocque, the AD's Pierre-Étienne Flandin, and the Radicals' Édouard Daladier. As such, the main democratic parties are represented in this new government, and they will carry together the fight against both syndicalism and autocracy, putting aside their ideological differences for the good of the Republic.\n\nWhether such a coalition will prove to be able to lead France effectively remains to be seen, but immediately celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities: indeed, it seems many had long hoped for radical reform and a more democratic future. Despite the royalists' best efforts, a new dawn is rising in the French Republic and the promised reforms can only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."

 nfa.97.t: "Le Coup Manqué"
 nfa.97.d: "Today, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units seized strategic points in Algiers, as well as the Palace of Government, headquarter of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, de Gaulle attempted to call for calm and order and announced that the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace to preserve the stability of the regime. And yet, this radio intervention had the opposite effect: PSF members, as well as untold numbers of civilians, flooded the streets, to the stunned surprise of the units deployed, some more isolated groups of soldiers even getting scorned like children by the mob, before being peacefully disarmed and arrested. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of General Mordacq and his new government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the crimes the Bear had supposedly committed and a call for an immediate vote. This was met with applause by some reactionary members of parliaments, who were immediately shouted down by the rest of the Assembly. Soldiers attempted to restore order but were unsuccessful.\n\nMinutes after this, troops loyal to the regime surrounded the Assembly and forced entry into the building. There they found de Gaulle, who remained silent as he was served a warrant for high treason. The Rooster did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial: clearly, the attempted coup did not go as planned."
 nfa.97.a: "At least he went down with flair."

 nfa.98.t: "Parliamentary Infighting"
 nfa.98.d: "Predictably, as soon as the General announced that regular parliamentary activity would resume, the parliamentarians fell back in their old habits. Liberals have already begun a smear campaign against de La Rocque's PSF claiming the Colonel merely intends to take advantage of the return of democracy by using his mass party to take over the Republic and install a renewed dictatorship. In response, the PSF has used its wide reach to feed tales of collaboration between Communard agents and the more left-leaning of the Radicals to the media, insinuating that they are traitors just waiting for the right opportunity to invite the Reds into Algiers and destroy any chance of salvation for France.\n\nTo the frustration of the General, this turn of events has proven to be positive for only the royalists of the Action Française, their ranks increasingly bolstered by many former Pétain loyalists. The monarchist daily has been relishing in the stories coming out of the Assembly, retelling any argument in colourful details: after all, if this is what restoration of parliamentary democracy was always about, maybe it's not worth the trouble."
 nfa.98.a: "... are they all secretly working for Maurras?"
 nfa.98.b: "If they don't work together, the Bear will make them work together."

 nfa.99.t: "The Lonesome Bear"
 nfa.99.d: "Despite the growing rumours of an imminent royalist coup, General Mordacq has let his scepticism of immediate restoration of parliamentary democracy prevent him from accepting the help of the democratic forces within the Republic. The failure of the Third Republic to manage the war against Germany will not be repeated: much like Pétain, he has decided to mostly ignore the parliament and to lead the nation without interference from bickering politicians. While he still discusses policies with politicians from all sides and has frequent contacts with industrialists, they are mere advisors and Mordacq will keep the final say in all decisions taken.\n\nHowever, the threat caused by the Action Française is still very present, and we need to do something about it. Despite the support of the Deuxième Bureau, their numbers are limited, and they will need time to infiltrate the Action Française. Time is running short, and our room for manoeuvre is shrinking. However, we do have one last option: asking once again Marshal for his help, though it is uncertain whether or not he will accept."
 nfa.99.a: "We can trust the Deuxième Bureau to stop de Gaulle, Maurras, and their clique."
 nfa.99.b: "Ask Pétain for one last favour."

 nfa.100.t: "Help from a Friend"
 nfa.100.d: "Pétain and Mordacq, two men who deeply respect each other despite their differences. The meeting took place in the presidential palace overlooking Algiers. The Marshal confirmed the threat of a coup: he had already been contacted by his former supporters to lead it, but he had so far refused. Retirement had clearly not blunted the shrewdness of the Lion, for he had an offer for the Bear: both were aware that the days of the regime in its current form were numbered, whether the threat would come from royalists toppling the Republic or too much cooperation with democrats paralysing the state was the only question. As such, Marshal Pétain would once again offer his help to Mordacq, contact former loyalists lost to the AF, as well privately endorse the regime in social occasions with the rich and powerful as much as needed. In exchange, however, his successor would have to agree to not restore parliamentary democracy immediately, and to only do so only once France was whole once again, and stable: too much was at stake to leave politicians in charge.\n\nThe General, sharing his scepticism towards parliament, immediately agreed."

 nfa.102.d: "The arrest of de Gaulle confirmed, a known supporter of Mordacq took the stand in front of the Assembly and proposed that in the interest of the stability of the nation a temporary Committee of National Salvation be created, made up of parliamentarians, experts and officers named by the legislative body, with broad powers to restore order after such a tremendous attempt at destroying the Republic and to find and prosecute any royalist traitors. While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favour of the proposal. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio, promising to free the Republic of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilises and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nWhether such a committee will be able to lead France effectively remains to be seen, but immediately celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities: indeed, it seems many had long hoped for radical reform and a more democratic future and our people trust Mordacq to lead the way.

A decision perhaps helped along by the presence of armed men in the hemicycle, who immediately arrested those who had voted against the motion.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen and civilians loyal to the Bear of Arras. There they found Jean-Jules Henri Mordacq, in full uniform, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute and he was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."

This special congress assembled late in the night, no name was proposed other than that of Charles de Gaulle, elected unanimously. Coincidentally present in the building, he immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio, promising to restore order and purify France from the Communard threat.

 nfa.105.d: "'The National Assembly gives full powers to the Government of the Republic, under the authority of General de Gaulle, to promulgate by one or more acts a new constitution of the French State'. By this simple motion, adopted unanimously, the destiny of France has changed for the better. Everywhere the enemies of France still lurked, and Charles de Gaulle, finally given the tools to save France, continued the work already started to cleanse the nation. Everywhere he looked, more and more evidence of the incredibly deep rot affecting the Republic came to light. Tasked with saving France, the General had come to a simple conclusion, that today he exposed in a speech in front of the Senate:\n\n'Trusted with the arduous task of guiding the nation in these hazardous times, I must put the patrie above all. Above my personal feelings, above petty convictions, above divisions. As such, I have come to the conclusion that a system born in the fires of revolution cannot extinguish the fire of another, and that any constitution my government could put together couldn't be enough to ensure the safety and future of our nation. As such, as chief of state of the French Republic, with the powers granted to me by the people, I hereby declare that to ensure the salvation of France we should look towards the fundamental laws, the laws that governed our nation and made her glory since times immemorial, the laws of the kingdom. As such, for the good of France and her people, as a subject, I hereby humbly ask monseigneur the Duke de Guise, heir of forty kings who over a millennium made France, to seize the crown and guide us towards the resurrection, the renewal of France.'\n\nTruth is, no one was surprised by this speech. Neither the parliamentarians nor the people. General de Gaulle's sympathies for the monarchy and the royalist Action Française were no secret, and forces loyal to the regime and the AF, in the media, the Church, the armed forces, had worked tirelessly to cement the idea of restoration in the public consciousness. The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the Republic, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her. The senators gave de Gaulle a long-standing ovation, named him Lieutenant-General of the reborn kingdom, regent in other words, before voting to dissolve the legislative chambers. The Republic has died a violent death, but few will mourn her."

 ### FUTURE WORLD NEWS EVENT ###:
 nfa.124.t: "Congress of Lyon is a Success!"
 nfa.124.d: "Cameras flashed across the room at the signing of the Treaty of Lyon. For decades if not centuries, the German and French people have been at odds with one another. The conclusion of the Second Weltkrieg marked the end of the third Franco-German war in the last 80 years. Many saw the conference in Lyon as just another bundle of kindling to spark further hatred between the two nations, but they have been proven wrong. With the signing of the treaty, the new French government is recognised as the true successor to the government that was toppled during the French civil war following the Great War. The Germans have agreed to pull out of much of occupied France and return the land to the rightful government of France."

They are pushing for the enforcement of unrestricted military access for our units inside of France to make sure that they do not arm themselves for a future war against us, the dismantling of the French forts along our shared border, a restriction on the tonnage of new French warships, and the establishment of Brittany firmly in our sphere. A short-term economic reparations deal to help us recover the losses we took. As well as an agreement to end hostilities for the near future while our nations rebuild is also required from the French. In exchange we will turn over the rest of occupied France that we hold.\n\nMeanwhile, the moderates are pushing for the demand that France must be subjected to economic dependence upon Germany. They must keep all of the previous agreements as well as submit themselves to becoming a member of the Mitteleuropan economic union. If their economy is dependent on ours, they can't afford to rise against us!\n\nWhile making sure to keep any in-fighting hidden from the French, the diplomatic envoys must decide whether to put forward the cautious dove deal that is almost certain to be accepted or to push their luck and try to scrape more from France by demanding the moderate deal."

 nfa.140.d: "An urgent telegram just came from our embassy in Algiers, our representative learned that the French government was planning to declare war on the Commune of France soon enough. Ignoring the fact that this will plunge all of our alliance in the war, the French planned to only inform us a few days before the declaration. Fortunately, we now have the information and can act on it. If we so wish, we can easily be able to pressure them to drop their plans and convince them that we aren't ready for war, or we can also let them do what they wish."

Started as a satellite in an occupied France, we now have full power over our land but not much use for it. Near us lays the National government of France that descends from the legitimate government of the Third Republic and claims ownership of our controlled territory. A lot of our citizens also look forward to this other government and do not understand why we are making a satellite state last.

Now with the conclusion of the Second Weltkrieg behind us, the Communards lie defeated and the reactionary [NFA.GetName] stands victorious. With the rebuilding in mind, they have come to meet us to discuss the fate of the occupation of Northern France. They feel that France must be made whole again in order to prevent collapse from within as former Communards rally against a government that allows French citizens to remain outside of the patrie.\n\nOur alliance with the French in the Entente may be called into question if we seek to retain our hold on the French land!"

# Post-War Events

 nfa.179.t: "The Question of Montmartre"
 nfa.179.d: "Paris, the most beautiful city on Earth, has been freed from the grasps of the Communard. Under their rule, she had often been martyred, defaced by radical avant-garde architecture and urban planning. Many buildings had been damaged during the revolution, and now the war has brought more destruction: as such, plans for the restoration of the City of Lights to her pre-revolutionary beauty have already been hastily thrown together as we discover the damage for the first time. However, one question remains: what should be done with Montmartre? The hill, towering above Paris, has a rich history: starting point of the 1871 Commune, later on a romantic village within the city and most importantly where an immense neo-byzantine basilica, the Sacré-Cœur, was being built, funded by donations from all over France. Close to completion when the revolution broke out, the basilica was never consecrated and was the site of a last hold out of loyalist forces. Damaged by the fighting, the building was gleefully torn down by the Reds, who saw it as a reactionary symbol as it was built to expiate the crimes of the original Commune of Paris. In its stead they built a modernist Palace of the People, where their attempt at government met.\n\nWe have received multiple proposals for the future of Montmartre, what should be done?"
 nfa.179.a: "Destroy the Palace and rebuild the Sacré-Coeur, twice as magnificent!"
 nfa.179.b: "Destroy the Palace and build an immense memorial for the victims of the revolution!"
 nfa.179.c: "Keep the Palace, but turn it into a permanent exhibit on the folly of syndicalism."

 nfa.180.t: "Les Procès - The Military"
 nfa.180.d: "Gamelin, Tanguy, Billotte, Makhno, Catroux, Delestraint... the name of the defendants' echoes in the halls of the High Military Court specially assembled to pass judgement on the officers of the Commune. Many of them had served in the French armed forces, joining the mutineers out of conviction or self-interest, others were foreigners who sought to serve the cause of the revolution. Many are present, stoic, or dazed, or crying hysterically. Some are still in hiding, some fled, and will have to be condemned in absentia. Each case is carefully examined by a court of officers, the defendant is charged with treason, mutiny, desertion, conspiracy against France, sometimes other accusations, and the verdict falls, inevitably: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.\n\nOne question remains, how to sentence the guilty. The typical sentence for military traitors is death by firing squad, however, even among our own military, there are calls for leniency on some of these officers, as they had contacted our intelligence services during or even before the war hoping to switch sides, arguing they had simply been thrust into serving a cause they did not believe in. Others argue that conflicts in the future are likely and that France cannot sacrifice talented officers."
 nfa.180.a: "Mercy? For traitors? Au mur!"
 nfa.180.b: "Arrange firing squads for the true believers. Imprison the rest."
 nfa.180.c: "Desyndicalise some, imprison the majority and make examples of the diehard supporters."

 nfa.181.t: "Les Procès - The Leaders"
 nfa.181.d: "For weeks now, dozens of high-profile Reds have been on trial in front of the High Court of Justice, assembled in the Palace of Justice in the capital. These men and women are all facing a litany of accusations: treason, sedition, conspiracy against France, corruption... enumerated by the prosecutor, resonating in the high halls, the numerous audience inside and outside the courthouse staying deathly silent, the building surrounded by military forces to prevent any risk of last-ditch effort to rescue these traitors. Their names sound familiar to our people keenly informed these last few years of their numerous crimes against France during and since the revolution: Monatte, Pivert, Thorez, Jouhaux, Blum, Sartre, and many, many others. They have been given ample time to prepare their defence, some doing so admirably, others going as far as testifying against each other in hopes of reducing their sentence, or on the contrary, choosing to remain entirely silent.\n\nMost of them have been found guilty of the crimes they were accused of: what should their sentence be? Death is the expected sentence, but this would certainly create martyrs. On the other hand, a lighter sentence could seem like a show of weakness to our supporters, and convincing our people that any of these Reds deserve mercy when they refused to show any to anyone standing in the way of their crazed revolution could prove difficult."
 nfa.181.a: "Madame la Guillotine and her unquenchable thirst awaits."
 nfa.181.b: "We are better than these godless Reds, show some mercy."

 nfa.182.t: "Les Procès - The Cadres"
 nfa.182.d: "Across France are taking place an untold number of more or less formal trials, with courts quickly assembled by loyalists to pass judgment on local cadres of the syndicalist apparatus, from militia officers to chairmen of the commune councils, or simply known true believers in the socialist cause. Our occupying forces have turned a blind to these barely legitimate courts when they don't outright supply the guns to shoot the traitors. Simply put, our reconquered people are tearing each other apart, blowing up in anger for they finally see the Reds for what they truly are, enemies of France who led them all to their collective downfall. However, these trials may have gone somewhat out of control, with unsavoury reports coming in of cruel punishments or settling of personal vendettas by the simple accusation of being a committed socialist. Furthermore, the more legalistic among us argue that this usurpation of state authority cannot be tolerated.\n\nWhat should be done?"
 nfa.182.a: "May this rightful anger consume the remnants of the Commune."
 nfa.182.b: "Call for order! Even this scum deserves a proper trial."

 nfa.185.t: "C'est Nous les Africains..."
 nfa.185.d: "Now that war is over, those who had chosen exile during the revolution are slowly making their way back. For some, it is a joyous ending to this fratricidal conflict as families are reunited and many rediscover their homeland. For others, it is a tragedy: their kin might have disappeared, their neighbourhood destroyed during the war, or their property collectivised. Some scars will take generations to heal, but the most pressing issue is that of seized property: many are clamouring for what was theirs to be given back.\n\nWe could simply declare all transfer of property undertaken under the syndicalist regime to be null, but expropriating untold numbers of families would certainly not endear us to our reunited people. We could also accept the status quo, legitimise the ownership of seized property, and simply give indemnities to the Exiles, but this might feel like a slap in the face to many. Finally, we could set up local committees investigating the claims of returning owners, which would then find a fair compromise between both parties, though this might prove complex and time-consuming."
 nfa.185.a: "We won't let thieves get away with their crime! Take back any seized property!"
 nfa.185.b: "We need to tread carefully, grant indemnities to the Exiles."
 nfa.185.c: "Set up committees, let's try to find compromise."

 nfa.186.t: "Republicanisation of the Army"
 nfa.186.d: "The recent attempted coup by reactionary elements within the armed forces has proved us that there are still many traitors within our midsts, principally royalists and Pétain loyalists who refuse to accept his decision to give up power. We cannot afford to simply purge the ranks of the armed forces from all reactionaries, the Grande Muette has hardly ever been in favour of liberal democracy. Instead, we will use a skilful mix of tactical promotions, making sure loyalists rise in ranks, and reassignments: others will be sent in the depths of the desert to monitor some tribe or another. It will be a long process, but it will certainly be effective.\n\nSome within the coalition also hope to cement their influence over our armies, and hope to discreetly include supporters of their opponents among those sent on long Saharan treks, however this would certainly be seen as a great injustice inflicted on loyal Republicans."
 nfa.186.a: "Make sure the reactionaries won't create further issues."
 nfa.186.b: "Send the reactionaries away and some of the PSF's allies too."
 nfa.186.c: "Curtail the traitors, and send some liberals along to accompany them."

 nfa.196.d: "The restored government of France has approached us, accompanied by several French business leaders, to ask for an increased economic cooperation between our two countries. Under their plan, companies of our two countries would cooperate to invest in the Ruhr and in Northern France together, which would improve the economic link between us. All of this is part of a greater effort to bring a Détente between France and Germany, profit is a basis for a lasting peace. Should we go ahead with this plan?"

 nfa.198.t: "Failure of the Franco-German Business Deal"
 nfa.198.d: "The news has come off unexpectedly. The German government refused our plan for an improved economic cooperation. They justified their refusal by citing some small details in the plan that, according to them, didn't suit their economic plans, but it is obvious this is just an excuse. We can't see anything else in this than a major blow to our attempts to an extensive diplomatic Détente between our countries."
 nfa.198.a: "Are they insulting us?"

 nfa.199.t: "The Congress of Verdun"
 nfa.199.d: "The effort of the French government to maintain a lasting peace between our countries continues. Today, the French ambassador presented himself to the Imperial Palace in Berlin with an official letter inviting our government to a Franco-German Congress in Verdun. The ambassador said the French government is hoping that the congress would be an occasion to draft an official peace and a deeper cooperation between Paris and Berlin. It would also be a rare moment to discuss the history and future of the troubled Franco-German relationship, a history filled with wars and rivalry, and Verdun being one of its symbols. It's at Verdun that millions died in 1916 in the Great War, it was also in Verdun that the territories of France and Germany were first separated in 843 by the heirs of Charlemagne.\n\nHow should we answer this attempt for peace?"
 nfa.199.a: "We shall attend the Congress."

 nfa.200.a: "Excellent!"

 nfa.201.t: "Germany refuses to attend the Congress"
 nfa.201.d: "Our ambassador just came back from the imperial palace and immediately called Paris to announce the sad news: the German government didn't accept our invitation for a diplomatic congress in Verdun, saying that they do not think such an effort would be worthwhile. The answer created an outrage in our ministry for foreign affairs as all of our efforts to organise the Congress now seem wasted. It seemed that in the end we couldn't trust the Germans."
 nfa.201.a: "The Germans seek the comfort of arms over the fruits of peace."

 nfa.202.t: "The Path to Peace?"
 nfa.202.d: "As long as the concepts of France and Germany have been separated by the splitting up of Charlemagne's empire, the two nations have been rivals. The kingdom of France fought the Holy Roman Empire more times than is possible to count, and Napoleon created his empire on the grave of the German one. Prussia then made France pay in 1871, recreating their empire on the rubble of the Second Napoleonic one. Then, the newborn Republic and the German Empire continued the intense rivalry, fighting in Africa, in schools, in newspapers and finally, in the fields of Northern France during the Great War.\n\nWith the French Republic back in Paris, some diplomats and intellectuals have called for a new era of Franco-German relations, one in which France and Germany would cooperate for the good of the continent instead of sending millions of their children to die every few years.

 #Army decides to block the coup #This is for when the Neutralise the PSF focus has been taken:
 nfa.220.d.parliament: "With his influence whittled away over the past few years, the outcome of his attempted coup was a foregone conclusion. A mole planted in his upper circle revealed his plan to use his contacts in the Army to transform France into his personal state.\n\nQuickly, loyalists to the democratic cause confronted and restrained any of those who would threaten our democratic way of life. Shocked at how quickly his plans unravelled, François de La Rocque was sent to the Casbah to await his trial.\n\nWith the threat to democracy nipped at the bud, the Army has declared its support for a return to free elections now that the Métropole has been retaken."
 #Army decides to back the coup #This is for when the Constitutional Reform focus has been taken:
 nfa.220.d.dlr: "Over the past few years, François de La Rocque has been able to accumulate vast influence in nearly every corner of French society. He has informants and contacts in the highest echelons of the French military loyal to his call.\n\nWhile the Reds may have been beaten on the field of battle, there is still much more work that must be done to ensure the safety of France from those who lurk inside. In the best interest of the country, François de La Rocque has called his officers together for a meeting of the utmost importance."
 #Army gets to decide to back coup or not #Neither of the above has been taken.:

The Parti Social Français has started to coalesce behind de La Rocque stronger than ever and there are rumours that he may be preparing a coup to take the reins himself.\n\nThe Army, traditionally aloof from politics, has had its hand forced.

This is of course all thanks to the Bear, President Henri Mordacq, whose presence at the head of the French Republic made sure that none dared threaten the stability of France during wartime. With the métropole reconquered, the differences in visions for the future of the nation might prove too much to bear for the coalition. The failed coup of the colonels already led to the break-off of the discredited PSF, which united the Radicals and the PRD together in a Concentration Républicaine, but there are now talks of ending the Coalition altogether. The truth is the only thing still holding the Coalition together is Mordacq's presence. A word from him could ensure its continuation, a word from him could end it."

The Radicals are now playing with the idea of participating independently in elections, using their newfound popularity as left moderates in the métropole. The truth is the only thing still holding the Concentration together is Mordacq's presence. A word from him could ensure its continuation, a word from him could end it."

Two electoral alliances face off: the right-wing Bloc National made up of the Parti Social Français and more minor right and centre-right wing forces, who hope to continue to reform France according to a compromise between the vision of Colonel de La Rocque and the more moderate right wing forces, and the Radicals, who as a formerly marginalised centre-left force enjoy the renewed support of those who still cling to some aspects of the left-wing dream."
 nfa.222.d.wholecon: "With the métropole freed, it is time to organise the first truly democratic elections in the French Republic in more than two decades. Thanks to the influence of President Mordacq, the unity coalition has held, even now that the Mainland has been reconquered. All the major parties being represented in this ruling coalition, the outcome of the election is not a surprise for anybody: the Concentration Républicaine has achieved an overwhelming victory, ensuring stability for the next four years as democracy slowly reasserts itself. Truly united, France can once again go forward through peaceful compromise."

He has the choice between keeping up the facade of democracy in place, with himself at the head, obviously, or clamping down with the Army at his back and installing a military junta not too dissimilar than the one run by Marshal Pétain."

As such, the various parties of the Bloc National have convened to decide which man they should choose to represent their interests in the coming presidential elections. This choice is particularly important, as the man they will choose will certainly be elected: the president is chosen by the Assembly to head the Republic for seven years, and their recently won majority is already enough to elect the candidate of their choosing.\n\nTwo are being seriously considered, the favourite Colonel François de La Rocque of the PSF, head of the former unity government during wartime who needs no introduction but whose dominant position has been somewhat shaken as he has not yet implemented the PSF as well as in Algeria, and Louis Marin, a veteran of conservative parliamentary politics, member of the Chamber of Deputies for now close to four decades. An ethnography professor, conservative, cultured, patriotic, a moderate Catholic, Marin is the very picture of a distinguished older gentleman, well appreciated by his colleagues and the public at large and as such is seen as a compromise candidate."

She stands as a major player in the world thanks to the leadership of great men like him!

The President will thus have a much greater power coming from its democratic legitimation.

The Bear then gave a long speech explaining his reasons for such a decision: as a devotee of democracy, he only wishes to see her flourish, something that she could not do under a president elected in exile by a rump parliament. He thanked the French people for their tremendous effort in the reconquest of the French nation and for their loyalty towards him, and shared his wish for a future where France will never again be so divided. Of course, this decision was long-anticipated: the president of the Assembly invoked Article 7 of the Constitutional Laws, stating that in case of vacancy a new Head of State should be immediately elected by the parliament. The Bloc National had their candidate, Colonel François de la Rocque, but their defeat in the legislative elections meant that the Radicals had the comfortable majority necessary to elect their candidate: Édouard Daladier. The victory of the \"Taureau\" was saluted by those who, like him, never ceased to believe in the supremacy of parliament and democracy."

Minor parties lying outside the coalition proposed their own candidates, but only one candidate was seriously considered, a true compromise candidate: Pierre-Étienne Flandin, a man of the moderate right, the former pilot elected to the Assembly at only 25 years old, whose skills as a knowledgeable technician made indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines. Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. This makes him perfect for the role of president."

 nfa.239.t: "The Colonel, Outmanoeuvred"
 nfa.239.d: "Today, Colonel François de La Rocque handed over his resignation as Chief of the Council of Ministers to President Mordacq. Tensions in the wide Union Sacrée coalition around the Colonel had reached a boiling point, as the representatives of the traditional parties of the Third Republic could not bring themselves to agree with the wide political reforms envisioned by the PSF and worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reinforce their positions and bring back some lost prestige to their parties and to the traditional democratic institutions of the Republic. It is even rumoured that Mordacq himself intervened to prevent the coalition from entirely breaking apart in these critical times, and personally asked for the formation of a new government as a conciliatory measure. This new government headed by the PRD's Paul Reynaud was presented to the Assembly later in the day and passed a near unanimous vote of confidence.\n\nOf course, this change in course does not mean that the PSF or de La Rocque are now in opposition with the government, and the Colonel himself does not see this as the end of his bid for power: after all the PSF is still an important party, and future electoral fortunes could certainly bring him back in the forefront of politics. In the meantime however, the party will have to take a secondary role in the coalition, a blow to its aspirations of deep reforms of the institutions of the Republic."
 nfa.239.a: "Vive la Concentration Républicaine !"

 nfa.240.t: "A New Constitution?"
 nfa.240.d: "With the dominance of the Parti Social Français and its president Colonel François de la Rocque over the Union Sacrée coalition asserted by months of political manoeuvring, the gears of deeper reforms are finally being put into motion. Today, the Colonel announced in front of the Assembly his plans for a constitutional referendum once the war is won, one that would thoroughly transform the institutions of the Republic and create a semi-presidential, democratic, more stable regime, instead of a Republic dominated by her fickle parliament. This was entirely expected of the Colonel, as this has been part of the PSF's platform since the creation of the party. However, he ended this speech by saying that this constitutional reform would be voted on by referendum, as he argues that the French people are after all sovereign: for reform of such importance, they are the most qualified to decide upon the future of the nation.\n\nThis immediately created an uproar among partisans of the supremacy of parliament. Indeed the last time a referendum was used in such a way, it was by President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to bury the Second Republic. Name calling, accusations of tyranny flew across the hemicycle, members of parliament even came to blows, and by the end of the day it was clear the Union Sacrée had only the nominal support of much of his former allies. As such, a new government was formed under de La Rocque with those sympathetic to his plans, though President Mordacq intervened so that the appearance of unity remains in this critical time. The traditional parties of the Third Republic, in no small part responsible for her fall, have simply been left behind in the dust as Mordacq continues to revolutionise French politics."

 nfa.243.d: "Louis Bonaparte is no more. He will now be known as Napoléon VI, Emperor of the French and successor of the previous reigning French emperors: Napoléon I and Napoléon III.\n\nThe creation of the new empire didn't come from the old republican political class but directly from the people, who approved the new constitution in a landslide during a plebiscite. After hearing of the news, Napoléon VI paraded magnificently in Paris. He drove down the Champs-Elysées aboard a military vehicle, encircled by a mass of Parisians shouting his name and followed by 3 columns of the best veterans of the last French wars. Napoléon accompanied these warriors first in the reconquest of the Métropole and then onwards to finally retake Alsace-Lorraine and restore the region to France! He didn't only command them but fought alongside them with only the pride of France as his ideal.\n\nThe people of France are now rewarding the War Hero appropriately, they recognised his valour and decided to offer him the throne as a show of their faith in him. The republican politicians were outraged by what they call a coup d'Etat, but Napoléon knows that the French nation is in its people and not its politicians. The emperor didn't get an official religious coronation, choosing to base his legitimacy on the mandate of the people rather than on the church, but did end his Parisian parade with an impressive mass at the church of the Madeleine to show the friendship of the Empire with the thousand-year-old French Catholic church.\n\nThe form of the new state will be a constitutional monarchy. Napoléon VI will thus rule alongside an elected parliament to best serve the interests of the people. The current parliament, dominated by the Bloc National, will be kept and will serve as the first legislature under the Empire. With the emperor at its head, France seems to be ready to live through another period of peace and glory."

The next step to rebuild France in its glory is political. The CSN has been designed since the start to be temporary until the Métropole can be retaken. Mordacq promised several times that once the time comes, the Republic and democracy will be restored in France following the old constitution of the IIIrd Republic.\n\nThe time has now come. Mordacq convened a reunion of the CSN for the last time this morning, he thanked everyone for their hard work and determination in saving France before announcing that the CSN will be dissolved at the end of the reunion and replaced by a democratic civilian government, of which the first elections will be held soon. The democratic political scene has had a hard time organising in exile but it now seems to be divided between a moderate left-wing tendency led by the Radicals and a union of conservative parties led by the PSF. After this election will come, as planned by the constitution, the election of the President for 7 years. Until the election can come Mordacq has also announced he will stay as an interim President, in that role he will be able to preside over the democratic transition and make sure it goes as intended."

 nfa.250.t: "Fate of Equatorial French Africa"
 nfa.250.d: "For some time, we had held out hope that the occupation of many of our colonies by the Germans would be short. Their widespread expansion across the globe could have produced the conditions needed for them to collapse. But the socialist regime in the Métropole failed to disintegrate and we have been forced to remain entrenched in Algiers, staring daggers at our brothers across the Mediterranean. Then, our long standing ally in the United Kingdom fell apart in 1925 leaving us in no condition to return our colonies to French rule. The Governor-General of what remains of French Equatorial Africa, Raphaël Antonetti, has decided to step down from his post citing a failing in his health in recent years. Antonetti has held the position since 1924, seeing the region through turbulent times, earning a well-deserved retirement.\n\nWith the seat left vacant, it may now be time to merge our two colonial sub-Saharan governments into one unified administration. The German Empire remains ascendant and the split focus on resource allocation is a waste of time and effort. With only a narrow portion of Chad remaining of French Equatorial Africa, we must move to merge Chad into the French West Africa administration. Some day our rightful territory might return to us, but that day is not today."

 nfa.251.d.civmission: "Officials from all across our colonies met together in Algiers to discuss how we shall govern the colonies under our control. With the recent reconquest of the Métropole from the syndicalists, we are finally back on our home turf. Now we must decide what to do with the colonies that supported us during our exile following our defeat in the Great War.\n\nMany in our government see our continued effort of spreading the civilisation mission as the future for France! The natives of Africa largely stood by our side during our darkest hour and deserve better recognition and representation in our country. As the population continues to assimilate into French culture, they should be admitted into a new French Union between the Métropole and the colonies!"
 nfa.251.d.autonomy: "Officials from all across our colonies met together in Algiers to discuss how we shall govern the colonies under our control. With the recent reconquest of the Métropole from the syndicalists, we are finally back on our home turf. Now we must decide what to do with the colonies that supported us during our exile following our defeat in the Great War.\n\nOur policymakers have come to a brief conclusion. The time has come to ease the yolk off the backs of the native population. We must take immediate measures to give power back over to the native chiefs and local powers. As they rebuild the societies that we have torn apart in our past, we shall continue to provide protection against any exterior threats until such a time as they are ready to defend themselves."
 nfa.251.a: "Let us continue our efforts to incorporate African peoples as French citizens."
 nfa.251.b: "Enact wide-sweeping autonomy across the empire."

 nfa.252.t: "Workers Run Away"
 nfa.252.d: "Faced with a reduction in provisions as a result of the new policy placed by our government, large groups of native workers have decided to take the risk and run for it. Overnight, several skilled workers got up from their barracks, raided the mess for food and supplies and set off into the desert to find their way back home. Any search for these men was made impossible by sweeping winds erasing their tracks in the sand. We must find more workers if we hope to finish this project!"
 nfa.252.a: "We really should have seen this coming..."

 nfa.253.t: "The Project Nears Completion!"
 nfa.253.d: "Long have we dreamed of this day. Even during some of the darkest days of France's history, her people have been able to persevere and display their resilience to the world. The Trans-Sahara Railway shall be our show of force that the French people are not defeated! The country stands strong!\n\nEven at the height of our power before the Great War, many doubted our ability to create such a feat of engineering as this railway. We will show the Commune and the watching world that in spite of our exile, the French people's spirit still burns as bright as ever!"
 nfa.253.a: "Our country shall soon be united!"

 nfa.254.t: "Workers Go On Strike"
 nfa.254.d: "Disgruntled over the continuation of lower pay and longer hours, groups of workers on the Trans-Sahara Railway have laid aside their tools in protest. They are demanding change in our treatment of them. If conditions were to improve, they would be happy to go back to work but we would need to bring conditions back to where they were before we cut resources devoted to the workers. Alternatively, we could stop shipments of supplies to the workers until they agree to go back to work."
 nfa.254.a: "Improve working conditions."
 nfa.254.b: "Wait it out."

 nfa.255.t: "Railway Sabotaged"
 nfa.255.d: "Recently, teams have found damaged sections of rails in sectors that should be in pristine condition. It is not clear whether these areas are a work of intentional sabotage or simply unskilled labourers creating shoddy work. In either case, we have to devote more manpower to watching out for raids in the night as well as more supervision of the workers during the day."
 nfa.255.a: "Push through this setback."

 nfa.256.t: "Consolidate All Of British Africa?"
 nfa.256.d: "With the collapse of the German Empire's colonies in Africa, we were approached by the leadership of [BWA.GetNameDef] about the rest of the former British colonies that are currently ruled from [NFA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Since the rest of British West Africa has realigned with our government, they have requested the ability to govern the colonies of Sierra Leone and Gambia as well. Transferring the colonies to the British administration would free up our garrisons that could be sent to nearby colonies to assist, but it would also entail giving up our direct access to the resources of the colonies."
 nfa.256.a: "Transfer Sierra Leone and Gambia."
 nfa.256.b: "We will continue to hold onto the territory."

 nfa.257.t: "Phase One Complete"
 nfa.257.d: "The first phase of the Trans-Saharan Railway has proven to be promising. Day and night, labourers from across West Africa have built far into the desert, starting in Southern Algeria and now making nearly a quarter of the way into the Sahara.\n\nCritics of this project have cited poor working conditions and the fact that these resources should be diverted to the mobilisation of our military. Though our engineers and advisors continue to encourage increased support for the project, as the construction has progressed fairly quickly and efficiently. One thing is clear, however: this is just the beginning."
 nfa.257.a: "We can do this!"

 nfa.258.t: "Phase Two Complete"
 nfa.258.d: "Another progress report on the Trans-Saharan Railway project has come in. The in-progress railway now extends about halfway through the Saharan Desert. Many trials and tribulations have occurred throughout the project, as threats of strikes from both French and Native workers have occurred due to poor working conditions, and fears of Senussi coming from Cyrenaica have spread throughout the construction site.\n\nDespite this, construction has continued as the place is abuzz with labourers, engineers, and military personnel patrolling the desert. However, with reports of the construction showing extreme promise, many investments, from abroad and from within, have appeared, as even investors from Germany have shown interest alongside Turkish and Canadian ones."
 nfa.258.a: "We will show the world what we can still do!"

 nfa.259.t: "Phase Three Complete"
 nfa.259.d: "The Trans-Saharan Railway Project has presented us with a third progress report. The railway now has expanded to the edges of the Algerian Sahara, and has entered Northern Mali.\n\nSupplemented by the investment from across the world, from our allies in the Entente, to the nations of Mitteleuropa, many have been impressed at the success of our engineers, who work day and night to keep this project alive. The labour force has fluctuated throughout this portion of the project, although the conditions have improved with the increase in available supplies to the labourers, we have sometimes have had to resort to the use of inmates from across West Africa as a solution to labourers quitting the job. Critics have argued that this is cruel and unusual punishment, but the supporters have argued that the project cannot be abandoned now with how far it is gone.\n\nWith the end of the construction nearing, a grand opening of the railway has begun being planned, with [NFA.GetLeader] scheduled to make a personal appearance and to make a brief speech."
 nfa.259.a: "The end is in sight!"

 nfa.260.t: "Phase Four Complete"
 nfa.260.d: "The Trans-Saharan Railway Project was completed today. Months upon months of construction, trials and tribulations, and investment has led to this remarkable occasion. [NFA.GetLeader] made an appearance in Southern Algeria, making a brief speech, congratulating the engineering team on this project being finished and seeing the first ever train off - a passenger train carrying around 150 people, most of whom are those who invested in the project, military officers and soldiers who were assigned to guard the construction site, and much of the engineering team.\n\nThis project was commemorated as a historical achievement in railway engineering, impressing international viewers and giving the French engineering industry a better name in the world. The only critics that remained were those in the Commune, as Red newspapers cited mistreatment of workers and the forced labour of prisoners.\n\nNevertheless, the Trans-Saharan Railway will forever be a valuable resource in our empire, connecting the colonies of French West Africa by train. There are already plans for the railway to allow passenger trains to go along the several military supply trains already scheduled to make the journey across the Sahara."
 nfa.260.a: "A marvel for the world to see!"

 nfa.270.t: "Fate of the Four Hundred Blows"
 nfa.270.d: "Eugène Deloncle, head of the terrorist organisation known as the Four Hundred Blows, close to the Action Française and notorious conspirator against the Republic, has been arrested as he was hurriedly planning an escape to Portugal. For years, he had been escaping the grasps of both police and our intelligence services, assassinating and bombing at will. His goal had apparently been to make his organisation's schemes out to be Communard or Indigènes plots, to goad the Pétain regime into cracking down further, but few were still credulous enough to believe this. His reign of terror is over, but the question remains: what should be done with him? A military tribunal would certainly sentence him to death, but his skills are undeniable and he has offered to serve the Republic in exchange for his life."
 nfa.270.a: "No use for traitors. Au mur !"
 nfa.270.b: "He will now use his skills for good, against the Reds."

 nfa.271.t: "Corvignolles"
 nfa.271.d: "Following our victory against Mordacq and his supporters, it has come to our attention that our Intelligence service, the Deuxième Bureau, has been compromised by pro-Mordacq elements. Following a secret investigation by Deloncle and his group \"les 400 coups\", we have identified an agency within the Deuxième Bureau, named the 'Corvignolles network', led by the nationalist colonel George Groussard. Despite his former allegiance to the democratic forces, he is still a good Communard-hating Frenchman, and it would be a shame to let his skills go to waste: we can send him to the Commune, where he will fight the Communard scum while being unable to represent a threat to our regime. Or, just say the word, and Deloncle will take care of him once and for all."
 nfa.271.a: "You know what to do, Deloncle."
 nfa.271.b: "Send him to the mainland, we can't spare competent patriots like him."

 nfa.272.t: "Shadows of the Oriflamme"
 nfa.272.d: "As our services were preparing to take down Groussard under Deloncle's supervision, Groussard decided to strike first. We managed to locate his hideout and had it surrounded by competent officers, but before the order to launch the assault was given, our agents were attacked by a stolen armoured car and were forced to retreat. Most of our agents lost their trace, and we found the corpses of those who did not in the middle of the street. Groussard made sure to leave no evidence in his hideout by setting it in fire before leaving, reducing everything but a single piece of paper to ashes. Now, we are left with nothing but a mere word, 'Oriflamme' and more questions than answers."
 nfa.272.a: "We'll get him some day."

 nfa.301.d: "Following the transition of power from Pétain's government into the Committee of National Salvation, our government has received a letter from Switzerland. The young heir of the Bonaparte line, Louis Bonaparte, has expressed interest in serving under the banner of the true French flag. In order to do so however, the law of exile banning heirs of the old imperial dynasties signed in 1886 must be repealed. Louis wishes to join the Algiers academy and offer his military service for the country. Repealing the law may bring some greater levels of support for our government from the monarchist camp, and France needs all the soldiers she can get. On the other hand, this may be seen as an attack against the democratic rule that we wish to return to following our return to the continent."
 nfa.301.a: "Repeal the Law."
 nfa.301.b: "It was created for good reasons."

 nfa.302.t: "A Bonaparte Back on French soil"
 nfa.302.d: "This morning, a small crowd gathered at the docks in Algiers to see the young Louis as he got off the boat. His journey took him across the Swiss Alps and through Austria, until he could find a boat offering passage down to Algiers. Quieting the crowds, Louis quickly gave a short speech praising the French Republic and affirming his belief in democracy and the rights of the people to vote who they support into positions of power and authority. To conclude his speech, he called on all the young men and women in the crowd to do their duty for France and enlist to liberate her from the Communard yoke!"

Until his last breath, our King had been eager to serve his country and his nation in the place that was his, a country that he loved with unconditional love, the love of a father, for France and for the French, considering each as his children. Having served in the Great War, since his rise as head of the French Capetians he worked tirelessly to propose an alternative to the failing republic and after de Gaulle's fateful call to restore the monarchy, to implement the deep reform needed to truly restore the Kingdom of France. But the burden of his increased responsibilities proved too much to bear for the monarch, already deeply affected by the defeat and the exile, and his health had been on a steady decline for some time. The dauphin had stepped in to relieve his father but this wasn't sufficient, and those in the know knew that the passing of the King was only a matter of time. Part of Jean III's dream to see his kingdom restored had come true, and with his family attending to him in his last moments, particularly his son the dauphin and his grandson Henri, he knew that the future was assured, that he was leaving the kingdom in good hands, that France would soon be freed, that all the sacrifices endured by his people and by himself had not been in vain, that, at last, he could rest.\n\nA week of national mourning has been decreed, at the end of which King Jean will be buried. Jean, departed from this world and now close to God, is succeeded by his eldest son, Henri, 32 years old. The energetic young man has been particularly active in working first towards the restoration in cooperation with the Action Française, then since his father's coronation in the matters of state.

Much like his father's coronation, the ceremony followed as closely as possible the traditions established over a millennium by the French monarchy: after swearing the traditional oaths and being anointed with oil from the Holy Ampulla, the prince was dressed in the regalia of the kings of France and finally crowned by the archbishop of Algiers. Peers of France and indigenous chiefs then swore fidelity to the newly crowned king, a mass was said, and all headed out of the cathedral.\n\nHis Majesty, instead of immediately heading back to the royal palace for a private reception chose to partake in his people's revelry, mingling for some time with the crowd assembled to see their new king and delivering a speech radio transmitted throughout the whole empire calling for unity and resolve in the face of the coming hardships, assuring all that the efforts demanded of France and her people will not be in vain. Popular festivities lasted late into the night, and this morning, two things are clear: the continuity of the monarchy is now well assured, and our nation must now be more determined than ever to free our countrymen from the red shackles of the Commune, so that one day the kings of France may be crowned in Reims once again."

Unlike his father's coronation, the ceremony could follow as closely as possible the rituals established over a millennium by the monarchy. After swearing the traditional oaths and being anointed with oil from the Holy Ampulla, the prince was dressed in the regalia of the kings of France, including some thought lost in the exile like the hand of justice and the sceptre of Charles VI, before finally being crowned by the archbishop of Reims. Peers of the reborn kingdom and indigenous chiefs swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said.\n\nOutside the cathedral, though there were cheers and cries of 'Long live the King' along with jeers and insults, the crowd seemed mostly perplexed by this surreal sight: after all, it had been more than a century since a king was last crowned in Reims, and two decades under the Commune had certainly made it seem impossible that such an event would happen again. And so, instead of heading back to the residence of the archbishops of Reims for a private reception, His Majesty chose to head out of the cathedral on foot accompanied by his young son, mingling for some time with his new subjects, almost to prove to the reconquered nation, and perhaps to himself, that this was all indeed real: the red beast was slain, the kingdom was well and truly reborn, this war pitting brothers against brothers was over. Henri VI then delivered a speech radio transmitted throughout France and her empire, assuring that with his coronation, a new era has dawned, an era of order, peace and prosperity, and that all the sacrifices France had endured will not be in vain.

 nfa.313.d: "The left, the Radicals, the moderates were all prime suspects. From municipal councillors to members of parliament, they had headed the Gueuse for decades, failing France at every turn, always pushing further for the destruction of the Church, fanning the flames of socialism with their incompetence and demagogic promises. Those not already awaiting trial were arrested, interrogated, sometimes made to give up names of fellow traitors, sometimes forced to confess to their treason. Special tribunals were created, with the crowd gathering in every town to see those who had betrayed them for so long get what was long coming. At last the \"pays légal\" was tumbling. Trials were often somewhat rushed, but most were given time to prepare their defence, with proper legal assistance provided if they could not afford one. Most were condemned to a ban from holding public office, some to prison sentences, and few to the death penalty. While this is satisfactory for the government, some more radical voices advocate for more expedite procedures to deal with such filth."

 nfa.314.t: "22, Here Come the Cops"
 nfa.314.d: "As expected, it didn't take long for our investigations to find problematic elements within the police force, with a few cases of what appears to be revolutionary cells forming up. Thankfully, they were caught in time, and these policemen were persuaded by fellow officers, intelligence service and Camelots who happened to assist questioning sessions to give up any co-conspirators who have slipped through the cracks. Some who had survived the last parade were particularly strongly advised to indicate whether their treason on that fateful day was spontaneous, or premeditated. For good measure, officers with known sympathies for Mordacq and the democratic cause were interrogated, with sanctions being envisaged for them as well."

 nfa.315.d: "It seems that though much of the Army stood with Mordacq in his opposition to the Marshal's more fanciful use of information against perceived traitors. Even of the men thought close to the Action Française, most were in the end much less sympathetic to the democratic cause than one could have feared. Or at least, that is what much of those interrogated by martial court assure us, perhaps cowed by Mordacq's untimely fate. In any case, though some will have to be shot, at the very least to set an example, most of the men interrogated could be reintegrated within the ranks without much penalty: the core of Mordacq's clique was blown apart along with their leader, and unified opposition from the armed forces seems unlikely."

It seems that a large part of the Bureau was sympathetic to Mordacq, and though they have dutifully helped us purge other elements of society, they have also carefully hidden proof that some of them were in contact with our enemies, even going as far as destroying seized evidence. We must however tread carefully: these are all incredibly talented men, and our investigation seems to show that they acted more by loyalty to each other than any deep ideological commitment. The Rooster, personally close to some of the men of the Bureau, seems to think that simply court-circuiting the mole, feeding him inaccurate information for him to share to planted contacts and letting the Bureau remain intact will be sufficient: after all there are few open Republicans left, sacrificing valuable assets to fight shadows seems like a waste. Others argue that the Bureau cannot be trusted, and that as such it should be disbanded and replaced, with some of the less trustworthy members assigned to posts far in the Saharan desert. Finally, simply getting rid of all of them might be the easiest choice."

It is possible however that we hit too much on the Republicans in some sectors, lowering our efficiency there, or contrarily that we didn't hit on them enough, which means some parts of the State aren't entirely under our control yet. But ultimately this can't endanger the regime any more. In any way we can thank our Camelots du Roi and our investigators for this well-rounded affair and we can now only hope that this newfound loyalty will last."

Mostly orchestrated by members of the OSARN, and the faithful, free to return to more openly practise their religious beliefs, many in the countryside have longed for this day for decades. The mood in larger city centres, however, is much more subdued. With a great number of socialists having known friends or families that fell to our troops, the occasional jeer or heckle can be heard amidst the activities. While no open conflict has broken out amongst the divided French nation during the victory parades, it is clear that it will be a difficult task ahead to rebuild France.\n\nMuch of the country lies in ruins as the Communard armies retreated before our forces. Pockets of resistance and stay-behind units not too dissimilar from our own OSARN cells are surely gathering in the corners where the light doesn't reach. If we are to avoid a protracted resistance to our rule, we must be dutiful and swift in the rebuilding of France. Much has been sacrificed to reach this point.

We are of course already working hard to conquer the hearts and minds of our people, and help them see that all the hardships that had befallen the motherland for so long were the product of Republican mediocrity and interior enemies. But to truly reform France, we must promote national symbols fit for the reborn Kingdom. Marianne, the denuded wench, has already been done away with, and the fate of the Marseillaise is controversial. But another subject is debated among royalists: that of the flag. The idea of going back to the white and gold fleurs-de-lys of the Ancien Régime has long been abandoned by the Action Française, though it remains the royal standard, and the blue, white and red flag is now accepted even among committed royalists. But if the colours are uncontroversial, the presence of the royal arms on the flag is not. Adopted in exile, mostly out of practicality, many expect our current ensign to be replaced by a plain Tricolore, once and for all co-opting this symbol for the monarchist cause. However, a minority argues that we should on the contrary adopt permanently the 'Royal Tricolour', that too many Frenchmen died for this flag. What should the King decide?"
 nfa.319.a: "Restore the Tricolore."
 nfa.319.b: "Keep our flag."

 nfa_af_holiday_shared: "July fourteenth, regardless of whether it celebrated the fall of the Bastille or the Feast of the Federation, was of course wholly inappropriate for our reborn nation to maintain as a holiday. We do not reject all that has happened since 1789, but celebrating rebellion against one's rightful ruler or his shackling with 'constitutional' chains would be downright seditious. Instead, great celebrations have been organised for our people, with military parades, public feasts, popular balls, fireworks displays, open air masses and processions taking part throughout the nation."

 nfa.393.t: "Following the Pucelle"
 nfa.393.d: "As per our King's decision, May thirtieth, feast of Saint Joan of Arc, has been made France's new national day. The story of the holy peasant girl, called by Heaven to save our nation from invasion and civil war, of course resonates stronger than ever for us. Having fought and beaten back the enemies of France, martyred, she became immortal. Her sainthood was recognised by the Holy See only recently, as France was torn apart by the godless, but devotion to her, in life as a veritable living saint, in death as a folk hero and holy figure, never wavered. Despite centuries of struggle against Christian France waged by internal, infernal forces, it was to her that our soldiers came for comfort during the Great War, her example an inspiration to all, now and then.\n\n$nfa_af_holiday_shared$ Johannine festivals are proving particularly popular, with young girls dressed in armour opening the festivities on horseback. These celebrations exalt the French character, our strength, and culture, a great moment of national unity. Above all, this is a reminder of the holy destiny of France, her people, and her dynasty: the very saints hope and pray for our ultimate victory, which will only be achieved once King and People act in perfect Christian harmony."
 nfa.393.a: "Joan, help us!"

 nfa.395.t: "Our Lady's Realm"
 nfa.395.d: "As per our King's decision, August fifteenth, feast day of the Assumption of Mary, when Our Lady was crowned Queen of Heaven after being welcomed in His Kingdom by her son, has been made France's new national day. For centuries, celebrations had taken place throughout the country on this particular date, not only out of piety but also national pride. Indeed, the Virgin Mary has traditionally been considered 'Regnum Galliae', Queen of France, a tradition reinforced by the vow made by King Louis XIII in 1638 to consecrate the realm to the Mother of God. This devotion to the Virgin, and the favours she has shown our nation in return, blessing us with many apparitions on our soil, can only be described as inseparable from our national character: her noble blue colour is even on our national flag!\n\n$nfa_af_holiday_shared$ These celebrations exalt the French character, our strength, and culture, a great moment of national unity and above all an opportunity to rejoice in the eternal link between Our Lady, our Dynasty, and our people. We are after all custodians of this fief of the Queen of Heaven: who could stand in our way, as we strive forward under her protection, knights of the Virgin fighting against the forces of Evil one and all."
 nfa.395.a: "Our Lady, pray for France!"

 nfa.397.t: "Under the King's Guidance"
 nfa.397.d: "As per our King's decision, August twenty-fifth, the feast day of his glorious ancestor Saint Louis IX, holy martyr and King of France, has become our new national day. The mediaeval king was revered as a living saint throughout Christendom for his deep personal piety: all princes bowed to his wisdom, often coming to him to settle their disputes, his judgement always true and just. His decision to take up the Cross and embark first towards the Holy Land and Egypt, then to the walls of Tunis where he met a tragic end, ensured if there was ever any doubt that the King would forever live: in Heaven and in the hearts of all Frenchmen. The ideal knight, the ideal king: we can only hope to follow in his example, as all of his descendents have admirably done.\n\n$nfa_af_holiday_shared$ These celebrations exalt the French character, our strength, and culture, a great moment of national unity and above all an opportunity to rejoice in the eternal link between the King and the People. Forty generations of kings have made France, and we can trust the heir of Saint Louis to lead us towards further glory, his royal person the very avatar of the Nation."
 nfa.397.a: "Saint Louis, protect the King!"

 #Jan 1936 and then one every month and a half:
 nfa.401.t: "The White Fathers"
 nfa.401.d: "Critical to the stability of the regime, the Society of the Missionaries of Africa is a Catholic society of apostolic life focusing on evangelism and education in Africa. Founded in 1868 in Algiers, they quickly became an integral part of colonial society, adapting to native customs, adopting the native dress, all the while accomplishing a tremendous amount of ethnographic and geographic research. They have been on the forefront of French initiatives on the continent, despite their sometimes strained relationship with an increasingly anticlerical republican government. They have become staunch advocates for the native populations, even accepting native priests, never hesitating to side with them against the colonial authorities when needed and generally acting as a bridge between the two, earning them the affectionate nickname of 'White Fathers'.\n\nIn the troubled times since the revolution, they have become downright crucial to maintaining French authority over what is left of the empire, working tirelessly to maintain the peace between colonists, Exiles, and natives with the full support of the Marshal's conservative government."
 nfa.401.a: "Our Lady of Africa, pray for us and the Muslims!"

 nfa.402.t: "Action Algérienne"
 nfa.402.d: "Founded in 1928 by Ferhat Abbas, calling itself the principal media outlet of integral nationalism alongside the main Action Française, Action Algérienne has become one of the most popular newspapers within the Algerian departments. Its slogan, 'From Colony to Province', summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the Indigènes."
 nfa.402.a: "Nationalists, united against the Republic? Can't be good."

 nfa.403.t: "Jacques Bainville"
 nfa.403.d: "Jacques Bainville, born in 1879, renowned historian, journalist, and one of the founders of the Action Française, has died at 57 years old. Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled 'The Political Consequences of Peace', Bainville exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among Exiles, and Bainville's funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the life and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."
 nfa.403.a: "A great man!"

 nfa.404.t: "Immaculée-Conception de Ouagadougou"
 nfa.404.d: "The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Ouagadougou was consecrated today in the presence of [NFA.GetLeader], Governor of Haute-Volta Henri-Louis Joseph Chessé, and Joanny Thévenoud, the very influential apostolic vicar of the city of Ouagadougou, whom some whisper is the \"true governor\" of the colony. The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thévenoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thévenoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."
 nfa.404.a: "A living saint, that Thévenoud!"

 nfa.405.t: "Mother's Day"
 nfa.405.d: "Ten years ago, the government instituted a heavy-handed natalist policy, which among many other measures included the creation of a special celebration for Mothers' Day, and of a Medal of the French Family, awarded to good mothers of numerous families. Though the results of these policies are only just starting to be felt, Mothers' Day has caught on as a truly popular celebration, is now widely celebrated in schools and homes across the nation to the delight of mothers everywhere, and it has become customary for children to bring home little gifts for their mothers, and for husbands to make sure this is a special day for wives and of course for their own mothers.\n\nIn a speech broadcast on the radio today, President [NFA.GetLeader] reminded women that 'Only you can give to future generations the taste for honest work, this sense of discipline, of modesty, of respect which makes healthy men and a strong nation. You are the source of our Christian civilisation, and our greatest hope for the future', ensuring that the incredibly important role of women in society is reminded to all and given the respect it deserves."
 nfa.405.a: "Bonne fête Maman !"

 nfa.406.t: "Humanisme Intégral"
 nfa.406.d: "'Integral Humanism. Temporal and spiritual problems of a new Christianity', the recently published work of Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain has caused passionate debate among the faithful. A convert from Protestantism, once close to the Action Française despite not being a monarchist, mostly out of suspicion towards representative democracy and opposition to the anticlerical policies of the Third Republic, Maritain has drifted after the shock of the Exile towards more moderate positions, closer to the personalist movement and Christian democracy.\n\nRejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the Common Good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced 'Integral Humanism' as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to 'democratism'.\n\nHowever, among more progressive Catholics Maritain's work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the Pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."
 nfa.406.a: "A new kind of integralism?"

 nfa.407.t: "The Call of Silence"
 nfa.407.d: "The Grand Prix du cinéma français has been awarded to 'The Call of Silence', a drama by Léon Poirier. The movie, retelling the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld, had found critical acclaim and great commercial success: Foucauld has fascinated the French public for years now. Charles, viscount de Foucauld would have seemed for much of his early life an unlikely candidate for the devotion now surrounding him. Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuareg with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church's hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn't waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld's frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."
 nfa.407.a: "'Father, I surrender to you': a saint for sure!"

 nfa.408.t: "Sette Giugno Commemorations"
 nfa.408.d: "On June 7 1919, riots broke out in Valletta, capital of the British Crown Colony of Malta. Tensions with the British authorities brewed for some time and the heavy burden of the Great War on the fortress island, as well as rising food prices, proved too much for thousands who ransacked locations associated with the British: when they attempted to force entry into a government building, soldiers opened fire. The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."
 nfa.408.a: "The island-fortress will hold out against any threat!"

 nfa.409.t: "News from Corsica"
 nfa.409.d: "This morning, a war memorial containing soil from the mainland was inaugurated on a beach near Ajaccio. It was dedicated to the tens of thousands of Corsicans who gave their lives for France during the Great War and subsequent civil war. Since the Revolution, the island has been an incredibly important bastion for us: indeed, it is so close from the Commune that its shores can be seen on a clear day, while Italy is less than 40 kilometres away. It has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the Mainland, with tense face-offs occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of Exiles landed: though most moved on, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms.\n\nThough there is no longer a stream of refugees, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero's welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul 'the Emperor' Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the Métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."
 nfa.409.a: "A lovely island!"

 nfa.410.t: "Louis Blériot Dies"
 nfa.410.d: "Louis Blériot, born in 1872, engineer, inventor and pioneer of French aviation has died of cardiac arrest in his Algiers villa, only 64 years old. Fascinated with the idea of flying and inspired by the prototypes of French engineer Clément Ader and the successes of the Wright brothers, Blériot put the profits of his automobile parts business towards the creation of flying machines. First encountering so many failures that the press derisively nicknamed him the 'King of Crashing', he eventually achieved worldwide fame and recognition for being the first to cross the Channel in an aeroplane in 1909, in only 37 minutes. A living legend of aviation, even being attributed the first pilot's licence, he created a successful firm building his ever-improving designs. With the Great War, he specialised in light reconnaissance planes, his company producing eventually more than ten thousand planes for the Army. At the outbreak of the Revolution, Blériot fled to Algeria like so many others and successfully re-implemented his business, Blériot Aéronautique, the government encouraging research and development in any field with any potential to help the national effort\n\nFollowing his death, the government has put out a statement honouring his contribution to the field of aviation and the war effort, as well as his resilience facing his early setback, calling him an example to all Frenchmen in these difficult times. The creation of a Louis Blériot medal, to be awarded to record setters in speed, altitude or distance in light aircraft, was also announced."
 nfa.410.a: "Long live the 'roi de la casse'!"

 nfa.411.t: "Murder Rocks the Casbah"
 nfa.411.d: "As he was on his way to the Sidi Ramadane mosque, the great mufti of Algiers, Mahmoud Bendali, was surrounded by two men and stabbed in the heart, dying on the spot. The two perpetrators were caught after a quick investigation and confessed to the murder, justifying their actions by saying the mufti had acted against the Islamic faith and was little more than a puppet of the infidels. Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb El-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the State under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many believe this is a conspiracy, and that El-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against El-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."
 nfa.411.a: "Free him, clearly the murderer was just trying to shift the blame!"
 nfa.411.b: "We can't let him roam free."

 nfa.412.t: "A Legionnaire"
 nfa.412.d: "The latest movie starring comedic superstar Fernandel, 'A Legionnaire', has been, like almost everything the actor touches, a success. A master of physical comedy and slapstick, adding to it a talent for singing, his movies generally featuring a few humorous songs that then prove to be successes in their own right, he has often been compared to Charlie Chaplin. This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion.\n\nIncapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour. The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."
 nfa.412.a: "Fernandel did it again!"

 nfa.413.t: "Journal d'un Curé de Campagne"
 nfa.413.d: "Today, the Grand Prize of the Académie Française, one of the most prestigious literary awards in France, has been awarded to Georges Bernanos for his novel, 'Diary of a Country Priest',which found great critical and commercial success. Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners. Sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering 'All is Grace'.\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticising clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this 'Diary', a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."
 nfa.413.a: "'Hell is to abandon Love.'"

 nfa.414.t: "Deuxième Bureau"
 nfa.414.d: "A new movie has taken French cinemas by storm: \"Deuxième Bureau\", directed by Pierre Billon. After numerous production delays and a harsh reception by critics, the commercial success of this thrilling tale of espionage is a surprise. Telling the story of captain Benoit, sent on a mission by the Deuxième Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true 'femme fatale', tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Reds realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover's arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."
 nfa.414.a: "Could this be the start of a series?"

 nfa.415.t: "The Archangel Disappears"
 nfa.415.d: "Jean Mermoz, nicknamed the Archangel, is a veteran pilot who turned to airmail transport after the War, becoming a pioneer in the field and accumulating countless feats of adventure, such as surviving a crash in the Sahara and captivity in the hands of rebel Tuareg, becoming the first to cross the South Atlantic from Senegal to Brazil and then the first to cross the Andes by plane. His exploits are told like epic tales in newspapers and newsreels, and he has become something of a national hero, even getting involved in politics with Colonel de La Rocque's PSF and advocating for the development of air travel.\n\nBut a few days ago, on his twenty-fifth cross-Atlantic flight the aviator disappeared. Circumstances are still unclear and the fate of Mermoz is still unknown, with headlines reading 'The Disappearance of the Archangel', and articles sounding more and more like eulogies with each new edition. The whole nation awaits with bated breath any news from the Atlantic."
 nfa.415.a: "He survived worse, right?"

 nfa.416.t: "Miracle in the South Atlantic"
 nfa.416.d: "After more than a week without news from Jean Mermoz and the crew of his Latécoère 300 Croix-du-Sud, little hope was left for their safe return home. However, today, a miracle happened: Mermoz and his exhausted, sunburned, thirsty but very much alive crew were found drifting in the ocean by a Brazilian ship.\n\nThe news, just like the pilot, quickly crossed the South Atlantic and spread like wildfire, cinemas and theatres even interrupting their programming to inform the audience. Public relief is palpable, the government has put out an official statement thanking the Brazilian authorities and a hero's welcome is already being planned for the Archangel."
 nfa.416.a: "Every failure survived gives us strength to succeed."

 nfa.417.t: "Pépé le Moko"
 nfa.417.d: "'Pépé le Moko', a drama starring rising actor Jean Gabin, has quickly found success at home and even abroad. Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organiser of the black market. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to 'slum it' among natives and emigrants in the sensual but dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé's mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it's hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become something of a youth icon, as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."
 nfa.417.a: "That Gabin is sure to go far!"

 nfa.418.t: "Orangina, Soda de Naranjina"
 nfa.418.d: "'Orangina, Naranjina soda!', with its secret recipe and distinctive bottle shape, the new refreshing orange soda developed by the Pieds-Noirs Léon Beton has quickly become a massive success in the cafés of Algiers, particularly with the youths. Some say the shrewd businessman even hired students and soldiers on leave to order the drink: if that rumour is accurate, the strategy was effective, making Orangina immediately trendy and kickstarting its popularity.\n\nAlready coffee houses all over the colonies are ordering crates after crates of the sugary drink, a boom sure to stimulate the agricultural sector, the climate of Algeria being perfectly suited to cultivate citrus fruits."
 nfa.418.a: "Délicieux !"

 nfa.419.t: "Algerian Muslim Scouts"
 nfa.419.d: "In 1935, a scouting troop for Muslim boys was created by Mohamed Bouras, supported by reformists ulemas, traditional elites, and reform-minded Frenchmen, all hoping that scouting would promote physical and moral education, character building, a sense of responsibility, as well as duty to Allah and the motherland. Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell's books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford.\n\nHowever, these groups have remained isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts. Already, prominent voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along loyalty to France, while some more conservative Pieds-Noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the motherland they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."
 nfa.419.a: "'Be prepared'! Give our blessing, this can only be a good thing."
 nfa.419.b: "More like 'be prepared' for insurrection! Ban these groups."

 nfa.420.t: "Sombre Dimanche"
 nfa.420.d: "Sombre Dimanche, 'Gloomy Sunday', is a melancholic song, telling the sinister story of a spurned lover who committed suicide, addressing from beyond the grave the man who left her. Composed by a Hungarian exile in the Commune in 1935, the song made its way across the world, first becoming a mainstay of seedy concert halls and cabarets before reaching mainstream audiences when it was first recorded in French by the popular singer Damia. In these trying times, it's hardly surprising that the peoples of Europe and beyond are prone to melancholy, however, rumours have been circulating about the song: that it is linked with an ever-increasing number of suicides, in France, the United States, and the composer's homeland, Hungary, and that merely listening to the tune could push even the cheeriest individual towards suicidal ideation. Whether this is a fact, a mere urban rumour, or a clever marketing campaign, the song has already been banned from airing on the radio or even being sung publicly in more than a few countries, which only adds to the credibility of rumours about the now-infamous 'Hungarian suicide song'.\n\nHere too, a debate has raged on the question of a potential ban, an almost welcome break from the usual political fracas. But it is time for the government to act. What should be done?"
 nfa.420.a: "Ban the song! Clearly there is a hidden message in there somewhere."
 nfa.420.b: "Why are we even wasting time on this? Dismiss the rumours."

 nfa.421.t: "Companions of Joan of Arc"
 nfa.421.d: "The Companions of Joan of Arc is an association honouring the memory of the patron saint of France, canonised in 1920 during the Revolution. Founded in 1930 by Maxime Real del Sarte, an artist close to the Action Française, after the man organised for a relic of the saint to be smuggled out of the Commune, the association describes itself as apolitical, simply stating that it seeks to 'bring together all those of goodwill around she who saved France in her hour of need and who so perfectly embodies our aspirations for the freedom of our nation'. And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the 'Pucelle' being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda. Both the Action Française and the Parti Social Français have repeatedly been caught distributing leaflets, supporters of the two parties sometimes even coming to blows. However, these minor incidents have not hampered the general enthusiasm for the celebrations, and the Companions expect even more attendance next year."
 nfa.421.a: "Saint Jeanne of France, hear our prayers and come save France once again!"

 nfa.422.t: "Aux Martyrs Espagnols"
 nfa.422.d: "'To the Spanish Martyrs' is a poem by dramatist and diplomat Paul Claudel, a deeply conservative, devout Catholic, long-time critic of the anticlerical Third Republic, who became a sort of official poet of the Pétain regime, his religious plays earning him unending praise and even a Nobel prize nomination. However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of Red terror, profanations, and acts of violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the Exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil.\n\nCommittees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, 'Aux Martyrs Espagnols' calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs. It has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."
 nfa.422.a: "Clearly a cause dear to him."

 nfa.423.t: "North Africa Cup"
 nfa.423.d: "Football was introduced in North Africa by the French: amateur clubs made up of colonists and garrisoned soldiers formed as early as the 1890s, with the Oran Athletic Club claiming to be the oldest football club in not just Algeria, but all of Africa. Slowly, Indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become a popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club's goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."
 nfa.423.a: "Congratulations to the winners!"

 nfa.424.t: "La Grande Illusion"
 nfa.424.d: "'The Grand Illusion', a war film, is quickly becoming the most successful and controversial movie of the last few years. Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one working-class, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew, and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the War is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the War ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."
 nfa.424.a: "How did that manage to go past censors?"

 nfa.425.t: "Fête du Souverain"
 nfa.425.d: "Since 1861, the principality of Monaco has had close relations with France: nominally independent, the tiny state heavily relied on France, and most of its flourishing economy depended on French money, invested or lost in Monte Carlo's casinos, the two neighbours eventually agreeing to sign a treaty of 'protective friendship'. Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat's hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of 'Soldier-Prince' and a promotion to the rank of General. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco's national day falling on the Prince's patron saint's feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France's political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince's palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."
 nfa.425.a: "Next year in Monaco!"

 nfa.426.t: "Pierre de Coubertin Dies"
 nfa.426.d: "Pierre de Coubertin, born in 1863, historian, educator, journalist, founder of the International Olympic Committee, has died at 74 years old. Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down a military career opportunity. Instead, he dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting physical activity integration into education. However, de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and making them an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Pan-Hellenic games. The first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics could not prevent the madness of the Great War. Following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Pierre de Coubertin was heartbroken by the death at the front of two of his nephews and the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics that neither of the Frances attended. He was forced to watch as his dream crumbled before his eyes. As the socialist powers grew in prominence, the Socialist Worker's Sport International began to draw away the dignity that he built the Olympics to be. Intended to be a contest of the nations' finest athletes, the socialists soured the games by basing them along mass participation rather than athletic heroism. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."
 nfa.426.a: "'The important thing in life is not triumph but struggle', right?"

 nfa.427.t: "Vendanges"
 nfa.427.d: "October has traditionally been the time of the vintage, grape harvest for winemaking, and the occasion for popular festivities, wine, of course, being incredibly important to French culture. Viticulture in a region that is populated in the vast majority by alcohol-abstinent Muslims might seem peculiar, but Algeria is well suited for growing grapes, with its warm, sunny climate. Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony.\n\nSince the Exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the Métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of Exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the Mainland."
 nfa.427.a: "Beggars can't be choosers. Santé !"

 nfa.428.t: "Le Prolétariat"
 nfa.428.d: "Henri, Count of Paris, has published 'The Proletariat', a short historical and political essay on the working class. In this essay, the heir traces back the origins of the poor working and living conditions of the proletariat to the Revolution of 1789, a 'bourgeois coup' that he claims turned the proud artisans and farmers of old into proletarians by destroying traditional structures such as guilds and enabling economic liberalism. He chronicles the slow descent of the working classes into indignity over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri's denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie. Curiously it has even received praise, sometimes genuine but mostly amused, from the Commune."
 nfa.428.a: "Maybe he should be nicknamed the Red Count?"

 nfa.429.t: "Museum of Man"
 nfa.429.d: "Today opened in Algiers the Museum of Man, a museum reuniting collections related to Man's evolution, Man's biological unity and variety, and Man's cultural and social diversity, showcasing various objects such as prehistoric artefacts, numerous examples of both French and indigenous crafts and artistry, and photographs documenting the way of life of the various peoples living in the French empire. Much of its collections are recent acquisitions: indeed, the government-funded extensive ethnographic expeditions in our present and former colonial possessions in an effort to consolidate our hold on outlying territories. The 1931 Dakar-Djibouti Mission alone, for example, made up of linguists, ethnographers, naturalists, painters, photographers and even a musicologist, brought back more than 3000 objects, 6000 photographs, 1600 metres of photographic film, and 1500 pages of notes documenting invaluable information on a rapidly disappearing way of life.\n\nThough there has been criticism over the manner of acquisition of its collections, some radical newspapers even going as far as making accusations of racket, the opening ceremony of the museum was a success, attended by the mayor of Algiers, the minister of the colonies and thousands of curious Algérois, Pieds-Noirs and Indigènes alike."
 nfa.429.a: "It's not stealing if it's for science, right?"

 nfa.430.t: "J'accuse!"
 nfa.430.d: "Directed by the controversial Abel Gance, a pioneer of film-making well known for his historical dramas, as well as his ingenious editing and special effects technique. 20 years in the making, 'I accuse' is a peculiar war story taking French cinemas by storm, telling the story of love rivals turned friends on the battlefields of the Great War, before the futile death of one, and the slow descent into shell-shocked insanity of the other. But it is the ending that has most divided the opinion, as the crazed man who had vowed to end all wars, temporarily relapses into sanity to find that the world is getting ready for a new great conflict. He springs into action, and in a supernatural storm calls on the millions of dead of the Great War, regardless of their nationality, to rise from their grave and punish the living for their foolish obsession with mutual destruction. All over Europe, the dead of all countries hear his call, unite and march on, creating mass panic and preventing another war.\n\nAccused of pacifism, of sullying the memory of our war heroes by some, praised for his skill by others, Gance escaped censorship due to his links with veterans associations: indeed, many veterans were employed during the filming of the movie, and in particular many 'gueules-cassées', broken faces, for the great finale. The dead might not rise and march on to prevent a Second Great War, but those disfigured by the last war want to have their voices heard as war frenzy in our nation rages on."
 nfa.430.a: "They're coming to get you, Wilhelm, there's millions of them now!"

 nfa.431.t: "The Algerian Bomber"
 nfa.431.d: "Marcel Cerdan, nicknamed the Algerian Bomber, has claimed the French welterweight boxing title after a 12-rounds battle of pure will against his opponent, in front of thousands who came to see this new sensation in French boxing. 22 years old, he has not known defeat since he started boxing professionally and is now on a 40 wins streak, something few have achieved, especially considering Cerdan has admitted in interviews that he hates hurting others and much prefers football over boxing. Tenacious, quick, and with incredible precision, some see in him immense potential, despite his one real weakness: fragile hands, earning him his other nickname, 'The Man with Clay Hands'.\n\nBorn in a poor Pieds-Noirs family of Spanish origins, speaking French, Arabic, and Spanish, having left school at 11, drifting from job to job until his father realised his true worth as a boxer, Marcel's success story has turned him into a popular icon. No matter the community, Arabs, immigrants, Pieds-Noirs, Exiles, the public sees him as a true self-made man, coming from nothing and yet climbing ever higher through sheer effort and strength of character. His national title earned, he is now looking into joining the European fray: the whole nation will follow with great interest his career from now on, cheering him on, perhaps even all the way to a world champion title."
 nfa.431.a: "Allez Marcel, on y va !"

 nfa.432.t: "Notre-Dame de l'Atlas"
 nfa.432.d: "A new abbey has been founded in the heights of the Atlas Mountain. Located in the outskirts of the village of Tibhirine, meaning 'gardens' in Berber, Our Lady of the Atlas was founded by French Trappist monks hoping to teach modern agricultural techniques to the Indigènes: they have already gone to work planting vines and vegetables, implementing beehives, as well as organising more efficiently the harvest of the thousands of fruit trees on their sizeable property. Though still small, the community hopes to attract more members seeking a life of work, prayer, and service to the natives, with whom relations have so far been peaceful.\n\nFar from being the only monastic community in a similar situation, Catholic media and hierarchy have nonetheless praised this latest example of religious coexistence, while others see the abbey as a shining example of the civilising mission of France in her colonies. However, some have expressed worry: the community is far from the centres of colonial life and most importantly their garrisons. But the monks have assured that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours and that they are in any case under the protection of the Virgin Mary, to whom they have erected a great statue overlooking the valley."
 nfa.432.a: "Christians, Muslims, we are all the sons and daughters of the most High."

 nfa.433.t: "La Môme Piaf"
 nfa.433.d: "Édith Gassion, better known as 'La Môme Piaf' (meaning 'The Little Sparrow' in Parisian slang), has recently become a sensation in France, on both sides of the Mediterranean. Born during the Great War to a failed singer and a street acrobat, raised in a brothel for most of her childhood in the torment of revolution, she was nonetheless blessed with an incredible voice, her harsh life has given her a haunting depth and sensibility. Having started her career as a street singer, she quickly started performing in cabarets and workers' clubs, singing about working-class life and struggles. Soon, she was on the radio, and inevitably her songs would cross the sea and the embargo. Her records are played in the packed clubs of Algiers, as Frenchmen let the nostalgia of their homeland be soothed by Piaf's striking Parisian accent and tales of the atmosphere of the shady parts of the City of Lights.\n\nSome find her songs scandalous, while others insist these songs are coated in syndicalist propaganda, but the government is doing nothing to stop the spread of her records and it is rumoured that she has admirers in high places. Amusingly, she has proved equally controversial in the Commune: there, she has been accused of encouraging bourgeois degeneracy and singing counter-revolutionary propaganda about the living conditions of the proletariat, though thankfully these complaints fall on equally deaf ears."
 nfa.433.a: "Maybe we'll hear her perform live some day!"

 nfa.434.t: "Doguicimi"
 nfa.434.d: "The Académie Française has awarded the French Language Prize to Paul Hazoumé for his historical novel 'Doguicimi', following court intrigues in Abomey, capital of the Dahomey kingdom. By the author's admission, however, the plot of the book is largely there to serve its historical and ethnographic qualities. Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation 'to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser', proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from 'civilised' people and that they too have a history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself from Dahomey. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing pro-French sentiments but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some Évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."
 nfa.434.a: "In any case, a fascinating book!"

 nfa.435.t: "Alert in the Mediterranean"
 nfa.435.d: "The Grand Prix of French cinema has been awarded to 'Alert in the Mediterranean', a thriller following the crews of three ships mooring off Tangiers, and in particular commanding officers of the British Navy, the German Kaiserliche Marine, and the French Marine Nationale. Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism. Against such critics, the director argued that the core message of the picture is one of Christian fraternity, bravery and camaraderie in the face of adversity, despite eternally rising international tensions."
 nfa.435.a: "A touching story!"

 nfa.436.t: "Ça Fait d'Excellents Français"
 nfa.436.d: "With tensions escalating even further, it's hardly surprising that popular culture in our country would reflect that fact: indeed the latest song to top the charts in France is called \"They make excellent Frenchmen\", performed by Maurice Chevalier, star of musical comedy and kingpin of French show business. The song lists all the characteristics of a group of soldiers and officers: all coming from different walks of life, all in different occupations, many middle-aged and with families of their own, of differing faiths, races, and political opinions, all with their own little ailments, and yet, as the chorus states, \"all of them make excellent Frenchmen, excellent soldiers.\"\n\nCatchy and comedic, it's the song's underlying call for unity as our nation is faced with its greatest struggle yet and its exaltation of the French infantryman, always ready to leave everything behind and forget himself in the fight to defend his motherland that has made its immense success. In a nation where everything is mobilised for the coming war effort like ours, each and every one of us can identify with this sentiment: we will fight, and we will win because we must retake our home!"
 nfa.436.a: "They march in step, no longer used to it, but it's like riding a bike, you never forget!"

 nfa.437.t: "Radio-Alger"
 nfa.437.d: "Though tuning into our radio broadcasts is nothing new for our countrymen still under the red yoke, Corsica is after all only a few miles from the mainland, a news station broadcasting from Algiers has been specially created to give true news to the Métropole and to transmit coded messages to our supporters within the Commune, such as instructions and information disguised as private messages from people separated from their loved ones by the current circumstances. This measure was necessary to coordinate the various actions taken by opponents to the syndicalist regime such as the distribution of tracts, preparations to hamper the war effort, recruitment, bribery, or discrete weapon training as tensions ramp up a bit more each day. Though the resistance is still far from being able to rise as one against the Reds, establishing this radio station will go a long way towards making sure the efforts of our brothers will not be in vain: once we land on our shores, they will be ready to do all they can to free France."
 nfa.437.a: "Les Français parlent aux Français!"

 nfa.438.t: "Eid al-Adha"
 nfa.438.d: "Today Muslims all over the world celebrate Eid al-Adha, the Feast of the Sacrifice, commemorating the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God's command. Before the killing blow fell, however, God sent archangel Jibril to substitute the son with a lamb to sacrifice instead. In remembrance of this intervention, each family ritually slaughters an animal and shares it in three: one third going to the poor, one third to relatives, and one third is kept and eaten. The faithful then go to their local mosque, and at the conclusion of the Eid prayers and sermons, they exchange greetings, gifts, and visit one another.\n\nConsidered the holiest holiday of the Muslim faith, it is always accompanied by large festivities and is sometimes even the occasion to lower confessional barriers, as some Muslims invite their non-Muslim neighbours and friends to partake in this uniquely Islamic celebration."
 nfa.438.a: "Eid Mubarak!"

 nfa.439.t: "Eid al-Fitr"
 nfa.439.d: "Today marks the end of Ramadan, a holy month during which Muslims are not permitted to eat or drink from sunrise to sundown. All over the Islamic world, for one to three days, the faithful celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the Feast of the Breaking of the Fast, with special prayers, rituals, and acts of charity, celebrations during the day, family visits, exchange of special treats and gifts, with many decorating their houses for the occasion and all organising sumptuous meals for family and friends in the evening.\n\nConsidered the second holiest holiday of the Muslim faith after Eid al-Adha, it is an important day for much of the indigenous population. The firing of a cannon salute to announce the end of the fast has become customary in most large cities, colonial authorities take care to accommodate the festivities, and for much of our European population, it is the occasion to learn more about the Islamic faith and its rituals."
 nfa.439.a: "Eid Mubarak!"

 nfa.440.t: "Dispute from Sanekui"
 nfa.440.d: "Word has reached us regarding a conflict between two churches in the province of French Sudan. Recently, a Protestant missionary couple set out for the village of Sanekui after hearing about a small community of young converts who had come under attack by their pagan neighbours. Since their arrival, much work has been undertaken to convert more Indigènes. However, this has attracted the attention of a nearby Catholic mission just a few miles away from where the missionaries have already begun building their church. Local authorities had already approved of the construction much to the anguish of the long-established Catholic missionaries seeing their Protestant neighbours leading growing numbers away from the Church. They reached out to colonial authorities, requesting that we overturn the local ruling and force the missionaries to move elsewhere, arguing that this couple seeks to sow dissent in the region."
 nfa.440.a: "Let the Protestants operate."
 nfa.440.b: "Side with the Church."

 nfa.441.t: "From Persecution to Prospering"
 nfa.441.d: "The road was never one free of suffering for the young church at Sanekui. First attacked by their pagan neighbours, Panca and his new converts struggled in their faith until their prayers were answered with the deliverance of a missionary couple. Next, the young church would be pressured by a nearby Catholic mission but the Protestant mission was allowed to stay and preach the word. The Apostle Paul's message from his epistle to the Romans that \"I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us,\" became a central message of the new church. These challenges pushed many to delve deep into the scriptures and diligently reinforce their faith.\n\nRecently, a large effort has been undertaken by the local population to reach across language barriers to their fellow Bobo people. Red Bobo Christians have reached out to Black Bobos living in their district to bring the gospel to them. Villages with a Christian presence have risen dramatically across the last few years and plans are beginning to form to found another mission closer to the Black Bobo people."
 nfa.441.a: "We are to be the light for the nations!"

 nfa.442.t: "The Chapel of Banfora"
 nfa.442.d: "While some missionaries were originally sent to the region a year ago, they were recalled and sent to a different site soon after arriving in the village. In their place, a local carpenter from Bobo-Dioulasso has taken the work into his own hands. He has recently completed the construction of a chapel in which to preach the word to the waiting world around him. The harvest is plentiful in Banfora with a nearby population reaching nearly 150,000 people including many pagan tribes. May his work serve as an example to others across the continent!"
 nfa.442.a: "The carpenter calls his people to Him."

 nfa.472.t: "The Lurking Mystics"
 nfa.472.d: "One of the more controversial aspects of the Action Française is the continued relationship of some its members with Occultism. For many reactionary Catholics this relationship is evidence enough that they are not truly committed to the Counter-Revolutionary cause. In Algeria this relationship has deepened even further. Under the influence of characters like René Guénon, and his newspaper La Gnose, and the desire to fight an esoteric spiritual war against the Syndicalist some have flocked to the Masonic Orders, despite the deeply anti-Masonic rhetoric of the new integralist monarchy. Furthermore, with Guénon's conversion to Sufism many of these Masons and other types are increasingly interested in the native Sufi Tariqas or Orders. With the AF now in power, this relationship is increasingly troubling, with some proclaiming it the return of Gnosticism and Quietism, both of which are excommunicated heresies. The Tariqas themselves are also worrying because of their rumoured links to Algerian independentist groups.\n\nIt's become clear that some sort of repression is in order, what should be done?"
 nfa.472.a: "Tolerate them. They aren't doing any real harm as long as they oppose socialism"
 nfa.472.b: "Destroy the Masons but leave the Tariqas alone, let's not push the indigènes."
 nfa.472.c: "Crackdown on both. The Eldest Daughter does not tolerate occultism."

 nfa.473.t: "La Métaphysique Orientale"
 nfa.473.d: "After the defeat of Napoléon III in the Franco-Prussian War there was an explosion in esoteric societies in France. This occultist milieu produced various currents claiming ancient lineages and hidden knowledge, supposedly handed down by cabals of Masons, Magicians and Alchemists. From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental religions. However, following the Defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-materialist tracts and published 'The Crisis of the Modern World' in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, 'Oriental Metaphysics' is a detailed exploration of Oriental metaphysical systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the liberal world-view of their recent past in favour of a traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-Thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences. Calls for a ban of the book have arisen from clergy and conservative Catholics, while others argue that it could be helpful in evangelisation, or control, of the natives."

 nfa.482.a: "And don't come back!"

 nfa.500.t: "A Traitor?"
 nfa.500.d: "'En Terre d'Islam', a monthly academic magazine dedicated to Islamic studies, has enjoyed a well-deserved success even among relatively mainstream audience, at least for this kind of publication. Our current exile has led many, particularly academics and clergymen, to seek a better understanding of the faith of so many of our countrymen. Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the Indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in 'En Terre d'Islam' is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a 'Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims' to 'pray for our estranged brothers' was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Moroccan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to \"study the enemy\". A year later he would convert, two years and he joined the Franciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and was overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."
 nfa.500.a: "Not a good day for dialogue."

 nfa.501.t: "Le Feu"
 nfa.501.d: "These past few weeks, something strange has been happening in Algiers. A man calling himself 'François-Henry Prométhée' has been organising politico-mystical gatherings, attracting a growing number of curious onlookers, with some even turning into believers in the strange creed of this fiery Prometheus. The man declares he is 'the Master' of a political movement called 'Le Feu', the Fire, the 'New Man' who has 'come to restore Hope in the hearts of all Frenchmen'. From a stage adorned in banners featuring the party-cult's symbols, the phoenix, a wheel and thunder, he leads the ever growing crowds in repetitive chants, such as:\n\n'Through our Fire, She will be reborn\n\nHer Faith will be perpetual\n\nHer Genius will shine\n\nFrance will be Eternal'.\n\nSince the man's political platform seemingly does not go into more depth than these charismatic if deranged rants, nothing was done at first by the authorities. As the crowds grew however, a cursory investigation was initiated by our intelligence services. Shockingly, they found that this 'François-Henry Prométhée' has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind. More worrying however, is the important funding the man receives from unknown sources: some within the Bureau suspect Communard influence."

 nfa.502.t: "The Tour d'Algérie"
 nfa.502.d: "The Tour de France was one of the most popular sporting events before the exile, drawing enormous crowds along its path, all over France. Though cycle sports have not dropped in popularity after the Great War, the current situation makes organising a Tour de France difficult. Worse, despite the ban on such activities, many of our compatriots tune into Communard radio every day during the month of July to follow the progress of the race, with cafés turning into listening parties and law enforcement being awfully lenient, often even discreetly listening to the results themselves. Something had to be done to prevent red propaganda from being directly broadcasted to our people in that way, and this year was finally created a Tour d'Algérie. Going through most major towns of the Algerian littoral, such as Orléansville, Oran, Bone, starting and ending in Algiers, with even a detour through Tunisia, the race was a massive popular success, giving bicycle racing fans the euphoria of a national sporting competition they had sought for close to two decades by now. And with a win by French cyclist Roger Lapébie boosting national pride, we have every reason to make this competition a yearly event, despite the whispers of killjoys that we might be 'settling in exile'."

 nfa.504.t: "A New Recruit in the Foreign Legion"
 nfa.504.d: "Today, a distinguished young man walked in a Légion étrangère recruitment office, not far from the Morrocan border. A strange sight for the officer in charge of processing his application, more used to foreign men of dubious pasts, willing to serve and die for France for a chance at a new life. He gave Henri Robert Orliac as his name, and the officer did not care if that was the truth. Like so many others in these bellicose days, Orliac was then integrated into the troop, once in a simple recruit uniform only somewhat standing out from his peers.\n\nTruth is, Henri was not an ordinary recruit: his real name is Henri d'Orléans, royal prince of the House of France. In the Great War, his father too had attempted to join the Foreign Legion but was denied it due to the Law of Exile barring representatives of the former reigning houses from setting foot in France. But young Henri, eager to serve France in this great crusade against socialism, could not be deterred from doing his duty. One day, perhaps the prince will be called to rule over the nation, but for now he will serve the nation in other ways."
 nfa.504.a: "Shh, it's a secret after all!"

 nfa.505.t: "The Men in Green"
 nfa.505.d: "The Reds have announced a programme to transform culture and entertainment, a so-called 'International Avant-Garde' of radical 'artists' aiming to tear down all that is beautiful in this world and transform it to fit the tastes of madmen, all in the name of making art more palatable to the proletariat. Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois.\n\nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of an international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere.\n\nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris. As the inauguration ceremony was underway, it was set ablaze by known lunatic Georges Bataille, a move that was applauded as an example of 'pure artistic spontaneity' by the organisation."
 nfa.505.a: "Yet another reason to put down the Commune!"

 nfa.506.t: "Fête de la Fédération"
 nfa.506.d: "On this 14th of July, we celebrate our National Day. Military parades as well as popular street celebrations and fireworks are planned all across France, in a joyous celebration of the greatness of our nation.\n\nFor long, what is even celebrated on this day has been a topic of heated debate between left and right. The left would insist that this is a day celebrating the 1789 storming of the Bastille fortress, a Parisian royal prison and armoury, widely considered as the starting point of the French Revolution, while the right would on the contrary consider that this is a day commemorating the Fête de la Fédération, a massive holiday festival that took place across France a year later to celebrate the unity of the French nation, and an end of the political struggle, of the Revolution itself. History proved that hope wrong, but this hasn't stopped this debate from arising every year. The 1880 law instituting the National Day on the 14th of July simply abstains from taking a side, but thankfully we have since put the controversy to rest, as an amendment voted by the Assembly some years ago has clarified that we are indeed commemorating the Festival of the Federation today."
 nfa.506.a: "Either way, let's enjoy ourselves!"

 nfa.507.t: "The Ulema"
 nfa.507.d: "The 'Association des oulémas musulmans algériens' or Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema is a religious association founded in 1933. Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of the stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, sceptical of both the sincerity of the AF's promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Reds."
 nfa.507.a: "Either way, they're probably trouble."

 nfa.508.t: "Right to Criticism"
 nfa.508.d: "Though the Bear has emphasised the need for a strong, united nation in the face of the arduous task at hand, he has been met with some resistance, particularly from disappointed former allies who had hoped that with the fall of Pétain democracy would be immediately restored, believing that mere promises of elections and a new constitution are not enough. Some dare to whisper that the Comité is merely a front for a renewed dictatorship under Mordacq, and already some intellectuals and politicians openly criticise the General. However, one thing that was restored immediately after the fall of Pétain is freedom of expression: these men have the right to speak their mind, no matter how wrong they are, and how potentially destabilising this kind of talk is.\n\nWe could simply let it go and hope the debate runs its course, or we could take a more proactive approach. One possibility would be using legal means to silence these critics, by accusing them of defamation: juries would no doubt rule in our favour and force these men to publicly recant."
 nfa.508.a: "Just let them talk, we'll prove to them in time that they were foolish to ever worry."
 nfa.508.b: "If they're not with us, they're against us. Silence them!"

 nfa.509.t: "Paroles, Paroles"
 nfa.509.d: "Though the mobilisation of the nation has been chugging along and finally a brighter future for France is being prepared by the Comité, some still remain doubtful. Prominent voices among veterans of the democratic cause have now joined the usual naysayers: though they support Henri Mordacq, they seem to find cause for 'concern' and 'worry' in seemingly every little action taken by the government, and the media relishes in reporting on every front page these doubts expressed by friends and allies of the Bear. Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression. The government has so far ignored the situation, but letting this criticism go unanswered much longer could durably undermine the new regime and jeopardise our efforts to save the nation. Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation. However, we could also take a softer approach: by setting up regular press conferences broadcast to our people, the president of the Comité could directly address criticism and clear any doubt anyone might have about his allegiance to the Republic, to democracy."
 nfa.509.a: "Let's talk it out, show them that the Comité is the best hope democracy has"
 nfa.509.b: "Never mind, now I understand why Pétain kept them on a tight leash."

 nfa.510.t: "Article 26"
 nfa.510.d: "In an effort to stop unjust criticism by prominent journalists, intellectuals and politicians, the government attempted to directly contact the worst offenders and ask them to reconsider, and if they still had criticism, to voice it privately. Sadly, most of those concerned dismissed this invite, and as such it became necessary to use legal means to stop their seditious activities. Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial.\n\nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavour of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime. Most were acquitted, other received at most small fines. It seems that in the future the Bear will have to contend with the liberties he supposedly fought to restore."
 nfa.510.a: "How embarrassing."

 nfa.511.t: "A Chat with the Bear"
 nfa.511.d: "The past weeks had proved difficult for the comité, as criticism grew from all sides. Some wanted censorship, Mordacq refused, and instead cooler heads prevailed: a press conference, broadcast to our people live, would be organised to dispel these accusations. When the Bear entered the room, in full uniform, his numerous medals, awarded for his long years of service to France, glistening in the spotlight, the room fell silent, as the men who had spoken so much against him were too intimidated by the now almost legendary general to open their mouths. It took a particularly brave foreign journalist to ask the one question on everyone's mind: 'General, will you uphold the fundamental liberties of Frenchmen?'\n\nAnd finally, Mordacq spoke. 'It is true that we live in extraordinary times, and as such extraordinary measures are necessary. This is no longer the time for discussion but the time of action, and action, true action, action that produces results, requires a single will. We must unite if we want to win, and we must win for the salvation of France. However, and this has always been my promise to our people, these measures are indeed extraordinary and will not be maintained for more than they are necessary. Democracy has always been the hope of not only France, but all of Europe, I simply ask my fellow Frenchmen to trust the Comité and myself to lead them to victory. It will not be easy, but internal dissensions would make it impossible: fundamental liberties have been restored, and I ask you to use them wisely, for the sake of our patrie.'"
 nfa.511.a: "He's right, it's time to put our differences aside!"

 nfa.512.t: "The Coronation"
 nfa.512.d: "More than a hundred and ten years since there was last a royal coronation, France finally has a king once again. The ceremony was carefully organised to follow as closely as possible the millennium old protocol, despite taking place in the Saint-Philippe cathedral of Algiers instead of the traditional coronation in Reims, which current circumstances would make difficult to organise. Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d'Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the sceptre and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."
 nfa.512.a: "The Republic is truly dead, long live the Kingdom!"

 nfa.513.t: "Women's Suffrage"
 nfa.513.d: "The issue of women's suffrage has been a contentious one in French politics for a long while. At the revolution, women were considered 'passive citizens', a category shared with children and domestics: in other words citizens who were inherently under the influence of another and as such could not be trusted with the right to vote. In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. They were again excluded in 1870 when the Third Republic was declared. Though there were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women's suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women's suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband's will, or worse, the Church's.\n\nCharles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."
 nfa.513.a: "Pour toutes !"

 nfa.514.t: "Down With Marianne!"
 nfa.514.d: "Marianne was a perfect symbol for the Republic. Vulgar, denuded, looking like little more than a prostitute or a beggar, she embodied the mediocrity of the republican regime. Chosen under the short-lived Second Republic, her representation became systematic under the Third, appearing in public buildings, statues, stamps, all things related to the state. But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d'Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armoured: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."
 nfa.514.a: "Soon enough the Republic will only be a bad memory."

 nfa.515.t: "A New National Day"
 nfa.515.d: "Since 1880, the National Day has been set on the 14th of July: the left would generally consider that day as commemorating the 1789 storming of the Bastille, while the right would choose to commemorate the Feast of the Federation, a celebration that took place one year later and that at the time was considered by many as the end of political instability, an end to the revolution, and a celebration of national unity. The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regina Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place. Which day will the king choose as a national holiday?"
 nfa.515.a: "Like under the pious king Saint Louis, the Monarchy will lead France to glory"
 nfa.515.b: "Let us ask for Our Lady's protection, Maria Regina Galliae, ora pro nobis!"
 nfa.515.c: "Like the Pucelle, we must hear God's call to save France!"

 nfa.516.t: "Expiation"
 nfa.516.d: "The Fourteenth of July 1939 marks the 150th anniversary of the Fall of the Bastille, traditionally considered the start of the French Revolution, which would eventually take the Kingdom of France from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, then shortly after the proclamation of the French Republic. The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\n\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

 nfa.517.d.angrypope: "With the long struggle against the Republic finally over, the Dauphin Henri d'Orléans has embarked on a great diplomatic voyage to introduce the new regime to our allies and neighbours. However, the first stop of this trip will be in Rome, where the Prince arrived by plane early today. France has long been the Eldest Daughter of the Church, though she certainly had been a rebellious daughter in the last century or so: from one revolution to the next the Church has often been the target of godless revolutionaries and unscrupulous liberals. No official relations between the Holy See and France exist since 1904 and the start of the debate over the separation of Church and State, and though relations between the Republic and the papacy had been warmer during the Great War, the subsequent revolution destroyed hopes of détente. The anticlerical terror that followed leading many to believe that Eldest Daughter was now matricide.\nBut no more! Like the Prodigal Son, France has finally returned to her mother the Church, and the Prince was warmly received by the Romans and His Holiness. A long private meeting was held between the two, where it seems His Holiness shared his joy at the return of France among the nations closest to the Church, and his hope that the new regime will remain true to its holy mission, calling for a peaceful transition towards monarchy. It was rumoured that the pope had concerns regarding the rather utilitarian nature of the Faith in the eyes of Maurras, but these concerns have apparently been soothed: whether by assurance by the Prince of Maurras' good faith or by a promise to control these unsavoury elements, we will never know.\nThe meeting concluded, Prince Henri announced that a new Concordat would be soon signed between the Church and the Kingdom, before solemnly swearing that France would from now on always defend the Faith."

 nfa.518.t: "The Return of the Prince"
 nfa.518.d: "Decades ago the House of Grimaldi went into exile as invading Communard militias closed in on the tiny principality of Monaco, symbol in their eyes of ultimate bourgeois degeneracy. Since then the \"Prince-Soldier\" Louis II has never lost his hope to restore the independence of Monaco and tirelessly lobbied the French government to include the restoration of the principality in any future war aims. To prove the princely commitment to their long-time allies and protectors, the heir to the principality Rainier even followed in the footsteps of his father and joined the French Army in the later stages of the war, serving with distinction.\n\nWith Monaco freed from the grasps of the Reds, their loyalty has of course been rewarded and Louis II has officially proclaimed the restoration of the independence of the Principality from the balcony of the Prince's Palace in front of cheering Monégasques. Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

 nfa.519.t: "Death of a Scholar"
 nfa.519.d: "Today, tens of thousands of people from all over Algeria were present at Sheikh Abdelhamid Ben Badis' funeral. Coming from a prestigious family of ulema, claiming to be descendants from the medieval Zyrid dynasty which had ruled Ifriqiya centuries ago, Ben Badis was destined to a comfortable life as an Islamic scholar, part of the native elites far from the struggles of his fellow Indigènes. Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centres of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the Indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the \"City of Bridges\". As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the Pieds-Noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of nationalist talk."

Founded earlier this year by Louis de La Bardonnie, a winemaker from Dordogne, it is now headed by our smuggled agent Gilbert Renault, now operating the pseudonym of 'Colonel Rémy'.\n\nThe network operates primarily in the West of France, recruiting mostly among the numerous Catholics disgruntled by the anticlerical practices of the syndicalist government, including a high number of women such as Jeannette Guyot.

 nfa.521.d: "For months now rumours of a highly effective network operating in the east of France have reached our intelligence service but it proved impossible to get truly a hold of. Indeed, it seems that none of the operatives even know the name of their hierarchical superior and meetings are kept to a strict minimum. But we have finally been contacted by its leader, Alsatian textile industrialist Paul Dungler, nicknamed Commandant Martial, a citizen of the Reich. With German cash, given under the pretences of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges. However, unbeknown to his German patrons, Dungler believes that Alsace is a rightful part of France and his network has been gathering an immense wealth of information from within the German intelligence framework as well as cultivating links within the armies of the Reich of disgruntled Alsatian soldiers and officers.\n\nHe has now offered us his services as a double agent, giving us access to his network to prepare the liberation of France, and we would be foolish to refuse. Though the Germans know his network as the Réseau Martial (Martial Network), to us he will become the 'Alsace Seventh Column', as the deeply Catholic Dungler believes 7 is a holy number. However his attention is obviously divided between the Commune and the Reich, which could hamper the effectiveness of his work against the Reds that he himself calls the 'anti-civilisation'."
 nfa.521.a: "Ask him to focus on the Reds, for now."
 nfa.521.b: "Information on the Boches will always be useful."

 nfa.522.t: "Collapse of German Africa"
 nfa.522.d: "In 1897, German Foreign Secretary von Bülow had argued that the colonial policy of the Empire was simply 'to throw no one into the shade, but to get our own place in the sun'. Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favourable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, colossal patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar-es-Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé [MAF.GetLeader] as head of the chimeric 'Deutsch-Mittelafrika', the over-ambitious pen-pusher only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered. We will bide our time, observing and contacting our former native allies: perhaps sooner rather than later they will come back under our influence."
 nfa.522.a: "I believe the Boches call this 'Schadenfreude'."

 nfa.523.t: "An Audience with Agoli-Agbo"
 nfa.523.d: "Surrounded by his female guards the Mino, better known to Westerners as the Amazons, clad in his finest traditional attire and wielding his 'récade', the axe-shaped royal sceptre, the elderly King of Dahomey welcomed in his palace of Abomey our envoy, who lavished him with gifts, praise, and with one demand: to re-establish the treaty of friendship and commerce that had united our two nations since 1894. The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly re-establish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their Wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources. But this is a joyous day: French diplomacy has secured us the first step towards the reconquest of our African empire."

 nfa.524.d: "Paris, capital of France since there has been a France. She has seen better days, the war and the reds have left ugly scars, but all will soon be healed. Despite the struggles, Paris will always be Paris, undeniably the most beautiful city in the world, the capital of European culture and civilisation, the city of lights: our good ol' Paname. Finally, we are here, home. It would be impossible to hide the deep and sacred emotion moving all those who had to leave her behind all those years ago and the awe of those who were exiled too young to even remember her. Red flags and other symbols of the revolution were torn down, and an immense parade on the Champs-Élysées took place to honour our armies and those of our allies: untold numbers of Parisians cheered on their liberators, some crying of joy, others simply staying stunned by this realisation of their most dearly held dream. The enemies of France still lurk, but each day high ranking revolutionaries are being brought to justice: it will take time, but first Paris and soon all of France will be cleansed from this filth.

 nfa.525.d: "While our rightful capital Paris is still out of our reach, our efforts have led us to settle for the next best thing: Marseille. One of the oldest cities of France, with a rich history dating back to Phocean Greek colonists, she is the gateway to the Mediterranean, the vital link to the empire that granted us victory. Finally, we are here, home, and France is almost whole. It would be impossible to hide the deep emotion moving all those who had to leave France behind all those years ago and the awe of those who were exiled too young to even remember her. Red flags and other symbols of the revolution were torn down, and a parade on the Vieux Port took place to honour our armies and those of our allies: large numbers of Marseillais cheered on their liberators, some crying of joy, others simply staying stunned by this realisation of their most dearly held dream. The enemies of France still lurk, but each day high ranking revolutionaries are being brought to justice: it will take time, but first Marseille and soon all of France will be cleansed from this filth.

 nfa.526.t: "The Knights-Monks of Sainte-Croix"
 nfa.526.d: "In the heights above Oran stands a citadel built centuries ago by the Spaniards, the fort of Sainte-Croix. Taken over and restored after the conquest of Algeria, the fort was until recently a secondary garrison. However the sleepy citadel has been bustling with activity for the last few months: a school was created there by the regime to educate the future elites of the nation.\n\nUnder the leadership of Lieutenant Pierre Dunoyer de Segonzac, a young and fiery officer, and René de Naurois, a military chaplain beloved by his men, the National School of Cadres of Oran has created an innovative six-months curriculum to shape hundreds of the brightest youths of the nation into leaders worthy of serving France. With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests. Interestingly the students in their retreat between sea and sky have begun to shape the 'spirit' of the School themselves: nicknaming Dunoyer de Segonzac 'Old Chief', though the man is barely thirty, they have styled themselves as a knightly order, with a motto and coat of arms, swearing an oath to France and their comrades. A development embraced by the direction of the School as the romantic image of the school brings ever more volunteers.\n\nHowever, Sainte-Croix's independence is worrying some within government while others consider the school to be slowly but surely into a personality cult around the 'Old Chief', if not a cult given the increasingly mystical Catholic devotion fostered by Padre de Naurois. What should be done?"
 nfa.526.a: "A wonderful initiative, encourage the Knight-Monks!"
 nfa.526.b: "Shut down the school, our best and brightest will not be turned into cultists"

 nfa.527.t: "The Hidden Ones"
 nfa.527.d: "Persecuted, forbidden from publicly displaying what they held most dear, relentlessly mocked: the faithful, those who quietly resisted despite the open hostility of the Reds are coming out of hiding. For years open expression of the Faith was forbidden, bishops were run out of the country, some churches were seized, homilies were monitored. In the sillage of our victorious armies some dared to join our forces' open air masses, priests who had gone into hiding reclaimed their parishes, while some still skittish, perhaps fearing a red counter-offensive, only discreetly brought flowers to the few roadside shrines which had managed to escape the purge of religious expression from public space. With the fratricide conflict coming to an end, the once silenced bells rang all over the nation, great processions were organised to purify towns and villages from the stain left by both atheistic anticlericalism and the orgy of violence, crosses were put back up, long lines formed at the confessional, pews filled up, pilgrimage sites teemed with life as survivors came to bring their thanks to whichever saint they prayed to for protection in battle or as bombs fell indiscriminately: Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, of Lourdes, of La Salette, Saint Thérèse, Saint Geneviève, Saint Jeanne d'Arc, all had their new devotees.\n\nThe Communards had attempted to stamp out the 'opium of the people': clearly, this was not as successful as they had hoped. Indeed, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church."
 nfa.527.a: "Te Deum!"

 nfa.528.t: "The Damocles Explosion"
 nfa.528.d: "After years of careful scientific research, French engineer Louis Réard has finally put the finishing touches on the most important work of his life, possibly radically altering the course of human history: the Damocles. When he invited the press to an exclusive event, rumours swirled until finally he unveiled his work to the world, leaving the journalists stunned for a split second before the fracas of camera flashes drowned out any question they might have. Truth is, they didn't need any explanation: a simple picture was sufficient, a picture that would be in every newspaper the very next day.\n\nWith a total area of 200 cm2, described as 'small and devastating', named after the now infamous Red project for an atom bomb by the genius inventor who hoped it would create an \"explosive commercial and cultural reaction\", the damocles, now the world's smallest swimsuit, is creating a wave of passion across Europe and beyond. Réard has already received thousands of fan letters, strangely enough mainly from men, and just as many orders, but many are not amused by this new fashion statement. Conservatives, women's associations, and even the Church have already condemned the damocles and called on the government to shut down this clear attack on public decency, leading to ever more publicity for the swimsuit."
 nfa.528.a: "Well, if the Church says so..."
 nfa.528.b: "This is pure French genius, don't stifle it!"

 nfa.530.t: "Art Week in Avignon"
 nfa.530.d: "Avignon is a lovely little town in the South of France known for the well-preserved medieval heart of the city, still circled by high walls, where the popes went in exile for some time in the 14th century and built a magnificent gothic palace-fortress, as well as for the Saint-Bénézet bridge, famously partially destroyed and the subject of a centuries old children's song. However, with a lack of funds allocated for the conservation of the Palace of the Popes under Communard rule and some sizeable damage occurred during the reconquest, the city has seen better days.\n\nAs such, to gather funds for the reconstruction of the medieval quarter, the city with support from the government has created a week-long art festival, focused primarily on theatre, the palace making for a prestigious open-air stage. Expecting the visit of a few locals, the city was instead overwhelmed by the attendance: thousands showed up to see plays such as Shakespeare's \"Richard II\" or \"The Story of Tobit and Sarah\", a biblical tale by devout Catholic diplomat and poet Paul Claudel. After such a success, the city has vowed to make this festival a yearly event, with all the proceeds going to the conservation and reconstruction efforts. As for the government, they hope to seize the opportunity to foster a rebirth of classical French culture after years of \"avant-garde\", bohemian nonsense."
 nfa.530.a: "May this festival be successful for decades to come!"

 nfa.531.t: "A Mosque in Paris?"
 nfa.531.d.default: "Plans for the construction of a great mosque in Paris had been drawn up for decades, first sponsored by Ottoman diplomats and by the late 19th century by a \"Committee of French Africa\" which sought to establish France as a nation friendly to Muslims as part of her colonial ambitions, or out of more genuine islamophilia. The Great War put these plans into motions: what better way to show respect and gratitude to the many Muslim colonial subjects fighting for the Motherland? Approval was given, funding gathered, a prospective emplacement even chosen. But the revolution threw all this out of the window, and though the Communard authorities did honour the memories of the Indigènes soldiers who died for France in the \"great imperialistic meat grinder\", they were certainly not about to create a place of worship for them.\n\nIn the exile and the reconquest of the Métropole, once again our Muslim subjects showed their bravery and dedication to the Patrie and we would not stand victorious without them. As such, the halted plans for the construction of a Great Mosque of Paris have been expanded, with some advocating for a sizeable complex architecturally inspired by the Ez-Zitouna Mosque in Tunis, complete with gardens, a hammam, a madrassa and even a tea house. Though no one is putting into question the need for a great symbolic gesture of thanks, the project is drawing some criticism from secularists and some conservatives alike."

 nfa.532.t: "The Grand Tour?"
 nfa.532.d: "The Tour de France was before the exile without contest the most popular sport event of the year, followed by millions on the radio and along the roads of France, as cycle sports fans showed up to cheer for their idols. The Tour's precise itinerary was different every year, and having the event pass through one's town or village was certainly the event of the summer. The revolution did not hamper the enthusiasm of France for the Tour, though the number of foreign participants starkly dropped. Indeed, cycle sports were even encouraged by the Communard authorities as a proletarian alternative to motor-sports, much like football was promoted over rugby. Even in exile, our people listened intently to the Tour on the radio, leading to the creation of a rival Tour d'Algérie which did find much success, though it never stopped our people from illegally tuning in to red radio stations to follow the competition.\n\nWith the mainland reconquered however, it is time to organise once again the Tour de France, hopefully bringing, if only briefly, our still deeply divided people together. However, within the committee tasked with determining the itinerary a question arose: should this Tour also pass through Algeria? After all, the Algerian departments are a part of France like any other. Medical experts have warned that this would turn the competition into an almost two-months long affair and that the sweltering heat of the Maghrebi summers could make more than one cyclist collapse, but the symbolic triumph of a unified tour could certainly make this risk worth it."
 nfa.532.a: "Combine the two tours into one Grand Tour!"
 nfa.532.b: "Stick to the Métropole."

 nfa.533.t: "La Ville aux Cents Clochers"
 nfa.533.d: "Before the revolution, Rouen was called the 'City of a Hundred Spires', because of its large number of churches. The anti-clerical number however destroyed some of these churches, took them over for secular use, or simply let them fall into disrepair. Now that the war is over and Normandie has been freed, a question arises: should we rebuild this part of Rouen's history as part of reconstruction efforts? Many of our Catholic citizens believe that the churches should be rebuilt as they were, a way to exorcise the godless past, however this would have a certain cost, especially when the money could be redirected to more urgent causes. Alternatively, we can rebuild some of them while giving them another purpose, like housing concert venues or public libraries. This way, the history of the city would be preserved while making an efficient use of money. Or we could simply tear down the most damaged ones and restore only a few, to make more space for new buildings."
 nfa.533.a: "Rebuild it all, of course!"
 nfa.533.b: "Be efficient in rebuilding."
 nfa.533.c: "There's no point, tear it all down."

 nfa.534.t: "The Wreck of Vimoutiers"
 nfa.534.d: "The sleepy little village of Vimoutiers in Normandie, whose only claim to fame was its tenuous assertion to be the birthplace of the famous Camembert cheese, was heavily damaged in the recent fighting, particularly after retreating Red British troops attempted to create a temporary stronghold. Much like in so many cities and villages across France, it will take years to rebuild. However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defence, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers.\n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one clean-up crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France. In any case, the local mayor said he intends to turn the tank into a monument. What should be done?"
 nfa.534.a: "Make sure it is disabled, and let them keep it"
 nfa.534.b: "This is just plain weird, seize and scrap the tank!"

 nfa.535.t: "Pontifical Zouaves"
 nfa.535.d: "Following the meeting of Prince Henri with His Holiness, the Prince has embarked on a campaign to honour the memory of the Pontifical Zouaves, a regiment of pious mostly French volunteers who defended the Papal States until the conquest of Rome by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870. Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading 'Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France' was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit. They will head to Rome and proudly stand guard on the Tiber, representing the French faithful united as one in their duty to defend the Church."
 nfa.535.a: "Long Live the Zouaves!"

 nfa.536.t: "Native Aristocrats"
 nfa.536.d: "For weeks now, an incongruous and unceasing ballet of Indigènes in the most colourful and awe-inspiring costumes has been taking place: an immense tent in the manner of the Bedouin was installed in the royal gardens, lavishly decorated in an eclectic Mauresque style overloaded with royal symbolism. It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honour, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman. The Monarchy only asks of the Indigène one thing: to serve France, and be ready to fight and die for his King."
 nfa.536.a: "What a sight!"

 nfa.537.t: "The Knights of Saint John"
 nfa.537.d: "The island of Malta, though still a British possession, has been under our control since 1926. Deeply Catholic, the people of Malta were not particularly troubled by the rise of the Action Française and the restoration of the monarchy, though we were keen to manage their sensibilities in the immediate aftermath of the coup de force: this is after all merely a temporary occupation and upsetting the Maltese status quo would mean upsetting our allies.\n\nHowever, we have been approached by representatives of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, better known as simply the 'Order of Malta', looking for an agreement with the monarchy. Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian Army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable. What should we do?"
 nfa.537.a: "How could we refuse the help of knights?"
 nfa.537.b: "A shame we can't afford to upset our allies."

 nfa.538.t: "A Latin Union?"
 nfa.538.d: "The question of a possible union or alliance of all peoples of 'Latin' culture is very dear to Charles Maurras. A passionate of the Classics, looking back to Rome as the foundation of European civilisation and France as her foremost heir, the practicality of such a project is of little interest to the Master, who extends the definition of 'Latin' to include the whole of Southern Europe, much of South America, and even South Germany, Switzerland and Romania, gleefully blurring the line between \"Latin\" culture and Catholicism. Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies.\n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany. These groups have even had some limited but rather positive effects, fostering good relations between our nations and turning into what could be described as an international think tank of fellow-minded Integralists."
 nfa.538.a: "An Integralist Internationale, perhaps?"

 nfa.539.t: "The Impossible Hajj"
 nfa.539.d: "The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca established by the Prophet Muhammad. Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu'min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfil this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire.\n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."
 nfa.539.a: "May next year be peaceful!"

 nfa.540.t: "A Call to Decency"
 nfa.540.d: "This winter is particularly rough, and all over France the scars of war run deep: many are still without a home, in the streets or in precarious living conditions, crowded in refugee camps. Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest has taken to the radio to call for an 'insurrection of Goodness'. Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised \"Emmaüs\" welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national pre-eminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shock-wave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and 'Abbé Henri' as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of an Emmaüs charity network are already underway."
 nfa.540.a: "... and they held everything in common."

 nfa.541.t: "A New Anthem?"
 nfa.541.d: "'La Marseillaise' has been the national anthem of France since 1879, though it was composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle for volunteers heading off to fight Prussian and Austrian armies. With the victory of the revolutionary forces, the song became immortal. Incredibly popular, the song is undeniably a republican symbol. However the fate of 'La Marseillaise' is sowing dissension even among our partisans.\n\nMany have no issue with the song, including Maurras himself, much like few have issues with the Tricolore: it has accompanied Frenchmen in some of the most glorious moments of the last century and its lyrics could easily be understood as more broadly patriotic than republican. On the other hand, a minority desires a total rejection of anything brought by the revolution, arguing that we could not fight one revolution while the embers of the previous one still burn. As such they demand the reintroduction of the anthem instated following the fall of the impostor Buonaparte, 'Le Retour des Princes Français à Paris', based on the melody of the popular song 'Vive le roi Henri'. A compromise was also proposed: the armies of the counter-revolution had themselves adopted a modified version of the song, the 'Marseillaise of the Whites', with radically different lyrics, which could satisfy everyone: after all it would be a shame to waste such a stirring melody."
 nfa.541.a: "We can't let the Republicans have it, keep the song."
 nfa.541.b: "Reject the Révolution, abandon the song!"
 nfa.541.c: "Let's compromise, adopt the modified version."

 nfa.542.t: "The Integral Experiment"
 nfa.542.d: "The next stop of the diplomatic voyage of Prince Henri is Lisbon, capital of the Kingdom of Portugal. A mere decade after the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic, a broad coalition of royalists took control of Lisbon and declared the restoration of the monarchy from the balcony of the Torreão Poente, overlooking the Terreiro do Paço, beating heart of the city. In 1927 however, following renewed economic turmoil and national humiliation inflicted in Africa by the Germans, a coup was engineered by Lusitanian Integralists, men inspired by Maurras and the Action Française, and a new government set out to restore Tradition and Faith in the small nation and its globe-spanning empire. Portugal had become a living experiment, a showcase of the possibility of the true counter-revolution. Portuguese implementation of the Integralist dream was followed intently by the Action Française, each development praised in dithyrambic articles, each setback explained as the work of red agitators and other saboteurs.\n\nWith France following in Portugal's footsteps, this state visit is seen by Lusitanian Integralists as a crowning success, proof of their prescience, and by many Portuguese as a source of national pride. The Dauphin toured the many sights of Lisbon and her surroundings accompanied by King Duarte II, before travelling to the small village of Fátima, in a pilgrimage to the site where the Virgin Mary appeared to tens of thousands. The princes and their close entourage then retired to Pena Palace for some well-deserved rest. It seems the two young men bonded over their shared experience and a budding friendship was born. And if court gossip is to be believed, something more might unite the two soon: young King Duarte was apparently struck by the beauty of Henri's sister-in-law, Brazilian princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Bragança, accompanying her sister Isabelle on this diplomatic tour. Regardless of these auspicious personal bonds being forged however, one unbreakable now unites our two nations."

 nfa.543.t: "Lá na Briogáide"
 nfa.543.d: "On the 11th of May 1745, near Fontenoy, French forces personally led by King Louis XV and his son the Dauphin faced the armies of a British-led coalition. Outnumbered and initially suffering heavy casualties, the royal Army prevailed thanks to its iron will, winning for the King a decisive victory. One force in particular illustrated itself facing the British Coldstream Guards, sending the elite force in a frenzied retreat, even seizing their banner: the six regiments of the Irish Brigade. These brave exiled Jacobite Irishmen served France for generations, never letting go of their hope to see one day a free Ireland, fighting for our kings against the 'fheall na Sasanach', the treachery of the British.\n\nTheir dreams have now come true: Ireland is free, and the 'Sasanach' being our closest allies will not stop us from commemorating Irish blood shed for France and the unbreakable bond uniting our two nations. Royal representatives travelled to Dublin to participate in a ceremony honouring the Irish Brigade on the day of their triumph at Fontenoy, where a monument funded by the donations of French and Irish Integralists was unveiled and enthusiastic speeches, in approximate Irish on our part, approximate French on theirs, were warmly received by a large crowd. The ceremony over, intense discussion took place between representatives of the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe party and our envoys on a variety of topics, such as the translation of the works of Charles Maurras into the Irish language, our ongoing process of counter-revolution, as well as further funding for their movement that they claim will soon be a favourable position to seize power: looking positively starstruck, these determined young men assured us that Ireland will once again stand with France to help us achieve our dream of freeing our homeland, against both Reds and Boches."
 nfa.543.a: "We should make this a yearly thing."

 nfa.544.t: "The Burgundy Tragedy"
 nfa.544.d: "Late in the night, grave news reached us from the occupied métropole, news that could have catastrophic consequences for the very stability of our nation should it spread. For a week now, our operatives had lost contact with important assets within the Commune, part of a vital network of sympathisers working for our cause tirelessly since the Exile. Despite our best efforts they remain unreachable, as if they had vanished without a trace alongside their particularly important cargo. We immediately suspected this to be the work of Communard counter-intelligence, which had been at best sluggish for years but recently had been hard at work to root out our valiant efforts to resist anarchic tyranny of the Reds.\n\nAs the fate of our heroes remains unknown, all we can do is rebuild and continue their sacred mission: the high-risk smuggling of French wine from Bourgogne, Bordelais or Champagne to Algeria, a task essential to keep up national morale. Though the purchase of any goods from the mainland is officially banned and likewise the Commune has desperately tried to enforce an embargo against us, there exists a thriving black market controlled in large part by our assets, recruited from either ideological sympathisers or organised crime, with wine and cheese being especially sought after, as they are after all essential goods. Despite official praise for Algerian wine, you would be hard pressed to find a bureaucrat, a businessman or an officer who had ever tasted it, and even among the lower classes where to find a good bottle for special occasions is an open secret."

 nfa.545.t: "Tu Parles d'une Ingénue"
 nfa.545.d: "'Tu Parles d'une Ingénue', 'Call that an Ingenue?', the first novel by Jean Bruce has been a surprise hit. The young man, born in the Commune after the revolution but a sympathiser of our cause, took inspiration from his involvement in our intelligence networks to write a spy novel which clearly fulfilled a niche for many Frenchmen who welcome some respite from the rather drab current situation. After such a success, possibly helped by a titillating cover and a dirt cheap price, a sequel has already been released and five more are already planned for the next year alone. They tell the thrilling stories of suave French operative Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, codename 2B 117, who travels around the world to fight bloodthirsty revolutionaries, all in between of what seems to be his main occupation: seducing and breaking the hearts of both high-class ladies and women of the night, of all allegiances, nationalities and creeds, these love affairs of course being described in torrid details. Here, the spy gets involved with Parisian organised crime to secure stolen documents of critical importance, there he stalks the red light district of Shanghai, looking for a turncoat, then we find him singing in a Cairo café or lost in the favelas of Rio: the novels have little artistic merit and will not win any literary prizes but this is of little concern to the author. Bruce is already a rich man and 2B 117 is the talk of young men all over France, who endlessly quote to each other the spy's cheesy one liners."

 nfa.546.t: "The Anti-France"
 nfa.546.d: ""The Four Confederate Estates, the Anti-France, any good Frenchman knows who is meant by these epithets: Freemasons, Protestants, Jews and Metics. Behind every revolutionary upheaval, working against us, getting fat off our labour, destroying every single part of the true France. We will not be safe until something is done to deal with these parasites." Since the coup, such rhetoric has been a daily occurrence in the 'Action Française', now the regime's official newspaper, each day ramping up further in virulence. The Republic finally toppled, the paper argues; it was now time to strike directly at her masters.\n\nOur people looking for ever more culprits to blame for France's downfall are satiated by a seemingly endless list of scandals, all seemingly involving Jews or Freemasons in some way or another. As the King's justice punishes these traitors, our compatriots have taken matters into their hand. Masonic lodges are raided by Camelots eager to delve into the secrets of these occultists. The properties of the Anti-France are being seized and redistributed, their commerce pillaged. In some major cities, riots broke out as age-old tensions between Jewish and Muslim natives came to a boiling point over any pretence. Frenchmen often joined in on the violence, the flames of discord fanned by the "Action Algérienne". The frenzy for salvation by the persecution of our enemies is gripping our nation, and already many of those of the Estates have fled, often right across the border to Morocco."

Dalaba has been the site of a civilising mission since 1924 when the Mission first chose the location to begin their ministry to the local population. The nearby homes built in the traditional style of the Foula people with their grass roofs did not fare well when a mob of natives, angry over the continued presence of the Christian missionaries bringing the gospel to their people and disrupting their former way of living, torched the town."

 nfa.471.t: "A Dispute Amongst Volta Kings"
 nfa.471.d: "The colony of Haute-Volta, effectively conquered in 1896, is still composed of traditional kingdoms with few official powers but with influence over the population. The biggest of these is the Mossi kingdom, headed by the current Moogo Naaba, Naba Koom II. It holds the legacy of the most powerful kingdom in the region before French colonisation, which spread its power far beyond its capital of Ouagadougou to neighbouring kingdoms. However, other kingdoms such as Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma or Ouahigouya still exist along with their kings and continue to vie for influence in Haute-Volta.\n\nIn this context, a dispute recently arose between the Moogo Naaba and the other kingdoms. Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom 'The Empire of the Mogho-Naba'. The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost complied to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambitions didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again.\n\nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compel him to take a stand of the matter. Who should we support?"

An investigation into the incident has given only the slightest of evidence into how the situation occurred. Several sections of track were hammered out of alignment causing the train to derail and crash. While there were no deaths reported from the incident due to the first train passing being a relative skeleton crew manned cargo train, most of the cargo was still too damaged to make it to its destination. It seems this section of track is a usual target for local Guinean terrorists and resistants, we can expect more actions of the sort to happen."

Rebels set up an improvised device that blasted a hole in the wall of the garrison in the city of Ouagadougou in the colony of Haute-Volta. This blast put the rebels straight into one of the barracks catching most of the unit completely by surprise. A brief but intense exchange of gunfire between the rebels and other nearby units in the garrison ended with a victory for the French troops but the morale has hit a new low with the ease at which the rebels managed to gain entrance into the facility.

Urgent messages were sent up the line to stop any further trains from heading down the rails just in case. With the sun just peeking over the horizon, the nearby garrison arrived on the scene to figure out what happened.

The locals were playing outside the fort and a stray kick sent the ball flying through the open front gates. Every player chased that ball inside the fort and before the soldiers had time to process what was happening, natives had seized weapons and held the fort hostage at the force of arms. Raising an improvised flag over the ramparts, our men were chased out of town without their boots. After they had run for several kilometres, they encountered an armoured car patrol that they were able to flag down. With the help of the patrol, the men of the garrison were able to fight back and recapture the fort. Martial law has been placed in effect for the next months and recreational games are to be held no less than 500 metres from the garrison."

Anyone who resisted did not see much fruit for their labours. Another soldier calls out that he can make out a faint trail moving east but a sandstorm appears to be moving up from the south..."

Outgunned but not without heart, the tribal raiders fought viciously but our boys prevailed in their righteous fight! One of the raiders was captured alive and divulged the location of the place where he was to meet another raider party before turning in to the Sahara.\n\nAfter seeing to the wounded from the burnt village, our patrol drove north and managed to set up an ambush upon the second caravan. Altogether, over 40 slaves were saved from captivity and have begun to spread the tale of their liberators' bravery in protecting them.

We of course quickly put him out at the time and forbade the CGTT, but it didn't stop it from existing underground. The union always was close from the Tunisian nationalists of the Destour party, and the two underground organisations often work together. This time, they worked to foment a strike amongst the Tunis dockers and in several factories in the south of Tunisia and in Tunis.\n\nIf syndicalist propaganda wasn't already threatening enough, the strikes have also put to the forefront a word of independence for Tunisia. An absurdity of course, but one these workers seem to believe in. In any way, it's going to be the time for a bit of cleaning in the dockers of the port of Tunis, and if the strikers won't disperse themselves, we will have to send the Army."

The document tells about known Tunisian nationalists entering the Beylical palace in which the prince Moncef Bey resides. These members of the nationalist Destour party aren't the most important ones - they aren't Habib Bourguiba or Abdelaziz Thaalbi - but most of them are suspected of treason. They come in and leave the palace discreetly and transporting nothing but there is no doubt the Bey is transmitting them important pieces of information. Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honorary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II. Whatever he is actually doing to help these terrorists, an opponent can't be tolerated this close to power. With our important military presence, an intervention to 'secure' the Bey shouldn't meet a lot of resistance."

 nfa.463.t: "The North African Star - A Rousing Speech!"
 nfa.463.d: "A small crowd started to gather on a square of Algiers at 6:00PM this evening. After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the centre of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his twenties, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observers were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Étoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land.\n\nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune. While their attempted struggle is far from being over, it isn't a reason to be lenient. We must take care to not let any comparable event happen again."

 nfa.464.t: "A Street Fight Between Algerian Nationalists"
 nfa.464.d: "Early last night, violence suddenly arose in streets of Constantine. The police report stated that some militants of the Action Algérienne party quite randomly encountered members of the underground ENA while they were seated at a small restaurant. The details of the start of the fight are then unclear but all versions agree to say the street turned into utter chaos in a few minutes while members of the two parties fought, threw chairs, tables, and any projectile they could find all while insulting each other in French and Arabic. The fight finally stopped when rumours were heard of coming police.\n\nThis fight of a minor importance reveals the increasing tensions between the two main Algerian nationalist parties. The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilationism into a Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy. The Action Algérienne is based on the ideas of the Action Française, adapting integralism to an Algerian context.\n\nIn the end, whatever the actual differences are, the good news is that they all hate each other."

In the boat: Weapons, supplies, along with nationalist and syndicalist books, all sent from the Commune and smuggled through Spain. We know the Reds have been supplying the Algerian resistance for years, sending whatever helps the cause by whatever means they can. However our police have made it clear today with this arrest that smuggling will not be tolerated, we can congratulate them for their effort to keep the country united."
 nfa.465.a: "As if we don't have enough problems already."

 nfa.466.t: "Nationalist Algerian Books Seized!"
 nfa.466.d: "The stash was well hidden, in the basement of a building in a narrow street of a European city of Algeria. Opening the door of the basement lead to the sight of a full stock of nationalist literature, most of it outrageously anti-French, and all of it strictly forbidden. All of the books have been seized by the police, to not let them badly influence anyone again, and the two Algerians present at the time of the intervention were arrested for treason.\n\nFurther inquiry has established that the basement belonged to a young Pieds-Noirs living in the district and sympathetic to the nationalist cause, who was consequently arrested too. Those Pieds-Noirs betraying their own country are a real thorn in our feet, as they have to be judged by French law and defended accordingly. They can also use their privileges to easily build a web of Pieds-Noirs militants across cities and rent places like the one we just raided to organise. But it is also a cultural disappointment: How bad is the education system for this youth to turn out as treasonous as they are?"

 nfa.468.d: "The colony of Senegal, the most 'civilised' of all West African ones, and home to the port of Dakar, is usually calm. Tensions are exceptionally low between the population and the colonial government. This is why the announcement of a miners' strike went as a shock for the colonial authorities. This morning, the workers of an iron mine refused to go to work and stayed in front of the mine. They claimed better conditions of life and better wages, taking the example of the richness of the coloured bourgeoisie in Dakar to legitimise their claims. Fortunately for us, their strike wasn't followed in other mines of the country and, after a single day, the Army was sent in to take care of the strikers. Let's hope this isolated incident stays... isolated."
 nfa.468.a: "Now get back to work!"

 nfa.469.t: "Resentment Spreads To The Lower Classes Of Senegal"
 nfa.469.d: "Senegal is very clearly our most economically dynamic colony in West Africa. The large port of Dakar is supplied with mining resources from the Senegalese countryside and with other goods coming from all of West Africa by railway. This rich export economy relies however on a deep divide between the merchant bourgeoisie in the cities, composed of Frenchmen but also of Black 'Évolués' (evolved) with the French citizenship, and a vast working class, the most visible example of it being the dockers of Dakar and the miners. In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\n\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class. 'Why are the ones in Dakar so rich yet we struggle to live correctly?'\n\nIf Senegal is still far from being prone to revolt, a few strikes have already been put down in the last years and this situation needs to be kept to scrutiny."
 nfa.469.a: "Well let's hope all of that doesn't breed syndicalism."

 nfa.470.t: "'Évolués' Support the Idea of Independence"
 nfa.470.d: "Our source about this issue is a French member of the colonial administration in Dakar, invited by friends to a mundane dinner in which rich French and Black 'Évolués' (evolved) merchants sat together. The administrator expected a friendly atmosphere, after all the 'Évolués' have the French citizenship and hold a lot of privileges compared to their black lower class counterparts, suffering under the Code de l'Indigénat. His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'Évolués' talk about how could Senegal organise itself after any hypothetical independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'Évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'Évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny any-more. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar... The lesson of the story anyway, is that some of the 'Évolués' can unbelievably come back to bite the hand that fed them."
 nfa.470.a: "This type of thinking doesn't fit a presumably evolved person."

 nfa.476.t: "The Prophet of Iriba"
 nfa.476.d: "In Iriba, a small city in Chad, a man started calling himself a new prophet. First he encouraged the locals to kill their cattle to prevent them from transforming into lions, panthers and vultures. Then he told them that they had to stop paying their taxes and throw away their French money. Finally, he announced that White people were leaving the country: the governor of the nearby city of Biltine had already been driven out by natives, and that it was their duty to kill all Whites left to be able to finally live free. To help them fulfil this mission from Allah, the dead would even come back to life and swarm the French garrisons. Not that they had anything to fear: according to the \"prophet\", the guns of the Frenchmen now only fired water.\n\nFew were truly convinced, but the brewing resentment of the peoples of Chad only needed the tiniest spark: a small insurgency broke out under the leadership of the madman, a returning patrol was swarmed and massacred and soon the local garrison was under siege. Order was quickly restored and the madman publicly executed, but the whole strange affair is a warning: the situation far from Algiers is more than volatile."
 nfa.476.a: "At least now they know our guns still fire bullets."

 nfa.477.t: "Clash Against the Tuareg"
 nfa.477.d: "The war led against the Tuareg of Niger during the 1910s had been successful, but led to other unsuspected problems. The Tuareg, having being driven off some of the usual roaming lands, had been made to sometimes live in more inhospitable regions. There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuareg. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village. The French soldiers got to congratulate themselves before leaving to help their wounded friend, the village however had to rebuild on its own."
 nfa.477.a: "That'll teach you!"

 nfa.478.t: "Assassination in Chad!"
 nfa.478.d: "Grave news has arrived to the colonial headquarters of Chad in Abéché. Another French official got attacked this morning and later died in the hospital. These assassinations of Frenchmen are fairly frequent as a sign of protest against the colonial rule which has the record of brutally imposing its decisions in the recently conquered region of Chad. Investigation is always hard in a region where the population isn't cooperative and it is likely we will never find the murderer, as always."
 nfa.478.a: "At least we can pray for his soul"

 nfa.479.t: "Attack On a Patrol in Niger"
 nfa.479.d: "We quite often send patrols across the north of Niger to assure our supremacy in these lands. As we don't have a lot of permanent bases there from where to assert our control we have to resort to such regular patrols. The patrols are usually uneventful but it wasn't the case this time. Our soldiers were suddenly attacked by a full Tuareg force armed and determined, they were hiding behind a relief waiting for the patrol to come closer before they charged with cavalry towards it. The first panicked shots of the patrol did make a few horses fall; however it soon was the French horses that started to fall as another group of Tuareg hidden in the dunes started shooting from another angle. Completely helpless and surprised, soldiers fell left and right to the bullets and the blades of the Tuareg before the survivors retreated disorderly. One of the survivors managed to get back to the nearest colonial outpost to tell this story.\n\nThe attack is an outrage but we are quite powerless to punish them unless we send a full blown army to search the desert. We will have to punish people nearer from us, who are probably Tuareg collaborators anyway..."
 nfa.479.a: "An outrage!"

 nfa.600.t: "Backed Rebellion in [revolter.GetNameDef]"
 nfa.600.d: "The natives in [revolter.GetNameDef] have been armed and organised by the occupier of the colony for weeks starting from when our forces were repelled from the region. They have now assembled a strong enough force to declare independence themselves and have also declared open revolt against our rule."
 nfa.600.a: "Another one? We must get this under control!"

 nfa.601.t: "[revolter.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence"
 nfa.601.d: "After kicking out our troops, [revolter.GetNameDef] has declared independence. Should we crush them with our superior forces, or should we cut our losses to focus elsewhere?"
 nfa.601.a: "They must remain a part of the Empire!"
 nfa.601.b: "We have more important matters than crushing native rebellions."

 NFA_gets_event_revolt: "Gets event '§H[?revolter_var.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence§!'."

 nfa.614.t: "Victory against the French colonists!"
 nfa.614.d: "When we started our revolt, no one knows what it was going to lead to, some were pessimistic, others more optimistic but everyone was determined to fight for our independence. This determination has now borne its fruit and after this long war, the French colonists had no other choice than to offer us peace and recognise that their rule over our country has ended. This day will be marked forever as the glorious day of our independence."
 nfa.614.a: "Let us rejoice!"

 nfa.623.t: "The Collapse of the French Empire"
 nfa.623.d: "With Algeria occupied, the centre of our power in Africa has now fallen to enemy advance. Without our administrative base, it becomes impossible to continue ruling over Africa, our domination has thus de facto ended in our colonial possessions. Everywhere in Africa, our garrisons and administrators are thrown out by emboldened mobs of natives. Our officials and soldiers have to flee to whatever place feels more secure, but soon there won't be any of those any-more. Some Frenchmen already plan to flee to continue the fight, but most of them accept this fact: the war is lost, and we will soon be strangers in our own home.\n\nThe French state in exile is no more."
 nfa.623.a: "Fin du jeu."

 nfa.624.t: "The Collapse of the French Empire"
 nfa.624.d: "We have lost control. The Empire of thousands of square kilometres, spanning several ancient kingdoms and thousands of ecosystems, lakes, savannahs and forests we built of ourselves in Africa is no longer in our control. Our army was pushed back by native revolts, revealing themselves way more organised and efficient than we first thought. The first defeat came off as a terrible blow, but then it kept going downhill, until putting our heartland of Algeria in danger. The situation is truly hopeless. Our only chance to survive more than a few weeks is now to recognise the independence of all of the native states and retreat back to Algeria where we can hope to reorganise and defend our nation. With a bit of luck and an efficient fight against Algerian and internal troublemakers maybe we will be able to stay afoot? Maybe this won't be the end for us... right?"
 nfa.624.a: "A national disaster."

 nfa.625.t: "Suing for Peace with Egypt?"
 nfa.625.d: "With the total collapse and capitulation of our African ally, the Algiers regime of France, the war goals of Egypt have sadly been fulfilled. Our shame is already great and there is no need to continue on this trail of humiliation. Should we then ask for peace with Egypt and safeguard what left we have?"
 nfa.625.a: "We have no choice..."
 nfa.625.b: "We can still win this war!"

 nfa.626.t: "The Entente Sues for Peace"
 nfa.626.d: "With the total collapse of their African ally, the Entente have come to the realisation that this war is over. They have been defeated and we won, and there is no reason to continue this fight any longer. Diplomats from [ENT.GetNameDef] have thus come to us to present the offer of their government: a white peace to end this war."
 nfa.626.a: "We accept the offer."
 nfa.626.b: "Never shall there be peace with the Entente!"

 nfa.627.t: "Egypt Accepted our Peace Offer"
 nfa.627.d: "Great news! The Egyptian government accepted the offer of our diplomats and accepted to sign an official peace between our two countries. With this war over, we can now focus on other fronts."
 nfa.627.a: "Excellent"

 nfa.628.t: "Egypt Refused our Peace Offer"
 nfa.628.d: "The Egyptian government decided to turn back our diplomats and refuse the white peace we offered them. This is a sad day for international peace, and it also has to make us careful. If their government refuses, it's that they aim to take more from us..."
 nfa.628.a: "Will this war never end?"

 NFA_Bring_Brittany_Home: "Invite Brittany back home"

 nfa.629.t: "[BRI.GetName] rejoins [NFA.GetNameDef]"
 nfa.629.d: "With the fall of German power in Europe, their position in [BRI.GetName] is no longer sustainable and their troops have pulled out from the region. Owing to the cultural and economic bonds with [NFA.GetNameDef], the government in [BRI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have lobbied to rejoin the French government in [NFA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Such a request was immediately granted and celebrated as a continued sign of the growth of French dominance over German interests!"
 nfa.629.a: "Back to the French."
 nfa.629.b: "Welcome back home!"

 NFA_Bring_Belgian_Land_Home: "Request the return of French Territory"

 nfa.630.t: "[NFA.GetName] requests the return of French territory"
 nfa.630.d: "Representatives today have gathered in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to discuss the fate of the French territories that we have occupied since the end of the Great War. The peace signed before the outbreak of the French civil war saw the port of Dunkirk transferred to [FROM.GetAdjective] control. Several decades later, at the peace following the fall of [FRA.GetNameDef], in the Congress of Lyon, the size of the [FROM.GetAdjective] nation was expanded thanks to German war demands. With their fall, and the French rise in power, they have swooped in to request that we reverse the German acquisitions across the last few decades."
 nfa.630.a: "Very well. Hand over all gains."
 nfa.630.b: "Keep [29.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], hand over the rest."
 nfa.630.c: "We shall keep all our land."

 nfa.631.t: "[29.owner.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] responds to our request"
 nfa.631.d1: "Our diplomats were very successful in their talks in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They have agreed to transfer over all French territories that they have acquired since the end of the Great War. This is a great victory for our diplomatic corps!"
 nfa.631.d2: "Our diplomats have found moderate success in their talks in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They have agreed to transfer over the holdings that they received from the Germans after the Congress of Lyon. While some members would have liked to see the return of [29.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], this is a victory for the diplomatic corps!"
 nfa.631.d3: "It is with great embarrassment that our diplomatic party returned from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives have dug their heels into the ground and refused to yield any ground to rightful French rule in the region."
 nfa.631.a: "Huzzah!"
 nfa.631.b: "The borders of 1919 shall have to do."
 nfa.631.c: "Curses!"

 nfa.632.t: "The Collapse of the French Empire"
 nfa.632.d: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has lost control. The Empire of thousands of square kilometres, spanning several ancient kingdoms and thousands of ecosystems, lakes, savannahs and forests they built for themselves in Africa is no longer under their control. Their army was pushed back by native revolts, which proved themselves far more organised and efficient than first suspected.\nThe first defeat in the Sahara came as a terrible blow, but eventually paled in comparison to the complete disaster further west, until finally even their heartland of Algeria was in danger. The situation is truly hopeless for the French. Their only chance to survive more than a few weeks is now to recognise the independence of all of the native states and retreat back to Algeria where they can hope to reorganise and defend what remains of their nation."

#NFA's Army General Descriptions by Eberronguy#
###############################################

 NFA_philippe_petain_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 24th, 1856, in Cauchy-à-la-Tour, Pas-de-Calais, French Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe Lion of Verdun, Henri Philippe Benoni Omer Pétain, always the eternal bachelor, he joined the French Army in 1876 and attend both Saint-Cyr and the École Supérieure de Guerre. Through the end of the century he would serve in multiple battalions of the elite Chasseurs à pied. In the 20th century he would alternate between regimental and command staff assignments, progressing slowly for opposing the primary doctrine of overwhelming infantry assaults. He would enter the Great War a colonel, having been told repeatedly that he would never become a general. By the end of August, he was a brigadier general and was given command of the 6th Division in time for the First Battle of the Marne. His greatest achievement as a general would come in February 1916 at the battle of Verdun. During the battle he was promoted to command of Army Group Centre. With his skills at organisation, he would ensure that more than 15 million shells were fired at the Germans during the first five months of the battle, and Verdun would hold. In April 1919, Pétain would replace Ferdinand Foch as overall commander of French forces but would be unable to organise any offensives before the war ended later that year. Pétain would maintain his leadership role through the subsequent Revolution and would organise much of the exiled military that ended up in Algiers."

 NFA_louis_franchet_desperey_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMay 25th, 1856, in Mostaganem, Oran, Algeria, French Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to a cavalry officer, Louis Félix Marie François Franchet d'Espèrey would grow up to be an officer like his father. His early commands ranged from France to Algeria to China, and by 1913 was in command of the I Corps. During the Great War, Franchet d'Espèrey would fight in many of the early battles; among them Charleroi, Guise, and the Marne. He would also develop a... particular... form of command in order to push his officers to follow his orders. He ordered that any officer not doing their duty were to be shot, and he would break up roadblocks by firing a pistol repeatedly until everyone understood his message. This style of command would not avail him however, and despite promotions first to the Eastern Army Group and then the Northern Army Group, he failed to produce substantial victories. Eventually he was forced into exile as the Revolution took hold, and now serves as the eldest officer in the reorganised French Army, aside from Philippe Pétain himself."

 NFA_jean_de_lattre_de_tassigny_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gFebruary 2nd, 1889, in Mouilleron-en-Pareds, Vendée, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to an aristocratic family, he would attend the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, graduating 5th in his class. By the time of the Great War he was a second lieutenant assigned to the 12th Dragoon Regiment. His career during the Great War was marked by taking and surviving a total of seven wounds, five of which were taken at the Battle of Verdun. For these injuries he became well decorated; receiving eight citations, The Legion of Honour, and the British Military Cross. He remained loyal to the government as the revolution took hold, and fleeing south, was eventually promoted to Colonel."

 NFA_charles_de_gaulle_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 22nd, 1890, in Lille, Nord, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gCharles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle, a staunch Catholic would enter the military academy of Saint-Cyr in 1910 and would prove a capable student, graduating 13th in his class in 1912, joining the 33rd infantry regiment of infantry under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. De Gaulle would enter the Great War as a first lieutenant, and the 33rd regiment would see action very early on at Dinant. At Dinant he would be thrown right into the fire and was one of the first to be wounded, taking a bullet to the knee. While recovering he wrote about the shortcomings of the French officer staff and how slow he felt the British troops were. He would rejoin his regiment and by December he became a regimental adjutant. His unit became well known for sneaking through No Man's Land to listen in on enemy conversations, and for this de Gaulle would be rewarded the Croix de Guerre in January of 1915. Another injury in March would take him out of the fighting for four months, and by September he became captain of the 10th company. In the Battle of Verdun, de Gaulle would take a bayonet in the thigh and be captured as a result. He would spend the next few months in German captivity. During this time, he read German newspapers, wrote his first book, and eventually escaped. De Gaulle was granted a hero's welcome when he returned, becoming a symbol of French defiance against the Germans. He would go home to his family but would not be at peace due to the Revolution. De Gaulle and his family would follow the government in exile to Algiers, where he would join loyalist officers. He has become famous in exile as a military lecturer and theorist and is a close associate of Marshal Pétain."

 NFA_maxime_weygand_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gsupposedly January 21st, 1867, in Brussels, Brabant, Kingdom of Belgium§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gSupposedly born to unknown Belgian parents, his true parentage is still a mystery, and he would be sent to Marseille to be raised by a widow and would only become a proper French citizen once he was adopted. Weygand was admitted to the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr as a foreign cadet and become a cavalryman. Eventually he would be promoted to captain and become an instructor at the Saumur Cavalry School. At the outbreak of the Great War he would spend a short amount of time on the front lines before spending most of the rest of the war in the general staff of Ferdinand Foch. Weygand was promoted to général de brigade in 1916. His final promotion would be near the end of the war, as Ferdinand Foch was sidelined by Pétain and Weygand was promoted to fill much needed gaps in command. His new rank as général de division would make him a target by association during the revolution, and he would be one of the generals to flee across the sea. He spends much of his time in Algeria as an inspector for the Army and trying to organise what troops the Republic has available."

 NFA_henri_mordacq_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 12th, 1868, in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dôme, French Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gHenri Mordacq is one of the oldest officers still serving the republic. Mordacq's earliest years in the military were spent in Algeria before joining the 1st Foreign Regiment of the Foreign Legion in French Indochina in 1893. He became an intelligence officer in Indochina before going back first to Algeria and then to Paris. He spent quite a lot of time writing, and later as an instructor, eventually becoming the head of military courses at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1912. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Mordacq was chief of staff of general Archinard's First Reserve Corps Group in the Eastern Army. He would take frontline command of the 159th Regiment of Alpine Infantry and fight in the Battle of the Frontiers as well as defend Arras from German occupation. As the war dragged on, he became witness to the first poison gas attack, and fought at both the Somme and Verdun. His last promotion before the revolution would be to become the military chief of staff to Georges Clemenceau's second government. This kept him off the front lines through the earliest events of the Revolution, and like many other officers, he would flee with the Republic to Algiers."

 NFA_henri_giraud_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 18th, 1879, in Paris, Seine, French Republic§!"

 NFA_alphonse_juin_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 16th, 1888, in Bône, Constantine, Algeria, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAlphonse Juin was born the only son of a gendarme and his wife who herself was the child of a gendarme. In 1909 he passed the entrance examination for the École spéciale militaire. At that time cadets were required to spend a year in the Army before commencing the course, so he enlisted in an Algerian regiment, the 1st Zouaves Regiment, quickly rising to corporal and then sergeant. After graduating on 1 October 1912, Juin was commissioned as a sous-lieutenant in an Algerian regiment, the 1st Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. During the Great War, he would suffer an injury that would permanently damage his right arm. As a result of this, he is a rare breed of soldier given permission to salute with his left hand."

 NFA_henri_meric_de_bellefon_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 30th, 1888, in Vannes, Morbihan, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gHenri-Roger Marie Meric de Bellefon was born the son of Anyard Meric de Bellefon, a recipient of the Légion d'honneur. Henri-Roger would follow in his father's footsteps and join the Army, eventually becoming a cavalry officer before the Great War. Despite being injured in the fighting, he remained as the commander of his units, inspiring confidence and loyalty in his men. This loyalty proved useful when the Revolution broke out, and many men in his unit would choose to remain loyal to de Bellefon and go into exile in Algeria with him."

 NFA_maurice_grisot_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gApril 28th, 1888, in Fouvent-Saint-Andoche, Haute-Saône, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe most reserved of the exiled military officers, Maurice Grisot was born in 1888. His military career was mostly undistinguished until the Great War, where he served with enough distinction to be awarded the Croix de Guerre with several citations. He chose to remain loyal to the government during the Revolution and ended up an exile like the others. In the time since, his skills in civil and military engineering have earned him promotion after promotion."

 NFA_philippe_de_hauteclocque_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 22nd, 1902, in Belloy-Saint-Léonard, Somme, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gPhilippe François Marie Leclerc de Hauteclocque was born the fifth of six children, of The house of Hauteclocque, a distinguished noble line that survived the French Revolution, and Philippe's direct ancestors participated in the fifth and eighth Crusades. This pedigree made the family enemies of the socialist revolutionaries, and Philippe would flee with his family to Algiers before completing his education. As soon as he was able, he enlisted in the remnant French Army, and has since made a name for himself as a competent cavalry officer."

 NFA_jean_touzet_du_vigier_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 10th, 1888, in Chambéry, Savoie, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gA military volunteer, Jean-Louis-Alain Touzet du Vigier would be denied entry to the St. Cyr Special Military School and instead assigned to the infantry. His time in the infantry was short lived however, as then War Minister Alexandre Millerand would assist him in finally attending St. Cyr. Touzet du Vigier would graduate just before the Great War broke out, serving in the 9th Cuirassiers. He spent most of the war in a trench alongside the 9th, but then in 1918 he was sent to join the 2nd regiment of the Chasseurs d'Afrique in Morocco. This fortuitous transfer would remove him from France as the revolution broke out, and Touzet du Vigier would find himself an officer in exile."

 NFA_marcel_descour_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 6th, 1899, in Paris, Seine, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gMarcel Descour is one of the few officers in the French military who did not fight in the Great War. His family made the choice to abandon Paris during the chaos of the revolution, and they have since resettled in Algeria. He made the choice to enlist in the Army, becoming an expert in stealth tactics and he now heads a unit of loyalist commandos."

He would enlist at the outbreak of the Great War in August 1914, and would serve in the dragoons until 1916, where at his request, he was transferred to the first Moroccan infantry regiment where he served for the rest of the war. At war's end, he had been temporarily promoted to lieutenant and would be in Africa when the Third Republic capitulated. Now an exile, his promotion was made permanent, and he has gradually climbed the ranks since. He has much interest in the affairs of the natives of Kabylia and spends much time there."

 NFA_alphonse_georges_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gAugust 15th, 1875, in Montluçon, Allier, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAlphonse Joseph Georges is a general of modest origins, He excelled in school, and would enter Saint-Cyr in 1895, graduating third in his class. His first posting would be in Algiers, and after marrying he would attend the École supérieure de guerre, where he passed with flying colours. He would assume various staff office and regimental positions through the end of the decade. At the time of the Great War Georges could be found on the staff of General de Castelnau's 2nd Army, and in command of the 122nd regiment, would be seriously injured on September 11th, 1914. This injury would force Georges to become a staff officer first under Joseph Joffre, and later under Ferdinand Foch. The consequence of this latter assignment would be that Alphonse Georges became a mortal enemy of the socialists when the Revolution broke out, and he would be forced into exile."

 NFA_pierre_lelong_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 20th, 1891, in Angoulême, Charente, French Republic§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gPierre Lelong was born the ninth child of French general Michel Lelong, After graduating from Saint-Cyr, he was supposed to be deployed with the 22nd colonial infantry regiment to Madagascar but would be turned around in the middle of the Red Sea at the outbreak of the Great War. Lelong would first see action in the Argonne in 1914 and was wounded that September at Frignicourt. In February 1915, he was taken prisoner in the fort of Beauséjour, and was sent first to Mainz and then to Fort Ingolstad. After being released at the end of the war, he would choose to go to Algiers instead of being a part of the newly created Commune of France. He would rejoin the loyalist remnants of the French military, and much of his time since the flight to Algiers has been spent moving from post to post within French Africa."

During the Great War, Lacaze lead a division of the Mediterranean fleet, and organised part of the Dardanelles Campaign. Lacaze was made Minister of the Navy in October 1915, and he retained the office until 1917. He would be one of the elder naval officers in exile and has used his experience in a variety of naval positions as the French Government reorganised.

Later he would command the Jeanne-et-Genevieve, where he would duel with the German sub on 6 August 1917 and receive a citation for his victory.

His first true command would be of the aviso Scape, in April 1918. During the chaos of the Revolution, the Scape would be the only one of the ships in its assigned squadron to not raise the red flag thanks to the leadership of Emile Muselier.
