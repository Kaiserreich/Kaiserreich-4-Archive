 SPA_SPR_SWF_civil_war_fervor_desc: "The Spanish Civil War is a conflict caused by deep economic and societal problems, the slow decline of Spain as a world power during the last 2 centuries, and the failure to keep up with the rest of the world in terms of progress.\nWhat the root causes of those problems are is what Spaniards disagree on, however, and the violence has been escalating for years culminating in this war of extremes against each other, resulting in an almost religious devotion to \"Cleanse Spain of all the problems that ail it\"... by any means necessary."

### Pre Civil War Focuses ###
 SPA_strengthen_kingdom: "Strengthen the Kingdom"
 SPA_strengthen_kingdom_desc: "The Kingdom of Spain is in dire straits, and many believe our nation will soon descend into civil war. We must consolidate our position and endeavour to thwart impending disaster."
 SPA_focus_economy: "Focus on the Economy"
 SPA_focus_economy_desc: "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should implement comprehensive economic reform."
 SPA_construction_focus: "New Construction"
 SPA_construction_focus_desc: "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construction of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
 SPA_civ_production: "New Factories"
 SPA_civ_production_desc: "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
 SPA_new_jobs: "Jobs for the People"
 SPA_new_jobs_desc: "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
 SPA_repurpose_steel_mills: "Repurpose Steel Mills"
 SPA_repurpose_steel_mills_desc: "Steel mills employ many in our nation and make up a vital part of our economy, however desperate times such as these call for desperate measures. Restructuring a few of the steel mills in southern Spain into more generalised factories may be enough to give us the edge if the ongoing tensions bubble over into full blown conflict, even if it may permanently harm the region's steel industry."
 SPA_relocate_factories_seville: "Relocate Industry to the South"
 SPA_relocate_factories_seville_desc: "If things in Spain do truly escalate into civil war, our government stands little chance of holding much north or east of Madrid. It has therefore been proposed that we preemptively move as much industry as we can to Seville, due to it being one of the largest urban areas in the nation and an area that will hopefully be far from the frontlines."
 SPA_galician_tungsten: "Invest in Galicia"
 SPA_galician_tungsten_desc: "With the situation turning dire, it seems time to already prepare for the inevitable. Galicia's untapped tungsten reserves are plentiful, and is likely to be isolated from any potential conflict within the nation. By focusing on establishing mines to extract this tungsten, vital northern munition factories will be much less restricted by resource constraints."
 SPA_focus_military: "Focus on the Military"
 SPA_focus_military_desc: "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
 SPA_mil_production: "Increase Arms Production"
 SPA_mil_production_desc: "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
 SPA_mil_planning: "Review Our Leadership"
 SPA_mil_planning_desc: "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
 SPA_fortify_madrid: "Fortify Madrid"
 SPA_fortify_madrid_desc: "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
 SPA_army_of_africa: "Recall the Ejército de África"
 SPA_army_of_africa_desc: "The Ejército de África, the Army of Africa, were fundamental to our success in crushing the native rebellion that rose up in the Rif. It seems unlikely that we will face further rebellion in the region in the short term, and so we are presented with the opportunity to recall General Franco's troops back to Cádiz to prepare for any insurrection on the mainland instead."
 SPA_german_assistance: "German Material Support"
 SPA_german_assistance_desc: "While the Spanish army may lack in tank divisions, our friends in Berlin lead the world in tank production and development. By petitioning the Germans to provide direct material support in the form of armoured vehicles, we stand to have a significant technological advantage over the rebels, which will certainly aid us in restoring order in the realm."
 SPA_rally_kingdom: "Rally the Kingdom"
 SPA_rally_kingdom_desc: "Despite our efforts to preserve peace, civil war has broken out in Spain. Now is the time to rally those loyal to the king, to eliminate our remaining divisions and ensure our nation does not fall to radicals."

 SPA_destabilise_kingdom: "Destabilise the Kingdom"
 SPA_destabilise_kingdom_desc: "It is clear that we will soon see the end of Gil-Robles's regime and the ousting of his puppet king Alfonso. Instead of attempting to prop up the government any longer, attempts should be made to strengthen those who wish to bring an end to the old order and bring in a new age of Spanish prosperity."
 SPA_focus_cnt: "Shatter Iberia's Chains"
 SPA_focus_cnt_desc: "Capitalism has clearly failed the nation of Spain, and the people of Iberia as a whole. Through supporting the cause of CNT-FAI we may be able to eliminate the evils of capitalism in our nation and bring about a new economic system that will directly benefit the common people of the realm."
 SPA_cig: "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra"
 SPA_cig_desc: "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra, the War Industries Commission, has been established in Catalonia with the stated purpose of ensuring the country is ready for war. Secretly however, the CIG's real purpose is to militarise the areas of Spain most loyal to CNT-FAI in order to arm these revolutionaries in the event of a civil war."
 SPA_roads_of_war: "The Roads of War"
 SPA_roads_of_war_desc: "Even during the times of Roman Hispania roads were vital not only to daily life but also to warfare. Without a proper network of roads, and in the modern age railways, supplying and repositioning troops is near impossible. By improving the roads of eastern Spain, we can ensure that any uprising can quickly organise itself into a proper frontline."
 SPA_raid_police: "Raid Guardia Civil's Armouries"
 SPA_raid_police_desc: "For a revolution to be successful, its revolutionaries must be armed to oppose those who wish to suppress them. By conducting raids on the armouries of the Guardia Civil, the revolutionaries of the CNT-FAI will be able to both arm themselves and help deprive the Kingdom's armies of combat equipment."
 SPA_zaragozan_steelworks: "Expand Zaragozan Steelworks"
 SPA_zaragozan_steelworks_desc: "Zaragoza is home to some of the largest steelworks in the entire nation, and as a result it is also home to some of the strongest unions in all of Spain. As the city will certainly fall under the control of Syndicalist rebels, investing in an expansion of the steelworks there will greatly aid their potential industrial capacity."
 SPA_factory_sabotage: "Sabotage the Factories of Madrid"
 SPA_factory_sabotage_desc: "Despite Madrid being the heart of the Kingdom of Spain, many within the city also wish to see the end of the regime. With the aid of factory workers loyal to the socialist cause, we can organise a coordinated campaign of industrial sabotage as a prelude to the revolutionary uprising, preventing the use of any of Madrid's factories by forces loyal to the King."
 SPA_focus_carlist: "The Righteous Cause of the Carlists"
 SPA_focus_carlist_desc: "The failure of the Second Republic showed the peoples of Spain that the country will fall apart without the guidance of a strong monarch. These past four years of turmoil have also shown us that Alfonso's incompetence would result in him failing to get people drunk in a brewery, let alone guide them through crisis. We should instead offer our backing to the Carlist claimant to the throne, and hope that a more legitimate Spanish King will lead our nation forward."
 SPA_northern_industry: "Industrial Expansions in Northern Spain"
 SPA_northern_industry_desc: "For centuries the stronghold of the Carlist movement has been in the north of Spain. In the event of a civil war, there is no doubt that these territories will remain loyal to the Carlist cause, and any industrial investments in these regions are bound to end up in the hands of their troops."
 SPA_defend_burgos: "The Stronghold of Burgos"
 SPA_defend_burgos_desc: "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
 SPA_kings_proclamation: "The Proclamation of the True King"
 SPA_kings_proclamation_desc: "No matter who or what they support, it is always painful for the blood of Spaniards to be spilled. While it seems unlikely at this stage that Javier can be peacefully restored to the throne, a proclamation from the true king declaring the end of Alfonso's reign and urging a peaceful transfer of power may convince some Alfonsists to lay down their arms and help save some Spanish lives from being needlessly lost."
 SPA_portuguese_aid: "Aid From Our Iberian Brothers"
 SPA_portuguese_aid_desc: "No matter how much we fight or bicker, the peoples of Spain and Portugal are truly brothers and sisters. While the Portuguese government does not yet wish to officially recognise Javier as the king of Spain, those in charge of the Portuguese regime and many subjects of its realm wish to aid the rightful Carlist cause. If we petition our Portuguese friends for support, there is no doubt that they will provide to us as much as they possibly can."

### Political Focuses ###
 SPA_consolidate_spain: "Consolidate Spain"

 SPA_replace_alfonso: "Future of the Nation"
 SPA_replace_alfonso_desc: "Our King Alfonso is in a coma, and it seems likely his time will soon be at its end. A regent is not enough - we must decide who is to lead Spain in the years to come."
 SPA_arrest_leaders: "Arrest the Malcontents"
 SPA_arrest_leaders_desc: "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
 SPA_new_constitution: "Absorb the Carlists"
 SPA_new_constitution_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Carlists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, Family and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPA_unity_at_last: "A National Movement"
 SPA_unity_at_last_desc: "We must aim to be a movement above petty party politics that any true Spaniard can rally behind. The Liberals, Marxists and Freemasons dare to threaten our great nation but they shall never succeed, for we have our Catholic faith beside us and once Spain has been united, the world will know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."
 SPA_rights_spanish: "Restore the Rights of the Spanish"
 SPA_rights_spanish_desc: "Since Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, the Spanish Constitution has remained suspended, which evidently has not mended the rifts in Spanish society as shown by the outbreak of civil war. Therefore the Spanish Constitution will be restored and the fundamental rights of the Spanish will be recognised, so long as the exercise of these rights does not go against the spiritual, national and social unity of Spain."
 SPA_jan: "Rally the JAN"
 SPA_jan_desc: "The Juventudes de Acción Nacional are the youth wing of our party and have captured the boundless energy hidden within the Spanish youth, which is far different to the desolate and enervating scepticism of our defeatists and intellectuals. The JAN faithfully came to the aid of Spain during the civil war by recruiting many volunteers for our holy cause. Now that the war is over, the JAN should be expanded and provide a home for all of our society's young."
 SPA_spanish_man: "The New Spanish Man"
 SPA_spanish_man_desc: "The anarchic generation of 98 and their ideas have created a sad, harsh and vinegary Spanish youth. We shall forge new men: an authentic, happy, optimistic, Spanish youth unlike the current that is riddled with defeatism and lacking in vision."
 SPA_organic_democracy: "Organic Democracy"
 SPA_organic_democracy_desc: "Instead of petty things like liberal principles, parliamentarism, political parties, and universal suffrage, Spanish Democracy will be based on natural social institutions such as the Family or Municipality, ensuring that Party Politics will cease to corrupt the Spanish people. A bicameral system will be created: Legislative power will be exercised by a Congress elected by universal suffrage  and by a Senate representing organised social interests."
 SPA_national_catholicism: "National Catholicism"
 SPA_national_catholicism_desc: "The rules and teachings of the Catholic church will be an integral part of Spanish Law. The church will have pride of place in making the laws while [SPK.getleader] will make sure that the church is protected."
 SPA_corporate_state: "A Corporate State"
 SPA_corporate_state_desc: "Society will be centred around the natural bodies of association: the family, where one is born; the municipality, where one lives; the union, where one works. The exercise of any individual right is conditioned to the decisions made by these traditional social corporations while issues relating to religion will be handled by ecclesiastical organisations."
 SPA_charter_of_labour: "Fuero del Trabajo"
 SPA_charter_of_labour_desc: "A Charter of Labour will be drafted to resolve the issues caused by labour disputes and revolutionary unions. It's provisions will include the prohibition of strikes, the regulation of working hours and of rest, the creation of the Magistracy of Labour and the creation of the Spanish Trade Union Organisation as a sole trade union, which will group employers and workers equally, both subordinated to the decisions of the State."
 SPA_municipal_reorg: "Municipal Reorganisation"
 SPA_municipal_reorg_desc: "Carrying on from the Municipal Statute of 1924, José Calvo Sotelo has proposed further reorganisation of municipalities in order to finally regenerate municipal and political life and vanquish the plague of caciquismo. Provincial and local authorities will be replaced by trusted men to ensure that no forms of corruption will exist."
 SPA_falange: "Supremacy of the Directorate"
 SPA_falange_desc: "Our esteemed Caudillo, Mola, shall carry on the legacy of Primo de Rivera and cure the many ills that afflict the Spanish nation. We are entrusted with a great mission: to create a new spirit, found a new State, a new Nation purged of weakness. Duties and sacrifices will be imposed no matter the cost."
 SPA_ally_jon: "Incorporate National Syndicalist Principles"
 SPA_ally_jon_desc: "The JONS have many admirable traits, such as their reverence for violence or their strong, Catholic character. Their fanaticism has impressed Mola and already talks have begun to incorporate the JONS into the UPE. Under our guidance, their National Syndicalist program can become a cornerstone of the Spanish nation and serve to instil a purpose in every part of society,"
 SPA_abolish_parties: "Corporatise the Cortes"
 SPA_abolish_parties_desc: "Following a corporate model, the Cortes will be closed, with the National Consultative Assembly standing in their place. A fruitful evolutionary process will begin that will allow the transformation of national public life, creating a corporate and authoritarian State. The parliamentary system in its current form is a failure, and so a Supreme National Assembly is required to build a New Spain."
 SPA_national_revolution: "National Revolution"
 SPA_national_revolution_desc: "The Patriotic Union will bring forth a new order, sweeping away any vestiges of previous failed regimes. To implement it necessitates a national revolution with direct, fiery and combative action. Life is a militia and must be lived with a pure spirit of service and sacrifice in order to regenerate the damaged Spanish nation."

### Economic Focuses ###
 SPA_rebuilding_the_economy: "Rebuilding the Economy"
 SPA_rebuilding_the_economy_desc: "The economy of Spain has been completely destroyed by our recent troubles. Now that the situation has stabilised, it is now time for us to rebuild."
 SPA_expand_railroads: "Expand the Railroads"
 SPA_expand_railroads_desc: "Railroads have been one of the main sources of infrastructure for Spain since their introduction in the last century. As we rebuild the economy, we should rebuild and modernise the Spanish railroads."
 SPA_resource_extraction: "Extract Natural Resources"
 SPA_resource_extraction_desc: "Spain has an abundance of minerals that can be exploited. We should survey the land for new deposits and export these minerals abroad. Of particular interest is Galician tungsten. There is great potential to be found there."
 SPA_provincial_rebuilding: "Provincial Rebuilding"
 SPA_provincial_rebuilding_desc: "We should look at rebuilding the various provinces and let their economy improve and recover."
 SPA_military_investments: "Military Investments"
 SPA_military_investments_desc: "We should have military companies invest in the various provinces. Not only will this help provide jobs for the King's subjects but it will also help the military production for the future wars."
 SPA_comercial_investment: "Commercial Subsidies"
 SPA_comercial_investment_desc: "The many private companies that are at the heart of the Spanish economy have been torn apart and left in ruins following both Black Monday and the Civil War. By providing government subsidies to these businesses we can ensure they get back on their feet and bring back the jobs our people so desperately need"
 SPA_electrification_program: "Electrification Programme"
 SPA_electrification_program_desc: "In order to help improve the economy we should look at electrify the country of Spain. This shall have over time beneficial impacts for the Spanish economy."
 SPA_ley_general_educacion: "Ley General de Educación"
 SPA_ley_general_educacion_desc: "In order to improve the quality of education for Spaniards across the country, a new law has been passed. The law modernises the education system, as well as making attendance mandatory for all Spaniards for at least 14 years. This will vastly improve the quality of education in Spain."
 SPA_expand_real_academia: "Expand Real Academia"
 SPA_expand_real_academia_desc: "The Royal Academies are the highest education schools within Spain. Many often specialise in one particular field or connected fields, such as science, medicine, history, language and so on. We should make sure that they get the funding needed to provide education for Spain."
 SPA_industrial_nationalisation: "Industrial Nationalisation"
 SPA_industrial_nationalisation_desc: "While our government has often supported free market industrial endeavours, the nationalisation of key industry during this turbulent time of reconstruction may significantly aid the rebuilding process and should be considered. The question of if and how we should return the industry to the original owners after this period of nationalisation is simply one for a future time, preferably far enough that it no longer matters."
 SPA_create_ini: "Instituto Nacional de Industria"
 SPA_create_ini_desc: "The Instituto Nacional de Industria or National Institute of Industry, is a state run corporation created to help develop the Spanish economy and improve the state's self-sufficiency."
 SPA_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 SPA_modern_agriculture_desc: "The many small farm estates of the countryside have struggled during the recent troubles we have faced, as they have been unable to adopt new agricultural technologies and methods of cultivation. We should subsidise the import of modern agricultural equipment to jump start this process."
 SPA_military_factories: "Expand the Arms Industry"
 SPA_military_factories_desc: "War will likely come to Spain in the future. The godless Commune of France sits just across the Pyrenees after all. Thus in order to prepare for that future war, we should build new military factories."
 SPA_labour_charter: "Labour Charter"
 SPA_labour_charter_desc: "The state has announced the creation of a Labour Charter. This charter helps protect the realm's subjects from godless Syndicalism by providing a conservative welfare programme and recognising some worker's rights, nipping the growth of further Syndicalism in the bud."
 SPA_catholic_trade_unions: "Catholic Trade Unions"
 SPA_catholic_trade_unions_desc: "Trade unions are unfortunately rather important in the modern economy, and we cannot simply get rid of them completely. However instead of alienating them we should instead promote Catholic trade unions as an alternative. This will help give us greater control over the working classes as well as help deradicalise the unions that sided with the godless syndicalists."
 SPA_spanish_miracle: "Spanish Miracle"
 SPA_spanish_miracle_desc: "At long last the Spanish economy has been rebuilt. Throughout Spain, the people are hard at work while also enjoying the newfound economic prosperity throughout the realm."

 SPA_modern_terrico: "Reorganise the Infantry"
 SPA_modern_terrico_desc: "While armoured warfare has its place, the backbone of every major army will always remain the humble footsoldier. Our infantry brigades will be reorganised and modernised into an elite fighting force, able to see off anyone who dares to challenge it."
 SPA_preservation_of_order: "Preservation of Order"
 SPA_preservation_of_order_desc: "A loyal army is fundamental to maintaining order in the state. Without one, anarchy and chaos is sure to prevail against order, and so we must therefore take steps to ensure and encourage loyalty in the army."
 SPA_artillery_effort: "Modern Guns for Modern Soldiers"
 SPA_artillery_effort_desc: "The world is quickly moving past the age of bolt action and small capacity semi-automatic rifles, and yet many of our frontline infantry are still equipped with this old fashioned equipment. If we are to be victorious we must focus on modernising and updating our infantry equipment and artillery, lest we wish for our army to languish in the past forever."
 SPA_guardia_civil: "Guardia Civil"
 SPA_guardia_civil_desc: "The Guardia Civil is the gendarme of the Spanish government and it has a military role in protecting the country. We should strengthen the Guardia Civil and provide them with better military training to be one of the backbones of the new Spanish army."
 SPA_emergency_factories: "Emergency Armament Production"
 SPA_emergency_factories_desc: "In times of peace we can afford to enforce safety standards and protections in our factories, but we no longer have this luxury. While some of those working in our factories may be injured, or potentially give their lives in service of the cause, it is a sacrifice we have to endure."
 SPA_defenders_of_realm: "Defenders of the Realm"
 SPA_defenders_of_realm_desc: "The battles that decide our future will not be fought in the open fields, but in the centre of great cities and sprawling urban landscapes. In order to defend our realm, our soldiers must learn how to fight in the streets, across rooftops, and even inside occupied homes."
 SPA_adaptive_fortifications: "Adaptive Fortifications"
 SPA_adaptive_fortifications_desc: "The opportunity to build grand protective fortifications is not one often granted to us, instead our soldiers must learn how to quickly produce more adaptive forms of fortifications to protect themselves."
 SPA_militarise_the_railways: "Militarise the Railways"
 SPA_militarise_the_railways_desc: "Supply lines are the arteries of an army, and trains their blood. In order to properly supply our troops, we must take steps to militarise the existing rail network and ensure it is optimised for war."
 SPA_army_of_maneuver: "Army of Manoeuvre"
 SPA_army_of_maneuver_desc: "It is no longer the Weltkrieg, wars cannot be easily won by simply having a large cannon. Motorised divisions, tank brigades, and fast moving infantry are key to victory, and so they will be key to the armies of Spain."
 SPA_mechanized_effort: "Spanish Auto Industry"
 SPA_mechanized_effort_desc: "We should look at modernising the Automotive industry of the Spanish Army. Mechanised warfare will require better trucks and automobiles, which will help in getting supplies to our troops as well as increasing the mobility of our soldiers."
 SPA_weltrieg_lessons: "Armoured Warfare Tactics"
 SPA_weltrieg_lessons_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed to everybody the potential use of tanks. Combined with motorised or mechanised support, tanks can excel at the purpose they were designed to achieve; to catch the enemy by surprise. Unlike in the Weltkrieg, where tanks were massive and vulnerable targets, a much more mobile approach is needed."
 SPA_navarran_lancers: "Navarran Lancers"
 SPA_navarran_lancers_desc: "During the first Carlist War, the lancers from Navarra were some of the best cavalry troops that the armies had. It therefore seems fitting to revive this legacy with our tank brigades. They shall be our elite troops, and the tip of the spear of the Spanish Army."
 SPA_tank_shipments: "Request German Tank Shipments"
 SPA_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield. While they may not be the highest quality, the Germans still have a large amount of old tanks rusting away in their stockpiles. By petitioning Berlin, we may be able to quickly get a sizable amount of these tanks delivered, allowing us to quickly send them to the frontlines."
 SPA_a_modern_army: "A Modern Army"
 SPA_a_modern_army_desc: "It was not long ago that our army was hopelessly outdated, barely advancing since the Napoleonic Wars. Now with our recent reforms and technological advancements the Spanish army can no longer be discounted as an outdated relic, being now a modern army that may soon become the premier army of Europe."

### Navy Focuses ###
 SPA_armada_espanola: "Armada Española"
 SPA_armada_espanola_desc: "During the Spanish golden age, the Spanish Armada was the greatest fleet in the world. Its ship sailed the oceans and we ruled the waves. We should modernise our fleet and restore our navy to its former glory."
 SPA_upgrade_dockyards: "Dirección General de la Marina Mercante"
 SPA_upgrade_dockyards_desc: "The Spanish Navy was famous for its merchants, Spanish galleons filled with gold and other goods from the Americas would flow back daily to the mainland. We should rekindle our mercantile spirit and build a modern merchant marine for the Spanish Navy."
 SPA_new_generation_of_admirals: "Training a New Generation of Admirals"
 SPA_new_generation_of_admirals_desc: "In order to rebuild our great navy, efforts must be made to modernise our admiralty. Our admirals, both new and old, must be taught modern doctrines for a modern age."
 SPA_infanteria_de_marina: "Infantería de Marina"
 SPA_infanteria_de_marina_desc: "The Infantería de Marina is the marine force of the Spanish Navy and the oldest marine corp in the world, having been founded in 1537 by Charles I of Spain. While the Infantería de Marina has slowly lost most of its prestige as the years have gone by, under [SPA.GetLeader] things will be different. Our marines shall be once again restored to a status truly befitting their legacy."
 SPA_grand_navy: "The New Armada"
 SPA_grand_navy_desc: "The new Spanish Navy will be a grand navy, able to project our power across all of the world's oceans. We shall rebuild the Spanish Navy to the power of its heights, soon Spain shall rule the waves once again."
 SPA_modern_galleons: "Modern Galleons"
 SPA_modern_galleons_desc: "The great galleons of Spain were the strongest ships of their age. Likewise as we build up and modernise our navy we should build modern battleships and dreadnoughts to secure the seas once again."
 SPA_battle_cruisers_support: "Dedicated Armoured Cruisers"
 SPA_battle_cruisers_support_desc: "While dreadnoughts are the pride of the Spanish Navy, armoured cruisers will also serve a vital role as escorts for our navy."
 SPA_defend_the_coast: "Guardians of the Spanish Coast"
 SPA_defend_the_coast_desc: "The Spanish Navy shall focus on defending Spain itself. While it shall not be as large as some want, it will be respected and it shall defend Spain from all enemies."
 SPA_coast_guard: "Establish a Dedicated Coast Guard"
 SPA_coast_guard_desc: "Currently Spain lacks any form of dedicated coast guard force, with most of the duties being handled by the Guardia Civil until recently. If we are to fully protect the Spanish coast from any possible threats, it would be imperative for us to establish a dedicated coast guard unit to handle these duties instead."
 SPA_protect_our_colonies: "Protect Our Colonies"
 SPA_protect_our_colonies_desc: "The overseas colonies that we still hold are of vital interest to Spain and we should use our navy to protect the coast of our colonies from all attackers. However in case that is not viable, several well placed coastal forts and batteries shall do the job."
 SPA_cruiser_support: "Light Cruiser Support"
 SPA_cruiser_support_desc: "The use of smaller, more lightly armoured scout ships will allow us to disperse forces across a wide area in order to scout our entire coastline, ensuring we are able to rapidly respond to enemy incursions."
 SPA_masters_of_the_sea: "Masters of the Sea"
 SPA_masters_of_the_sea_desc: "The Spanish Navy has been successfully reformed and is now one of the greatest navies in the world. We once again assume our rightful title of Masters of the Sea."

### Air Force Focuses ###
 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire: "Academia Básica del Aire"
 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire_desc: "Modern wars are fought not only on the land and across the seas, but also in the skies. Modern air doctrines must be instilled into our pilots, and state of the art planes must be built if we expect to be victorious in our battles."
 SPA_upgrade_air_ports: "Nationalise Civilian Aerodromes"
 SPA_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up. Across the country there are many civilian aerodromes which we would be able to nationalise and expand into proper military airports, saving us significant time in establishing new airfields for our pilots to use."
 SPA_new_pilots: "Training New Pilots"
 SPA_new_pilots_desc: "Most of our current air force is made up of eager volunteers and former pilots of civilian aircraft, with little to no knowledge of military aviation. It is therefore imperative that these recruits receive proper training before they are deployed in the skies, as their experience will hopefully give us the edge we need over our rivals."
 SPA_aviation_industry: "Support the Aviation Industry"
 SPA_aviation_industry_desc: "Spanish aircraft manufacturers have been stunted by the turbulence that has plagued the country for several years. Ongoing troubles in the world have showed the need for modern aircraft companies, and so support should be provided to several Spanish companies that seek to modernise our aviation industry."
 SPA_air_supremacy: "Air Supremacy"
 SPA_air_supremacy_desc: "The skies must be free from enemies and our armies unmolested by hostile aircraft. Our air force should primarily be focused on establishing and maintaining control of the air."
 SPA_fighters: "Fighter Effort"
 SPA_fighters_desc: "Fighters are the backbone of any air force, allowing us to express our supremacy over the sky and allow the rest of our air force to flourish. To ensure that we are able to do so, we must focus on developing new fighter models to outperform our enemies in the air."
 SPA_foreign_airplanes: "Purchase Foreign Planes"
 SPA_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SPA_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 SPA_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."
 SPA_bombers: "Bomber Effort"
 SPA_bombers_desc: "To truly assist the army, our air force must be capable of destroying fortified positions and disrupting enemy infrastructure. To accomplish this, we should focus on the development of new tactical and strategic bombers."
 SPA_voice_of_heaven: "Eyes of Heaven"
 SPA_voice_of_heaven_desc: "Radar is a promising new technology which, with further development could provide a wealth of information about enemy tactics and positions and reveal the course of enemy aircraft. Several pilots have begun calling radar the Eyes of Heaven for how much they are able to reveal and see."
 SPA_paratrooper_focus: "Desperta Ferro!"
 SPA_paratrooper_focus_desc: "By the end of the Middle Ages, a famous company of Aragonese mercenaries, the Almogávares, made their war cry “Awake the Iron” famous across the Mediterranean. That war cry will honour a new unit of paratroopers; quick infantry, transported by planes and able to deploy behind enemy lines."
 SPA_colonial_air_ports: "Colonial Airports"
 SPA_colonial_air_ports_desc: "We should expand our airports within our colonies. This shall allow the air force to quickly go from the mainland to our overseas colonies to defend them from anyone who would seek to separate us from our possessions."
 SPA_rule_the_skies: "Champions of the Skies"
 SPA_rule_the_skies_desc: "The air force is no longer a rag-tag collection of volunteers, but a fully functioning organ of our military. Let us rule the skies of Spain and beyond!"

 SPA_place_in_the_world: "Our Place in the World"
 SPA_place_in_the_world_desc: "With all the troubles which have afflicted the kingdom, we have come to be treated as a second-class country within Europe - a nation to be ignored, or even one which might be seen as an easy target. Now that we have reasserted our position, it is time to restore our contact with the rest of the world, and to let them know our strength has returned."
 SPA_join_germany: "Join the Reichspakt"
 SPA_join_germany_desc: "Our place lies at Germany's side - let us join the Reichspakt, so that the syndicalists will find themselves surrounded."

 SPA_iberian_trade: "Iberian Friendship"

 SPA_support_sardinia: "Aiding the House of Savoy"
 SPA_support_sardinia_desc: "Italy has suffered greatly these past few decades, but in the House of Savoy there is hope for it to recover and restore itself to its former greatness. We should seek to trade with our newfound allies, and pledge to support the restoration of their great legacy."
 SPA_support_sicily: "Aiding the Sicilian Borbóns"
 SPA_support_sicily_desc: "Italy has suffered greatly these past few decades, but in the Sicilian branch of the House of Borbón there is hope for it to recover and restore itself to its former greatness.

 SPA_french_advisors: "French Advisors"
 SPA_french_advisors_desc: "The years France has spent in exile in Algeria has led to the development of advanced amphibious assault techniques, all in service of reclaiming the mainland. We should ask our French friends to share their knowledge with us, so we too can aid their plans."
 SPA_canadian_advisors: "Canadian Advisors"
 SPA_canadian_advisors_desc: "Canada has been the heart of the British Empire in terms of industrial development and military advancement since the loss of the Home Isles. We should seek support from their IEDC and ISAC to aid Spain in our own developments in these fields."
 SPA_german_equipment: "Request German Equipment"
 SPA_german_equipment_desc: "Ever since the Weltkrieg it has been said that German manufactured armaments are unmatched in terms of quality. With our ascension to the Reichspakt, we have the perfect opportunity to request some from our new ally to see for ourselves."
 SPA_german_mining_projects: "German Mining Projects"
 SPA_german_mining_projects_desc: "The German war machine never ceases its thirst for more resources to produce further armaments. Germany has therefore proposed allowing German led mining projects in our country, to aid in our resource extraction attempts and to hopefully be a mutually beneficial arrangement for us both."
 SPA_mitteleuropa: "Renewed German Trade"
 SPA_mitteleuropa_desc: "Trade with Germany has greatly diminished since the turmoil of Black Monday hit both our countries. Now that we are properly aligned with the Germans, it is time to renew trade between us, which will greatly aid our country's economic growth."
 SPA_expanded_mitteleuropean_trade: "Expanded Mitteleuropean Trade"
 SPA_expanded_mitteleuropean_trade_desc: "Being part of Mitteleuropa means not just access to the German markets, but to all members of the union. Being able to export Spanish goods to large swathes of Europe will greatly stimulate our country's economy."
 SPA_isolation: "We Stand Alone"
 SPA_isolation_desc: "Truly, Spain has no interest in joining in the larger conflicts of the world. We have seen enough troubles. For now, we rebuild and look to our own defence."
 SPA_lease_gibraltar: "Lease Gibraltar to Germany"
 SPA_lease_gibraltar_desc: "While we may officially be neutral in the ongoing conflict between Germany and its Syndicalist rivals, it does not mean we do not wish for a German victory over the godless socialists. The Strait of Gibraltar is vital to controlling the Mediterranean during this war, and by temporarily leasing Gibraltar to the Germans we can help ensure their control over the sea while netting ourselves a tidy sum in the process."
 SPA_bounties_of_neutrality: "The Bounties of Neutrality"
 SPA_bounties_of_neutrality_desc: "War is good for business, and even better when you're not involved in it. By sitting on the sidelines of any ongoing conflicts in the world, we are able to conduct trade regardless of allegiances and thus we stand to greatly profit from these conflicts."
 SPA_increased_volunteers: "Unofficial Intervention"
 SPA_increased_volunteers_desc: "Just because we are officially neutral, it does not mean that our private citizens must also be neutral. Many in our country still wish to fight in conflicts overseas, and it would be wrong to stop them from doing so. It is simply coincidental that many of these volunteers happen to be part of our military and are armed with the latest equipment of our armed forces."
 SPA_influx_of_refugees: "Influx of Refugees"
 SPA_influx_of_refugees_desc: "Being a neutral country in Europe during this great war has resulted in an influx of refugees fleeing their homes and arriving in Spain to be free of conflict. While we of course will not allow unchecked migration into our country, accepting and assimilating these refugees may prove useful in the long run."
 SPA_putting_refugees_to_work: "Putting the Refugees to Work"
 SPA_putting_refugees_to_work_desc: "The Spanish state is not a charity organisation, if the refugees we have received wish to stay they must make themselves useful. Many of these refugees have industrial backgrounds and will fit perfectly into the workforces of our factories, and for the rest the armed forces always needs more men to ensure the state's protection."
 SPA_bourbon_throne: "Claim the Borbón Throne"
 SPA_bourbon_throne_desc: "King Jaime I is, by rights, the senior legitimate male heir of the House of Capet and thus heir to the French throne. Indeed, there are many Frenchmen who consider him the de jure King of France. It is time to see that claim enforced and see all of France and Spain united under a single banner once again."
 SPA_franco_spain: "The French Coronation"
 SPA_franco_spain_desc: "Now that France has been liberated from the godless Syndicalists by our brave troops, no one can doubt that Jaime de Borbón is the rightful King of the French. Jaime will be anointed and coronated at Notre-Dame de Reims, as is tradition, and the two nations will be united together under our righteous king."

### Intro Screen ###

 SPA_country_intro_header: "The Kingdom of Spain"
 SPA_country_intro_content: "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. After this, separatist movements in both the Basque country and Catalonia arose, and both the Church and a radical worker's movement, the CNT, are interfering in her internal politics. Spain's populace has become deeply divided.\n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded.\n\nAs a result of the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, accepting the will of his people, went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right.\n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
 sprd.1.a: "Let us prevail."

### Events ###

### Domestic ###
 sprd.2.t: "Black Monday Hits Spain"
 sprd.2.d: "The defeat of France and Britain during the Weltkrieg, and their subsequent socialist revolutions, has led to the Spanish economy being inseparably tied to Germany’s Mitteleuropean trade bloc. As a result, the effects of the complete collapse of Berlin’s stock market has torn the Spanish economy apart, hundreds of businesses have already shuttered their doors and thousands of citizens seem set to lose their jobs with every additional day that passes. This news has already galvanised radicals all across the political spectrum, from the anarchists in Catalonia who wish for the complete destruction of the Spanish state, to the Carlists in Burgos who aim to coopt the nation’s institutions in service of an extremist cause. It seems that the true troubles that plague Spain and her people are only just beginning..."
 sprd.2.a: "We did not need this!"

 sprd.3.t: "Breakdown of our Society"
 sprd.3.d: "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics has driven the Spanish people into a frenzy, and the sustained economic crisis following Black Monday has poured gasoline onto the embers. Across the great cities of Spain, riots have begun breaking out not only between police loyal to the government and these radical extremists, but also between the extremists themselves with reports of fighting occurring between Carlist supporters and CNT members in Zaragoza. It is hard to imagine how this situation can get any worse."
 sprd.3.a: "This is not going to end well."

### Carlist Chain ###

 sprd.4.t: "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón Dies"
 sprd.4.d: "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 86. As the Duke had no children the question of who will succeed him as the Carlist claimant has arisen. Following the Duke's death, King Alfonso XIII has become the most senior male descendant of Charles IV and so in theory should also now be the head of the Carlist branch of the Borbón dynasty.\n\nVery few things in life are ever that simple however, and only a fraction of Carlist supporters have accepted Alfonso's position as the legitimate king, with the rest disqualifying him for a wide range of reasons including the alleged treason of his ancestors and even simply on the grounds of viewing him as being unfit to rule based off his weak leadership and previous deposition.\n\nThe majority of supporters of the Carlist cause have decided to instead support the claim of Javier de Borbón-Parma, declaring him King Javier I of Spain. While it is hoped that in time the Carlists may be able to slowly be convinced to begin to instead support the legitimate claim of Alfonso, it seems unlikely Carlist opposition to the king will end any time soon."
 sprd.4.a: "The Carlists must be plotting something."

 sprd.8.t: "Javier's Ambitions to the Throne"
 sprd.8.d: "Despite adherents of the Carlist cause supporting Javier's claim to the throne, it was hoped by those in the current government that this new Duke of San Jaime would simply uphold a passive claim instead of actively seeking the crown for himself. This hope was shattered today when Javier, having recently arrived in Spain from Naples, gave a speech to a crowd of Carlist supporters openly calling for his 'restoration' to the Spanish throne and the deposition of the 'false king Alfonso'.\n\nThis clear act of treason has left many within the government fearful of the lengths his supporters will go to enforce this demand, some going as far as predicting that the only remaining outcome will be civil war breaking out in the nation. It is clear that this monarchical upstart must be quickly nipped in the bud if Spain is to survive as a nation, and a decision must now be made as to how to handle the Duke."
 sprd.8.a: "Time to ban his organisation."
 sprd.8.b: "Arrest Javier and his followers!"
 sprd.8.e: "Ignore the pretender."

 sprd.9.t: "Carlist Bombing Campaign"
 sprd.9.d: "The Carlists have made it very clear that if Alfonso does not peacefully hand over the throne to Javier, violence will be the only option left to them. The rabble-rousers have already set out to prove that this was not an empty threat, as last night the home of one of the junior officers of the armed forces was bombed, with the man and his family perishing as a result of the attack. While the Carlists have claimed credit for this brutal murder, a statement was issued stating that the additional deaths of the officer's family was an unfortunate tragedy, finishing the statement saying that further tragedies like this will be avoided if Alfonso simply relinquishes the throne."
 sprd.9.a: "Those damn marauders will pay for this!"

 sprd.10.t: "Carlist Protests in Valladolid"
 sprd.10.d: "Supporters of the Carlist movement have taken to the streets once again to denounce the failures of the current regime's response to the economic collapse the nation has endured as a result of Black Monday. In an attempt to win the support of the people of Valladolid a group of Carlist militia men wearing their distinctive red berets have begun handing food out to the local populace, declaring to the people that only under 'king' Javier I can prosperity be brought back to the nation of Spain."
 sprd.10.a: "Send in the Civil Guard to disperse these traitors."

 sprd.11.t: "Foul Murder in Madrid"
 sprd.11.d: "Late last night, after a long day debating the status of our country's internal security, our current administration's Chief of Security, Miguel Ponte Mansó de Zúñiga, was gunned down on his way home from work. The two lone witnesses of the event have reported to police that as he was walking down the street, a group of armed men rushed out of a dark alley before retreating back into it once the brutal deed had been carried out. To further complicate the police investigation, both the Carlists and multiple socialist elements have claimed credit for this assassination, and the lack of further evidence seems to make this case impossible to definitively solve."
 sprd.11.a: "May he rest in peace."

### CNT-FAI Chain ###

 sprd.13.t: "The CNT-FAI"
 sprd.13.d: "Spain's largest anarcho-syndicalist confederation of trade unions, the CNT-FAI, are one of the greatest threats to His Majesty's Government. Yesterday, Joaquin Maurín Juliá, a leader in the movement made a speech entitled 'My Heroes' in which he stated that the CNT will attempt to organise all laid off workers in an effort to save the country's economy and return jobs back to the people of Spain. With thousands of unemployed workers across the nation, it is no surprise that speeches like this have resulted in droves of new trade union members committed to the CNT's cause.\n\nFurther government inaction will clearly lead to the group becoming more and more emboldened, the threat the syndicalists pose must be dealt with as urgently as possible. The obvious solution would be to outlaw the organisation to prevent the further expansion of syndicalist support, but a much harsher crackdown may be more effective in ridding us of them at the expense of inflaming further tensions. Alternatively, we could tacitly support this latest initiative, as after all we all benefit from Spanish workers returning to their jobs, and by doing so we may be able to ultimately coopt much of the support they stand to gain through it."
 sprd.13.a: "Outlaw the CNT-FAI."
 sprd.13.b: "Arrest the leaders of the movement."
 sprd.13.c: "Syndicalists only understand force, send in the army."
 sprd.13.e: "Tacitly support them, we both benefit from solving unemployment."

 sprd.14.t: "Syndicalist Protests in Barcelona"
 sprd.14.d: "If one stepped out onto the streets of Barcelona yesterday, they would be forgiven for thinking that a revolution had already begun with the amount of angry socialists marching through the city. At the centre of the protest, on a podium in the middle of the city, trade union leaders laid out their three major demands: a solution to the economic crisis, fair working conditions, and the restoration of a free Spanish republic. The leaders also made their intentions clear to maintain these protests until their demands are met, and that they will not give in to any attempts to frustrate these goals."
 sprd.14.a: "These agitators must be dispersed at once."

 sprd.15.t: "CNT-FAI Declare a General Strike"
 sprd.15.d: "To the surprise of almost no one, the CNT have not simply quietly dispersed following our ban of their organisation, and have urged all workers of the nation to take part in a general strike until the ban is repealed. Not every worker has heeded the calls of the syndicalists to take part in the strike, but enough have to potentially tear apart what little is left of the Spanish economy. The government will not stand idly by while these traitors attempt to abolish the Spanish state, but the decision must be made on if violence is the only solution left or if negotiations will benefit us most in the long run"
 sprd.15.a: "Send in the police, a few cracked skulls will solve everything!"
 sprd.15.b: "We have no choice but to lift the ban and negotiate."

 sprd.16.t: "Arresting the Leaders of the CNT-FAI"
 sprd.16.d: "When the police arrived at the regional headquarters of the CNT in Madrid, all that was found was an abandoned building with signs that the occupants had left in a hurry. Units sent to other headquarters across the country have returned similar reports, with one unit seemingly being sent to an office building completely unrelated to any trade union organisation. It seems obvious that not only were the syndicalists tipped off about the impending arrests, but the police force itself has either been infiltrated by syndicalist agents or it has been sabotaged by members sympathetic to the cause of the socialist agitators. With no further leads to go on as to the location of the leadership of CNT-FAI, it appears that any attempt to arrest them must be put on hold for now."
 sprd.16.a: "We must immediately focus on flushing out the traitors in our ranks!"

 sprd.17.t: "Forcefully disbanding the CNT-FAI"
 sprd.17.d: "When members of the armed forces arrived at the regional headquarters of the CNT in Madrid, all that was found was an abandoned building with signs that the occupants had left in a hurry. Units sent to other parts of Spain's cities have had some success, albeit still limited, with some lower ranking members of trade unions having been found and forcefully detained. While the leadership of these unions and most of the membership have managed to escape the wrath of the army, the sheer scope of this operation will likely deter the less dedicated members from organising further, hopefully buying us valuable time to prepare for further confrontations when they do re-emerge from hiding."
 sprd.17.a: "As expected, a bit of force was all that was needed."

 sprd.18.t: "CNT-FAI Begin Their Workers Initiative"
 sprd.18.d: "With the tacit support of the central government, or more accurately its lack of opposition, the CNT-FAI have begun to implement their proposed initiative of getting Spain's unemployed workers back on their feet with the beginnings of a fresh series of infrastructure projects done alongside members of local governments across Spain. While this genuinely seems to the benefit of everyone, it is incredibly unlikely that there is no catch, although only time will truly tell what will come from this endeavour."
 sprd.18.a: "Keep a close eye on this operation."

 sprd.19.t: "CNT-FAI Expand Operations to the South"
 sprd.19.d: "Following on from their successful infrastructure projects, the CNT-FAI have announced that they have begun work on a further series of public projects and mining operations along the southern coast. Organised in a communal system, these operations are loosely controlled from their headquarters in a small town called Agua Amarga. While once again it seems unlikely there is no catch, some in the government have begun to genuinely question if these trade unions actually are just an overall benefit to the Spanish people instead of just rambunctious revolutionaries."
 sprd.19.a: "Maybe we can work together for a better future."

 sprd.20.t: "The Fruits of Socialist Labour"
 sprd.20.d: "The CNT-FAI's operations around Agua Amarga have begun to reach their conclusion, with the opening of many new mines and dozens of both new and old roads made fit for public use. While the impacts of these economic initiatives have yet to have a significant effect on the greater Spanish economy, the local communities of the region are arguably now in a better state than before the economic crash. It seems that cooperation with the trade unions has been mutually beneficial for all, and barring any further disasters this uneasy partnership may be enough to help Spain get back on its feet in the long term."
 sprd.20.a: "Hopefully the nation has now moved past the worst of its troubles."

### Elections ###

 sprd.21.t: "Our King Has a Stroke!"
 sprd.21.d: "This morning a member of King Alfonso's staff found His Majesty unconscious in bed after noticing that the King had seemingly not awoken at his usual time. Doctors on site in the palace were immediately called in to assess the situation, and have concluded that Alfonso must have suffered a stroke in the early hours of the morning. At this current stage, it is hard to gauge the severity of his condition and only time will tell if he will be able to recover."
 sprd.21.a: "We pray that His Majesty recovers quickly."

 sprd.22.t: "Alfonso is in a Coma"
 sprd.22.d: "While the current condition of His Majesty is stable, he has not yet regained consciousness - the King is in a coma. It is unknown whether or not he will ever recover from this travesty, and his son Infante Juan has been designated temporary regent while his father continues to be incapacitated. The news of the king's stroke has quickly spread like wildfire, and the malcontents of the nation have quickly jumped upon it to call for a general election to allow the people to decide the future of both the monarchy, and Spain itself."
 sprd.22.a: "Call for elections, but with only selected parties."
 sprd.22.b: "The King is not dead, and the government will not falter!"

 sprd.25.t: "Riots Sweep Through the Country"
 sprd.25.d: "When elections were called with an explicit ban on candidates aligned with socialist or Carlist groups, some opposition from these groups was of course expected. What was however not expected was the mass outbreak of violence in cities across the nation, with both the Carlists and the CNT-FAI seemingly behind anti-government riots in protest of the state's attempt to disenfranchise these political extremists. It is hard to see how an election can be carried out in these conditions, but cancelling it now may entice even the moderates in the nation to oppose the government."
 sprd.25.a: "Call off the election and declare martial law."
 sprd.25.b: "Nothing will stop this election."

 sprd.26.t: "The Election Day Disaster!"
 sprd.26.d: "Despite all efforts having been made to hold a peaceful election, it seems that any hopes for peace have now been permanently crushed. Violence has erupted across the entire nation, polling stations have been bombed, those attempting to vote have been murdered, and when soldiers attempted to quell the violence they were met with heavily armed insurrectionists belonging to both the Carlists and the Syndicalists. Martial law has been declared, although many cities have completely fallen from the government's control already, and the army has already begun full mobilisation for the inevitable."
 sprd.26.a: "It was impossible for this to end any other way..."

 sprd.27.t.juan: "The Death of the King, and a New Beginning"
 sprd.27.d.juan: "Just when it began to seem like the nation could at last recover from chaos and destruction, one final blow has been dealt to the Spanish people. Since falling into his coma, there has been little hope for King Alfonso's recovery, and over the past few weeks his condition has rapidly deteriorated. At 11.51PM last night, Alfonso was officially declared dead with a public announcement being provided in the early hours of the following morning.\n\nWhile a period of mourning has been declared in the nation, the question of how Spain is to proceed forward must be immediately solved. While Prince Juan, the current regent and Alfonso's official heir, is fully expected to ascend to the throne and succeed his father, the question of if Spain truly still needs a monarchy weighs on the minds of many.\n\nWhile the short life of the Second Republic was no paradise, there are still countless people across the nation who look upon the period favourably. In contrast the few years of Alfonso's restoration culminated in Spain's civil war, and even some monarchists have begun to ponder if a return to the Republic would finally allow Spain respite from constant instability. Regardless, a decision must be made lest Spain is to permanently dwell in the quagmire of chaos that the past few years has created."
 sprd.27.t.jaime: "The Death of the King, and a New Beginning"
 sprd.27.d.jaime: "Just when it began to seem like the nation could at last recover from chaos and destruction, one final blow has been dealt to the Spanish people. Since falling into his coma, there has been little hope for King Alfonso's recovery, and over the past few weeks his condition has rapidly deteriorated. At 11.51PM last night, Alfonso was officially declared dead with a public announcement being provided in the early hours of the following morning.\n\nWhile a period of mourning has been declared in the nation, the question of how Spain is to proceed forward must be immediately solved. Following the brutal assassination of Prince Juan, his brother Jaime has returned to Spain and positioned himself as the new rightful heir to the throne. This claim has not been without detractors however, as many have questioned Jaime's eligibility as monarch on account of his deafness, and the question of if Spain truly still needs a monarchy weighs on the minds of many.\n\nWhile the short life of the Second Republic was no paradise, there are still countless people across the nation who look upon the period favourably. In contrast the few years of Alfonso's restoration culminated in Spain's civil war, and even some monarchists have begun to ponder if a return to the Republic would finally allow Spain respite from constant instability. Regardless, a decision must be made lest Spain is to permanently dwell in the quagmire of chaos that the past few years has created."
 sprd.27.a: "Name him as Alfonso's successor."
 sprd.27.b: "No, the time of the kingdom is over."

 sprd.31.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] wants to join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 sprd.31.d: "A telegram has been received from [From.GetNameDefCap] with a request from their leadership to join the [Root.GetFactionName]. Despite the great devastation their nation has suffered as a result of their civil war, many of their peoples still wish to aid us in our conflicts and their nation geographically is in a very strategic position. A decision must be made on how to respond to this request."
 sprd.31.a: "Absolutely, they are welcome to join us."
 sprd.31.b: "No, they will be nothing but a liability."

 sprd.32.t: "[From.GetName] Agrees"
 sprd.32.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed that [Root.GetNameDef] will be a useful addition to the [From.GetFactionName]. An alliance between the two nations has now been created."
 sprd.32.a: "We have thrown our lot in with theirs..."

 sprd.33.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses"

 sprd.33.a: "So be it."

### Post-War ###

### Foreign ###

 sprf.3.t: "The Carlists Banned in Spain"
 sprf.3.d: "Following attempts to increase their power, the Carlist movement has suffered vicious repression from the present government. Manuel Fal-Conde and the new pretender, Francisco Javier de Borbón-Parma, have sought asylum in Lisbon, and are requesting support to continue their drive to re-establish a most Christian monarchy in Spain."
 sprf.3.a: "Allow them to continue operating from Portugal."
 sprf.3.b: "Break off diplomatic relations with Spain."
 sprf.3.c: "Wash our hands of the Carlists."

 sprf.4.t: "CNT-FAI"
 sprf.4.d: "The leaders of the CNT-FAI have fled Spain, where they currently face arrest and imprisonment. They have come to us asking for training and support, so that when they return they will be prepared to bring down the King!"
 sprf.4.a: "Give them what they ask."
 sprf.4.b: "Refuse, but give them refuge."
 sprf.4.c: "Kick them out."

 sprf.6.t: "Spain Proposes Mediterranean Customs Union"
 sprf.6.d: "As a result of recent economic development in Spain, their government has recently approached us with an offer of a Mediterranean Customs Union, something that could bring free trade to the Mediterranean and profit for all parties involved.\n\nWhile in its infancy, this programme is already beginning to show promises and investments for all parties involved. As this Customs Union becomes a beacon of free trade in the Mediterranean, it seems that Spain's idea has quickly become a prideful and extremely profitable venture."
 sprf.6.a: "More trade is always welcome."

 sprf.7.t: "Portuguese–Spanish Treaty of Friendship"
 sprf.7.d: "With the end of Spain's civil war and their ascension into the Entente, diplomatic relations between Portugal and Spain have never been better. These improved relations have culminated into the signing of a new treaty today in Lisbon, known officially as the 'Portuguese–Spanish Treaty of Friendship', and informally as simply the 'Iberian Pact'. The terms of this treaty has laid out plans for military cooperation between the two nations, a motion to discuss proposals to solve the dispute over Olivenza, and a mutually beneficial trade agreement for both parties. The news has already galvanised business in both Spain and Portugal, and it is hoped that this is only the beginning of a future filled with prosperity for both nations."
 sprf.7.a: "May Spain and Portugal be allies for evermore."

 sprf.8.t: "Spanish-Italian Treaty of Cooperation"
 sprf.8.d: "The peoples of Spain and Italy are not simply united under the banner of the Entente's military alliance, but also through the mutual suffering they have experienced. The peoples of each nation have had to witness and experience their nation's destruction by hostile foreign agitators and internal saboteurs, and in recognition of this bond representatives from the two states have met today in Spain to formulate a treaty between them. The main terms of this treaty lay out a series of trade agreements between both nations, and the establishment of Spanish military aid to assist the Italian cause. Following the end of this meeting, a statement from [ROOT.GetLeader] was read out declaring this agreement to be simply the starting point of the shared future of Spanish-Italian cooperation, and that [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] will be committed to strengthening the bonds that hold their peoples together."
 sprf.8.a: "May the bonds between our nations be eternal."

 sprf.10.t: "Collapse of the French Exiles"
 sprf.10.d: "With the collapse of the French exiles in Africa, it has presented us with the opportunity to claim France for ourselves. Our allies in the Entente will likely not be happy with this but the obstacle to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s ambitions is now gone for good. A Borbón Spanish-French Union awaits!"
 sprf.10.a: "Time to reclaim France once and for all!"
 sprf.10.b: "It would be wise not to anger the rest of the Entente."

 sprf.11.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers to Lease Gibraltar to Us" #Gibraltar lease by SPA
 sprf.11.d: "Despite [FROM.GetNameDef]'s official stance of neutrality in regards to the ongoing war in Europe, it is obvious to many in Spain that an Internationale victory would lead to a very precarious future for their nation. In order to help tip the balance of the war against the Syndicalists, Spain has proposed a temporary lease of Gibraltar as a German naval base for the duration of the war. Not only would control of Gibraltar provide a fortified position in the Mediterranean, but it would also grant us control over the strait and allow us to easily block any enemy ships from entering the Mediterranean. In exchange, Spain simply requests a simple monetary transfer as compensation and to pay for any post-war reconstruction that may be needed after our lease expires."
 sprf.11.a: "Gibraltar is vitally important, we accept the Spaniards' proposal."
 sprf.11.b: "We have better things to spend our money on than temporary control of a Spanish rock."

 sprf.12.t: "Germany Accepts the Lease"
 sprf.12.d: "A telegram has been received back from [FROM.GetNameDef] informing us of their acceptance of the proposed lease, and details of how the agreed monetary transfer will be handled."
 sprf.12.a: "Hopefully this transfer will tip the scales in Berlin's favour."

 sprf.13.t: "Germany Refuses the Lease" #Player only decision to refuse deal
 sprf.13.d: "A telegram has been received back from [FROM.GetNameDef] informing us of their refusal of the proposed lease, with little further explanation as to why."
 sprf.13.a: "[GER.GetLeader] wouldn't know a good deal if it slapped his behind."

 sprf.14.t: "Seizure of Gibraltar"
 sprf.14.d: "With Germany seemingly having fallen in Europe, our earlier Gibraltar lease agreement has now become null and void. Troops were sent in today to seize the port to avoid it falling into the hands of Germany's enemies. There was limited resistance by the garrison stationed in the rock resulting in a peaceful transfer of ownership."
 sprf.14.a: "I guess we still reaped some benefits..."

 sprf.15.t: "End of the Gibraltar Lease Agreement" #German event to trigger return of Gibraltar
 sprf.15.d: "With the war against the Internationale finally over, so too is the lease of Gibraltar. At the same time a telegram was received from [SPA.GetLeader] congratulating [GER.GetLeader] on the crushing of European Syndicalism, Spanish troops had already arrived in Gibraltar, almost too eager to aid with the transition back to Spanish control."
 sprf.15.a: "A deal is a deal, the Spanish shall have their rock back."

 sprf.16.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Gibraltar to Us" #Return of Gibraltar after GER crushed INT
 sprf.16.d: "Now that Germany's war with the Internationale has ended, their temporary control of Gibraltar has too reached its end. Spanish troops have already arrived in Gibraltar to help with the transition back to Spanish control, and the German government has officially acknowledged the conclusion of the lease and their intention to honour the conditions of it."
 sprf.16.a: "A toast to our friends in Berlin and their crushing of the Syndicalist menace!"

 sprf.17.t: "Reclaiming Galicia"
 sprf.17.d: "During the Spanish Civil War, the Portuguese seemingly seized the valuable region of Galicia from us, an unjust annexation from their part. Let us request back what we lost, should they want to restore diplomatic relations with us in the future.\n\nEver since the end of the civil war, [ROOT.GetLeader] has issued a diplomatic protest to [POR.GetLeader] pressuring them to return the land. With a couple months having passed since the end of the civil war, it is time to make a formal request to transfer it back to [ROOT.GetNameDef]."
 sprf.17.a: "Send a diplomatic envoy to Portugal."
 sprf.17.b: "This is not worth it, we are too weak."

 sprf.18.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Galicia"
 sprf.18.d: "With a couple months having passed since the guns fell silent on the Spanish fields, pressure has been put on [POR.GetLeader] to formally return Galicia to [FROM.GetNameDef], taken during the Spanish Civil War. Now, the socialists have sent a diplomatic envoy demanding Galicia from us.\n\nOur decision was motivated by the fear of a Carlist collapse in the civil war to the CNT-FAI. Turns out that our worst nightmare became reality and the socialists ended up victorious! Giving up the valuable Galicia to them would not benefit us in the slightest.\n\nRegardless, we must decide what is to be done." #Fires if SWF won civil war
 sprf.18.d2: "With a couple months having passed since the guns fell silent on the Spanish fields, pressure has been put on [POR.GetLeader] to formally return Galicia to [FROM.GetNameDef], taken during the Spanish Civil War. Now, the Spanish have sent a diplomatic envoy demanding Galicia from us.\n\nOur decision was motivated by the fear of a Carlist collapse in the civil war to the CNT-FAI. Fortunately, the socialists were defeated putting [FROM.GetLeader] in power. With a friendly government now in Spain, it would be wise to return it, if we wish to restore diplomatic relations once more.\n\nRegardless, we must decide what is to be done." #Fires if SWF didn't win civil war
 sprf.18.a: "We should not anger our Iberian brothers."
 sprf.18.b: "No! Galicia will stay Portuguese!"

 sprf.19.t: "Portugal Agrees to Return Galicia"
 sprf.19.d: "Following negotiations, Portugal has decided to cede Galicia back to us as we expected. Our previous grievances with Portugal are no longer present. Whatever their view of our government is, diplomatic relations may now be restored."
 sprf.19.a: "Finally, a return to the status quo in Iberia."

 sprf.20.t: "Portugal Refuses to Return Galicia"
 sprf.20.d: "The fools in Lisbon have decided to refuse our polite demand to return Galicia! With negotiations having fallen apart, there is no room for forgiveness anymore. The only solution may have to be through war, though for now, focusing on rebuilding should be our priority. Eventually, it will be ours, and it will come at a much greater cost to Portugal."
 sprf.20.a: "They will regret their decision..."

### Civil War ###

 sprc.1.t: "Civil War!"
 sprc.1.d: "An unprecedented week of unrest in Catalonia and Andalusia has left these regions dominated by anarchy. State power has broken down, civil guard garrisons have been massacred, private plantations and factories have been collectivised by armed workers, and the clergy have been forcibly driven out. This new revolutionary government is in open warfare with the government.\n\nCarlists in the armed forces have united with the remnants of the Requêtes to seize control of Northern Spain. Carlist political organisations are taking over state authorities, the rural clergy are mobilising the masses, and the pretender has flown to Burgos to proclaim the beginning of a Second Reconquista to reclaim Spain for a truly Catholic Dynasty.\n\nSpain is headed for a brutal civil war..."
 sprc.1.a: "We shall fight them!"
 sprc.1.b: "¡A las barricadas! (Play as the §RCNT-FAI§!)"
 sprc.1.c: "¡Viva Cristo Rey! (Play as the §lCarlists§!)"

### Pre Civil War ###
 sprc.2.t: "Choosing a Chief of the Army"
 sprc.2.d: "The country is on the brink of collapse, and [ROOT.GetLeader]'s popularity is at an all time low. The Army has suggested preparing for the struggle that is soon to come by picking who to lead the army. The choice is between the offensive-minded Francisco Franco Bahamonde and defensive-minded Juan Yagüe y Blanco. We must pick carefully given it is highly unlikely this conflict will be short-lived."
 sprc.2.a: "Francisco Franco Bahamonde."
 sprc.2.b: "Juan Yagüe y Blanco."

### Civil War Events ###

 sprc.3.t: "The Fall of Madrid"
 sprc.3.carlists: "Reports have reached us confirming that the last pockets of resistance in the capital of the Kingdom have been dealt with. Madrid is finally in our hands and we have quickly moved to secure all the vast artistic patrimony and to safeguard the decent population of oppressed good Catholics under the corrupt yoke of the impostor monarch.\n\nMadrid has turned into a den of depravity in the hands of Alfonso XIII and his massive collection of rather, obscene content found in the Royal Palace is perhaps the best testimony. Shall we extend God Almighty judgment on the corrupters of Spain, no matter how well they hide; or should we show them a merciful hand to take them to the path of the righteous?"
 sprc.3.socialists: "The last vestiges of reactionary resistance have surrendered, faced with the overwhelming truth that there is no way out of the city. Madrid, the belly of the reactionary beast, with its palaces, its avenues and cafés has cheated the eyes of the visitor away from the misery of its slums and worker neighbourhoods one last time.\n\nToday, the Madrid of the working class, for the working class has emerged to claim its rightful place to live, high above the grime and dirt. The massive patrimony of centuries of art and treasures is finally available to everyone, and in doing so, we have discovered that the decadence of Alfonso XIII is far deeper than expected, as his immense collection of obscene content attests. Should these chaotic days be employed to enforce the steel discipline of the proletariat on those unwilling parasites, or should we send word to the world that these inequities will never be allowed?"
 sprc.3.a: "We must scavenge what we can!"
 sprc.3.b: "Leave the city as it stands."

 sprc.4.t: "The Fall of Burgos"
 sprc.4.kingdom: "Burgos, once called \"caput Castellae\", is no longer the capital of the traitors. Four times the illegitimate traitors have risen their hypocrite flag of tradition and religion and four times we have defeated them, hopefully this time, for good. The pretender Javier, has fled the noble city and with him, his traitor generals while the last soldiers have realised the futility of the Carlist cause.\n\nSearching the Palace of the Condestables of Castile, the seat of Javier's power, has provided us with a complete documentation of the collaborators and conspirators both in Spain and outside. With this information in our hands, how should we proceed? Prosecute and detain the traitors, no matter where they hide; or show them the clemency of our fair laws?"
 sprc.4.socialists: "The Arlanzón riverside has seen the surrender of the last requetés while the impressive stone monuments' last flames are extinguished. The city of Burgos, once called \"caput Castellae\" is finally in the hands of the proletariat in arms. Revolution, as we anticipated, will take every corner on Spain, even the most outdated and refractory. The marvels of the old world will, for the first time, be enjoyed by the many instead of the few to take us all into a glorious future.\n\nAmong the chaos of the Palace of the Condestables of Castile, we have been able to locate ample evidence of internal and international support for the Carlist cause and this knowledge take us on a conundrum: should we deactivate the reactionaries and allow them to return to the generous bosom of the working people, or should we make sure that their poisonous influence will not stain anyone anymore?"
 sprc.4.a: "We must scavenge what we can!"
 sprc.4.b: "Leave the city as it stands."

 sprc.5.t: "The Fall of Barcelona"
 sprc.5.d: "The rotten heart of the Red terror is finally in our hands. No more torment for the devout clergy, no more prosecution for the decent industrialists and intellectuals, no more blasphemy against the rule of law and common decency. While Las Ramblas' barricades are still burning, the last remnants of the Godless barbarians are surrendering.\n\nEsparetero's century old forecast of the necessity to bombard Barcelona every generation has been fulfilled, but ahead, lies the task of how to proceed from there: shall we cleanse the red infection of Barcelona street by street, building by building or should we just give back the city to its legitimate owners?"
 sprc.5.a: "We must scavenge what we can!"
 sprc.5.b: "Leave the city as it stands."

### SPA ###

 sprc.120.t: "The Kingdom Victorious!"
 sprc.120.d: "The Spanish Civil War is finally over, and it seems that [SPA.GetNameDef] has emerged triumphant. Much of the countryside lies in ruins, and order has not completely been restored, but the [SPA.GetAdjective] government announced that the anarchist and syndicalist threats had finally been dealt with and would be unlikely to rise again anytime soon. This is a triumph for King Alfonso XIII, though the king is unlikely to know of it, having fallen into a coma shortly before the civil war broke out. Despite all attempts to bring about stability in 1936, it seems the Kingdom had not planned well ahead. The question of the republic is still widespread among the people and what is to be done about the monarchy has become a key point of discussion. Regardless, our enemies should be unable to rise up again anytime soon."
 sprc.120.a: "Hail to the king!"

 sprc.122.t: "Victory, No Matter the Cost"
 sprc.122.d: "The ongoing war has been hell for the entire population of Spain, and nowhere is this felt more than with our civilian population. As this war has dragged on, the repression conducted by our soldiers against Spain's people has slowly become more and more brutal. With enemy troops often disguising themselves as civilians in an effort to conduct ambushes, our men have begun to pre-emptively fire upon suspected traitors, despite the risk to actual civilians this has brought. \n\nWhile promises can be made to prosecute these soldiers after the war, it seems unlikely that any punishment will ever be handed out. The only hope for the civilian population of Spain is a swift end to this war, and with it a swift end to this needless terror."
 sprc.122.a: "Do the ends truly justify the means?"

### Post-War ###

### SWF ###

### Post-War ###

 sprc.220.t: "Victory for the Revolution!"
 sprc.220.d: "Despite the challenges we faced, we have succeeded in uniting our nation together under a syndicalist Government! Now that Spain is truly united, we must take our first steps into this new era with our fellow socialists. The country has suffered much under Alfonso's reign and it is time to right the wrongs he caused. Our first step will be to start the Congress of Iberian Socialists to decide the direction of the revolution in Spain. While the CNT-FAI led the revolutionary war effort, this victory has been won through the combined effort of the entire Popular Front, especially that of PSOE and moderate republicans who have now ingrained themselves with the people of the nation, and they will be vital to reconstruction effort."
 sprc.220.a: "Time to start the transition to socialism."

 sprc.221.t: "The People's Home"
 sprc.221.d: "Now that we have won the Civil War, our syndicalist dream has become a reality! But should we keep the people's home in Barcelona, or move it to the old capital in Madrid?"
 sprc.221.a: "Madrid, for a unified Spain!"
 sprc.221.b: "Barcelona is now and forever the people's home."

### Carlists ###

 sprc.306.t: "Assassinating the Regent"
 sprc.306.d: "Following King Alfonso's stroke and subsequent coma, his son Infante Juan has taken over his functions as the state's regent. While most of the power in their regime is held by Prime Minister Gil-Robles, many duties are still carried out by Juan and his presence has been a beacon of stability for their government. In order to strike terror into the heart of the regime, two Carlist agents have managed to infiltrate the prince's guards and will soon make an attempt on his life.\n\nThere are of course those in the Carlist movement who disapprove of this assassination, both among those who like Juan despite his family's betrayals of Spain and those who do not think it is right to kill a royal no matter the situation. Unfortunately this war must be won no matter the cost, and now we simply must wait for news of the outcome."
 sprc.306.a: "Godspeed to our agents."

 sprc.307.t: "The Assassination Plot Fails!"
 sprc.307.d: "News of our failure has quickly spread across the nation, Infante Juan has survived the attempt made on his life. It appears that the Alfonsist regime had discovered the infiltration of Juan's personal security, and when plans began to be set in motion both of the Carlist agents were immediately arrested and promptly executed without trial by the regime. With how quickly this plot was discovered, the chance of any further assassination attempts succeeding at this stage is virtually nil. It seems that this avenue of approach must be abandoned for now."
 sprc.307.a: "Who signed off on this flawed plan anyway?"

 sprc.308.t: "Carlist Treason Against Juan"
 sprc.308.d: "Through the righteous efforts of the security forces, a Carlist plot to assassinate Infante Juan has been quickly discovered and foiled as soon as these traitors attempted to launch their scheme. It appears that the prince's guard had been infiltrated by those sympathetic to the Carlist cause, with communications between two of the most recent recruits and their traitorous leadership having been intercepted.\n\nAfter a quick arrest of these imposters, both were put to death for treason against the state and security services have immediately launched investigations to weed out any potential further spies. Security around the prince has been greatly stepped up, but it seems unlikely that any further attempts will be made on his life once news of how quickly this plot has failed. "
 sprc.308.a: "Can these snakes truly go any lower?"

 sprc.309.t: "Crown Prince Assassinated!"
 sprc.309.d: "The people of Spain have woken this morning to the news of the death of Infante Juan, with knowledge of it having begun to spread before the Carlist leadership was even directly informed. Having infiltrated the prince's guard, the two agents were presented with an opportunity to plant a bomb along a path that the prince was known to regularly walk through as part of his daily routine. It appears that the bomb detonated earlier than expected, but ultimately it was enough to end the prince's life.\n\nIt has unfortunately not been entirely good news, with one of the agents having been caught by security services of the regime and quickly put to death as retribution for the killing. Ultimately though, this assassination has thrown the Alfonsist regime into chaos with soldiers already beginning to see their cause as hopeless and attempts being made by the military to seize control to maintain order."
 sprc.309.a: "We will see Javier crowned yet!"

 sprc.310.t: "The Crown Prince is Dead!"
 sprc.310.d: "Infante Juan, crown prince and regent, has been brutally murdered by Carlist agents seeking to destabilise the nation. These snakes posed as members of the prince's guard, allowing them to get close enough to plant a bomb to assassinate Juan with. In the chaos, at least one of these murderers was captured by security forces who quickly put them to death, but it appears that any others involved in the plot have managed to flee back to their masters.\n\nWith the death of Juan, the nation is left without a regent and due to his brother Jaime's deafness many question the future of the monarchy. This has also caused complete disarray in the government, with many calling for the ousting of Gil-Robles Quiñones for this sinister plot being able to flourish without his knowledge, and it seems that a military coup led by Emilio Mola may be brewing. The future of the nation has now been left balancing on a cliff's edge."
 sprc.310.a: "Emilio Mola and the military dissolve the government and assume direct control."
 sprc.310.b: "J.M. Gil-Robles Quiñones is able to maintain order."

 sprc.311.t: "Crown Prince Assassinated!"
 sprc.311.d: "Many in Spain today have awoken to the news that Infante Juan, crown prince and regent of Spain, has been assassinated by Carlist agents aiming to destabilise the Alfonsist regime. This news is of course welcomed by all righteous revolutionaries, not only has a reactionary royal been killed, but the regime itself has been thrown into complete disarray as a result. Rumours are swirling of a military coup against the remaining government, and their soldiers are allegedly already beginning to desert their army in mass. It is now time to deal the killing blow against them."
 sprc.311.a: "It is a good day when reactionaries kill each other for us."

### Post-War ###

 sprc.320.t: "The Carlist Cause Victorious!"
 sprc.320.d: "Despite the challenges we faced, we have succeeded in uniting our proud nation! Now that Spain is truly united, we must take our first steps into this new era with our fellow Catholics. After a series of failed attempts in the 19th century to establish the Carlists as the government of Spain, our mission has finally been achieved. The Alfonsists should no longer be a threat to us, now that their support base is all but eradicated. Javier can finally be coronated as the official King of the Kingdom of Spain. The socialist devils shall cower in fear realising what their fate will be."
 sprc.320.a: "Cheers to the new King."

 sprc.321.t: "The Capital"
 sprc.321.d: "Now that we have won the Civil War, our Carlist dream has become a reality! But should we move the national capital to the House of Borbón's home in Madrid, or keep it as is?"
 sprc.321.a: "To Historical Madrid!"
 sprc.321.b: "A new Borbón Dynasty with a new home."

 sprc.322.t: "The Troubles Continue"
 sprc.322.d: "Despite our victory in the Civil War, there is still a great amount of unrest and partisan activity around the country. Rebuilding and regaining the trust of the people may take some time."
 sprc.322.a: "The after-effects of a war."

 sprc.323.t: "The Nation is Recovering"
 sprc.323.d: "Our efforts at rebuilding the country and regaining the trust of our people are paying off."

 sprc.400.t: "The Spanish Civil War"
 sprc.400.d: "Ever since the defeat of Napoleon, Spain has been plagued by violence, dissent and turmoil. No amount of pleading, deal-making and appeasement has managed to do more than paper over the cracks as tensions bubbled. Finally they boiled over, the Spanish kingdom has been ripped apart by a three-sided civil war between numerous factions - the loyalists of the Madrid government, the supporters of the pretender Javier and finally the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI. There are already numerous reports of volunteers and equipment being shipped to Spain from all over the world to support one faction or another.\n\nSpain will be torn to shreds as a battlefield for the ideological forces of the wider world..."
 sprc.400.a: "It was inevitable."

### Collapse of Spanish Africa ###

 sprc.500.t: "Spanish Africa Supports our Regime"
 sprc.500.d: "With the full collapse of the Alfonsist Kingdom of Spain in the Spanish Mainland, some parts of their government and army had hoped that they could escape to the Spanish colonies in North Africa, and establish a government-in-exile like the one in Algiers. Regardless of how unlikely such a project would have been to succeed, considering the vast differences between the Spanish and French colonial empires, they never got a chance to even try. The colonial administration of Spanish Africa decided to preempt any attempts of turning their small territories into a machine with the sole purpose to reconquer Spain, by appealing to the Carlist government still holding out against the Red Menace. We were just informed that the colonies have chosen to recognise our government as the sole legitimate government of Spain, and fully submit to us."
 sprc.500.a: "They have made the right choice."

 sprc.501.t: "Spanish Anarchists in Equatorial Guinea"
 sprc.501.d: "The anarcho-syndicalists in Spain have taken control over the Spanish colony of Equatorial Guinea, and more than one member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government is suggesting that allowing [SWF.GetNameDef] to possess land in the middle of Africa is hardly a wise idea."
 sprc.501.a: "Seize it at once!"
 sprc.501.b: "Leave it be."

 sprc.502.t: "[FROM.GetName] occupies Spanish Guinea"
 sprc.502.d: "[FROM.GetName] has taken control of Spanish Guinea, apparently with the consent of the Royalist Administration! While we can't really attempt to retake the territory, some suggest that we encourage the locals to resist."
 sprc.502.a: "We must let this slide"
 sprc.502.c: "Encourage local Anarchists to resist!"

 sprc.503.t: "CNT in Africa"
 sprc.503.d.mrt: "With the anarchist revolution in Spain a power vacuum occurred in the Spanish colonies, still toiling under Royalist colonial administrations. No more is this the case, as the local population took to arms and liberated the colony, which has now been reunited with the independent Mauritanian state!"
 sprc.503.d.not_mrt: "With the CNT-FAI revolution in Spain and their gaining control over the African colonies of Spain, they have a foothold here. Many in Algiers are of the opinion that we must invade these territories to secure them from the red threat and occupy them, at least until a responsible government returns to Madrid."
 sprc.503.a: "Mauritania is finally fully free."
 sprc.503.b: "The Red Menace must be contained!"
 sprc.503.c: "We can't spare the resources."

 sprc.504.t: "Revolution in the Spanish Sahara"
 sprc.504.a: "Mauritania is finally fully free."

 sprc.505.t: "Conflict in the Sahara"
 sprc.505.d: "The Nationalist French Government has marched on our territories in the Sahara! How should we respond to this action?"
 sprc.505.a: "Let them take them."
 sprc.505.b: "To war!"
 sprc.505.c: "Offer what resistance we can..."

 sprc.506.t: "Revolt in the Sahara"
 sprc.506.d: "The people in the Spanish Sahara has risen up against the royalist administration in the Colony, and joined the neighbouring Mauritanian state! How should we respond to this action?"
 sprc.506.a: "Let them take them."
 sprc.506.b: "To war!"

 sprc.507.t: "Anarchists take Spanish Morocco"
 sprc.507.d_ger: "With the anarchist revolution in Spain and their subsequent invasion across the Strait of Gibraltar, the syndicalists now have a foothold on the African Continent, right next to our protectorate in Morocco. Within the government in Berlin, as well as among Germans and Moroccans alike in Casablanca, the unanimous stance is that we must immediately take control over the Spanish Protectorate and put and end to the system of dual protectorates in Morocco."
 sprc.507.d_other: "With the anarchist revolution in Spain and their subsequent invasion across the Strait of Gibraltar, the syndicalists now have a foothold on the African Continent, right next to territories under our control. Within our government, the unanimous stance is that we must immediately take control over the Spanish Protectorate."
 sprc.507.a: "Reunify the Moroccan Protectorates"
 sprc.507.b: "The Red Menace must be contained!"
 sprc.507.c: "We can't spare the resources."

 sprc.508.t: "Spanish Morocco occupied by [FROM.GetNameDef]!"
 sprc.508.d: "In a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, [FROM.GetNameDef] has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been an inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
 sprc.508.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
 sprc.508.b: "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

 sprc.600.t: "Syndicalist Resistance"
 sprc.600.d: "Although the godless syndicalists have been resolutely defeated on the battlefield by our brave soldiers, they continue to contest our rule across the country. While they have no chance of staging a revolution, recovery from the civil war can't proceed until they have been dealt with."
 sprc.600.a: "Faith will always triumph over Anarchy."

 sprc.601.t: "Monarchist Resistance"
 sprc.601.d: "Although the reactionary monarchists have been resolutely defeated on the battlefield by our brave soldiers, they continue to contest our rule across the country. While they have no chance of staging a counter-revolution, recovery from the civil war can't proceed until they have been dealt with."
 sprc.601.a: "They will be cast into the dustbin of history."

 sprc.602.t: "Congress of Iberian Socialists"
 sprc.602.d: "With the conclusion of the civil war, the need arose for a formal gathering of the many groups that sided with the socialist cause in order to cement the legitimacy of the Revolution as one that was supported by the popular will of the people. The First Congress of Iberian Socialists has been called and is attended by delegates from the PSOE, CNT-FAI, POUM as well as various independent socialists and sympathetic Republicans. Most seats are occupied by delegates from either the CNT-FAI or the PSOE, who are both attempting to persuade the remainder of the delegates to support their bid for leadership.\n\nWhile the CNT-FAI is in a strong position due to their revolutionary zeal and the early role they provided in leading the revolution to victory, the PSOE has been able to appeal to a broader support base due to promising stable leadership and moderation. It remains to be seen which group will emerge victorious in the Congress."
 sprc.602.a: "The people continue to place their trust in the CNT-FAI."
 sprc.602.b: "The Caballeristas sway the delegates."

 sprc.603.t: "Party Congress of Acción Nacional"
 sprc.603.d: "While Acción Nacional has outwardly been a united party since its creation in 1930, there has been a growing divide between the moderate and radical wings of the Party which has been fuelled by the many political crises Spain has faced over the years. The eruption of the civil war has only served to deepen the rift even further with an increasing number of clashes between the two wings over policy implementation. Therefore, a party congress has been called to put an end to party disunity and to determine the direction the party should take.\n\nThe reigning radical wing of the party is lead by José Maria Gil-Robles who appeals mainly to the politically influential radical right with his staunch catholicism and uncompromising attitude towards the enemies of Spain. He is challenged by José Calvo Sotelo, representing the moderate wing and defending the need for Parliament and suffrage under a responsible regime, who appeals to those disillusioned by the increasingly radical direction the party has taken. Although many expect Gil-Robles to retain party leadership, the amount of support Sotelo has received comes as a surprise and could be enough to propel him into national leadership."
 sprc.603.a: "Gil-Robles firebrand rhetoric secures his position."
 sprc.603.b: "Sotelo's moderation sways the party."

 SPA_jose_calvo_sotelo_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 6th, 1893, in Tui, Province of Pontevedra, Kingdom of Spain\n§YPolitical Career:§! While initially starting out as a jurist, having graduated with a law degree from the University of Zaragoza and later a doctorate from Central University, José Calvo Sotelo soon shifted his focus towards heavy involvement in Spanish politics. Beginning his political career as part of the Maurism movement, he would eventually end up being briefly both a deputy and the Civil Governor of Valencia.\n\nFollowing the establishment of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, Sotelo quickly found himself rising through the ranks through his committed support to de Rivera's leadership, eventually becoming the Minister of Finance. The collapse of Rivera's first regime led to his brief self imposed exile to Portugal, but with the swift end of the Second Republic Sotelo found himself not only back in government but in a much higher position than before.\n\nAfter the death of de Rivera many expected Sotelo to potentially succeed the late Prime Minister, but any hopes of this were quickly scuppered in the wake of his hospitalisation following an attempt on his life by a group of radical socialists aligned with the CNT. In the aftermath of his swift recovery Sotelo's position within the party remained strong, and with the government's victory in the civil war he has found himself elected as its new leader to hopefully guide Spain to a new period of prosperity and peace."

José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed nationalist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."

 SPA_emilio_mola_vidal_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! July 9th, 1887, in Placetas, Cuba, Kingdom of Spain\n§YPolitical Career:§! The chaos that arose after the collapse of the Spanish economy and the incapacitation of King Alfonso led to many wishing for a strong leader to guide Spain out of the chaos, and it is therefore little surprise that these conditions have facilitated the rise of Marshal Emilio Mola Vidal to power.\n\nBeing born in Spanish Cuba to a Cuban mother and a Spanish father, his family would ultimately move back to mainland Spain after the nation's defeat by American forces finalised Cuban independence. His military career for the Spanish state began at the Toledo Infantry Academy, with him ultimately distinguishing himself in Morocco and ending up one of the premier generals of de Rivera's regime and its Director-General of Security.\n\nDespite having no direct involvement in General Sanjurjo's coup which ended the Second Republic, Mola quickly found himself rewarded by the restored regime with a promotion to Field Marshal regardless. This new position has allowed Mola to command great respect within Spain's armed forces, even among those who disagree with his political stances.\n\nNow colloquially referred to as 'El Caudillo', both by his enemies and his allies alike, Mola and his cabinet make no secret of their disdain for the democratic system of the Second Spanish Republic. It is their belief that for Spain to survive, it must be led by a one party state with a strong leader to guide it forward, and only time will tell if Mola is truly that leader."

 SPA_alfonso_de_borbon_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 17th, 1886, in the Royal Palace of Madrid, Madrid, Province of Madrid, Kingdom of Spain\n§YPolitical Career:§! The status of the Spanish monarchy has often been a source of great instability within the nation, and this has never been more true than under Spain's \"twice-crowned\" king. Born with the full name Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Habsburgo-Lorena, he became King of Spain for the first time from the day of his birth, given his father Alfonso VII had died a year earlier from dysentery. His mother, Maria Christina of Austria served as regent until Alfonso's ascension to the throne in 1902 on his 16th birthday.\n\nIn 1906, he married Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg which while initially successful, was strained following the birth of their sons Alfonso and Gonzalo of which both inherited haemophilia, carried by the Queen. From 1914 onwards, King Alfonso had several mistresses and fathered many illegitimate children distancing himself from his wife. His involvement in explicit productions and his extramarital affairs led to him gaining the title of \"the playboy king\", deeply undermining his reputation.\n\nFor his active role in the Rif War of the 1920s, he gained the title of \"El Africano\" (\"the African\") wishing for Spain to reclaim its place in the world by colonising Africa, having lost most of its colonies in 1898 to the United States. However, the devastating defeat at the Battle of the Annual in 1921 largely discredited Alfonso given Alfonso's known involvement in the war and his disregard for the soldiers fighting there. When asked about the battle's outcome, he replied that \"chicken meat is cheap\" as he continued his game of golf.\n\nIn 1923, with the government's credibility diminishing rapidly, especially due to the Rif War, Captain General Miguel Primo de Rivera launched a coup installing a military government. Fortunately for Alfonso, this kept his position secure while also resulting in a miraculous period of economic growth. Within just a decade however, the turn towards stagnation would see de Rivera's regime fall and a new republic declared. While the short lived republic would soon be overthrown by General José Sanjurjo and the monarchy restored, even the King's supporters have begun to worry this \"borrowed time\" will soon finally run dry."

Following the incapacitation of his father, Infante Juan has assumed the position of regent to attempt to steer Spain through this tumultuous time. While real power within the kingdom still remains in the hand of Prime Minister Gil-Robles, many duties still fall to Juan to carry out and it is hoped this period of regency will help the young prince rule as an effective monarch when the time ultimately comes."
