 SUR_totalist_party_long: "Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiderspartij Suriname (Social-Democratic Workers Party Suriname) \n§LThe Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiderspartij Suriname is a relatively recent foundation, coordinated among a select few Suriname communists with support of Anton de Kom during his brief visit and subsequent expelling. The SDAPS has since been banned by the colonial authorities for its involvement in food protests.\n\nThe SDAPS, while sharing part of its name with a Surinamese socialist party which only briefly existed during the early 1930s, is mainly inspired by the Dutch SDP. The SDAPS thus embraces stringent and anti-reformist Marxism, Surinamese nationalism and is generally opposed to syndicalism. The SDAPS does, however, work with the SAWO due to the hostile anti-revolutionary political landscape in the colony.§!\n"

The appeal of the party remains limited to white settlers, specifically Catholics, alienating the large protestant and Jewish colonist communities. The party is often attacked for its anti-Semitism by Suriname newspapers.§!\n"
