 SQI_qu_yingguang: "Qu Yingguang"
 SQI_qu_yingguang_bio: "Qu Yingguang was inspired by Qiu Jin to become a revolutionary, but later aligned himself with the cliques of the Beiyang Army. In 1919 Qu was appointed Governor of Shandong, which became an adoptive home province for him. He distinguished himself as a good leader, improving management of the Yellow River and making efforts to protect the province’s religious and cultural legacy, in part by fostering ties with the Duke Yansheng. Years later, he joined the Beiyang Government and grew close to Duan Qirui. Both men were followers of Buddhism, a belief Qu learned from the maternal side of his family. He spent time working with religious societies and charitable organisations, earning the Buddhist name “Faxian” and the nickname of “Qu Bodhisattva”. He then moved to Shanghai shortly before Duan’s overthrow in 1926, dissatisfied with authoritarianism and corruption in Beijing.\n\nThe Shanghai Uprising of 1932 devastated his charity, the “Benevolence Alliance”, as it was feared to be infiltrated by Syndicalist agents. He fled the city like many of his peers, choosing to return to Shandong, but there witnessed the horror that China’s “Basest Warlord”, Zhang Zongchang, had wreaked upon it with opium and debauchery. Through ties to members of the Anti-Drug Association in Shandong, as well as friends like the Duke Yansheng and allies in Beijing, his Benevolence Alliance was reformed in Qufu as the “Society for Restoring Benevolence”. Though rarely publicly opposing Governor Zhang, Qu opened secret talks with the Zhili and the Imperial Court, working to find a way to pull the corruption in Shandong up by the root. Qu believes China must defeat corruption and sin, which a religious-political order upheld by an Emperor can best achieve. He’s cautious of the Manchu princes but supports Emperor Puyi, with whom he was granted an audience once. He is greatly interested in Puyi’s Buddhist sympathies, having come to believe that the Emperor is the best candidate to impose a harmonious, dharmic political order in China."

 SQI_zhang_zongchang: "Zhang Zongchang"
 SQI_zhang_zongchang_bio: "Zhang Zongchang himself felt no great national pride for Qingdao when it was lost in 1897 to Germany, but the 1911 revolution did bring him to action. Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. But when Feng died in 1919, Zhang returned to Manchuria and joined the Fengtian Clique just in time to participate in the First Zhili-Fengtian War in 1922. Fengtian's defeat in that war didn't dissuade him, and he went on to play a prominent role in the second war in 1924, capturing the crucial Lengkouguan Pass. With the near-total collapse of the Northern Zhili Clique following the Beijing Coup, Zhang went on to conquer Shandong, and pushed as far south as Nanjing and Shanghai. An ability to utilise railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as \"filthy\", even by his allies, carried him through to victory after victory. Following a period of debauched rule in China's most international city, Zhang thoroughly entrenched himself in Shandong, and through back-and-forth wars over Jiangsu eventually found himself trapped in the province during the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928. In the years since, Shandong has become both a refuge and a prison, where his illegal but tolerated presence remains under the shadow of the Qing government in Beijing. More recently, a bout of seemingly incurable sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zhang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honoured Teacher, Zhang Tianran himself. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, The Dogmeat General promised The Honoured Teacher that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."

 SQI_zhang_tianran: "Zhang Tianran"
 SQI_zhang_tianran_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 15th, 1889, in Jining, Shandong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Zhang Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognised her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occurred after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Zhang Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Zhang Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for The Honoured Teacher and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Zhang Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Zhang Tianran's supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

 SQI_li_zaolin: "Li Zaolin"
 SQI_li_zaolin_desc: "Born into a peasantry and lost his father as a child, Li Zaolin had to seek refuge from his uncle and poverty hindered his education. His military career began in 1909 when he entered the Baoding Military Academy at the age of 17 with the referral of a friend. After studying infantry for three tough years, he joined the 3rd Division as a junior officer under Cao Kun and Wu Peifu.\n\nFollowing the formation of an air force by Yuan Shikai in 1913, Li studied at the Nanyuan Aviation School and became one of the first batch of Chinese pilots in 1915. As a flying squad commander, when the National Protection War broke out, Li was sent by Yuan to showcase military prestige with his flying skills under Feng Yuxiang. Li returned to Beijing and enrolled in the 5th class of the Staff College in 1916, but he spontaneously joined Zhang Zongchang's force in Hunan as a staff in 1917 against the Constitutional Protection Army to earn field experience. As this was not officially authorised, he was declared missing at one point. After graduating in 1919, this outstanding officer became a tutor at Baoding.\n\nIn the First Zhili-Fengtian War in 1922, Li served as the chief of staff of Peng Shouxin in the Zhili army (with official recognition this time).In the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, as the chief of staff of the 1st Zhili Corps under Peng, Li was captured and recruited by the Fengtian Clique after repelling multiple Fengtian offensive in in Shanghaiguan before being encircled (It is said that Zhang Xueliang met him in person following his capture). Daunted by his defeat, Li tried returning to Beijing secretly, but Zhang Zongchang's men intercepted him at the train station and persuaded him to work with the Dogmeat General again. Since then, Li has been serving as Zhang's chief of staff, assisting him in overseeing military affairs, especially after he took charge of Shandong.\n\n§YNotes: Although Li worked with several prominent figures, his loyalty is unquestioned, as he strongly disapproves of actions that go against superiors."

 SQI_ma_liang_desc: "Originally a Hui from Hebei, Ma Liang is a particularly well travelled and weathered individual. Graduating from Beiyang Military Academy, Liang would serve as the commander of a battalion of the Beiyang New Army, later becoming commander of the Fifth Regiment of the Beiyang Army in 1911. Curiously, he studied wrestling under the famous wrestler Ping Jingyi, and would in-turn ensure that most of his subordinates under his command also participate in the sport.\n\nIn 1912, he would be employed in the service of Jin Yunpeng, wherein he was later transferred to the commander of the 47th Mixed Brigade in Shandong. In 1916, he was promoted to Garrison Commander of Jinan, and would become commander of the 2nd Division of China's Weltkrieg participation army, with the division eventually being reorganised into the Northwest Frontier Defence Army, albeit still stationed in Shandong.\n\nMobilised to fight in the Zhili-Anhui war, Ma Liang would be dismissed from his post following Anhui defeat. Following his soft retirement, Ma would settle down in Jinan, and write \"New Chinese Martial Arts\". Emboldened by the rampant increase in crime, the drug trade, and the general fall of morality in Shandong, Ma Liang would relinquish retirement, and begin contact with Qu Yingguang through his participation in the Anti-Drug Association, eventually becoming a founding member of both the Benevolence Alliance and “Society for \"Restoring Benevolence\", transitioning into Qu's right-hand man in Anti-Drug affairs."

 SQI_li_jinglin: "Li Jinglin"
 SQI_li_jinglin_desc: "First appearing onto the public scene as a graduate of Baoding Beiyang Army School in 1907, Li Jinglin was one of hundreds of young officers caught up in the swell of partisan military activity. Li's first major decoration was in fighting the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. An association with Anhui general Qu Tongfeng guided Li towards clique politics during the republican years. Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appraisal turned sour by 1928, when The Dogmeat General became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong. Li, having taken inspiration from the declaration of Xue Dian as the Yiguandao's minor Emperor in Shandong, decided to present himself as spiritually enlightened. Li publicly began training in Wudang swordsmanship, and named himself 'the Magic Sword' to provide an air of mystery. This ultimately caught the attention of Zhang Tianran who has given Li several offers to train with Big Sword militias at Taishan."

The Zhang family, seeing the future in western businesses up north, moved Huizhi to Tianjin at a young age. As a student at the Tianjing military equipment school, Zhang Huaizhi join in the Boxer rebellion with his regiment, and was commended for bombarding the Legation quarter. The guilt of losing to the westerners drove the disgraced Zhang into the army of Yuan Shikai, whose ambitious goal of becoming an Emperor felt like more of a natural evolution for Zhang than republicanism. After Yuan died, Zhang fell in with the Anhui clique, and briefly served under Zhang Shuyuan as an administrator in Shandong in 1918. Zhang eventually failed his leader again after his regiment fell fighting in Hunan. This left Zhang Huaizhi destitute again, and the only people who would take him was the Yiguandao. Citing his age, experience, and service against western imperialism, Zhang Tianran appointed Zhang Huaizhi a commander of the Red Spears of Shandong."

In 1912, Xu cooperated with the Nanjing Interim Government, rallying students in favour of revolution against the Qing. Xu used this political position to lead the Guangfu Cavalry regiment in 1913, briefly spending time in Xinjiang as well. Xu was send with the 6th Mixed Brigade Battalion into Shandong for the KMT to secure the province. Xu was unable to secure the province upon Zhang Zongchang's arrival in 1926. Xu choose to betray the KMT and surrender his brigade to Zhang, while remaining untrustworthy to him. Xu was instrumental in riling Zhang into feeling insecure, ultimately causing him to remain in Shandong during the 1928 offensive. Xu developed an addiction to opium during this time, and became complicit in the drug trade in Shandong, leading to a reduced discipline in his ranks."

Kohinata took this interest into a career first by joining the Japanese Kwantung Army, serving as a colonel under Sakamoto Rihachiro in Manchuria. Kohinata deserted the Kwantung military in 1920 to visit the mysterious Urga in Mongolia, being captured by bandits on his journey. The bandits took a liking to Kohinata, and allowed him to join their gang of horse thieves. These horse thieves taught Kohinata Daoism, martial arts, and gave him a Browning pistol emblazoned with a dragon, which he dubbed the 'Little White Dragon' - which in turn became a popular nickname for Kohinata himself. When the Qing were restored, Kohinata began going by the pseudonym Shao, hiding his Japanese ancestry. Kohinata was captured by Zhang Zuolin and initially sentenced to death, but was pardoned on the stipulation that he serve Zhang Zongchang in 1928. Kohinata joined the Zhang Clique, and has been instrumental in maintaining the army's flexible cavalry corps to counter more advanced army innovations elsewhere."

Sun also joined the Temple Road Society, a folk religion, and eventually rose into a leadership position within the society. Sun convinced the society to join the Mount Song Pacification Force, an anti-bandit group composed of former bandits. After being routed and witnessing Han Yukun's suicide in 1925, Sun deserted with loyal soldiers. These soldiers entered Bozhou, Anhui, and swore allegiance to the KMT as cover. When the Northern Expedition crumbled in 1927, Sun took his men into Ningxia. There the soldiers showed extreme prejudice in raiding the countryside, attaching religious significance to their banditry. The Ma Clique retaliated, and Sun's bandits retreated to Shandong in 1928.

Zhang was given governorship of Hunan in 1918, but his brutal rule as the Butcher of Hunan quickly led to a movement to expell him, and he was removed from Hunan on June 11th, 1920. Jingyao then decided to engage in grifts between the Anhui clique, and later to Zhang Zongchang after the rise of the League of Eight Provinces. Zhang became The Dogmeat General's 2nd Army Chief in 1926, and changed his name to Chang Shigu to hide his warrant for murder.

Siding with Yuan Shikai, Qu entered the Tianjin Naval School, and furthered his education at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, which he graduated from in 1904. Qu returned to China and served as instructor at the Wuyang Academy of Military Sciences in 1910. Initially cooperating with the Republicans in the Wuchang uprising of 1911, Qu bounced around to different posts in the Republic, eventually returning to Yuan briefly before running the Shandong Military Affairs Office in 1916. Qu made an agreement in 1917 with Li Yuanhong to sell mineral rights to an aluminium mine in Shandong to Japan, and allow shipments out of Yantai. The Anhui Clique in 1920, feuding with Li Yanhong, rescinded this right and requested Qu to Nanjing to stand trial. Rather than stand trial, Qu faked illness and postponed his trip until the Anhui Clique became disinterested in 1925. A letter from Sun Yat-sen, requesting Qu rally himself against Wu Peifu stirred him into action, attempting to organise a force in Shandong to join. This force choose to fight Zhang Zongchang upon his arrival to Shandong in 1926, being soundly defeated, and Qu went into hiding. The lack of central authority, and the idea that Sun Yat-sen ordered him to fight but he failed weighed heavily on Qu. Qu was then invited to Fengtian by Zhang Zuolin, who offered to redeem Qu if he joined the Beiyang Navy. Qu, distrusting the Japanese presence in Manchuria, refused and left. Qu is recalled once again, when the current leader of Shandong asks for his return to Shandong, motivated by a promise to Sun Chuanfang to fight."

Unlike the elder Jin hoewver, Yun'e spent much of his childhood in the fields working.\n\nTo seek a better life, Jin Yun'e joined Yuan Shiaki's New Army in 1898 as a soldier and was later promoted to junior officer. His military career would continue as he was selected to study in the Baoding Accelerated Staff Academy, where he would become a staff officer which paved the way for his promotion afterwards. In 1918, under the referral of Cao Kun, Jin became a brigade commander and thus became part of the Zhili clique. However, as Wu Peifu is suspicious of Jin's relationship with his elder brother, Jin Yun'e found himself unable to advance up the ranks. Jin Yune's promotion was visibly slower than almost all of his colleagues in the Zhili clique despite his contribution to the Zhili-Fengtian Wars, this laid the seed of discontent in his heart, which would grow even more when Jin, who was only promoted to a divisional commander in 1923, three years later than the others, was sent to Shandong.\n\nTherefore, when Zhang Zongchang consolidated in his home province, Jin Yun'e did not resist but indirectly worked with him despite being a supposed Zhili member. As a relatively independent commander who is indifferent to politics, Jin Yun'e is willing to work with anyone as long as he can maintain his status."

It is said that his initial bandit force was given by a bandit leader who was rescued in one of Chu's raids against a Qing prison. Later, in 1913, Chu and his bandits were incorporated into Zhang Zongchang's force, and they would work well with each other afterwards. Chu Yupu, unexpectedly entering a military career, would rise steadily in Zhang's ranks, following him to align with the Fengtian Clique and fighting countless wars together with the Zhangs. Chu would eventually be promoted to a Corps commander and Quartermaster in Chief for his merits after Zhang Zongchang consolidated power in Shandong.\n\nNow, as one of Zhang's clique dignitaries, Chu is an entrusted subordinate and friend of the Dogmeat General, and he is more than willing to support the Dogmeat General by making good use of his "irregular" forces and his experience in leading in unconventional warfare."

 SQI_lu_jin_desc: "Entering the Beiyang Military Academy at age 20, Lu Jin was one of many Chinese students sent to study Japanese military methods, eventually graduating from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and returning to China in 1903 to teach at the Beiyang Academy's Military Survey School. He began to associate with the Zhili and Anhui Cliques of the Beiyang Army, relying on political patronage to attain several high ranking jobs in the Zhili and Shandong provinces, where he in turn built up local connections. Jin never stayed in one place long enough to establish thoroughly root himself, however, and he always fleeted between different military cliques. In 1917 he became an avid supporter of Zhang Xun's attempted Manchu Restoration and was showered with praise and archaic military titles by the rest of the coup plotters. When the Restoration failed, Jin nevertheless managed to preserve his military career, but he fell deeper into the Zhili clique's web of factional intrigue and became more beholden to the influence of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. He eventually had to flee the country after Feng Yuxiang's Beijing Coup of 1924, finding temporary refuge in Japan, before regrouping with members of the Anhui Clique. By the time the Zhili retook power, Jin was a spent political force. Despite his Zhili and monarchist credentials his attempts to petition the Zhili Clique as well as the newly re-enthroned Xuantong Emperor to restore him to his position in the army failed. Unable to advance politically among the former Anhui Clique members in Fengtian, Jin drifted between Beijing, Tianjin and Shandong, eventually making contact with Qu Yingguang.\n\nThe two men bonded over their mutual monarchist beliefs, their hatred of the entrenched corruption in the Beijing government and their shared background as men from Zhejiang Province. Even though Lu Jin had been born in Tianjin, his family had originated from Zhejiang, and this earned him Qu Yingguang's respect. He was eventually recruited as a member of the Shandong Anti-Drug Association and the Benevolence Association, as a loose pretext to allow him to legally help organize the military wing of Qu Yingguang's political movement, free from the prying eyes of the Zhili Clique."

 SQI_wu_huawen_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1904, in Laizhou, Shandong Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gWu Huawen was born to a Christian peasant family in Shandong, but accompanied his father to Mengcheng in Anhui Province at the age of 7. Different stories circulate of just what kind of life young Huawen led, he has sometimes bragged about coming from a rich peasant family and graduating from a private missionary school, and at other times claimed he was barely surviving as a starving farm boy. In one of these stories, he joined the army as an ambitious, nationalistic student, and in the other he enlisted after a flood destroyed his home. Either way, a teenage Huawen was initially serving as a cook and doing other menial tasks before he was recognised to be literate and appointed as a messenger. He was thereafter sent to serve in a garrison in Jinan, under the command of the then Zhili-aligned General Feng Yuxiang. Huawen bonded with his commander over their shared religious beliefs and Feng grew fond of the boy, vouching for Huawen's credentials and sending him to Beijing to pursue a proper military education in 1923. He drifted between different schools and eventually graduated from the Beiyang Army Academy in 1927, the same year that his mentor Feng Yuxiang was driven out of Beijing by the Zhili Clique. Huawen quickly denounced Feng and curried favour with the Zhili, earning a teaching position in Henan and was eventually assigned in 1930 as the commander of the very same Jinan garrison he had once served in. It was here he made common cause with Governor Zhang Zongchang and fell into his infamous "Zhang Clique". Huawen rapidly worked his way up the Dogmeat General's corrupt hierarchy and eventually cut ties to the Zhili Clique. He is known to have carved out a slice of territory for himself in Jinan and made contacts with other political forces in the province, in case his fortunes would shift. His habit of frequently sides between different generals and telling conflicting stories about his past has earned him an untrustworthy reputation. He carries two infamous nicknames, the first being "The Bastard of Three Fathers" as just like Lu Bu he has served three different masters, and the second being the "Jumping General".§!"

This healing put Li Lijiu squarely in the realm of the faithful as an adult. It was around this time the young Li Lijiu began to study martial arts. In 1925 he served as a martial arts coach for the Henan Army. Since then, he has been cavorting with various warlords. In 1935, Li came to Nanjing and stayed at his martial arts master Du Xinwu's home. Soon, he became interested in the Yiguandao. The first delivery of tithing to Shandong catapulted Li Lijiu into Zhang Tianran's inner circle.

Lu Yongxiang led a failed attack on the League under Sun Chuanfang during their struggle with the Anhui Clique, and made a hastily escape to Japan upon his defeat. Unwilling to abandon his home, Lu Yongxiang requested that Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin find some way for Lu to return to Shandong safely.

As a native of Fujian, Lin joined the Imperial Chinese Navy, and graduated from the newly-established Kiangnan Naval Academy. Lin demonstrated this boldness during the Xinhai Revolution by launching a rescue mission up the Yangtze River against the republicans. Lin was rewarded for this act by the Nanjing Provisional Government by being promoted to Admiral and given the flagship Nan Shun battleship. This promotion saw Lin's entanglement in Chinese politics, and his eventual defection to the Zhili Clique. After the Qing Restoration, Lin declared his fleet independent, and sailed it to Shanghai. This action nearly cost Lin his life, when his fleet deposed him and left him at Yantai. Humiliated yet skilled, Lin became the perfect target for recruitment into Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique, which paid his salary as he was assigned to rebuild a fleet at Yantai."

Soon after, he was sent to the Northeast Military Academy to learn skills related to artillery, and would graduate to become a mortar company commander. During the second ZhiFeng War in 1924, Liu would notably command six mortars to annihilate Zhili Army positions, allowing his fellow soldiers to flood in the openings. Rising to prominence in the war, he would be promoted to battalion commander.\n\nAfter a period of recuperation from war wounds, he would join Chu Yupu as commander of the 16th Brigade, and later would serve as commander of the second battalion of the \"Model Regiment\". Serving under the likes of Zhang Jingyao, Liu Zhennian would see extensive, and bloody, service in the Northern Expedition. Notably critiquing Zhang Jingyao's performance in the war, Liu Zhennian was granted command over the remnants of Jingyao's second division, and through drastic measures and strict training, Liu managed to transform the division into a feared fighting force. Having survived the Northern Expedition, Liu alienated many within Zhang Zongchang's clique, and so aligned himself with Qu Yingguang in Shandong. Liu continues to show relentless ambition in the military totem pole, slowly climbing with every great victory.\n\n§YNotes: Having had an inch of his skull shot clean off by a bullet, Liu often likes to refer to the resulting scar as a \"soldier's flower\", much to the chagrin of any who bear witness."

 SQI_syndicalist_party_long: "Anti-Japanese Solidarity Society (Fanri Tuanjiehui)\n§gA radical splinter of the initial Kuomintang mission in Shandong, this group has spent several years underground in Qingdao waiting for the opportunity to arise. Influenced by translated socialist works published by the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, their organisation can only survive with the support of these foreign influencers.§!\n"
 SQI_radical_socialist_party: "Kuomintang"
 SQI_radical_socialist_party_long: "National Party (Kuomintang)\n§gSince the foundations of the New China movement were laid in Shandong, there is still an undercurrent of progressivism and change in the Shangqing.

 SQI_social_democrat_party: "Progressive Party"
 SQI_social_democrat_party_long: "Progressive Party (Jinbudang)\n§gFounded in 1916 by Kang Youwei, the Progressive Party grew largely through donations from ex-patriots and within the margin of democratic opportunism of the decade. When this opportunism was replaced by the Qing Restoration, several party members in Shandong chose to go underground.§!\n"

With membership unwilling to compromise with the intellectual climate of Shandong intelligentsia, party membership is mostly built on donations from ex-patriots and appeals to visiting westerners.§!\n"

 SQI_market_liberal_party_long: "Dragon Flower Society Heavenly Way (Yixin Tiandao Longhua Hui)\n§gFounded in Zouping county to combat the excessive poverty in the region, the Dragon Flower Society represents an alternative to banditry that attracted so many that decade. The founder, Ma Shiwei, intended the organisation to unify several different schools of Xiantiandao under a common goal to improve welfare in Shandong. The Dragon Flower Society was only recognised as a political party when interventionists and western observers sought out an alternative to the Yiguandao's latent militarism and the Guiyidao's generous welfare ideals.§!\n"

 SQI_social_conservative_party_long: "Guiyidao Society (Guiyidao Hui)\n§gThis organisation has a similar background to the Yiguandao, but is inclusive of Christianity and western esotericism. As such their funding has sharply declined in recent years due to the divided nature of Shandong. Those seeking Christianity have already moved to Qingdao. They do however have a strong reputation for nonpartisan welfare, giving to the poor of every race.§!\n"

 SQI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Society of Restoring Benevolence (Guiren Hui)\n§gThe turmoil of the century of humiliation is just another page in the long history of Shandong. For many in Shandong, enlightenment is the only way to escape it, others seek to dominate in their short lives. Traditionalists around Qu Yingguang and the Duke Yansheng oppose all changes that were introduced by foreigners of the last century. The Zhang Clique’s open secret drug trade is seen as degenerate behaviour by many in Shandong. Not to mention the extravagance and boorishness on display with Zhang Zongchang himself. To many, the failure of the Qing is their lackadaisical attitude towards Shandong, not their monarchy. Qu Yingguang’s public commitment to the Qing is resounded in southeastern Shandong, who wish to return home to Weihaiwei and Qingdao.§!\n"

Zhang Zongchang’s true power is in the well armed remnants of the Shandong Revolutionary Army that patrol the province.

Their syncretic beliefs combine the structure of heaven of Confucianism, the variety of gods of Buddhism, and the life extending practices of Daoism. The Yiguandao doctrine was confided by Teacher Lu Zhongjie to his small group during the Weltkrieg, and most subsequent converts learn in stages. This ensures that the core leadership has enough chips to adjust the cult to fit their personal goals. First among this group is The Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran, the successor to Lu Zhongyi. Through Zhang Tianran’s political manoeuvring, the cult has grown to about 7 million adherents across China, with only 500,000 members located within the Shangqing itself.\n\nPeasant armies throughout Northern China, particularly the Big Swords Society and Red Spears Society, see the Yiguandao as the most morally upright government in China.§!\n"

 SQI_two_zhangs_enter: "Two Zhangs Enter"
 SQI_two_zhangs_enter_desc: "Years of tension between the Yiguandao and Zhang Zongchang has reached a breaking point. Zhang Zongchang's promises to stay clean have withered away, and Qu Yingguang's infiltration into the drug trade has unearthed valuable evidence to convict him in the eyes of the world. With the arrival of Lu Zhongjie to Jinan, The Dogmeat General has put himself on a path of destruction for all three in Shandong."

 SQI_announce_revelationary_order: "Announce Revelationary Order"
 SQI_announce_revelationary_order_desc: "As all great teachers in Chinese history have done, Zhang Tianran will reveal revelationary order to the Chinese public through public sermons. While the warlords of China shout and break their men, Zhang Tianran will calmly dictate the future of China as told to him through spirit writing. Through Zhang Tianran, Wujimu, Sun Yat-sen and the Buddha speak."

 SQI_destroy_the_drug_trade: "Destroy the Drug Trade"
 SQI_destroy_the_drug_trade_desc: "The generations of pain China is crawling out of are threatened by vicious seeds of Opium. Opium is not a medicine but a poison upon Chinese people, and something the noble Boxers and Sun Yat-sen sought to end. Zhang Tianran has organised a list of known drug dealers, and is relying on citizens to uproot them."

 SQI_back_to_the_basics: "Back to the Basics"
 SQI_back_to_the_basics_desc: "The whole bureaucracy of Jinan is rotten with blind faith in warlords. The Shandong independence council, Zhang Zongchang's Governor's office, and the corrupt importation office must all be condemned. From their failure, the Yiguandao will establish Managers and Teachers to oversee civil governance. "

 SQI_absorb_the_guiyidao: "Absorb the Guiyidao"
 SQI_absorb_the_guiyidao_desc: "The Guiyidao's innovative ability to connect pious men from outside China to our cause of salvation is commendable. It is with great regret that they have abandoned Shandong for Beijing and Tianjin. No matter. Their offices are prime locations for Managers to distribute charity."

 SQI_benevolence_and_morality: "Benevolence and Morality"
 SQI_benevolence_and_morality_desc: "The destruction Zhang Zongchang has wreaked on Shandong is apparent. The opium trade and corruption run rampant, infiltrating every level of society, with government officials being little more than Zhang's hired bandits. Now that Qu Yingguang has returned to power in the province, with the Society for Restoring Benevolence at his side and Central Government funding in his pocket, Shandong will be cleansed of its ailments and be restored to order."

 SQI_return_to_the_source: "Return to the Source"
 SQI_return_to_the_source_desc: "Now that the two Zhangs have been eliminated, Shandong can now return to the source of legitimacy in China, Beijing. Our mutual interest in seeing China freed of foreign influence will be fulfilled, and the cultural institutions of Shandong will be preserved. "

 SQI_story_of_a_bastard: "Story of a Bastard"
 SQI_story_of_a_bastard_desc: "The crowds that laughed at him when he rode into Jinan in a coffin are now in wooden boxes themselves. Governor Zhang Zongchang announced to his soldiers that they are all bastards like he is. They are also the biggest and most virile bastards in China. Shandong's destiny is to outplay the big dogs and keep The Dogmeat General alive at all costs."

 SQI_honoured_teacher_lu_zhongjie: "Honoured Teacher Lu Zhongjie"
 SQI_honoured_teacher_lu_zhongjie_desc: "The most important lesson Zhang Zongchang took from Taishan is that the people of Shandong have flocked to religion as their disillusionment with him increases. In order to cut them off at the pass, Zhang has invited the grateful Lu Zhongjie to resume her position as Honoured Teacher of the Yiguandao, and to stay out of politics."

 SQI_besiege_mount_taishan: "Besiege Mount Taishan"
 SQI_besiege_mount_taishan_desc: "The Yiguandao still persist up on Mount Taishan, and our generals have devised a careful plan of attack to finally rid Shandong of their influence. We must act quickly to ensure the Yiguandao threat is ended, once and for all."

 SQI_bolster_the_drug_trade: "Bolster the Drug Trade"
 SQI_bolster_the_drug_trade_desc: "The looming threat of discovery that Qu Yingguang and Zhang Tianran held over our head is over. Once we eliminate the remaining nannies that try and disrupt the drug trade, we can enjoy that freedom the monarchists and philosophers disparage."

 SQI_shandong_model_province: "Shandong, Model Province"
 SQI_shandong_model_province_desc: "The idea of model governance is not what kept Shandong independent, but soon it may be the only argument in favour of autonomy. The civil servants in Shandong are implored to distribute positive assessments of the province, as well as ensure that foreign visitors do not venture too far from the cities."

### Army ###
 SQI_reaffirm_the_northeast_army: "Reaffirm The Northeast Army"
 SQI_reaffirm_the_northeast_army_desc: "The Northeast Army was decamped at Shandong, and was declared by most observers to be defunct. Despite our best efforts, the foreign observers are largely correct. Many veterans of Fengtian's force are in hiding, and need to be called in from the reserve to fight. The old banners of Shandong should be brought out to call all capable men to our army."

 SQI_an_army_of_professionals: "An Army of Professionals"
 SQI_an_army_of_professionals_desc: "Past experience with recruits deserting and disobedience indicates that we should focus on training professional soldiers. Having to draw from a more mature selection of soldiers, providing them with proper training, and given specific orders to retreat will ensure our soldiers last longer in a protracted war."

 SQI_replace_outdated_weapons: "Replace Outdated Weapons"

 SQI_train_with_northern_cavalry: "Train with Northern Cavalry"
 SQI_train_with_northern_cavalry_desc: "The mercenary cavalry that came to Shandong with Zhang Zongchang are now awaiting either their cue to leave or to fight. Some of them have had experience in the North foraging and outrunning larger patrols. These lessons would be great if applied to our battle plans."

 SQI_improve_rail_supply_lines: "Improve Rail Supply Chains"
 SQI_improve_rail_supply_lines_desc: "The railroad through Shandong was essential for Zhang during his service to Fengtian. Now his lessons can be applied to future campaigns, with additional improvements. Having some rail cars carry food, and others with spare parts will reduce breakdowns."

 SQI_an_army_of_fanatics: "An Army of Fanatics"
 SQI_an_army_of_fanatics_desc: "Past experience with recruits displaying more bravery than their superiors and death defying manoeuvres indicates that we should focus on training fanatic soldiers.

 SQI_request_weapons_from_followers: "Request Weapons From Followers"
 SQI_request_weapons_from_followers_desc: "The people of Shandong have been building personal defence weapons for years in fear of Zhang Zongchang. Now that he is gone, our administration can request these potential patriots donate their arms to the national salvation."

 SQI_learn_from_the_chahar_horsemen_desc: "Chahar horsemen played their part in helping poor folks of northern Shandong resist Zhang Zongchang's tax collectors. It is now time to pay back the favour. Chahar Cavalrymen living in Shandong have been pardoned of any banditry they may have committed, and are implored to join the army and assist in national salvation. "

 SQI_fight_for_the_master: "Fight for the Master"
 SQI_fight_for_the_master_desc: "Soldiers no longer respond to warlords orders en masse. It takes a competent and proven leader, a Master, to muster bravery in these cautious times. A command centre lead by a civil and military administration can ensure objectives can be completed using all of Shandong's faculties."

 SQI_modernise_officer_portfolios: "Modernise Officer Portfolios"
 SQI_modernise_officer_portfolios_desc: "The younger generation of soldiers lack the opportunity to attend military academies abroad, due to our lack of legitimacy. We must take an account of our options for foreign military schooling and press all our favours in that direction."

 SQI_novel_military_projects: "Novel Military Projects"

 SQI_modern_military_research: "Modern Military Research"
 SQI_modern_military_research_desc: "The younger generation of students lack the opportunity to attend military academies abroad, due to our lack of legitimacy. Our administration can spend some capital to gather teachers from Qingdao and Tianjin, and assemble a military research plan."

### Industry ###
 SQI_revive_shandongs_industry: "Revive Shandong's Industry"
 SQI_revive_shandongs_industry_desc: "While Shandong was not under the inept administration of the League of Eight, the previous few years have seen many small factories close their doors. The administration has dedicated itself to assessing the empty factory lots for potential loans to open new businesses in Shandong."

 SQI_reopen_mothballed_factories: "Reopen Mothballed Factories"
 SQI_reopen_mothballed_factories_desc: "Zhang Zongchang's attempt to play the Shandong Mining Cartel against the Luda mining company resulted in several factories in Shandong being closed when the cartel and distribution centres could not reconcile. It is time we push through reconciliation and reopen the centres for business."

 SQI_repair_the_jinan_qingdao_railway: "Repair the Jinan-Qingdao Railway"
 SQI_repair_the_jinan_qingdao_railway_desc: "The Jinan-Qingdao Railway has been worn out through overuse and poor construction methods when tracks were laid in the 1910s. Some sort of mutually beneficial arrangement can be made with the German authorities where they supply steel for repairing the railway, and we supply the corvée labour."

 SQI_mineral_rights_leases: "Mineral Rights Leases"
 SQI_mineral_rights_leases_desc: "In the intervening years since the standstill on coal, more speculators have revealed mineral deposits in Shandong. Our administration is now competent enough to handle leasing mineral rights to Chinese companies. We can predict better profit and no tricks this time."

 SQI_empower_the_shandong_mining_cartel: "Empower the Shandong Mining Cartel"
 SQI_empower_the_shandong_mining_cartel_desc: "The Shandong Mining Cartel was formed in 1928 with secret endorsement by Zhang Zongchang. Their goal is to organise Chinese labour to ensure foreign companies do not get a cost advantage over domestic competition. This goal, if done in secret with our administration's help, can enrich everyone besides the foreigners."

 SQI_shandong_university: "Shandong University"
 SQI_shandong_university_desc: "Shandong University has been closed since the end of the Weltkrieg, having remained within German Qingdao. In this void there is only Shandong Agricultural University in Tai'an, which is ill suited to military science. The administration has struck a deal with Qingdao to let Shandong students attend Shandong University so long as we reopen it."

 SQI_improve_roads_to_beijing: "Improve Roads to Beijing"
 SQI_improve_roads_to_beijing_desc: "The roads to Beijing have proven more useful as the Bohai Bay is disputed between [QIE.GetNameDef] and Fengtian. Especially with the free trade zone in Tianjin attracting commerce. The road to Beijing within Shandong is now being repaired under our administration's supervision."

 SQI_court_northern_elites: "Court Northern Elites"
 SQI_court_northern_elites_desc: "The Beijing government is ejecting otherwise fine residents for petty political issues, and their loss is our windfall. The administration has authorised we spruce up several estates around Shandong and make Northern elites an offer to take up residency. This will improve our claims of autonomy, or at worst case make for good hostages."

 SQI_purchase_factories_in_tianjin: "Buy Factories in Tianjin"
 SQI_purchase_factories_in_tianjin_desc: "The recent economic turmoil around the world has left real estate fairly affordable in Tianjin. It is in the administration's interest to purchase some of the money struck factories in Tianjin for our military industry. This location will also enable us to better assess the situation of China through a neutral port."

### Reclaiming Industry ###

 SQI_reclaim_despoiled_industry_desc: "After years of unsystematic disregard by the Zhili governors, [SQI.GetLeader] has arrived with a promise to reinvigorate the southern provinces. This initial promise has come with it a bounty to Governors should they defect to this new scheme."

 SQI_victory_in_the_south: "Victory in the South"
 SQI_victory_in_the_south_desc: "With the vast ruined expanse of the Yangtze River Valley now open to [SQI.GetLeader], it is time to hear the needs of the millions of refugees whose homes are now within reach. These grateful citizens will be easily plied to assist in industrialising the region towards our goal of national defence."

 SQI_develop_the_coastline: "Develop the Coastline"
 SQI_develop_the_coastline_desc: "The Northern Yangtze region coastline has become a minefield of competing interests, even after the AOG was unseated. It will take the greatest effort of our administration to effectively reestablish sea traffic, but the reward will be great."

 SQI_develop_anqing: "Develop Anqing"
 SQI_develop_anqing_desc: "Anqing, the capital of the oldest of the upper Yangtze cliques, has been abused for far too long by its stewards. It is time for the people of Anqing and Anhui to be given the economic opportunities their narcissistic leaders have denied them."

 SQI_complete_the_jinan_nanjing_railway_desc: "When the millions pushed and jostled down dirt roads from Jiangsu to Shandong, they lamented the lack of a rail line. With the dangers of travelling by the coast still present, and enough capital from the newly liberated provinces, we should be able to expedite a small gauge railway between these cities."

 SQI_dayu_tungsten_mines: "Dayu Tungsten Mines"
 SQI_dayu_tungsten_mines_desc: "It has long been known there are large quantities of tungsten in Dayu, which is located close to Ganzhou in Gannan, Jiangxi.

 SQI_connect_fujians_communities: "Connect Fujian's Communities"
 SQI_connect_fujians_communities_desc: "Fujian is a home to numerous refugees and a traditional community that did not appreciate occupiers. It is our hope that our administration will be able to earn their loyalty through work projects in their province."

 SQI_rebuild_northern_zhejiang: "Rebuild Northern Zhejiang"
 SQI_rebuild_northern_zhejiang_desc: "Northern Zhejiang was partially destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion, an event no leader in China wishes to bear responsibility for. Until our administration came along, that is. The people of Northern Zhejiang, with a few condolences and infrastructure works, could very possibly join our cause and rejoice in our future victories."

### Navy ###
 SQI_rebuild_the_beiyang_fleet: "Rebuild the Beiyang Fleet"
 SQI_rebuild_the_beiyang_fleet_desc: "Shandong used to be home to the Beiyang Fleet, the pride of the old Qing Empire. Although the Germans have reduced us to smaller capacity ports, we will return. The fleet that owned the Bohai Sea will live again, and Shandong will be at the front of it."

 SQI_modernise_naval_bases_desc: "The naval base of Yantai is not sufficient for supplying our soldiers should they lose land connection to Shandong. A larger naval base may be necessary, and it is within this administration's ability to acquire such a naval base."

 SQI_purchase_convoys: "Purchase Convoys"
 SQI_purchase_convoys_desc: "If we are to draw trade from the contentious Bohai Sea, and survive the submarines, we must invest in more convoys. It is most prudent to acquire them secondhand from old merchant ships."

 SQI_obtain_submarine_designs: "Obtain Submarine Designs"
 SQI_obtain_submarine_designs_desc: "If we are to wrest control of the Bohai Sea from our rivals, we must outwit their superior firepower at sea. The solution is a secretive submarine programme. The potential returns if we are able to dislodge this sea outweighs the cost of development."

 SQI_incorporate_qingdao_and_weihaiwei: "Incorporate Qingdao and Weihaiwei"
 SQI_incorporate_qingdao_and_weihaiwei_desc: "It is time for us to assume the true home of the Beiyang Fleet, Qingdao. Our grand return will precipitate a revitalisation of Chinese naval industry in Shandong."

 SQI_experimental_fighters: "Experimental Fighters"
 SQI_experimental_fighters_desc: "With costs so high to develop fighter planes, our technicians have devoted their effort towards cutting corners and sacrificing safety in the name of getting as many planes in the air as possible.

 SQI_expand_the_jinan_airstrip_desc: "The airstrip in Jinan is inadequate to handle the volume of flights our military has planned in the upcoming years. We have plotted out a larger airport to take our bold measures further and outwit the other warlords."

 SQI_planes_over_the_bohai_sea: "Planes over Bohai"
 SQI_planes_over_the_bohai_sea_desc: "Being able to project power over the Bohai Sea will enable us to assist the navy in securing the sea from our rivals. Specially designed naval aircraft will also be able to handle targets at sea much better than land targets."

 SQI_airspace_protection: "Airspace Protection"
 SQI_airspace_protection_desc: "Escorting our fighters and infantry is a growing trend in the newsreels of wars abroad. It may be worth the effort to invest in anti-air defences to complement our army."

 shandong.2.t: "Lu Zhongjie Arrives to Jinan"
 shandong.2.d: "This day brings to Zhang Zongchang another opportunity to humiliate the old man on the mountain, Zhang Tianran. In order to establish his little cult on the hill, Zhang Tianran had to expel the sister of his former master, Lu Zhongyi. The sister, Lu Zhongjie, has become a rather concise rebuttal to the numerous Yiguandao well-wishers Zhang Zongchang has had to deal with in recent months. This is why she must return to Shandong, if only as a joke. To enhance the shock value, Zhang has brought his old mother to this welcoming ceremony, which has swelled from the intended group into a sizeable crowd. Zhang Zongchang, in an attempt to enhance the humiliation Zhang Tianran should feel, has given the elderly Lu Zhongjie a bouquet and a traditional twenty-one gun salute was fired into a nearby apartment building in celebration of Lu Zhongjie's arrival."
 shandong.2.a: "Bullets have to go somewhere"

 shandong.970.t: "Zhang Zongchang's festivities escalate through Jinan"
 shandong.970.d: "After that rouse of fun and violence, Zhang dropped his mother off with Lu Zhongjie and has decided to celebrate a night on the town. Zhang stops occasionally to distribute 'Minsheng' to refugees from Jiangsu. Another encounter that day were Yiguandao protestors at Zhang Zongchang's business office. Their daily empty promises have been replaced by outrage over Lu Zhongjie's return to Shandong. Before Zhang attempted to hit them with his car, they claimed that Zhang Tianran would arrive to judge Zhang Zongchang's very soul. The only thing that soured the evening was finding out that his opium dealer is still in hiding. This no doubt is caused by interloping Ren Ci who have foiled otherwise fun evenings in Jinan with their morality in the past. The adventure ended with a visit to Zhang's favourite brothel, where several women joined his entourage on the way home that evening to do drugs. As the day comes to an end, one of these ladies has gone missing with some opium, Zhang Zongchang asks his officers not to go after her, for there is still plenty more ladies and capsules of opium for the night."
 shandong.970.a: "Her loss then"

 shandong.3.t: "A spy for Qu Yingguang is captured"
 shandong.3.d: "After a night of hard drugs and soft women in Jinan, Zhang was revelling in himself the next morning when he saw a stranger in his backyard. Alerting his wives, and then his guards, Zongchang apprehended the intruder. After Sun Dianying's own special words with the man, it was revealed that he was an ally of Qu Yingguang, and had come after a sex worker had alerted him to drugs on the property. Dianying believes that this intruder is the vanguard of a rebellion Qu is planning out of Qufu. A fear Dianying has stoked for several months since his income from taxation was cut off by Qu's militia. Commander Junnosuke Date, on the other hand, insists to the hungover Zhang Zongchang that Qu Yingguang is planning to alert [QIE.GetNameDef] instead. Junnosuke insists that their forces be diverted to Dezhou to stop Qu Yingguang from escaping. Barely able to recall the night before, Zhang decides to..."
 shandong.3.a: "Block the roads, Qu Yingguang must be leaving"
 shandong.3.b: "Send men to Qu Yingguang's house"

 shandong.971.t: "Junnosuke Date attacks Qu Yingguang at Dezhou"
 shandong.971.d: "Junnosuke Date's forces arrived at Dezhou to strong public distaste, stronger revulsion than usual. It was immediately apparent that the town has been turned over to the Ren Ci and Qu Yingguang. Junnosuke sent his cavalry into Dezhou to search out Qu Yingguang, with the looming and dangerous prospect of a possible raid into [QIE.GetNameDef]. Qu was found near the Haido Jinshan temple, paying respects to his ancestors. Junnosuke's soldiers seized Qu Yingguang, and a skirmish began between his Ren Ci militiamen and the cavalry. Fortunately Junnosuke brought enough firepower to eliminate the militia and Qu Yingguang in the process. Unfortunately, the abundance of witnesses in Dezhou required a lot more fighting to silence. At the end of the battle, the Haido Jinshan temple was in flames, and Junnosuke was retreating back towards Jinan trying his best to think up an alibi."
 shandong.971.a: "That was a Boxer temple, nobody will care"

 shandong.972.t: "Sun Dianying fails to find Qu Yingguang at Qufu"
 shandong.972.d: "The soldiers sent to Qufu found what they wanted, but not what they needed. After threats of violence were given by Dianying, and several quarters burned, the occupants of Qufu fled as Dianying began searching for Qu Yingguang. While there was abundant evidence that the Ren Ci had used the manor, neither Qu nor the Duke Yansheng were to be found. Zhang Zongchang waited several days for a response from Dianying, and received Dianying's most humble apologies and gifts from Confucian manor. These gifts did little to sate Zhang's anger, who immediately set out with the Japanese cavalry to Dezhou, furious that Junnosuke's advice was not taken. Zhang Zongchang's arrival in Dezhou failed to find Qu Yingguang, not even evidence of him being there. Faced with the dangerous prospect of sending a raid into [QIE.GetNameDef] on the hunch of Junnosuke Date, Zhang decided the investigation was over, and returned to Jinan to continue his harassment campaign on the Yiguandao."
 shandong.972.a: "At least I got some gifts out of this"

 shandong.4.t: "Zhang Zongchang sends an alibi to [QIE.GetNameDef]"
 shandong.4.d: "Several books of poetry, and a commentary on the classics has proven to be very helpful to Zhang Zongchang at this moment. Letters that used to contain embarrassing misspellings and poor stroke order are now refined in a golden alibi Zhang Zongchang has sent to [QIE.GetNameDef]. This alibi intends to answer what caused such a panic in Dezhou recently, and why this issue should not bother Puyi or Wu Peifu in the least. The letter paints the picture of a province filled with bandits and conmen. This environment, explains the letter, leads to unfounded rumours of moral decay in Shandong, which is certainly exaggerations by conmen like Zhang Tianran. Furthermore, the letter adds that Zhang had found and eliminated a cell of KMT holdouts in Shandong, and there is no reason to be concerned about traitors to the emperor, no matter what they may claim."
 shandong.4.a: "Nothing to see here, move along"

 shandong.5.t: "Qing Magistrates Arrest Zhang Zongchang"
 shandong.5.d: "Sun Dianying was a fool. While he was burning and looting Qu Yingguang's manor, the man himself was already halfway to Beijing. Despite Dianying's excuses and efforts to uncover the plotters in Shandong, it left Jinan vulnerable to a large contingent of [QIE.GetAdjective] infantry that entered Jinan. Even worse, Zhang Zongchang had no way of knowing the [QIE.GetAdjective] soldiers were there to arrest him. A written letter by Zhang from prison to the Emperor asking him to allow family visitation has been rejected. Zhang Zongchang now has a forth Unknown, unknown when he will be released from prison for his numerous crimes. The other day, one of the many children of Zhang Zongchang approached Qu Yingguang, asking him if his father will survive his imprisonment."
 shandong.5.a: "Your daddy will be fine in prison"

 shandong.6.t: "Mount Tai Outraged at Zhang Zongchang"
 shandong.6.d: "It did not take long for the teacher Zhang Tianran to find out about Lu Zhongjie. The initial reaction being delivered in a request to return to Mount Tai for more treatment of his long-gone illness. These letters were ignored by Zhang Zongchang, wishing to further annoy the teacher on the mountain and to humiliate him by publicly reading the letters. Finally the last letter delivered today took on a much darker tone. The letter addressed the people of Jinan, and accused Zhang Zongchang of smuggling opium into China, betraying Chinese for Western gambling partners, and of trying to take Lu Zhongjie as a wife. Zhang Tianran has challenged Zhang Zongchang to come to Mount Tai to receive his eternal judgement, or else the people of Shandong will wither and die to punish their leader. Sun Dianying recommends confronting and purifying Mount Tai of its residents, while another commander, Zhang Jingyao, recommends waiting the teacher out."
 shandong.6.a: "Come, let's confront these ascetics"
 shandong.6.b: "I'll wait for his desperate letters"

 shandong.7.t: "Zhang Tianran Passes Judgement on Zhang Zongchang"
 shandong.7.d: "Zhang Zongchang's contingent arrived at the gates of the Dai Miao, already his soles tired of the 6600 steps. Dianying suggested they conceal their guns, and open fire when they are let in. As Zhong Zongchang passed under the Zhengyang Gate, he was fatally shot by a sharpshooter from atop the gate. Dianying attempted to charge the courtyard with whatever men he had, but Jingyao had fled with the soldiers guarding his rear. Dianying was also fatally shot, and the current whereabouts of Zhang Jingyao is unknown. The honoured teacher Zhang Tianran was received in Jinan with an early New Years celebration, and read his final letter to Zhang Zongchang to a cheering crowd."
 shandong.7.a: "I declare this a Red Letter Day!"

 shandong.8.t: "Zhang Zongchang Saves Jinan from Yiguandao Raid"
 shandong.8.d: "The following weeks in Jinan have shown how far Zhang Tianran's influence has spread. Members of the public have defaced Zhang Zongchang's office, and several former friends have written to him asking to prostrate himself before the Yiguandao. In return, Zhang Zongchang has told his commanders to man the walls of Jinan, extort and search all suspected Yiguandao members they come across, and deliver anything suspicious to him. Several of the items confiscated included poison labelled as medicine, small arms, and curses against Zhang Zongchang. Today Zhang Zongchang was delivering another reading of Zhang Tianran's letter, along with a dissertation into the evils of the Yiguandao, when a mob of them entered the city. Zhang Zongchang's soldiers quickly engaged the cultists that were carrying guns, and Japanese cavalry chased the rest out. Zhang Tianran, while attempting to hide his shining head, was caught and shot by the cavalry."
 shandong.8.a: "Finally the public sees my truth"

### Focus tree related events ###
 shandong.9.t: "Yiguandao and Peasants Riot"
 shandong.9.d: "After news of Zhang Tianran's murder during the attack on Jinan, thousands of mourners have descended upon the city to search for the Honoured Teacher's remains. When rumour spread that Zhang Zongchang had Zhang Tianran along with all of the Yiguandao fighters buried dishonourably in a mass grave, panic spread across Shandong. The remaining Yiguandao across Shandong have begun to aggressively attack policemen and landlords throughout the province. Townspeople, fearing both the fanatic and the now-demonised Zhang Clique, have begun to shield themselves from the outside world. They will not respond to any governing authority, and must be dealt with."
 shandong.9.a: "Kill two bald men and everyone goes crazy!"

 shandong.1000.t: "A Strike Against Nanjing"
 shandong.1000.d: "The death of Sun has thrown Eastern China into chaos. Fires, looting, and banditry will become the norm throughout the region, but at the same time, it provides a golden opportunity. The Zhili hegemony is over, a power vacuum is fast growing in China, and if we can seize our chance and take control of Nanjing, we'll be assured to play a major role in the coming struggles over China's future. Top advisors have advised us to march south towards the old capital and secure our place as one of China's big players."
 shandong.1000.a: "Nanjing will be ours!"
 shandong.1000.b: "We should wait and see..."

 shandong.10.t: "Sending Young Officers into School"
 shandong.10.d: "Shandong lacks the proper facilities to train officers in modern warfare. This issue speaks directly to the commanders in Shandong, as they were trained in schools in the north and south. It is well known that the prestige of the school you attend is as important as the training at the school. Therefore we must attempt to send young officers-in-training abroad. Whichever school they will attend will also leave an indelible effect on their loyalty, of course."
 shandong.10.a: "Apply to Japanese Military Academies"
 shandong.10.b: "Apply to German Military Academies"
 shandong.10.c: "Apply to Western Military Academies"

 shandong.11.t: "Military Projects in Shandong"
 shandong.11.d: "It is already becoming apparent that Shandong's army is behind the times. While we have spent our efforts trying to raise the standard of our military equipment, we have not dared to venture outside what we can purchase. The Army Command has convinced [SQI.GetLeader] to put some resources into projects recently made by a Czech resident of Shandong, Hanchtedelay. Hanchtedelay has ambitions to transform several Studebaker cars that he owns into crude tanks. A second plan is to purchase Flying Pigeon bicycles from Tianjin and train a division to use them. A third plan proposed by a professor at Jinan University is to purchase climbing equipment and focus culinary efforts towards enabling soldiers to survive China's numerous mountain ranges."
 shandong.11.a: "Construct a tank"
 shandong.11.b: "Develop bicycle units"
 shandong.11.c: "Train mountaineer soldiers"

 shandong.12.t: "Investigate missing shipments"
 shandong.12.d: "For the past few months, vital commerce is being disrupted along the Qingdao-Jinan railway. An ongoing police investigation has only determined that it is not the train line employees, and no other possibilities have been ruled out yet. [SQI.GetLeader] has been called in to supervise the investigation before it becomes a major scandal in Jinan. The police, ever cautious of the Chinese border guards outside of Qingdao, have suggested we investigate the railway relay stations first. [SQI.GetLeader], on the other hand, is of the suspicion that the items are being stolen along the deserted stretches of countryside between Qingdao and Jinan. Which should we investigate first?"
 shandong.12.a: "Investigate the Railway"
 shandong.12.b: "Investigate the Border"

 shandong.13.t: "Evidence of Banditry on Railway?"
 shandong.13.d: "[SQI.GetLeader]'s hunch was correct. Police dispatched to survey the railroad's more deserted stretches have found suspicion constructions hidden under some brush. These constructs appear to be a cushion and luggage straps. There is no doubt that whomever has been stealing from the rail lines has been throwing their hauls off the train, where it is moved to a second location. The police chief is adamant that bandits must be responsible, and requests some backup in order probe the dens of Eastern Shandong for their hideout."
 shandong.13.a: "Yes, take these men"

 shandong.14.t: "Evidence of bribery at border stations"
 shandong.14.d: "The police were right, the border station was certainly suspicious. Upon initial inspection, the small shack that houses the border guards could barely fit five occupants. Upon inspecting the floor of the shack, however, a large empty alcove was discovered. There being no logical use for such a large empty space below the shack, the police chief has decided to arrest the attending border guards. Although there is some risk that this will anger our sellers in Qingdao, law and justice are on our side."
 shandong.14.a: "Interrogate the station guards"

 shandong.15.t: "Besieging the Bandits"
 shandong.15.d: "Following a dirt road, several soldiers have come upon an active militia encampment. Fortunately these brave men were able to alert the police chief, who has the grace of [SQI.GetLeader] to besiege the bandits on suspicion of theft. Calling [SQI.GetLeader] himself, the chief's siege has resulted in some deaths, and an offer arrives in the morning from the bandits. They request their freedom in exchange for all their goods, stolen and owned, so long as they can leave with their weapons and their lives."
 shandong.15.a: "Money means nothing to us, perish!"
 shandong.15.b: "Surrender saves lives, we agree"
 SQI_bandits_surrender: "The bandits surrender peacefully"
 SQI_bandits_escape: "The bandits send a decoy and escape"

 shandong.800.t: "Bounce Event"
 shandong.800.d: "This is a bounce event, you should not be seeing this. If you do in normal gameplay and are not running any submods, please report the issue."

 shandong.16.t: "Border guards arrested, confess to smuggling"
 shandong.16.d: "The border guards quickly break down under interrogation, proclaiming that poverty has driven them into a scheme where one of them stalls trains coming from Qingdao, while the other steals items from the carts. These guards have begged for prison over execution, and have offered all their remaining loot as collateral. [SQI.GetLeader] has ultimately decided to continue with execution, seeing as the Jinan jails are already too crowded as is."
 shandong.16.a: "Justice is fair, above all else."

 shandong.17.t: "Our Railway Is Secured"
 shandong.17.d: "When news reached the corners of Shandong that [SQI.GetLeader] had uncovered the railway thieves, many people did not believe it. They being so used to corrupt and ignorant governance coming out of Jinan, that a step in the right direction has renewed hope in the government. Traffic along the railway has also increased, proof that our actions did not disrupt the machinations in Qingdao."
 shandong.17.a: "Now we can improve the rails."

 shandong.18.t: "Bandits send Decoy, Escape to Hebei"
 shandong.18.d: "A gaurish display came out of the bandit encampment. Through binoculars, [SQI.GetLeader] saw bandits indicate they were ready to surrender, several of the bandits began entering their hold, and exiting with goods in trunks. Finally, in astonishment, several bandits exited the hold and removed their clothing. These bandits then dropped their weapons, and began to haul the trunks towards our offensive line. In shock, [SQI.GetLeader] ordered his line to hold heir fire, and let these apparently insane bandits pass. Soldiers were in such an uproar of laughter humiliating these bandits, that nobody noticed that another contingent of bandits had slipped through the woods until the whole display was over. A scramble over this ruse resulted in the death of the nude bandits, but it appears the other group has escaped Eastern Shandong."
 shandong.18.a: "We are screwed, people"

 shandong.19.t: "Bandits captured in Hebei, claim Zhang Zongchang is smuggling drugs"
 shandong.19.d: "Out of Shandong came several ragged men recently. These nameless refugees claim to be farmers, but their scars indicate either military service or banditry. These men were detained in Hebei, where they produced evidence of [SQI.GetLeader] being involved in the drug trade. This claim moved rapidly to Beijing, where our investigators have verified the evidence as genuine. Opium and other drugs are often seen as responsible for the collapse of traditional Chinese morality over the past century, and therefore a major cause of its continuous humiliation at the hands of foreign powers. As we are the national government, with a reputation to uphold, this is a very serious matter indeed. Should we dismiss the claims of these bandits, or should we ready a military intervention to restore law in Shandong? Most experts agree that [SQI.GetLeader] cannot be retired without the total subordination of the clique."
 shandong.19.a: "Drug stabbing time."
 shandong.19.b: "These bandits cannot be trusted."

 shandong.20.t: "Yiguandao Seeks Modern Weaponry"
 shandong.20.d: "Word has reached the capital of scattered attempts by members of the Red Spears and Big Swords, peasant armies supporting Zhang Tianran's Yiguandao movement in Shandong, to purchase large quantities of weapons from local magistrates. The money and other supplies offered in return are a pittance, but some local authorities have defended their sales so far by pointing out that arming these religious fanatics might weaken our shared enemies. We could issue a covert order permitting further sales of weapons to [SQI.GetNameDef], or crack down on them completely."
 shandong.20.a: "Enemies of our enemies are our friends."
 shandong.20.b: "We cannot support these militant zealots."

 shandong.22.t: "Divisions Completes Japanese Cavalry Training"
 shandong.22.d: "The Japanese soldiers we invited have finished training our cavalry corps. Their professionalism will hopefully set an example for the rest of our army, where success in battle is less important than the pay. Some in our ranks are still wary of trusting the Japanese for military assistance, but to their credit they haven't betrayed us yet."
 shandong.22.a: "The Samurai rode horses, once."

 shandong.23.t: "Divisions Completes Chahar Cavalry Training"
 shandong.23.d: "The Chahar soldiers who visited Shandong have finished training our new cavalry corps. Zhang Tianran was especially pleased with the devotion that these new divisions display. An impromptu speech by Zhang revealed he could recite long tracts of Water Margin from memory, and he asked that they too receive enlightenment as Lu Zhishen did before his death."
 shandong.23.a: "When you see the faithful, enter silence."

 shandong.24.t: "Shandong Requests Cadet Training"
 shandong.24.d: "[SQI.GetLeader], governor of Shandong, has sent a formal request that we induct his young cadets into our prestigious military academies. Although we have certainly accepted Chinese students in the past, and many now serve across China, they have usually served in the army of a recognised national government. [SQI.GetLeader], a mere provincial governor, blatantly fails to meet these standards.\n\nHowever, if we accept, the payment for our services may be considerable."
 shandong.24.a: "Accept them."
 shandong.24.b: "Absolutely not."

 shandong.993.t: "Japan Agrees to Train our officers"
 shandong.993.d: "Japan has agreed to open several of their most prestigious military academies to our cadets, including the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō. Their training will be second to none, and this should go a ways toward securing us additional respect in the eyes of other Chinese - albeit only those indifferent to Japanese influence."
 shandong.993.a: "Wonderful."

 shandong.994.t: "Japan Refuses to Train Our Officers"
 shandong.994.d: "Labeling [ROOT.GetLeader] a 'bohemian' and a 'mere provincial governor', Japanese authorities have unfortunately refused to train our young cadets."
 shandong.994.a: "We always have Germany"

 shandong.25.t: "Shandong Requests Cadet Training"
 shandong.25.d: "[SQI.GetLeader], governor of the Chinese Shandong Province, has sent a formal request that we induct his young cadets into our prestigious military academies. Although we have certainly accepted foreign students in the past, they have usually served in the army of a recognised national government. [SQI.GetLeader], a notorious criminal and mere provincial governor, blatantly fails to meet these standards.\n\nHowever, if we accept, the payment for our services may be considerable."
 shandong.25.a: "Accept them."
 shandong.25.b: "We aren't a charity."

 shandong.995.t: "Germany Agrees to Train Our Officers"
 shandong.995.d: "Germany has agreed to open several of their most prestigious military academies to our cadets, including the Prussian Staff College. Their training will be second to none, and this should go a ways toward securing us additional respect in the eyes of other Chinese - albeit only those indifferent to German influence."
 shandong.995.a: "Wonderful"

 shandong.26.t: "Shandong Requests Cadet Training"
 shandong.26.d: "[SQI.GetLeader], governor of Shandong, has sent a formal request that we send a number of Weltkrieg Veterans to assist in the training of his troops. It is certainly true that the French surrender in 1919, and the British collapse in 1925, left the international settlements with a surplus of exiled war veterans, many of whom have since taken to policing or mercenary work. Nonetheless, [SQI.GetLeader] is a mere warlord with a great deal of blood on his hands, and Zhang Zongchang's sweep through Shanghai in 1925 left him with a monstrous reputation in local circles. We could accept the deal, but there are also risks to consider."
 shandong.26.a: "Accept the deal."
 shandong.26.b: "This is too dangerous."

 shandong.27.t: "Mineral Rights in Shandong"
 shandong.27.d: "Ever since Qu Tongfeng's debacle with the Anhui Clique a decade ago, there has been a lot of caution whether or not to sell mineral rights to foreign enterprises. There have not been a lack of opportunities to profit, but the fear of appearing uncouth or traitorous has stopped any resolution as of yet. At long last Shandong is stable enough, and the offers are more attractive than ever. The options are the Japanese Luda company, who has already gained access to Weihai through negotiations. Krupp, whom already wield significant political clout in Qingdao. And finally Peabody Energy, who offer stock options unavailable to Chinese citizens."
 shandong.27.d1: "Ever since Qu Tongfeng's debacle with the Anhui Clique a decade ago, there has been a lot of caution whether or not to sell mineral rights to foreign enterprises. There have not been a lack of opportunities to profit, but the fear of appearing uncouth or traitorous has stopped any resolution as of yet. Now, we have been pressured by our benefactors to accept the offer from the Japanese Luda company."

There are numerous families in Jiangsu, Anhui and beyond that are being split apart by the League War. Thousands who could not cross the battlefield and are now stuck. The committee proposes breaking [SQI.GetLeader]'s neutrality policy with a volunteer group for the purposes of rescuing families of Shandong residents. This will definitely involve Shandong choosing a side in the conflict, and should these volunteers choose cooperation with the losing side, we can expect increased animosity from the south."

Chen's reputation far outmatches [SQI.GetLeader], and our own reputation works against us. While this should improve our odds against the League, it also means that, because of Fengtian's support, we can't just move against Anqing afterwards."

 shandong.34.d: "Fengtian has notified us that it will no longer seek to involve itself in our dispute with Anqing, citing that it would be impossible to get us to agree. This is unfortunate, as that also means they will not back us in our war against the Anqing Clique, which we must now begin immediately."
 shandong.34.a: "Now is the time to strike."

 shandong.35.t: "Fengtian Talks Break Down"
 shandong.35.d: "The mediation attempted by Fengtian between us and Chen Tiaoyuan's Anqing Clique has failed. We need to move immediately before Chen can respond."
 shandong.35.a: "Now is the time to strike."

 shandong.36.t: "A Deal is Made with Anqing"
 shandong.36.d: "We have successfully struck a deal with the Anqing Clique. This means that we will have time to prepare further moves while they deal with the Kuomintang. It is important to know that this deal is not permanent and we will seek to alter it in our favour if we can."
 shandong.36.a: "A fragile peace."

 shandong.37.t: "Anqing Diplomat Approaches Us"
 shandong.37.d1: "While it seemed like Fengtian's recent proposal was not accepted by both us and Anqing, a lowly Anqing diplomat has found the courage to seek an audience with Zhang Zongchang to discuss the possibility of a peace deal without Fengtian interference. Zhang, who was in an uncharacteristically good mood, heard the diplomat out.\n\nWe currently hold territory deemed extremely critical by Chen Tiaoyuan's Anqing. The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to accept peace if we give up territory outside of Jiangsu. This might not be a bad idea, as this territory is difficult to administrate regardless and doesn't give us many benefits, except making Chen very angry. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."
 shandong.37.d2: "While it seemed like Fengtian's recent proposal was not accepted by both us and Anqing, a lowly Anqing diplomat has found the courage to seek an audience with Zhang Zongchang to discuss the possibility of a peace deal without Fengtian interference. Zhang, who was in an uncharacteristically good mood, heard the diplomat out.\n\nWe currently hold territory only in the northern Jiangsu province. The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to accept peace if we hold on only to these territories we acquired. This might not be a bad idea, as getting anything extra would most likely only result in resistance in this new territory. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."
 shandong.37.d3: "While it seemed like Fengtian's recent proposal was not accepted by both us and Anqing, a lowly Anqing diplomat has found the courage to seek an audience with Zhang Zongchang to discuss the possibility of a peace deal without Fengtian interference. Zhang, who was in an uncharacteristically good mood, heard the diplomat out.\n\nWe were unable to acquire any new territory. The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to cede all of Jiangsu in exchange for peace. This is great news, as Jiangsu is the main territory we are after. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."
 shandong.37.d4: "While it seemed like Fengtian's recent proposal was not accepted by both us and Anqing, a lowly Anqing diplomat has found the courage to seek an audience with Zhang Zongchang to discuss the possibility of a peace deal without Fengtian interference. Zhang, who was in an uncharacteristically good mood, heard the diplomat out.\n\nWe were unable to acquire any new territory. The diplomat said that Anqing was most likely willing to cede Xuhai, the western part of Jiangsu, in exchange for peace. This is great news, as this would be a great step towards further gains. A temporary peace would also allow us time to prepare further actions."
 shandong.37.a: "Let's do it."
 shandong.37.b: "Striking now is better."

 shandong.38.t: "Fengtian Backs Us"
 shandong.38.d: "The conflict with Anqing has escalated and led to war, but thankfully the Fengtian Government has decided to support us and not Chen Tiaoyuan."
 shandong.38.a: "Good."

 shandong.39.t: "Fengtian Backs Anqing"
 shandong.39.d: "The conflict with Anqing has escalated and led to war, but the Fengtian Government has decided to support Chen Tiaoyuan and not us!"
 shandong.39.a: "Bad."

 shandong.40.t: "The Anqing Issue"
 shandong.40.d1: "Now that the Kuomintang have been defeated, it is no longer necessary that we bow to the wishes of Chen Tiaoyuan. Chen sees himself as better than the others for his support of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, but we all know this is just a show. We can no longer afford to be stuck only within Shandong. We must seize control of at least Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong). We will immediately send a telegram to Fengtian to make sure this is achieved."
 shandong.40.d2: "Now that the Kuomintang have been defeated, it is no longer necessary that we bow to the wishes of Chen Tiaoyuan. Chen sees himself as better than the others for his support of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, but we all know this is just a show. While we have taken control of at least parts of Jiangsu Province (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong states), we must now seek to seize the rest! We will immediately send a telegram to Fengtian to make sure this is achieved."
 shandong.40.d3: "Now that the Kuomintang have been defeated, it is no longer necessary that we bow to the wishes of Chen Tiaoyuan. Chen sees himself as better than the others for his support of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, but we all know this is just a show. We control all of Jiangsu Province (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong states), but Anqing’s Chen Tiaoyuan will most definitely not accept this permanently. We will immediately send a telegram to Fengtian to make sure they do not give our territory away to him."
 shandong.40.a: "Let's await their reply."

 shandong.41.t: "Training Mission to Shandong"
 shandong.41.d: "The Shandong Clique is in dire need of additional troops to be able to meet the League. Should we send a large training mission to them? While a victory for them would be an enormous boost to our influence within China, this training mission would constrain our own training abilities for at least a while."
 shandong.41.a: "Let's do it"
 shandong.41.b: "Not worth the cost"

 shandong.42.t: "Fengtian Training Mission"
 shandong.42.d: "The Fengtian Government, in their support of our efforts, has sent a large training mission to us, consisting of Chinese and Japanese drill sergeants and other officers. This should help us set up the large army necessary for a conflict with the League."
 shandong.42.a: "Great news"

 shandong.43.t: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] Sends No Aid"
 shandong.43.d: "Feeling no need to priortise sending aid to Shandong, [QIE.GetNameDef] has denied [SQI.GetLeader]'s request for a regiment of the army to come to Shandong in an attempt to allievate Shandong from the recent riots! Governor [SQI.GetLeader] expresses his deepest dissapointment in [QIE.GetNameDef] for their shortsighted decision, choosing to isolate themselves from Shandong and spare no resources to aid us. It appears as though for now we are on our own."
 shandong.43.a: "Damn them!"

 shandong.100.t: "Engineers Caught Selling Naval Secrets to Shandong"
 shandong.100.d: "The Kenpeitai has uncovered a plot by several naval engineers on the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation who are planning on selling ship designs to Shandong. The Kenpeitai is ready to stop this deal and arrest the pair, but an alternative solution is possible. If the Kenpeitai was to alert the Kawasaki Corporation that they could legally sell ship designs to Shandong, they could arrest the traitors themselves and we can profit off a legal sale. This is a risky proposition, but considering that Shandong is too minor to become a naval rival, the damage to national security by the sale is minimal."
 shandong.100.a: "Alert Kawasaki, allow the sale"
 shandong.100.b: "No, stop this sale immediately!"

 shandong.101.t: "Japanese Engineers Sell Us Designs"
 shandong.101.d: "The clandestine deal went sideways, but the final sale appears to be salvaged. Shortly before the transaction was made, the Kawasaki Corporation alerted us that they have been given permission to sell naval designs to us legally. The engineers we were in contact with are now in prison. This surprising turn of events bodes poorly but is presently satisfactory."
 shandong.101.a: "That was close"

 shandong.102.t: "Japanese Engineers Arrested Before Sale"
 shandong.102.d: "The clandestine deal went sideways, and we have lost contact with the Japanese engineers. It is believed that the engineers were arrested in a major bust at the Kawasaki Corporation, where they were employed. This surprising turn of events bodes poorly and the investment we made towards the designs is lost. "
 shandong.102.a: "We will remember this"

 shandong.996.t: "The Legation Cities Accepts Our Officers"
 shandong.996.d: "The Legation authorities have sent us good news! They will be dispatching a number of French and British Weltkrieg veterans, serving as contractors, to train our young cadets in the ways of warfare. This should go a long way toward improving their practical fighting ability, if not their discipline."
 shandong.996.a: "Wonderful."

 shandong.997.t: "The Legation Cities Rejected Our Offer"
 shandong.997.d: "The Legation authorities have refused to send French and British Weltkrieg veterans to train our troops, due to concerns about how their training might be put to use. Zhang Zongchang's sweep through Shanghai in 1925 earned him quite the monstrous reputation there, which may be to blame."
 shandong.997.a: "Terrible!"

 shandong.988.t: "Experimental tank built"
 shandong.988.d: "Several of our officers, and some of our mechanics, have had the opportunity to bear witness to the German Panzer in action. while many thought us fools for trying it, we have done it. We have created a wholly Chinese made tank! Though parts of it may have been salvaged from captured or destroyed pieces left behind in the League, it is mostly Chinese. With the knowledge of producing armoured vehicles now in our hands, we may yet give our enemies a surprise, to be sure."
 shandong.988.a: "I can't believe that worked"

 shandong.989.t: "European Cyclist Division trained"
 shandong.989.d: "It is a simple fact that we lack the means to produce sufficient vehicles for a truly motorised force, however, the european militaries have paved the way for us to implement a cheaper solution. Our troops must be able to reach the battlefield first, and in good shape, otherwise we will be outmatched. Thus, it is only acceptable that we incorporate the bicycle into our regiments. With this cheap piece of metal, we may yet form a fighting force never before seen in China!"
 shandong.989.a: "AND WE FORGOT THE TINY BELLS?!"

 shandong.990.t: "Grotto-heaven Division trained"
 shandong.990.d: "They do not grasp the deep spiritual link we Chinese have with the land. Our connection to the universe. The foreigners play with their toys of steel and fire, while we have the power of the cosmos at our fingertips. The Mandate of Heaven shall push them out!"
 shandong.990.a: "Built in a cave with a box of scraps, excellent..."

The Yiwu that Zhang Zongchang employed are also still robbing the Chinese people blind, and must be caught. Though it was plain to see the vileness in Zhang Zongchang, so many this day still rile at his death. We have repelled all visitors to Jinan who wish to attend Zhang Zongchang's funeral, which is better than he deserves."

 shandong.992.t: "Panic against Qing Restoration in Shandong"
 shandong.992.d: "Following Qu Yingguang's grand return to Shandong, Qing Magistrates publicly requisitioned the remnants of the Zhang Clique, ordering them to submit to their authority. Fortunately, Qu's familiarity with military tradition in Shandong provided the needed bribes to get the majority of the armed forces to submit. Amazingly, his request even received pledges from the anti-bandit peasant armies that control south Shandong. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Zhang Clique and those devoted to the Yiguandao until death have other plans. We must protect the townspeople in Shandong from these newly-denounced warlords."

It therefore came as a surprise when the new Governor of Shandong, Qu Yingguang, sent a copy of these witness accounts directly to the Emperor. These eyewitness accounts not only condemn Zhang Zongchang further, but point strongly towards ongoing instability in Shandong that resulted from Zhang Zongchang's regime. Qu Yingguang has used this to heavily imply that further military assistance is needed to secure Shandong for Beijing. We are inclined to assist Qu Yingguang once again, save for the numerous other very important uses of our gendarmerie that the Chief of the Army has already planned out. What are we to do?"

 shandong.400.t: "Zhao Matriarch Joins Zhang Tianran"
 shandong.400.d: "In the sea of refugees that flee northeastern China, many promises are made to the Homored Master Zhang Tianran. Many peasants have entrusted Zhang with their lives possessions, others have sworn themselves to fight in the Red Spears for Shandong. On a sunny day, a woman wearing winter garb from Beijing approached Zhang Tianran. The Yiguandao guards claim she is a matriarch like Zhang Tianran's wife, Sun Suzhen, but she stands before him with two pistols on her belt. Zhao Hong Wenguo, mother of Beijing student leader Zhao Dong, is here to offer her families services to the Yiguandao. Zhao Hong Wenguo claims to do this not out of religious loyalty or financial need, but because the Yiguandao appears to her the essential resistance against Japanese aggression that threatens her home. The Honoured Master agrees, and reiterates his promise to never cooperate with the Japanese in exchange for her families financial and tactical services. Zhao Hong Wenguo also insists in leading Red Spears and Big Sword divisions as a full fledged Field marshal."
 shandong.400.a: "Her resolve leaves us no doubt of her ability."

 shandong.401.t: "Zhang Tianran publishes Provisional Etiquette"
 shandong.401.d: "Zhang Tianran has long pushed that the teachings of Buddhism and Confucius are integral aspects of Chinese society that can never be questioned. Within the inner circle of the Yiguandao, a debate rages between Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen over how to best engage the literati in Shandong. Zhang Tianran and Suzhen have both collaborated on a book entitled 'Provisional Etiquette', intended to demonstrate how the Yiguandao respects the spiritual lineage of Chinese leadership. To Zhang Tianran, who was once a minor bureaucrat under Yuan Shikai, the spiritual lineage of China's dictator went from the Regent Zaifeng to Yuan Shikai, then finally to the enthroned Puyi. To Sun Suzhen however, spiritual lineage in China belonged to Sun Yat-sen, and through Sun Yat-sen's death there is no true spiritual leader of China currently. Zhang's interpretation appears to hold to his agreement to promote Puyi as Emperor within the Yiguandao, but ignores the wellspring of spiritual support for the southern idealists."
 shandong.401.a: "Zhang is right, praise Puyi"
 shandong.401.b: "Sun is right, praise Sun Yat-sen"

 shandong.402.t: "Zhang Tianran Warns Public of Maha-Kalpa"
 shandong.402.d: "Spoken often within the temples and schools, but elusive to the secular public, Zhang Tianran has decided to reveal the existence of the Maha-Kalpa prophecy a public rally. To Zhang Tianran and the Yiguandao, the history of the world is divided into three periods by three periods of peace and barbarism, represented by Three Suns. The last aeon, that of the Red Sun, ended with the Xinhai Revolution. The Confucian legend Kang Yuowei is referenced in Zhang Tianran's speech, which agreed that the third age, Datong, or Maha-Kalpa was dawning. Soon, claims Zhang, the Chinese people will be perfected racially or be destroyed by foreigners like the Japanese Emperor or the British Empire.\n\nTo the uncertain people of Shandong, the only concrete suggestion out of so much esoteric ado is that they should work harder towards national unification, and reinforces the already-prevalent feeling of existential struggle they feel."
 shandong.402.a: "Maybe we should have revealed this earlier"

 shandong.403.t: "Poor Yields in Shandong"
 shandong.403.d: "Famines have long ravaged the people of China which has caused mass death and still keeps us reliant on grain outside our control. Our overreliance on traditional farming is likely the cause, but trying to move away from it would enrage the farmers who have been using the same tried and true methods for thousands of years. We could always begin to implement new, modern farming techniques from westerners, and run the risk of alienating our supporters who look to us for traditional guidance, or we could devote a sizeable portion of our Red Spears to help the farmers and make sure we do not have a famine."

 shandong.404.t: "Buddhist Priest Juzan Declares Zhang Tianran Heresiarch"
 shandong.404.d: "Our Buddhist brethren in Hunan have decided to launch a campaign of slander against us! The teacher Juzan has declared the Yiguandao a heresy, and Zhang Tianran a Heresiarch! This denunciation is already causing ripples in the lower rungs of our organisation. Managers are reporting that several wealthy Buddhist donors have stopped appearing at the temple. Buddhist Teachers in training on Taishan have already heard the news, and their indecision has caused several to abandon the Yiguandao. To Zhang Tianran, Teacher Juzan is nothing more than fanatic sectarian, who desires to shatter the Chinese spiritual genealogy and forestall the Maha-Kalpa."
 shandong.404.a: "Send Red Spears to find and burn Juzan's pamphlets"

 shandong.405.t: "Former Honoured Teacher Lu Zhongjie Caught"
 shandong.405.d: "Zhang Tianran may well be the 18th patriarch of the Yiguandao, but the scars from Lu Zhongjie's departure remain. After Lu Zhongjie fled Shandong a second time during the Yiguandao's assault on Jinan, she was spotted infrequently by our Red Spears. After following a tip that the Teacher Juzan spoke to Lu Zhongjie when he published his defamation against us, the Red Spears snuck into Hunan. One of our most loyal minor Emperors has managed to hunt her down and bring her back to us, after all these years. Within the inner circle, a debate rages over how to handle this windfall. To Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen, keeping Lu Zhongjie alive is tempting further dissenters to venerate her as the reincarnated Guan Yin. To the Red Spears and their leader Xue Dian, Lu Zhongjie was so feeble that she poses no threat to them. Xue Dian has insisted that he put Lu Zhongjie under house arrest, and that no harm come to her."

 shandong.406.d: "The Red Swastika Society, formerly an ally of the Yiguandao during the Zhang Zongchang regime, has finally cracked and deserted us. This news comes as a surprise to even the Honoured Teacher, whom can scarcely come up with a response to his followers. To Sun Suzhen however, this desertion vindicates her opposition to war posturing, which she claims she had always felt. Sun has taken this opportunity to chastise Zhang Tianran, saying that this was the obvious consequence of trying to balance war with charity. Outside the confines of the Yiguandao inner circle, the minor Emperors and Managers have downplayed this loss. Clearly, they say, the Red Swastika Society been bought out by the American YMCA to slander and defame the Yiguandao."
 shandong.406.a: "The American dollar is to blame"

 shandong.407.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran makes contact with the Soka Gakkai in Japan. This Buddhist society has been subjected to government oppression for lobbying fellow Buddhists against Japanese intervention in China. Zhang Tianran's letter to Tsunesaburo Makiguchi has been released to the public in both nations, emphasising their common adherence to the Lotus Sutra. It appears that the Japanese public have taken positively to this letter. Our Japanese brethren may yet sway things in a more beneficial way for us."

 shandong.408.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran has made contact with the leader of the Dao Cao Dai in Vietnam. This group has received messages from the mysterious Cao Dai, a divine Buddhist power they claim unites mankind of all races. Zhang Tianran's compassionate letter hopes to establish and formalising ties with our brethren in Vietnam. The Dao Cai Dao's current leader, Pham Cong Tac, has organised a militia not unlike the Red Spears of Shandong to defend their land from German religious absolutism. Though we have had a long rivalry and animosity between Chinese and Vietnamese, we may yet forge greater ties through our shared faith, and thus one another."

 shandong.409.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran has made contact with the Daejonggyo in Korea. The Daejonggyo are a noble group of Goshindo who see through Japanese Imperialist lies and strive for an independent Korea. The Daejonggyo are famous for their former leader Na Cheol, whose absolute devotion to the Korean people led to his suicide in 1916 over his failure to liberate Korea and Manchuria. With this outreach, we may be able to further influence the Daejonggyo, and thus we may yet gain support from Daejonggyo nationalists."

 shandong.410.d: "The fog of confusion has lifted from the province of Shandong and one man has emerged: Qu Yingguang. Qu was responsible for alerting the magistrate to Zhang Zongchang's illegal and inexcusable crimes in Shandong, and was appointed Governor in thanks. Governor Qu Yingguang, citing the rebellions that are holding back Shandong, pleads before the government to help restore order. Fears that the province may yet be lost to another upstart warlord, or lost to the KMT, abound. Surely, we would not allow another province to fall away from us?"

 shandong.411.d: "The Beijing delegation has conceded, and has sent a detachment of soldiers to seek out and arrest bandits in Shandong. The soldiers arrived to great fanfare in Jinan, and were deployed by General Qu Yingguang to the towns. It appears that most of the rebels resisting taxation have laid down their arms, and some who did resist are now safely behind bars."
 shandong.411.a: "Finally we can focus internally"

 shandong.412.t: "Beijing rejects Qu Yingguang's pleas"
 shandong.412.d: "The Beijing delegation stands firm, and refuses to send soldiers to Shandong to help us. Lacking the legitimacy to order the rebels to stand down. General Qu Yingguang has decided to call their bluff instead. Some spare soldiers will be sent to intimidate rebels in Shandong, dressed in [QIE.GetAdjective] uniforms. Let us hope the rebels do not find out the soldiers we send to break them up are not from Beijing."

 shandong.413.d: "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and admiral you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to the leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous province of Shandong, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. This general comes with a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."

 shandong.414.d: "The young Kong Dechang, the symbol of the Society to Restore Benevolence, has begun making waves with the public. As the inheritor of the Qufu manor legacy, Kong Dechang has been kept abreast of the latest philosophical developments in Confucianism. In this field, Beijing illuminaries like Wu Peifu and Chen Huanzhang have made their own interpretation of the Confucian canon known. What separates Kong Dechang's first publication from others is its rejection of attempts to revive state-enforced piety. While Wu Peifu and Chen Huanzhang have decried their times as impious, Kong Dechang has stated that each individual family in China defines piety through their actions. This rejection of partisanship in the religion he helps represent has upset the intellectuals in Beijing."

 shandong.415.d: "The Duke Yansheng, Marquis of Extended Grace, and other titles of nobility have been purchased by Governor Qu Yingguang during the recent economic decline in Beijing. These are merely symbolic gestures by the bureaucratic entities in Beijing that confer no responsibilities to the owner, but their intended effect remains. This allows allies of Qu Yingguang to regain some of their honour that was deprived from them during the Xinhai Revolution. The landowning nobility of Shandong now have a more legitimate stance within the clique, and can more easily exert influence over the people of Shandong."

 shandong.416.t: "Famine in Shandong, [QIE.GetAdjective] Aid Needed"
 shandong.416.d: "This year's yield in Shandong is not turning out as well as predicted. Most likely due to the overuse of land for commercial opium farming during the Zhang Zongchang years. Qu Yingguang has been called in to solve the food shortage before it leads to endemic famine. Governor Qu Yingguang's solution is to once again go into the provincial reserve and pay for food imports from Hebei, where the harvests are more plentiful. This burden will be shared with the people through additional taxation."

 shandong.417.d: "Big Sword members who had sworn loyalty to Zhang Tianran have returned to Jinan to pledge loyalty to Qu Yingguang. This is because Governor Qu has fulfilled one of their most pressing desires to stem the drug trade in Shandong. However, these Big Sword militiamen are demanding to be treated with the same respect and payment as the trained regulars, which would cause our treasury further woes. How do we respond?"

These righteous bandits have been forced from Henan by the government in Beijing, and are repeating the age-old mantra of 'Destroy the Qing Restore the Ming'. This tired phrase has apparently caused a peasant leader to declare himself Chu the Ninth, and lead a charge on Dezhou. Fortunately our guards were well equipped to handle another religious awakening, and have captured Chu the Ninth and destroyed the Yellow Sands Society."

 shandong.419.d: "The Boxer Temple in Dezhou has erupted in violence, with Yellow Sands Society rearing their ugly head again. This time one 'Wang the Sixth' has launched a surprise attack on the town, only to be cut down by our guards. The Kong Dechang was consulted for advice on how to prevent further insurrection from the Yellow Sands societies. The young Kong Dechang, after giving it much thought, has suggested that the various temples the Yellow Sands that venerate the Ming be interceded with new government-appointed custodians. To the Kong Dechang, the weary people of Shandong continue to rebel because of the existential threat they feel from the political situation."
 shandong.419.a: "A brilliant idea, young lad!"

### 424 - 423 Patauto Flavour Events

 shandong.424.t: "A State Visit to Fengtian"
 shandong.424.d: "Zhang Zongchang, in a bid to gain support from Zhang Zuolin, decided to visit Shenyang. However, talks never were able to take place as The Dogmeat General as soon as he arrived in Shenyang began drinking and whoring obscenely, topping it all off by arriving 3 hours late to the meeting with Zhang Zuolin completely and utterly out of sorts due to drugs and alcohol. Mocking the Old Marshall for his illiteracy to boot! "
 shandong.424.a: "I'd rather entertain Zhang Xueliang"

 shandong.425.t: "Zhang Zongchang Releases Poetry Book"
 shandong.425.d: "Even Zhang Zongchang is not immune to the charms and allure of poetry, and thus he has decided to publish a book containing his poetry. This comes several years after his failed Commentaries on the Thirteen Classics. To many readers, the only moral advice the commentary provided was anecdotal lessons on how Confucius approved of polygamy. While the poems might be questionable, the Dogmeat General seems to be quite pleased with himself, cutting down his daily degeneracy."
 shandong.425.a: "Even a dog enjoys a bone or two"

 shandong.426.t: "The Dogmeat General's Second Publication"
 shandong.426.d: "Zhang Zongchang has released his second Commentary on the Thirteen classics, and horribly insults Wu Peifu's writings! Describing Wu Peifu's writings as circumstantial, and in line with the Beijing style of conforming to political interests over absolute morality. The Dogmeat General writes in the Commentary that the works of Mencius tracks well with the current crisis in China, and draws a favourable comparison between the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, and the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang."
 shandong.426.a: "Thankfully Xueliang's father can't read it"

 shandong.427.t: "Sun Dogs or Rain Dogs?"
 shandong.427.d: "Zhang, reaching new depths of depravity, has decided to take the wife of commander Sun Dianying. Enraged, General Sun has decided to blackmail Zhang Zongchang, threatening to expose this bigamy if he does not promote General Sun. The Dogmeat General is obviously known for his lust and degeneracy, but taking the wife of a trusted subordinate would bring shame to his army. While Zhang wants to keep this quiet, should he concede, it might weaken his standing to his subordinates."
 shandong.427.a: "Take a seat, Marshall"
 shandong.427.b: "Taxi, I'd rather walk"

 shandong.428.t: "Old King Coal and the Dogmeat General"
 shandong.428.d: "A debacle during the early 1930s has come back to haunt Zhang Zongchang's administration. In those years Zhang Zongchang imposed a 40 cent tax on exported coal as a means to profit off of coal operations from Qingdao. this tax, however, was so exorbitantly high that no mining company has ever paid it. Yet still there is mining in Eastern Shandong. A more radical solution has been concocted, which has Zhang Zongchang fund a coal miner syndicate to empower coal miners to fight their bosses. This gamble carries with it a level of agreement with KMT cells in Eastern Shandong to let them excite workers towards syndication. This kind of ideological manipulation, to Zhang Zongchang’s staff, feels as if pulled from Yan Xishan's playbook."
 shandong.428.a: "A shade of Xishans's ideas, I see?"

 shandong.429.t: "Brothel Brawl for Business"
 shandong.429.d: "Zhang Zongchang, whether due to being drug addled, or for his own amusement, appointed two men to the same position as Chief of Security. The two men only found out about the other when they both at the same time went to take their new position. Seeking clarification on the issue, they barged into Zhang Zongchang's room, where they found him engaged in depravity as usual. Zhang, amused at their confusion, ordered the two men to fight each other for the position, and whoever was on top would claim victory, though he did not rule out a power bottom. The men thus proceeded to tear into each other, much to Zhang's and the girl's amusement."
 shandong.429.a: "It seems it was an orgy in more ways than one"

 shandong.430.t: "The Cheapest Medicine"
 shandong.430.d: "The threat of famine has returned to Shandong due to the proliferation of the Opium trade in the province. Due to how much land is currently used for Opium production, people are beginning to tighten their belts. In previous years, petitions to the central government would be made to relive the people. To Zhang Zongchang, this option carries with it too much risk of another warlord discovering his opium plantations. As a result, the Dogmeat General has taken a fatalistic position, and commanded that his soldiers only provide to those whom they feel worthy of food aid."
 shandong.430.a: "The hardest choices require the strongest of wills"

 shandong.431.t: "Sun Dianying Builds Bandit Temples"
 shandong.431.d: "General Sun Dianying's autonomy within the military is great, so much so that his officers act as if Sun Dianying is a clique within the clique. Sun Dianying's soldiers, having looted Taishan of its Yiguandao books, have conceived of a plan to enrich themselves. As Sun Dianying was a leader once of the Temple Road Society in Henan before retreating to Shandong, his men have thought it prudent to recreate the society on Taishan. Atop Taishan, under a mandatory opium haze, Sun Dianying hasbuilt a shrine called The Ninth Heaven. Sun Dianying's soldiers have reportedly begun painting Te and Sheng characters on their faces."
 shandong.431.a: "Hard to escape faith in Shandong"

 shandong.432.t: "The Empress Has No Clothes"
 shandong.432.d: "Sun Dianying has led a group of bandits to rob the grave of Empress Dowager Cixi in Beijing, a shocking development. Under the cover of night, men lead by Sun Dianying opened Cixi's tomb, and removed much of her gold burial treasures. The apex of their debauchery was when they took the jade melon Cixi held in her sarcophagus. While her legacy has been debated between being a ruthless despot who brought about great humiliation, traditionalist still consider her to be a paragon of Chinese society. Looting her grave is a deep insult to Chinese tradition, and [QIE.GetNameDef] are deeply embarrassed. Unfortunately, Sun Dianying has returned to the frontline, surrounded by guards and safe from bounty hunters and vigilantes."
 shandong.432.a: "That belongs in a museum!"

 shandong.433.t: "The Ming Demeaned Once More"
 shandong.433.d: "Sun Dianying, in his growing lust for gold and booty, has decided to rob the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum grave in Nanjing. Sun Dianying's men again arrived in the night, climbing the tomb's walls before blasting the door open. The Ming Xiaoling Tomb belonging to the Hongwu Emperor, the first Ming. Hongwu who was a Red Turban in a White Lotus Society like the late Zhang Tianran, fuelling Sun Dianying's fury. Sun Dianying made off with treasures of the Hongwu Emperor and his wives, their value being permanently sullied by being arranged next to Cixi's jade melon. The grave has been looted and set ablaze, not since Li Zicheng did so in 1644 when he took Beijing has this happened. It really does seem that there is no honour to restore the Ming, despite what those old slogans have said. The hundreds who, in the past, promised to 'Destroy the Qing, Restore the Ming', are saddened by the desecration."
 shandong.433.a: "Is nothing sacred anymore?"

 shandong.434.t: "A New Headquarters?"
 shandong.434.d: "Our expansion has led us to occupy more and greater territory than just Shandong province. The people of Jinan ache and cry out for the soldiers to depart. While the tax house in Jinan has been burned down by angry mobs every year since his occupation, Nanjing promises a much greater security. While some hardliners wish us to remain in Jinan, as it has served as our capital in successful campaigns, others have suggested we move to Nanjing. The metropolitan people of Nanjing brace for the worst of Zhang Zongchang's crew. Bunkers built to survive the siege of Nanjing are currently being filled up with valuable objects in the hope that Zhang Zongchang will not find them."
 shandong.434.a: "Stay in Jinan"
 shandong.434.b: "Move to Nanjing"

 shandong.438.t: "Shangqing Tianguo Declared"
 shandong.438.d: "Governor Zhang Zongchang, known throughout China as the \"Dogmeat General\", is dead. Reports coming out of Jinan allege that Zhang Zongchang and his top lieutenant Sun Dianying had attempted to storm the sacred Tai Shan earlier this week, and did not survive the assault. This astounding news comes with proclamations from the new master of Tai Shan, Zhang Tianran, that he now rules Shandong and all its people.\n\nZhang Tianran is a less notable figure to newspapers, but is well known to the refugees of the Eastern China as the benevolent leader of the Yiguandao cult. To the more conservative refugees, this event symbolises something brighter in store for China."
 shandong.438.a: "This will not go well..."

 shandong.439.t: "Unrest in the South"
 shandong.439.d: "In the League of Eight Provinces there are numerous reports of spreading unrest after the sale of the newly built railway to the Germans. If we want to secure a better hold on China we should keep an eye on the events of the South East as we could gain a lot from the collapse of Chuanfang's clique."
 shandong.439.a: "We should keep an eye on this."

 shandong.440.t: "A Heavy Bullet"
 shandong.440.d: "The League Marshal Sun Chuanfang has been shot and is currently in critical condition, after weeks of riots it seems one lucky peasant got to him. What this means for the League is unknown but if chaos ensues we must be prepared to take advantage of this."
 shandong.440.a: "This bullet will change the fate of China."

 shandong.441.t: "The Old Alliance Alive"
 shandong.441.d: "When General Zhang Zongchang presented Zhang Zuolin with a carrying pole at his inauguration, it came with a deep mutual understanding. Zhang Zongchang would not lavish the Marshal with baubles or pleasantries, but would serve as the reliable tool to which Zuolin may achieve victory. This promise made years ago arrives to Zhang Zongchang this day. A carrying pole sent by Zhang Zuolin could only mean one thing. The time of great service was approaching, and Zhang Zongchang will deliver, whether his honour exists or not."
 shandong.441.a: "This pole will change the fate of China."

 shandong.445.t: "Minor Emperor Xue Dian Deserts With Lu Zhongjie"
 shandong.445.d: "After assuring Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen that Lu Zhongjie was isolated, the Minor Emperor of Shandong has betrayed the Yiguandao. After failing to arrive for daily exercises, Red Spear soldiers discovered Xue Dian missing from his quarters. Panic ensued as the Red Spears scrambled in vain to find Xue Dian. This panic magnified when the old Homored Teacher, Lu Zhongjie, could not be found as well. After Zhang Tianran arrived in a very uncharacteristic fury, he entered Xue Dian's house to ask the spirits for guidance. After several hours, Zhang Tianran emerged from Xue Dian's quarters, and stated that the Minor Emperor was called by a greater power to commit to an immediate and permanent pilgrimage. While the Red Spears soldiers are sated, the dissidents outside of Taishan have easily deduced that Xue Dian and Lu Zhongjie have escaped the cult. To the surprise of many, including Sun Suzhen, Zhang Tianran has not ordered for a manhunt. It appears as if the Honoured Master has accepted a consequence he did not predict."
 shandong.445.a: "It is probably part of the Maha-Kalpa"

 shandong.447.t: "Border Skirmishes Between [ANQ.GetName] and [SQI.GetNameDef]"

 # Tianran in charge:
 shandong.447.d1: "Up until now, [ANQ.GetLeader]'s revolt against the Nanjing regime and our own interests in the region have avoided directly confronting each other. However, this uneasy cease-fire was never meant to hold, and now local conflicts have arisen with Yiguandao militia and Anqing forces engaging each other.\n\nWith our expedition south into the Five Provinces in direct conflict with [ANQ.GetName]'s regional interests, many close to Zhang Tianran have voiced their opinion that the reasons we have for engaging the League also apply to [ANQ.GetName], that aside perhaps it is best we focus on Nanjing first."

 # Zongchang in charge:
 shandong.447.d2: "Up until now, [ANQ.GetLeader]'s revolt against the Nanjing regime and our own interests in the region have avoided directly confronting each other. However, this uneasy cease-fire was never meant to hold, and now local conflicts have arisen with both Shandong and Anqing forces engaging each other.\n\nWith our expedition south into the Five Provinces in direct conflict with [ANQ.GetName]'s regional interests, many generals have voiced to Zhang Zongchang that [ANQ.GetNameDef] is weak and has little backing among the military. These generals have been wrong before with reports of large League units defecting to [ANQ.GetName]."
 shandong.447.a: "We should strike them swiftly!"
 # Peace:
 shandong.447.b: "Peace will prevail, for now..."

 # ANQ side:
 shandong.448.t: "War between [ANQ.GetName] and [SQI.GetNameDef]"

 # ANQ allied with FNG:
 shandong.448.d1: "Up until now, [SQI.GetLeader]'s intervention against the Nanjing regime and our own uprising have avoided directly confronting each other. However, this uneasy cease-fire was never meant to hold, and now war has officially broke out.\n\nWith the assistance of [FNG.GetNameDef], our forces could have a slight material edge against Shandong forces, provided we are able to hold the coasts."

 # ANQ allied with QIE:
 shandong.448.d2: "Up until now, [SQI.GetLeader]'s intervention against the Nanjing regime and our own uprising have avoided directly confronting each other. However, this uneasy cease-fire was never meant to hold, and now war has officially broke out.\n\nWith the intervention of [QIE.GetNameDef] on our side of the conflict, our forces will have more breathing room in our struggle against both [LEP.GetLeader] and [SQI.GetLeader], though it still will be a hard fight."
 shandong.448.a: "[FNG.GetLeader] will bring order to China!"
 shandong.448.b: "[QIE.GetLeader] will bring order to China!"

 shandong.449.t: "Border Skirmishes Between [SQI.GetNameDef] and [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 shandong.449.d: "The Nanjing regime hasn't been the only threat our forces have had to deal with, for the past few weeks we have been trying to ignore [FROM.GetNameDef]'s probes into our territory but [QI.GetLeader] has decided action might well be required. If we were to let this continue on with this inaction we will be viewed as weak which may very well come back to hurt us later however, a weak display may be exactly what we want if a trap is decided as the plan of action. [SQI.GetLeader] has a choice to make, he favours..."
 shandong.449.a: "... striking [FROM.GetNameDef]'s lines immediately."
 shandong.449.b: "... focusing on our current issues."

 shandong.500.t: "Victory in the League War!"
 shandong.500.d: "We won"
 shandong.500.d1: "A new era is beginning for China. Little more than a strange yet influential organisation when the League War began, the forces of the Yiguandao brought about hope and redemption to the lands suffering under the corrupt and wicked when they marched upon Nanjing. Now, Zhang Tianran, the 18th patriarch of the Yiguandao, has emerged victor of the League War and rules over China's wealthy eastern provinces. The man wasted no time - in the city of Nanjing, opium was confiscated, dens raided, and criminal foreigners expelled. Aid was also distributed to the suffering and needy by Yiguandao monks, eager to earn goodwill with the populace.\n\nBut though our control has been largely secured over Eastern China, lawlessness remains the norm across too large a portion of the countryside. Uncooperative governors, KMT bandits, warlord remnants - the list of obstacles to integration is quite long. It will take some time to consolidate control over the lands we won in the struggle, but soon the Shangqing Tianguo will elevate China into a new era of righteous morality."
 shandong.500.d2: "A new era was beginning for China, or so KMT radicals and Yiguandao zealots thought as they attempted to impose their dangerous ideologies upon the people. Differentiated from the rest of China's petty rulers primarily by the sheer extent of his corruption and extravagance, the Dogmeat General, Zhang Zongchang, has emerged victor of the League War, now ruling over the country's wealthy eastern provinces. To celebrate this incredible feat, Zhang engaged in a night of drunken enjoyment, complete with a stunning amount of opium and finishing with a tour of Nanjing's fine brothels.\n\nBut though our control has been largely secured over Eastern China, lawlessness remains the norm across too large a portion of the countryside. Uncooperative governors, KMT bandits, religious fanatics - the list of obstacles to integration is quite long. It will take some time to consolidate control over the lands we won in the struggle, but soon we will be able to announce a new League of East Chinese Provinces under the rule of soon-to-be Marshal Zhang Zongchang."
 shandong.500.a: "Peace at last"

 shandong.501.t: "Zhang Zongchang Flees Shandong"
 shandong.501.d_FNG: "Having left Jinan in flames, and Shandong in the throws of violent revolt, Zhang Zongchang recently arrived in [745.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] after escaping prison with a band of close associates, at the helm of a hastily commandeered cattle freighter. Despite his unassuming means of transport, the Dogmeat General was quick to make his way to Shenyang, and demand a return to Zhang Zuolin's inner circle. Despite his recent defeat, Zhang Zongchang remains a formidable general, widely considered among the most effective in north China. Many would argue that his return presents an unmatched opportunity.\n\nHowever, Zhang was quick to assert his autonomy when he became isolated in Shandong during the Third Zhifeng War. His armies stood aside in 1928, at our moment of greatest need; a betrayal in all but name.\n\nIn truth it was Zhang Zuolin who made Zhang Zongchang; it was his armies that the Dogmeat General led to victory. Now that he depends once again on the Grand Marshal's charity, not to mention his clemency, should either be extended?"
 shandong.501.d_SZC: "Having left Jinan in flames, and Shandong in the throws of violent revolt, Zhang Zongchang has arrived in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] after escaping prison with a band of close associates. Apparently without a home in Fengtian, Zhang is now boldly demanding a place at the head of one of our own armies, and promises a series of swift victories by his hand.\n\nDespite his recent defeats, Zhang Zongchang remains a formidable general, widely considered among the most effective in north China. Many would argue that his return presents an unmatched opportunity. On the other hand, Zhang is known to be violently unpredictable, and ill reputed in most respectable circles."
 shandong.501.a: "Welcome, Old Eighty-Six!"
 shandong.501.b: "We have no need of this rabid dog."

 shandong.502.t: "Zhang Zongchang Loyalists Flee Shandong"
 shandong.502.d: "After attempting to storm the sacred Mount Tai, Zhang Zongchang and his top lieutenant Sun Dianying were shot dead. The loyalists who survived the assault fled Shandong and have now arrived in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. They have asked to serve in our armed forces, perhaps with the hope of returning home one day. While their knowledge may prove useful in any future battles in Shandong, they are also seen by others in the armed forces as little more than bandits."
 shandong.502.a: "They are welcome here."
 shandong.502.b: "We have no use for addicted warlords."

 shandong.503.t: "Manchu Flee Beijing After Failed Coup!"
 shandong.503.d: "Following the failed Qing restoration in Beijing, some Manchu generals and advisiors have fled the wraith of Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique and now seek refuge in our province. Events are moving quickly, and while the fates of the Emperor Puyi and his brother Pujie are still yet unknown, these family members offer their assistance to the cause of restoring the monarchy."
 shandong.503.a: "They are welcome here."
 shandong.503.b: "We have no use for them."

 shandong.504.t: "An Unbridled Gambit"
 shandong.504.d: "In a shocking turn of events, it would appear that the underworld of Beijing politics has unfurled onto the national scene. As it turns out, the iron grip of the Jade Marshal and the King of Baoding, Wu Peifu and Cao Kun respectively, was less concrete than was internationally believed. Following their inaction in the collapse of the League, the Zhili clique was sent into a miasma of disarray. Sensing both opportunity and weakness in their enemies, the Manchu royals colluded with Governor Yan Xishan of Shanxi in order to eject the Zhili from the Central Provinces.\n\nHowever, history has repeated itself, and Wu Peifu has oncemore defied the odds and turned them in his favour. Reportedly, the coup attempt failed dramatically, and has instilled the new ”National Protector” with vengeance and vigour. The Zhili Clique seem intent on descending down the warpath against Yan Xishan’s Jin Clique and Feng Yuxiang’s Guominjun, for the attempt on his life.\n\nYet there remains an opportunity for [SQI.GetLeader]. With monarchical sympathies, and the political situation of Shandong settled, this could be the necessary setpiece to see him ascend from the mere province to the national level. This is of course, presuming that his armies can fight the Jade Marshal’s on equal terms, a feat rarely achieved."
 shandong.504.a: "Seize the initiative! For the Emperor!"
 shandong.504.b: "We’d be fools to go against the Jade Marshal."
