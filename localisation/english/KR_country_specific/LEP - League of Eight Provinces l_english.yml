 LEP_ma_xulun_bio: "A local Zhejiang political heavyweight, Ma Xulun would study at the Yangzheng Academy in Hangzhou in his early years, and would organise a journal in 1905 to promote Anti-Qing Revolution. In 1910 he would join Liu Yazi's revolutionary literary group \"Nanshe\", or the Southern Society, and the following year would follow his friend Tang Erhe to Tokyo. Asking Zhang Taiyan to introduce him to the Tongmenghui whilst there, Ma Xulun would participate in the Xinhai revolution by organising militia in his hometown, later serving as secretary of the Zhejiang Governor's Office.\n\nTravelling to Shanghai shortly thereafter, Ma would found the Great Republic Daily with Zhang Taiyan, and in 1913 would become a professor at Beijing University. Resigning in 1915, he would return to Zhejiang to protest against Yuan Shikai, and would be re-invited to Beijing University by Cai Yuanpei. Participating in the November Riots on behalf of the supporting staff, he would return to Zhejiang in 1921 to serve as director of its Provincial Education Department.\n\nReturning to Zhili Beijing in 1922, he would serve as deputy minister of education twice, and even acting minister. Protecting Li Dazhao from persecution, he would join the Kuomintang in 1923 and serve as a propaganda minister. In 1926 he openly denounced Duan Qirui for the March 18th Massacre, and promptly fled to Hangzhou. Attempting to instigate Zhejiang Governor Xia Chao to rebel against Sun Chuanfang, he would become wanted in the League.\n\nFollowing the liberalisation period in the aftermath of the Northern Expedition, Ma Xulun would return to Beijing University, and participate in the formation of the National Salvation Federation. Returning to Zhejiang to advocate for a united front against imperialism, Ma has remained a local kingpin in Zhejiang politics, with an ear to the revolutionaries and to the reformists."

In 1927 he returned to serve as head of the Civil Affairs Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and infamously aided Korean Revolutionary Kim Gu by providing him shelter from political persecution. A chief proponent of Zhejiang Federalism, Chu is its popular figurehead and rallying point amongst civilian politicians."

In 1890 Rong would become manager of Guangsheng Bank, an enterprise established by his father Rong Xitai and a few friends. In 1900 Rong would utilise the opportunities presented by the Eight-Power Allied Forces' invasion of North China to transport gigantic amounts of flour northwards along with his brother, resulting in an immense accumulation of wealth.\n\nUsing their profits, Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng would open Maoxin Flour Mill, and in 1907 would raise funds to build Wuxi New Cotton Mill. In 1912 he would establish Fuxin Flour Mill in Shanghai, and would oversee tremendous growth due to the ceasing of foreign food imports during the Great War.

 LEP_sun_chuanfang_bio: "Born into humble circumstances, Sun Chuanfang's family fell into poverty when his father died. His brother-in-law Wang Yingkai took Sun under his wing and sponsored his entrance into the Beiyang Army Accelerated Military Academy, the predecessor of the Baoding Military Academy. In 1905, Sun graduated after studying two years of infantry and would enroll in the 6th Chinese Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy to master infantry. In 1909, Sun returned to China and served under Wang Zhanyuan, who became the latter's mentor. When Wang's rule of Hubei collapsed in 1921 due to oppressive governance, Sun was brought into Wu Peifu's branch of the Zhili Clique, and sent him to take Fujian in 1923.\n\nSun centralised his authority in Fujian and over the next two years collaborated with Zhili officers Qi Xieyuan and Chen Tiaoyuan to seize control of Zhejiang and Nanjing, whilst fighting Shandong Governor Zhang Zongchang in Jiangsu and ultimately pushed him back into Shandong. Sun took the opportunity to establish the League of Five Provinces and based himself in Nanjing in 1926. Sun successfully retook Nanchang from the KMT during the Northern Expedition and expanded his authority into Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong.\n\nAfter the Northern Expedition, Sun cooperated with the German Military Mission extensively to modernise the military and reform. Although opposed to pervasive German influence, Sun allowed Qi to greenlight several exploitative deals with Germany in Shanghai and brutally put down the Shanghai Uprising of 1932. Sun's ambitions led him into a rivalry with Wu over influence within the Zhili Clique, a conflict which will undoubtedly shape China's future."

Qi was assigned to Li Chun's command, becoming his chief of staff by the establishment of the Republic of China. During the Second Revolution, Li took Jiangxi. When Feng Guozhang was rising to the presidency, he assigned Li Chun to rule Jiangsu. In 1920, Li Chun unexpectedly committed suicide, and Qi succeeded him with the support of Chen Tiaoyuan.\n\nDuring the 1st Zhifeng War, Qi supported Wu Peifu's side, and the Jade Marshal rewarded him with control of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. After Wu was soundly defeated by Zhang Zuolin in the 2nd Zhifeng War, the Old Marshal deployed the Dogmeat General to seize control of Jiangsu. Qi was forced out due to various defections in his camp, and he fled to Sun's court to make an alliance. The two launched a counter invasion of Jiangsu in 1925, and Qi once again became Su Governor.\n\nWhen Sun formalised the creation of the League, Chen and Qi served as his chief lieutenants, but Qi was able to gain Sun's favour"

After returning to China, he would serve as a recruit training instructor, and later a battalion commander.\n\nTransferred to the Second Division of the Hubei Army, Lu would be promoted to serving as a brigade commander under Sun Chuanfang. Winning great prestige and victories, Lu would become commander of the Second Division, fighting against the likes of Lu Yongxiang.\n\nServing under Sun in 1925, Lu would secure the territory of Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui for the Smiling Tiger, and would become governor of Zhejiang as a reward. As a friend and confidante of Sun, Lu was elevated far beyond local officers like Xia Chao and Zhou Fengqi, which led much resentment from the Zhejiang officers.\n\nAfter Xia Chao's rebellion, Sun and Lu installed Chen Yi as the new civilian governor of Zhejiang, hoping to count on the latter's stronger fealty to the League Marshal.

Chen was motivated to serve in his country due to the declining situation of the Qing Dynasty, and so he entered into a military career. After studying artillery in the 5th Chinese Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, Chen went to the Artillery Shooting School of the Japanese Army. While abroad, Chen became associated with the Guangfuhui (Restoration Society), and met several other Zhejiangers including Cai Yuanpei, Jiang Zungui, Qiu Jin, and Xu Xilin.\n\nChen returned to China in 1907, and became a clerk for the Ministry of Army. During the Xinhai Revolution, Jiang Zungui became Zhe Governor, and Chen returned to his home province to serve at the former's invitation. In 1914, Chen went to Beijing to work as a political councillor. The following year, Yuan deployed Chen to chase Cai E who fled to Yunnan, but Chen only pretended to give chase before resigning and going back to Zhejiang. After Yuan died, Chen went back to Japan to study again for three years, this time in the Army War College of Japan, and then set himself up as a businessman in Shanghai.\n\nIn 1924 during the Jiangnan war, Chen was elected as a local representative to meet with Sun to end the war. Sun was impressed by Chen's knowledge of Japanese military training, and so recruited him into his army. Chen helped Sun in taking Jiangsu from Zhang Zongchang, and the former was rewarded with Governorship of Zhe after the previous governor attempted to rebel, a post he still holds a decade later.§!\n\n§YNotes: While held by Sun in high regards, Chen has no loyalty to the Smiling Tiger.

Deng's company held out long enough for Sun Chuanfang to launch a surprise attack on the rear of the enemy warlord forces, leading to victory.\n\nFang rewarded Deng by making him a platoon leader and the two men became sworn brothers.

The constant political turmoil in Zhejiang backfired on Zhou, as Zhejiang fell into the control of Anhui Clique General Yang Shande. Zhou was forced to flee to Japan because of this.

Before joining Sun Chuanfang's division as a brigade commander in 1921, Meng served in various units of the Beijing government as a Colonel and regimental commander.\n\nIn 1922, Meng was given the rank of Major General and two years later, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. As Sun Chuanfang marched into southeast China in the early 1920s, Meng would follow as a garrison commander in Hangzhou and a divisional commander under the League Marshal. When the National Revolutionary Army marched against Sun Chuanfang, he was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Zhejiang Army and successfully held the NRA out of Sun Chuanfang's base in Nanjing with his fortification skills earned in the past decade. Since then, Meng has been a joint garrison commander in Nanjing with Zhou Fengqi, safeguarding the heart of Sun Chuanfang's League.§!\n\n§YNotes: A longtime follower and loyal subordinate of Sun Chuanfang, Meng never received any formal military training, however his experience is always helpful to the League Marshal.§!"

Returning to China in 1910 he would pass the engineering and imperial military exam in Beijing, serving as a Garrison Officer in Hunan.\n\nPersonally requested by Li Yuanhong to serve as a staff in his office, he would become a consultant to Yuan Shikai. Serving as a tactica tutor in Beijing and the tutor of engineering force of the War Participation Army, Wei would return to Hunan in 1919 to serve as deputy chief of the Military Governor's Office under Fu Liangzhuo. Leaving his home province that same year as Fu was expelled, Wei would be secretly sent south in 1922 to soothe tensions between the North and South Warlords.\n\nEarning the rank of major general in 1923 and travelled to Taiwan under Japanese occupation in 1924, Wei would serve as the local magistrate for a series of counties under the auspices of Sun Chuanfang in 1925, and after being involved in a spat between Liu Haisu and Sun over the meaning of nude models, would continue to serve as Governor of Shanghai County well into the Northern Expedition. With Sun Chuanfang managing to hold onto his League territories, Wei would manage to smooth over tensions between the South Zhili and Fengtian in the successive ZhiFeng wars, in-part due to his personal ties to Zhang Xueliang. A skilled and charismatic sweet talker, Wei has been utilised time and time again by Sun in the past couple of years to smoothen often very prickly compatriots.§!"

His career as a soldier would begin in 1903 as he was transferred from a private secondary school to the Zhejiang Military Academy. As an outstanding student, together with celebrities like Yan Xishan, Tang Jiyao, Zhao Hengti and most importantly, Sun Chuanfang, he was sent to the 6th Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, where Li studied infantry. After returning to China in 1909, this brilliant officer was recruited into the Imperial Guard, as Li's talent was recognised by Zaitao, he became one of the few Han people who held a senior position in the Qing Imperial Guards.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, leaving a sorry letter to Zaitao, Li Erkang joined the revolutionary army as a tutor and stayed in his home province afterwards, serving as a military writer, staff and tutor in the governorate of Zhejiang. After Sun Chuanfang marched into Zhejiang, Li was hired by Sun and was sent to Japan in 1923-1924. After his return, he spent most time concluding and publishing his observations on the most dangerous enemy of China and aiding Sun Chuanfang in training new officers. Although Li disagrees with the concessionist nature of the League, he stays for the considerable publishing resources in Zhejiang and ideal environment for military academic discussion and exchange with the powers, particularly with Germany, which Li regards as the most militarily advanced power.§!\n\n§YNotes: As a prolific military intellectual, Li Erkang, editor of several military journals in Zhejiang, has published and translated countless military works, some of the most noticeable works are \"New Military Tactics Learnt in the European War\" (1916),\"Toxic Gas and Toxic Smoke\" (1928), \"National Defence and Supplies\" (1929), \"Japan's Military Understanding after the European War\" (1929) and \"Youth Military Training Course\" (1931). Some believe that part of the military thought of Jiang Baili is inspired by Li, as Jiang highly praised Li's ideas in the preface of Li's \"National Defence and Supplies\", where Li calls for comprehensive national, economic and social mobilisation against inevitable Japanese aggression. As the mentor of Chen Cheng and sworn brother of Chen Lifu, Li Erkang is also well-connected in the rightist element of the KMT, and he tried to persuade Sun to cooperate with the KMT in the Northern Expedition.§!"

Trained in modernised mobile warfare tactics, they have been taught by the Victors of the Weltkrieg, and therefore are some of China's most cutting edge military theorists. However, learning in Berlin has also brought with them the factionalism of the German military.\n\nSplit between the likes of Li Rentao and his adoration for chemical warfare, Xu Peigen \"The Moltke of the East\" and his insistence on a small, elite, modern army, and that of the numerous military industrialists inspired by the likes of Max Baeur, they have resembled their tutors almost perfectly.

Documented in his various writings, Li Erkang sports a theory not too dissimilar to Jiang Baili's own, with many alluding that Jiang was inspired by Li.\n\nThe core tenets of Li's military theory focus on mustering the Chinese nation to be ready to enter a state of national siege. Fighting against pacifism in the face of Japan's increasing militarism, Li states that modern wars require the full effort of the nation and its people, not only in mobilisation but in the preparation for advancing military research, material independency and establishing war protocols such as a ration system on food and fuel. Along similar lines, Li insists upon the militarisation of the youth and society, with special attention to chemical weapon use, which Li believes would present in the next major war in China despite being banned international. The Zhejun Officers also promote the utilisation of light infantry tactics, modern armaments, and a focus on training and coordination, not spirit.

 LEP_eight_provinces_allied_armies_desc: "Born out of Sun Chuanfang's desire to unite the Southeast, the Eight Province Inter-Allied Armies owe their origins to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Allied Army, formed in 1924 in response to the outbreak of the Zhejiang-Jiangsu war of 1924. Formed by Governors Sun and Governors Qi, such an alliance would ultimately end with Qi's deposition from China. However Sun Chuanfang would remain, and slowly amass his power in the Southeast with Cao Kun and Wu Peifu's permission. Seizing Nanjing, and with control of Fujian and Zhejiang, Sun would negotiate with Fang Benren and Deng Ruzhuo to join his alliance, similarly conducting such matters with Chen Tiaoyuan. Fighting off a war with Fengtian and Zhang Zongchang, Sun would establish a five-province coalition system encompassing Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui and Jiangxi to formalise his alliance.\n\nWhilst the originaly governors of that time, Chen Taoyi, Xia Chao, Wang Pu, Li Dingkui and Sa Zhenbing are now on different paths from the League, Sun remained. Weathering the storm of the Northern Expedition, the now Eight Province (following the incorporation of Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi in 1928) Inter-Allied Armies are a highly decentralised bunch. With the three most recent provinces effectively maintaining their own armies, the Eastern provinces ostensibly maintain their forces under the League Marshal's auspices. Although Sun himself retains a personal force within Nanjing. Altogether they contribute to an almost modernised force capable of standing against the Central Army.\n\nAs long as Sun remains, the League Army will endure!"

Whilst a geopolitical nightmare, it has sent reverberations all throughout the Eight Province Inter-Allied Armies. Soldiers are mutinying, Governors in the West have refused to update Nanjing on their status, the Kuomintang have grown bolder, and the clouds are gathering on Nanjing. However, the Smiling Tiger still stands! And all traitors, large and small, will face the Tiger's fury. The League is safe, as long as he retains power."

Lacking both Sun Chuanfang's charisma and military skill, Qi commands very little beyond his immediate soldiers as Governor of Jiangsu. With most of the Smiling Tiger's closest compatriots merely choosing to side with Qi for their own survival, considering the other option is most likely execution, the unity of the League's Army is fraught."

If we are to emulate even a crumb, in conjunction with our reconstituted German Military Advisors, we must entirely subsume ourselves to their way of thinking. The League Army has never been a truly weak force, that is true, for a majority of its commanders owe heritage to the intense training of Japanese military academies and that of Baoding. However for those who have engaged in nepotism and cronyism to find themselves in their commands, they prove an unmeasurable weakness.\n\nEstablishing a new League army, powerful enough to keep the warlords in check, foreign invaders at bay, and spearhead modern military endeavours will be a titanic task to pursue. However there is no other polity capable than that of the League to ensure that China's armies march into the modern era."

However, they all bow to the authority of the League Marshal as overall Commander of the joint forces. Numerous and in large quantity, the League Army still proved radically in-effective in light of the smaller National Revolutionary Army. Solders born from Whampoa were able to consistently trounce our much bigger forces, only being driven back by the German intervention.\n\nWith the extensive modernisation programme conducted by the renewed German Advisory Mission, and the enacting of a period of serious reform, analysis, and reconstruction of the League Army of old, the new glorious United Army of the Five Provinces truly represents the peak of modernity and warrior spirit within the Chinese nation. Armed with German equipment, practicing mobile warfare tactics, with an elite core of stormtroopers, we have brought modern warfare to the Chinese battlefield, and the whole nation will acknowledge our symphony of industry and steel."

Building an airstrip on the original campus site, he would officially move the Nanjing Air Academy here in 1931. Spouting facilities such as an airport, bomb depot, machine repair shop, and aircraft manufacturing plant, the western portion is dedicated to student and faculty amenites. Dubbed \"The Cradle of the Chinese Airforce\" by foreign observers due to having trained more than 500 students, it has received renewed attention following revived League Air Warfare efforts. With the League being one of the most industrialised entitities within the nation, it is undoubtedly the most suitable to be the progenitor of China's Air Power."

Born from China's desire to not fall behind in the technology arms race with the west, the Westernisation Movement spurned Governor Zuo Zongtang in 1866 to construct a series of shipyards in Fuzhou, Fujian. Choosing Mawei as the base to build its shipyard, a slow formenting and directing of Fujian's naval culture into the Chinese admiralty began to develop.\n\nSpecialising in a variety of schools, from manufacturing to driving to administration to design, the students would be taught by foreign advisors, and learn all facets of British naval doctrine and French shipbuilding. Being functionally the Cradle of the Chinese Navy, the Fujian Naval Academy was the first modern military academy, modern professional college and first naval navigation institution in modern China.\n\nHaving long persisted despite the destruction of the Fujian fleet in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, Fujian's naval clique has once again carried forth the flag of China's nascent naval power."

Utilising mobile partisan units, the National Revolutionary Army were able to halt the advance of our encirclement campaigns in totality, despite being outnumbered sometimes three-to-one. Rendering the much better equipped Fujian and Jiangxi armies utterly inefficient, their harassment campaigns can prove a lesson for us in the future. Should any invader intrude upon our lands, we will turn the whole League into a battleground. Assaults from the front, and pincers from behind."

Initially led by Marshal Li Jishen and operating with networks flowing in and out of Shanghai, the defeat of the 1932 uprising forced them to retreat southwards to the Jiangxi-Fujian area.\n\nIn the mountains, Song Qingling, Deng Yanda and others published the \"Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World\", announcing the formation of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang to autonomously manage the guerilla zone. This, combined with weakening communications with Wang's government in exile, has created a certain independence within MinGan cadres, even as the movement has reunited again.\n\nWhilst its influence within the broader League itself is frayed at best, the Kuomintang continues as a spectral remnant of the past. Through illicit connections with the Green Gangs, the Gang of Ten, and the sheer determination and willpower of the soldiers in MinGan, the cause of Dr. Sun Yat-sen continues despite the odds.§!\n"

Soon after their formation, in 1929, they joined the Chinese Empire Reform Association coalition in Beijing in order to try and create a united opposition bloc against the Harmony Association, due to a distaste of the Zhili's seeming apathy towards the concessions.\n\nWith limited influence within the League itself due to their opposition towards continued conduct with the Germans and blatant corruption, the NSF is but a minor interest group of intellectuals. More powerful within Beijing than that of Nanjing. However Sun Chuanfang personally finds them rather admirable, for their crusade against corruption and their willingness to abide by authoritarian government. Split upon the precipice of viewing the League Marshal as nothing more than a warlord, they are quite unwilling to cooperate with the League itself, unless it adopts a new form of legitimate governance.§!\n"

With its origins in the Late Qing reformers, the movement initially sprung into action following the establishment of the Advisory Council, further thrusting themselves into the limelight by launching their own uprising in Hangzhou, in conjunction with Xinhai.\n\nPromulgating a series of provincial laws, governmental organs and a constitution within 1912, Zhejiang initially was the birthplace of idealist Federalist principles within China. However following the appointment of Zhu Rui as Governor, Zhejiang would enter a concrete period of military politics. Increasingly conservative and split upon military and civilian facets, Qu Yingguang and Zhu Rui would support the Hongxian Emperor, and as a result would see the erasure of the movement from the provincial assembly.\n\nFlourishing once more in the 1920s, Zhejiang would see its own Constitution drafted along the example set by Hunan. However it would be shelved by local militarists. Reconstituted by Sun Chuanfang, Sun has utilised the movement to provide him a form of true governance.

Spurred on by the Shanghai Scramble, the German intervention within the Northern Expedition and later that of the Third ZhiFeng War, the A.O.G's predecessor organisation would be that of the \"German East Asia Society\".\n\nCarried forth by the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, based in Tsingtau, it was ostensibly a group of colonial officials, bankers and business owners that had negotiated with Sun Chuanfang to aid in clearing his considerable war debts. Considering his options, and with the hopes of furthering his arms race with Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang signed to a stringent and pervasive series of economic deals with the bank, in exchange for further loans and extensive German military hardware.\n\nFollowing the 80-Division plan which saw implementation within the Central Government and the League, the Shanghai Uprising would throw a wrench into the amicable relationship between Smiling Tiger and GEAS. Coinciding with the latter's corruption scandal and its position being made aware to other powers within China, they would form the A.O.G as an attempt to further enwrap themselves within China. With most German-owned businesses operating under its umbrella, the A.O.G's influence but only grows.

Tied up closely with the sprawling rural gentry that occupy the numerous League Provinces, they find themselves to be a minor player within League Politics. Ostensibly attempting to levy the League Marshal to their side to form a front against pervasive German influence, Sun Chuanfang has positioned them in such a way that they are primed to strike as soon as he desires to be rid of the Germans.\n\nHowever the Jiangnan Consortium's greatest enemies are those within the progressive and pro-German camps. Bringing together mutual enemies, the Consortium is consistently harassed by the likes of the Zhejiang Autonomy Movement alongside the personal might of pro-German officers such as Li Rentao and Qi Xieyuan. Nonetheless they control a sizeable portion of the League's non-German industry and economy, and are sceptical of any further encroachment from concessionists.\n\nNonetheless they are not powerless.

 LEP_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Southern Zhili Clique (Nanjing Zhixi)\n§LThe estranged branch of the Zhili family, the Southern Zhili Clique claims its legacy from the likes of Wang Zhanyuan. An important ally and supporter of Feng Guozhang, Wang would form a reliable and sturdy ally within his province of Hubei. Even to the point that he was jointly referred to, alongisde the likes of Jiangsu Governor Li Chun and Jiangxi Governor Chen Guangyuan as the \"Three Governors of the Yangtze River\". Rising to his true climax following the ZhiWan War, Wang's rule of Hubei would ultimately fall apart catastrophically due to his harsh, oppressive rule.\n\nOusted by Zhao Hengti, the mantle of the Southern Zhili Clique would then fall upon his old subordinate, Sun Chuanfang. The infamous and renowned Smiling Tiger, Sun would be nominated by Wu Peifu to succeed Wang's possessions, and following the First ZhiFeng war would fully accede to the Zhili clique. Securing Fujian Province, Sun would support Qi Xieyuan in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, and would amass Zhejiang under his domain too.\n\nDefeating Zhang Zongchang and Yang Yuting, Sun would catapult his Southern Zhili Clique to the rulership of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian and Zhejiang, forming the Five Inter-Allied Armies, the predecessor to the League of Eight Provinces. Succeeding in the Northern Expedition, albeit badly bruised, the Southern Zhili Clique would soon end up in an arm race with its Northern counterpart. Remaining elusive, Sun would form his League of Eight Provinces in 1928 as a direct threat against the Jade Marshal. Unruly, chaotic, and irresponsible, the Southern Zhili Clique hinges all around the personal power of two men. Sun Chuanfang and Qi Xieyuan.§!\n"
 LEP_national_populist_party: "YCP"
 LEP_national_populist_party_long: "Young China Party (Zhongguo Qingniandang)\n§LBorn from the student \"Young China Society\", the Young China Party would be one of the society's successors, as it split into \"nationalist\", \"socialist\" and \"idealist\" factions, led by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, Li Dazhao, and Wang Guangqi respectively. Travelling to France to study, Zeng Qi and Li Huang and the other members of their nationalist faction would engage in spats with other students in France such as Zhou Enlai, Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng.\n\nSometimes becoming violent, the amassment of support for the Chinese Syndicalist Party would result in Zeng and Li forming their own party, announcing the formation of the Young China Party in 1923, outside Paris. Developing rapidly amongst Chinese student organisations, the Young China Party would stand in concrete opposition towards the Kuomintang's cooperation with the CSP, and the YCP would return to Shanghai founding a series of political societies and newspapers in 1924.\n\nBecoming ingratiated with Sun Chuanfang's forces, the Young China Party would move North to participate in the Beijing Assembly yet leave behind perhaps their most brutal compatriot. Li Baozhang, \"General Guillotine\", is a key officer within Sun Chuanfang's League Army, and is also the requisite local leader of the Young China Party within the League Provinces. Ostensibly the leader of the Young China Party in the Southeast, Li has overseen tremendous militarisation and growth of the nascent party, as opposed to the parliamentarian approach by his bosses in Beijing.§!\n"

 LEP_qing_help_party: "Beijing Liaison Council"
 LEP_qing_help_party_long: "Beijing Liaison Council (Beijing Lianluo Weiyuanhui)\n§LOur benefactors, the Zhili, have naturally taken a keen interest in the programmes being undertaken by our impromptu government. Relations between the Southern and Northern Zhili were always fraught, and the intricate web of connections that served as both groups' foundation served only to aggravate the issue; a personal slight against a Nanjing official could have grave economic repercussions on both sides.\n\nWhile we may resent somewhat their presence here, at least they have little strength independently; any power they do have is only as a tool of Beijing, and if we maintain good relations with the Zhili themselves these representatives can't give our government any trouble. The extent of their activities is mostly disseminating pro-Zhili propaganda and pushing for their own candidates in some minor posts. It would be a different story, however, if we were to somehow offend the dragon to the north...§!\n"

 #League War
 LEP_qi_rules_nanjing: "Qi Rules Nanjing"
 LEP_qi_rules_nanjing_desc: "Qi Xieyuan, the well respected Governor of Jiangsu and controller of many of the troops around Nanjing, has seized control of the city. This makes him Sun's nominal successor. Qi now rules the Nanjing Clique. However, chaos reigns in what was previously the LEP and it is not certain that all the former LEP governors recognise Qi."

 LEP_north_south_west: "North, South or West"
 LEP_north_south_west_desc: "The Nanjing Clique has enemies in the north, the south and the west. Our territory is divided, with the Anqing Clique close to our heart. We must choose which enemies we will focus on first. We also need to reestablish contact with the former governors of the LEP provinces, in order to ensure their loyalties."

 LEP_jiangnan_loans: "Jiangnan Loans"
 LEP_jiangnan_loans_desc: "The AOG has been hit hard by Black Monday and has been unable to pay the rent on many of their concessions to us. This is unacceptable, but right now there is nothing we can do as we depend on their support. The Jiangnan Consortium has been somewhat isolated from the crisis and have offered us loans, which we should take in order to finance our armies and government."

 LEP_aog_gun_shipments: "AOG Gun Shipments"
 LEP_aog_gun_shipments_desc: "While the AOG does not yet have its finances under control, it has begun to stabilise somewhat. They have large amounts of guns available and we must make sure that these are sent to us, as we are dealing with serious gun shortages. Furthermore, our own production capacities are limited, making their support even more valuable."

 LEP_qis_central_command: "Qi's Central Command"
 LEP_qis_central_command_desc: "The disorganised, decentralised nature of the current governor armies on which we rely is not sufficient for the current conflict. We need to make an effort to establish a unified central command. The governors will retain their authority, but important decisions will now be made in coordination instead of separation."

 LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty: "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
 LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc: "Our officers are all of dubious loyalty. We have a core force that has followed Qi for years, but now that we control much of Sun's former forces as well as the forces of the various provincial governors, we cannot be so sure. The KMT and Shangqing also continue to secretly recruit, so we must make sure our officers are loyal to the cause of the Nanjing Clique, and no other."

 LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation: "Emergency Industry Reallocation"
 LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation_desc: "Much of our limited industry is in disarray. We need to coordinate the industry we have available to focus on military production. As we do not have the resources for this ourselves, we must rely on the Jiangnan Consortium and AOG to help us with this effort. We will leave some assets under their management to ensure that our own incompetent officers will not cause problems."

 LEP_price_controls: "Price Controls"
 LEP_price_controls_desc: "With the collapse of the LEP, our bank notes have become nearly worthless and inflation is rising at a breakneck pace. While price controls are not an ideal solution, we must make sure there is at least a temporary stop to the devaluation in order to properly pay our soldiers. It will hopefully also calm the countryside and put a halt to rising food prices, at least for the time being."

 LEP_suppress_student_unions: "Suppress Student Associations"
 LEP_suppress_student_unions_desc: "The so-called 'patriotic' student associations have been a thorn in our side for a while now. They were the key force behind the anti-concessionist protests and continue to make trouble in the cities. If we shut down their means of organisation, we will hopefully suppress the movement as a whole."

 LEP_enforce_media_controls: "Enforce Media Controls"
 LEP_enforce_media_controls_desc: "The media are complicit in the collapse of the League and they continue to publish negative reports about our administration and continue to slander Qi's name. We must seize control of much of the media in order to put an end to the spread of dangerous information that could compromise our goals."

 #Foreign Policy
 LEP_the_marshal_stands_triumphant: "The Marshal Stands Triumphant"
 LEP_the_marshal_stands_triumphant_desc: "The uppity fools following Governor Chen and the damnable spirits of the Kuomintang thought they could supercede the League! Yet we have undeniably put them back in their place! With the formal ascension of Qi Xieyuan to the role of League Marshal following Sun's truly tragic death, the duty falls upon us to continue the plans of the \"Smiling Tiger\"."

 LEP_two_marshals_under_the_sky: "Two Marshals under the Sky"
 LEP_two_marshals_under_the_sky_desc: "Sun Chuanfang found himself in an odd situation. Ostensibly the Jade Marshal's protege, he was in no way his formally accepted successor. Too estranged, distrusted by the rest of the Northern Zhili. No matter! Qi Xieyuan is an elusive chameleon! Together, the Jade Marshal and the League Marshal shall restore order to the Middle Kingdom, and assert the Zhili's dominance!"

 LEP_deepen_the_zhili_schism: "Deepen the Zhili Schism"
 LEP_deepen_the_zhili_schism_desc: "The perfidious Northern Zhili think of their Southern brethren as nothing more but upstarts, the outer rung, inconsequential! Utilising us as pawns for their own game, they'd be so deeply misunderstood. Sun Chuanfang left with us the legitimacy to fulfil a vision, to be the true heirs to the legacy of Beiyang. Controlling the Southern Capital, we shall march onwards!"

 LEP_joint_training_with_beijing: "Joint Training with Beijing"
 LEP_joint_training_with_beijing_desc: "Truly many of our commanders could learn a large deal of military knowledge and expertise from our Northern counterparts. For our measly Jinling Academy holds nothing but a candle to the legendary Baoding Military Academy. Even on a personal basis, many of our top commanders lack formal military tutorship. Through the conduction of joint exercises, the Zhili is sure to cement itself."

 LEP_negotiate_with_the_nationalistic_elite: "Negotiate with the Nationalistic Elite"
 LEP_negotiate_with_the_nationalistic_elite_desc: "The noble Democracy and Science Forum are a grouping of liberal, nationalist and progressive intellectuals residing within Shanghai and Beijing. Who remain at true disdain with the authoritarian nature of Zhili-ruled provinces within the nation. Mutually distasteful, it is nonetheless the prudent move to bring these men of words to the negotiation table to paint a veneer of genuine intention."

 LEP_utilize_the_jingxing_society: "Utilize the Jingxing Society"
 LEP_utilize_the_jingxing_society_desc: "One of perhaps the most curious intellectuals within Nanjing's retinue is that of the young, boisterous and witty Li Linsi. Carrying with him the Jingxing Society, they are an interest group of intellectuals and civilians far more tolerant of the Zhili, and in return, supportive of a deepening of pro-German relations. Spurned by most but not all, their support could prove invaluable in the schemes to come."

 LEP_foster_economic_cooperation: "Foster Economic Cooperation"
 LEP_foster_economic_cooperation_desc: "One of the greatest benefits of extensive German investment and development within the League's territories is that of the resounding economic power projection potential that the League exhibits. However there is great disparity, as for every Zhejiang there is a Fujian. By cooperating with Beijing and integrating our economies further, perhaps we will have our own Golden Waterway."

 LEP_end_southern_intransigence: "End Southern Intransigence"
 LEP_end_southern_intransigence_desc: "In perhaps the League's most clouded moment, in our darkest hour, the Governors of Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi finally cut ties. Having long been distancing themselves ever since their informal incorporation, the Southerners would find themselves positioned to strike against our own domain in the future. To preserve our legacy, we must be swifter than them!"

 LEP_secure_german_support: "Secure German Support"
 LEP_secure_german_support_desc: "Our loving allies, our true friends! Without the Germans the League would be all but a dependency on the machinations within Beijing. For our grand ambitions, we necessitate even grander support. Through our connections established prior, let us increase the amount of German aid for our recovering economy and army. In return, we secure for them their influence within china."

 LEP_heir_to_the_jade_marshal: "Heir to the Jade Marshal"
 LEP_heir_to_the_jade_marshal_desc: "Truly it is the Southern Zhili that are the successors to the machinations of the Jade Marshal! Once it was Sun Chuanfang, and perhaps Marshal Wu has his own ideas like the weak Bai Jianwu, but without the glorious League Marshal Qi Xieyuan, the Zhili would have very well met their doom at the hands of the Kuomintang, or Fengtian. Even Wu knows this, and surely Beijing must grant us the respect we deserve."

 LEP_last_son_of_the_family: "Last Son of the Family"
 LEP_last_son_of_the_family_desc: "The Northern Zhili have cast away any pretenses they had to the cause of Feng Guozhang! To have cut every branch of the patronage network besides their own! It is not Wu, Cao or Wang who are the heirs to Li Hongzhang however, it is the South! The true last heirs to the legacy of the Chinese Bismarck! With our ambitions ever greater, it is time to march north..."

 #Economics/Politics
 LEP_government_by_coercion: "Government by Coercion"
 LEP_government_by_coercion_desc: "We now rule the League and we must, at all costs, prevent its renewed collapse. We will not make the same mistakes Sun Chuanfang made. Instead, we will build a strong government, based not on weakness, but on strength. We will not shy away from harsh methods in order guarantee its survival."

 LEP_finish_sun_investigation: "Finish the Sun Investigation"
 LEP_finish_sun_investigation_desc: "We have waited long enough to present the results of our investigation into the assassination of the former leader of the League, Sun Chuanfang. It is time to finish up the work and release the results to the public. Hopefully we can spin these results in such a way as to strengthen our position."

 LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists: "Purge the Complicit"
 LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists_desc: "Currently there are still many people in our government of which we cannot be sure that they will support us. Using our release of the results of the Sun assassination investigation, as well as by painting our enemies as complicit in the collapse, we should be able to make many arrests and purge our ranks of their presence."

 LEP_university_oversight_board: "University Oversight Board"
 LEP_university_oversight_board_desc: "We have seen how dangerous students can become if they organise. They were key players in the Anti-Concessionist Movement and will continue to be dangerous if we do not properly keep an eye on them. Therefore we must establish the University Oversight Board, which will make sure that any 'dangerous' individuals within universities are neutralised."

 lep_governor_1: "Now that we again control Zhejiang and Anhui, the governors of which both traitorously rose up against us, we must decide who to replace them with. We must make sure that they are our close allies and will not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. Furthermore, we should also finish formalising relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."
 lep_governor_2: "After the traitorous uprising of the Governor of Anhui, Chen Tiaoyuan, we now once again control his province. We must decide who replaces Chen as Governor of Anhui and make sure that our replacement does not repeat Chen's mistake. Furthermore, we should also finish formalising relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."

 LEP_governor_question: "The Governor Question"
 LEP_governor_question_desc: "[getlepgovernor]"

 LEP_track_down_kmt: "Eradicate KMT Cells"
 LEP_track_down_kmt_desc: "While we might have driven KMT military units out of Fujian, partisans continue to operate within our territory. We also fear that some KMT members may have infiltrated our ranks. We must track down the remaining Kuomintang bases and eliminate the various active KMT cells."

 LEP_crack_down_rural_bandits: "Crack Down on Rural Bandits"
 LEP_crack_down_rural_bandits_desc: "Day in and day out, rural bandits, some having even been former soldiers, continue to terrorise our citizens and officials. Numbered by scoundrels such as the Red Spears and Yiguandao, they continue to stir up trouble. We must begin a formal crackdown on these troubledoers similar to that of the encirclement campaigns, if we are to cripple their movement."

 LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system: "Reconstitute Baojia System"
 LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system_desc: "The baojia system envisioned local control of local militias. It aimed to increase stability and assign local responsibility. While the system failed in the past, it can now be very useful as it allows us to effectively patrol the countryside and allows us to circumvent the governors."

 LEP_xiangyong_inspections: "Xiangyong Inspections"
 LEP_xiangyong_inspections_desc: "If we want the baojia system to become a success, we must ensure that the xiangyong, the local baojia units, behave nicely. Inspections will also allow us another method of control over these local militias without having to worry about the governors."

 LEP_water_infrastructure_commission: "Water Infrastructure Commission"
 LEP_water_infrastructure_commission_desc: "The war has damaged an enormous amount of critical infrastructure designed to protect our cities from the rivers. Dams, dykes, and levees have all been damaged. We need to set up a special commission with adequate funding to repair these immediately. If we wait, floods can potentially endanger millions of Chinese."

 LEP_peace_in_countryside: "Peace in the Countryside"
 LEP_peace_in_countryside_desc: "Now that we have dealt with the most seditious elements that started the war, we can begin the last efforts to fully restore peace to the countryside. For months now, people were afraid to go out and travel, as roads were infested with bandits and rebels. But with our measures and reforms, we have increased security and peace has returned to the countryside."

 LEP_selective_enforcement: "Selective Enforcement"
 LEP_selective_enforcement_desc: "It is not through the law that will achieve legitimacy as a government. We can only achieve this by building a stable government that is not questioned by the people. Therefore, we can afford to selectively apply the law as we see fit. By allowing certain companies and individuals extralegal rights, we can be sure of their support, as we will crack down hard on their enemies."

 LEP_reform_public_security: "Reform Public Security"
 LEP_reform_public_security_desc: "Despite Sun Chuanfang's hyper vigilance, the Smiling Tiger still faced the bullet. Unable to plug every hole to protect himself, it is clear that one of his flaws was that he had no dependable network of agents that maintained security in his name. With Qi's Nanjing Guards, this will now change. With these reforms, Qi will have agents everywhere, which will allow him to react quicker and keep the peace."

 LEP_redoubts_for_revenue: "Redoubts for Revenue"
 LEP_redoubts_for_revenue_desc: "With the recent war still fresh in the minds of our governors, combined with the general instability beyond the borders, means that our governors will be very much occupied with security. We will offer them help in constructing fortifications and other defences, in exchange for them allowing Nanjing to raise additional taxes from their territory."

 LEP_tackle_local_corruption: "Tackle Local Corruption"
 LEP_tackle_local_corruption_desc: "Local corruption is a serious issue. It harms our ability to extract taxes from the local level of government, it takes an unnecessary toll on the local farmers and it fills the pockets of those who do not need it. For this reason, we should begin dealing with this issue. The inspectors we will use for this will also allow us greater control over local governments."

 LEP_green_gang_dealings: "Green Gang Dealings"
 LEP_green_gang_dealings_desc: "We must solicit the help of the Green Gang in Shanghai. These crime lords, major players in the drug trade, will allow us to exert influence on potential investors in the Legation Cities. Using the Green Gang, we will surely be able to expand our influence within the Legations."

 LEP_public_media_campaigns: "Public Media Campaigns"
 LEP_public_media_campaigns_desc: "Our government is viewed negatively by many. We are seen as the ones who sold out to the Germans and cracked down on the patriots who aimed to kick them out. We must ensure that this image disappears by using our control of the press to spread positive messages about our government, while spreading negative messages about our critics."

 LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates: "Appoint Civilian Magistrates"
 LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates_desc: "Many of the provinces and local governments are headed by military men, who depend on their armies for their political power. It is difficult to force them to do anything without fighting. Therefore, we should begin appointing civilian magistrates to positions in local governments and slowly allow them more power, as we can control them more effectively than military men."

 LEP_public_repression: "Public Repression"
 LEP_public_repression_desc: "We do not deceive ourselves by saying we are a friendly and free government. No, we admit that there is only one way to offer the people law and order, and that is through harsh repression of those who speak or act against us. Only if those seditious elements are eliminated, can the people be confident of their safety."

 LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles: "Shut Down Intellectual Circles"
 LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles_desc: "Various groups and circles of highly-respected intellectuals, many of whom supported the Anti-Concessions Movement that lead to the downfall of Sun Chuanfang, continue to speak out against us. We can no longer tolerate this insubordination and must act immediately by prohibiting the meetings of these intellectuals and making sure they remain isolated."

 LEP_crush_urban_unions: "Crush Urban Unions"
 LEP_crush_urban_unions_desc: "Just like the student associations, unions of urban workers have always caused problems. Their strikes undermine our industries and we can never be sure that they do not cooperate with the Left KMT. We must use our authority in the cities to crush these unions and make sure workers do not organise."

 LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi: "Pacification Commissioner Qi"
 LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi_desc: "It is customary to give yourself many different positions and titles to create authority in new areas. Qi Xieyuan is therefore no longer just the League-Marshal, but also Pacification Commissioner. This new position gives him the authority to shut down any seditious act in any area of the League with his own forces, which will allow us to respond much faster in emergencies."

 LEP_pressure_jiangzhe_caifa: "Pressure the Jiangzhe Caifa"
 LEP_pressure_jiangzhe_caifa_desc: "The Jiangzhe caifa, meaning the Jiangsu and Zhejiang zaibatsu, is a group of powerful bankers who control the major banks in the Legations. Using our newly acquired connections, we should attempt to pressure the Jiangzhe caifa to provide us with loans and resources, like they have done to others in the past."

 LEP_solicit_legations_investments: "Solicit Legations Investments"
 LEP_solicit_legations_investments_desc: "The Legation Cities are a great source of wealth. Often now, foreign investors choose to invest in these cities and many rich Chinese move their businesses there. We must present ourselves as an attractive target for investment, something which, considering our new influence in the Legations and our open economy, should not be difficult."

 LEP_expand_jiangnan_arsenal: "Expand the Jiangnan Arsenal"
 LEP_expand_jiangnan_arsenal_desc: "The Jiangnan Arsenal is the linchpin of our military industry. As we further develop our general industry, a special effort to expand the Arsenal would be prudent, as it would allow us to further ramp up our domestic production of military hardware."

 LEP_lower_yangtze_development: "Lower Yangtze Development"
 LEP_lower_yangtze_development_desc: "The heart of the Five Provinces, and thus Qi's power base, lies in the Lower Yangtze region. Developing this area will lead to the greatest gains for Qi, as he effectively taxes and controls the area directly. Furthermore, it is located in a perfect position, which will surely attract much investment."

 LEP_eastern_railway_construction: "Eastern Railway Construction"
 LEP_eastern_railway_construction_desc: "Railways are the lifeblood of China. Without them, industrial transportation comes to a standstill. We must invest heavily in the construction of additional railways and in the renovation of existing ones. The Germans will most definitely want in on this, so we need to decide exactly how we will carry out these plans."

 LEP_heavy_industrial_investments: "Heavy Industrial Investments"
 LEP_heavy_industrial_investments_desc: "Currently, China's industry is mostly for its own consumption. Much of it is also only light industry, as we lack the capability and expertise to produce heavier industrial equipment. If we wish to advance our economy, this must change. With the help of German expertise and new government investments, we will make sure that heavy industry will also be developed in China."

 LEP_new_economic_development: "New Economic Development"
 LEP_new_economic_development_desc: "As the League stabilises and industrial development reaches new heights, we must make optimal use of this. With our opening to the rest of the world, we are in a unique position to develop at a faster pace than any other part of China. We must do all we can to invest in industrial development and the development of this new economy."

 LEP_subsidize_local_communities: "Subsidise Local Communities"
 LEP_subsidize_local_communities_desc: "We have lost support of much of the urban population. Eventually, if our economy develops enough, they will come around. But until that moment, we need the support of another portion of the population, the peasants. For this reason, we must introduce new subsidies for local communities, which will be specifically aimed at rural development. This should help secure their support."

 LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade: "Revitalise the Tea Trade"
 LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade_desc: "The tea trade used to be much more common in southern and eastern China. Furthermore, many of the Chinese peasants lack any kind of monetary income. If we revitalise the growing and selling of tea, we can provide them a new source of income. This will integrate them into the new, modern economy and should spur further growth and development."

 LEP_patronize_xiangshen: "Patronise the Xiangshen"
 LEP_patronize_xiangshen_desc: "The xiangshen, the local landowners, are incredibly valuable allies. If we can secure their support, we can also secure the support of the peasants. We should use our newly acquired control over local governments in their favour, which will show them that we are their strongest ally, not the provincial government. This will also provide us with additional leverage over our governors."

 LEP_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 LEP_modern_agriculture_desc: "While China was once renowned for its efficient farming methods, which in part helped develop our enormous population, we have long since lost that edge. We need to introduce modern methods from the West into our agriculture if we wish to ever escape the dire times of the past century. We can no longer afford to remain behind."

 LEP_cult_of_personality: "Cult of Personality"
 LEP_cult_of_personality_desc: "If Qi Xieyuan, our League-Marshal, wishes to truly entrench his power and influence, he must develop somewhat of a mythical persona. If he achieves an almost cultist following, no man will dare speak up against him. Therefore, we should publish various stories about his life, including his miraculous birth and his personal achievements during the war, such as the destruction of an enemy airplane with only his rifle."

 LEP_network_of_allegiances: "Network of Allegiances"
 LEP_network_of_allegiances_desc: "No man rules alone. For that reason, Qi must maintain a network of allies throughout the League. This network has to be carefully managed, lest it fall apart, which would be disastrous for Qi and the League."

 LEP_dubious_practices: "Dubious Practices"
 LEP_dubious_practices_desc: "If Qi wishes to remain in power, he must use any method as his disposal. While Sun Chuanfang often claimed a moral high ground, in reality most of his actions were guided by securing his leadership. Qi should do the same. In fact, with his tighter control, especially in Nanjing, and with support from the Germans, Qi can possibly afford even more."

 LEP_tsingtau_collaboration: "Tsingtau Collaboration"
 LEP_tsingtau_collaboration_desc: "Our greatest advantage over the other warlords, is that we have the full support of the Germans. Collaboration with the Germans allows us more rapid industrialisation, more advanced technology and more effective armies. We must safeguard this relationship at all costs."

 LEP_german_reconstruction_crews: "German Reconstruction Crews"
 LEP_german_reconstruction_crews_desc: "The League is damaged. The war saw destruction on an unprecedented scales, with thousands upon thousands of dead. Railways were destroyed, cities burned to the ground and factories torched. While the League possesses the manpower to begin reconstruction efforts, it lacks expertise and money. For this reason, specialised German crews should be invited to oversee reconstruction work in many places."

 LEP_krupp_industrial_methods: "Krupp Industrial Methods"
 LEP_krupp_industrial_methods_desc: "If China wishes to modernise, it needs to adopt the methods of those were successful. Krupp is one of the more powerful German conglomerates, active in both the Legations and the AOG. We should invite them to educate our engineers and entrepreneurs of how to develop new industry. We must make sure that China adopts German industrial methods, if we wish to have any chance at all in this world."

 LEP_german_research_aid: "German Research Aid"
 LEP_german_research_aid_desc: "German technology far exceeds our own. We could significantly ramp up our research capabilities if we would have access to cutting-edge German research. We must establish cooperation between universities and research groups in China and Germany."

 LEP_nanjing_university_expansion: "Nanjing University Expansion"
 LEP_nanjing_university_expansion_desc: "Nanjing University is small and underfunded and mostly provides antiquated forms of education. This must change if we want to advance our technological capabilities and innovation. We must expand Nanjing University and ensure a new generation of students will be educated with modern methods."

 LEP_westernized_school_curriculum: "Westernised School Curriculum"
 LEP_westernized_school_curriculum_desc: "Chinese education is backward and outdated. Not only our universities are antiquated, our school system in the smaller cities and towns is as well. Children are educated using useless facts and are in no way prepared for the real world. We must develop a standardised education curriculum based on what is taught in the West, which will hopefully help us advance our studies of modern technologies."

 LEP_deutsch_asiatische_loans: "Deutsch-Asiatische Loans"
 LEP_deutsch_asiatische_loans_desc: "Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has greatly expanded in the past years and has become a major vehicle for AOG and German investment in China. We are currently not utilising this as much as we could. The bank is internationally valued and trusted and could provide us with significant loans for industrial expansion and railway projects."

 LEP_opening_the_interior: "Opening the Interior"
 LEP_opening_the_interior_desc: "The interior has always remained relatively resilient to foreign influence. This has also meant that its many resources have gone mostly unused. We are sure that the Germans are extremely willing to tap into this potential source of resources and we should make an effort to open up the interior to German investments."

 LEP_improved_tungsten_extraction: "Improved Tungsten Extraction"
 LEP_improved_tungsten_extraction_desc: "There are several locations that currently produce tungsten and other valuable metals. We should cooperate with the Germans in improving extraction methods and significantly expand mining operations and production."

 LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion: "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
 LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion_desc: "The Schantung-Eisenbahn railway company has made plans for extensive railway renovations and expansions around our heartland. We should allow them to make their plans a reality.

Though united by its members' fear of central government control, the §PLeague§! is nonetheless a cornerstone of the §cEmpire§!, buttressing §aBeijing§! against both external threats and internal challengers by virtue of shared heritage.\n\nThis tenuous arrangement has brought years of peace, and with them relative prosperity. Foreign industrial methods have proven transformational, and §PSun's§! armies now include several §mGerman-trained§! and equipped divisions at their core. The §PLeague-Marshal§! has come to sit atop a vast bureaucratic pyramid, a position he is more than happy to keep, despite the cracks that have begun to appear at its base. §mGerman material aid§!, necessary to offset pressure from §cBeijing§! and the §PLeague's§! fractious southern members, has not served as a source of strength alone. §mGerman§! money trickles into every level of the §PLeague's§! hierarchy, feeding an already ingrained and unhealthy taste for corruption, with officials complicit in everything from embezzlement to the stolen antiquities trade.\n\nThis has gradually stoked the fires of §Ypopular discontent§!, increasingly harnessed by §nnationalistic agitators§!, and fuelled by the elusive remnants of the §RKuomintang§!. For all §PSun's§! efforts to draw the fragmented §PLeague§! together, it may be drifting all the further apart. Still, these domestic squabbles are outshone by the §nRising Sun§!, which looms large in the east.

 league_events.5.t: "The Sun Investigation"
 league_events.5.d: "When the Smiling Tiger was downed, anarchy became the rule of law within the League. Soldiers mutinied, defected, Chen Tiaoyuan attempted to decapitate the League with his offensive, the National Revolutionary Army rose up from their insurgency for a last hurrah. To put it quite frankly, thousands have already died, and many more deaths are bound to follow if League Marshal Qi's rule is to be cemented. Although numerous factors truly led to the collapse of League authority, be it the much beguiled Governor Chen's power play or the Kuomintang. Some, outside of Marshal Qi's reach, even suggest the Germans and Qi himself contributed towards Sun's demise.\n\nDissuading any of that rabble, besieged on all sides by enemies moreso now than ever, Marshal Qi has quite brilliantly devised a formal investigation into the tragic murder of Marshal Sun Chuanfang. The majority, most fervently Sun's own allies within our camp such as Xie Hongxun, Li Baozhang, Yang Wenkai or Wei Daofeng and numerous others thoroughly do not believe that the assassin, Shi Jianqiao, was working alone. They are all clambering for answers in this fog of mystery. How could she have gotten so close? How could Sun have let down his guard?\n\nSome suggest she worked on behalf of the Kuomintang, an agent of Dai Chunfeng. Others believe she was working on behalf of the North Zhili's information networks, a plan that catastrophically went out of order. Some think she was an agent of Chen Tiaoyuan, what with being the sister of one of his subordinate commanders, Shi Zhongcheng. Others argue simply that it was revenge for the brutal beheading of her father Shi Congbin, a man who died damn near a decade ago.\n\nThere are even rumours abounding within Sun's loyalist circles that League Marshal Qi Xieyuan was the man to snuff out the flame. With recollection and reports indicating that the women utilised a German import weapon, provincial security was particularly lacking, and that she had a man on the inside. Worse still, supposedly the last man to be in audience with Sun's comatose body was none other than Qi himself. None dare speak of it openly however, fearing Qi or his hounds riddling them with bullets.\n\nFor this investigation, there must of course be an investigator. Someone who will lead the case and will find the truth, or at least, whatever Qi needs the truth to be. Four options have been presented to the Marshal. We could choose a man who was close and loyal to Sun, Liu Zongji, who will know him best and know where to look. However, he may not show Qi in the best light, as many loyal to Sun believe Qi was willing to push Sun aside a little too enthusiastically, and have suspicions of him. Another option is to choose Tian Wenbing, a Qi Loyalist, who will make sure the results dare not harm the League Marshal. Furthermor there is the option of a German investigator, which will have far more credibility than one of ours. Finally, we can utilise the Northern Zhili, for they won't have many conflicting loyalties."

That is, if you ignore the fact that the investigator is linked with the League. Nonetheless, many within the League believe that the toppling of Sun was a mere sweeping of a whole house of cards. That if we are to find the root of the assassin's reasoning, the Marshal would be wise to grant our intrepid investigator a lead. Or perhaps even some of the high command's initial speculations and opinions of the events that occurred that day.\n\nNaturally this will assist the investigation, allowing it to progress sooner and have the matter resolved in a timely manner. Even better for the League Marshal personally, it will provide him with some brevity of influence and control over the research and findings of the investigation. Albeit there always remains the fact that the investigator will simply ignore the Marshal's suggestion, sweeping him aside as a biased actor. There still remains the hope though that it may at least sway them slightly."

Whilst many officials fled with documents, and of course wealth, our investigator has informed us that the Sun Investigation report is being quickly finalised.\n\nAfter numerous weeks of prodding, and perhaps intruding too uncomfortably for Qi Xieyuan's liking, the investigator has begun to formalise and gather all of the disparate components together. Drawing a picture, to Marshal Qi's liking or not, the investigation has stayed relatively independent of direct interference, in spite of our initial sense of direction provided.

According to the report, Shi Jianqiao, the woman who shot Sun, was on the payroll of Wang Yujia, Cao Kun's most pre-eminent spymaster. Naturally this conclusion has backing, as the North Zhili have been angling for the subduing of the Southern Zhili's power plays ever since 1929. Having met with Lu Xiangting, who operates known spy rings within the League due to his previous association with Sun, she was sent to Nanjing to act as an intelligence operative on his behalf. Clearly however, she acted rogue. Following with the AOG purchase of the ZheGan Railway, and the increase of unrest, Shi saw it as the perfect opportunity to end Sun once and for all."

According to the report, Shi Jianqiao, the woman who shot Sun, was working on behalf of the machinations of the Germans. Acting in Nanjing as a political spy for the AOG, the report delves into most uncomfortable territory for the League Marshal. It claims that Berlin forced the AOG to purchase the ZheGan Railway to sow dissent, then allowed Shi to have her well sought after revenge. Apparently, the Germans feared that Sun was transitioning oncemore to his Anti-Concessionist stance, bound to reject them any moment. Instead, the Germans acted first, desiring someone more favouriable to their interests.\n\nStopping short of indicting Qi Xieyuan, if the report were to be released as is, it would undoubtedly alienate his German backers."

 league_events.17.d: "In the early hours of this morning, Qi's forces were able to fully capture the Arsenal in Nanjing. Following the deposition of Sun, and the \"coup\" of Qi, Nanjing's forces were split between Sun loyalists and Qi loyalists. Attempts to force Sun's closest top ranking commanders like Xie Hongxun to order these soldiers to stand down failed, as Xie refused to budge.\n\nMany of these troops, their commanding officers, and those within the highest ranks of the military high command still believe Qi is not fit to rule, with some even suggesting that Qi killed Sun himself during the latter's coma so he could take the role of League-Marshal for himself. Since Qi took power, fighting in Nanjing has been widespread and sporadic, with Sun loyalists mainly staging their defiance around the Nanjing Arsenal.\n\nWith the Arsenal's position was one of China's most prolific arms and ammunition manufacturing depot, it proved a tought nut to crack. Even in spite of Qi's elite German trained and armed soldiers. With the fighting brutal, reportedly numerous soldiers died on the League Marshal's side. That was, until Marshal Qi granted permission to utilise artillery.\n\nDevastating the arsenal, the barrages obliterated the defenders. Whilst machinery and the structure is damaged, it is a small price to pay for Qi's continued domination. After all, more is sure to follow."

Whilst they're not armed, as the majority of armed resistance within Nanjing died with those in the Arsenal, many remaining Sun loyalists joined the popular masses in their protests.\n\nDecrying Qi as a \"Hanjian\", they accuse him of putting down the Smiling Tiger, and of being nothing more than a German lackey. Many of them desire an end to the warlordism that has plagued China for years, believing that Sun's calls for national unity and elections were imperative to the emancipation of the Chinese people. Many turned radical, looking back towards the White Sun of the Kuomintang as a superior option to Marshal Qi. Others clamber for an intervention from Beijing.\n\nMarshal Qi proved them wrong. Marching his soldiers into the streets of Nanjing, all from the safety of his new palace, reports from local officers came in that the protests had dispersed easily, albeit with casualties amongst the civilian population. No matter, as such daring action has secured the League Marshal's rule in Nanjing, at least for the time being."

Crushing the closest threat to Nanjing, it would allow the League Army to withstand the onslaught of the Kuomintang, crush Shandong, and then drive South once the National Revolutionary Army loses its spirit.\n\nAll strategic plans have different positives and negatives, both militarily and politically, at least for Qi Xieyuan's rule.

 league_events.20.d: "For as long as the League Marshal can remember, the League Army has been staffed by individuals of less than clear-cut loyalties. Of course you have the Sun hardliners and loyalists, who contribute the majority, but provinces commonly swore loyalty to the provincial governor, not the League Marshal. Therefore it resulted in precarious situation in-which Sun's own personal connection to a provincial governor was the thin barrier between a friend and an enemy.\n\nWith the final betrayal of Chen Tiaoyuan, it has become evidently clear that such a system cannot remain. Those who are not loyal to Nanjing prove themselves possible rebels in the future. How is our military supposed to function when the local officers serving do not hold absolute loyalty to Qi Xieyuan?\n\nTo solve this, over the last few days, a massive purge has occurred across the whole League officer staff. This work has been carried out by the recently established Military Loyalty Committee, a body of investigators whom review all of the officers' histories and past ties. Questioning many within Nanjing not under Qi's retinue, there has already been a sweeping array of arrests.\n\nOfficers found with links to the Kuomintang, Bandits, or some other military warlord, with some ties travelling back a decade, have all been imprisoned indefinitely. Although there are reports of extrajudicial executions occurring behind the veil."

Not as their saviour, but as a tyrant. Ironically, many of the enterprises allude that the League Marshal was an actor in the League's collapse, insinuating that he killed Sun when he was most weak.\n\nAlbeit there remains an opportunity in such travesty. Such publication outlets have proven themselves potentially invaluable in producing propaganda, a merit that cannot be ignored. Therefore, new writers and editors have been offered to the newspaper companies, ostensibly to replace all of those that have been imprisoned.

Naturally, the only answer to such matters is lead. In conducting our final purge, it has become clear that many of the groups before us are large, expansive, and all encompassing. To follow through with such action efficiently, it would be prudent to focus all of our efforts on one of the main groups currently opposing us.\n\nPresently, many within Qi Xieyuan's direct retinue associate the young students of China as the birthplace of dissent and rebellion. Radicals with connections to the Kuomintang, Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, Democracy and Science Forum and other intellectual groups proliferate their associations. Naturally they are no friend of the martial law of Qi Xieyuan. Obviously there remains the present issues of the Party State themselves, alongside the various rural bandit groups conducting an incessant campaign of carnage within our territory. Finally, and of personal pertinence of the League Marshal, there exists Sun Chuanfang's old friends, accomplices, associates and allies.

After all, in either option there are feasibly powerless to challenge the League Marshal. However in this group there remains criminals and rebels who, given the chance, will bring about the end of stability and society as we know it.\n\nPotentially spurning on another League Collapse, and the assassination of Marshal Qi, many within the Marshal's retinue have advised him to follow through with immediate execution. No half measures. Similarly to the former option, if they'd dead, they cannot challenge the Marshal's rule. Either way, Qi has the final choice."

With League Marshal Qi's most elite military police clearing street after street of possible opposition to the League Marshal, the prisons within the League began to overflow with enemies of the regime. Not even the village was spared, as rural regions frequently had their local magistrates and councillors replaced wholesale, or wheeled out in binds.\n\nSitting upon this pyramid of backstabbing, fear, and brutality is League Marshal Qi. A man who was previously forced into exile a decade ago, now one of the most powerful men in the whole nation. Of course, Qi still remains far within Sun Chuanfang's shadow, although surely he will eclipse the Smiling Tiger soon enough."

 league_events.27.d: "Not too unfamiliar with the dark underworld of China's urban centres, Qi Xieyuan still remained an odd duck amongst those unscrupulous individuals that numbered its havens. Dispatching his ever loyal Tian Wenbing to conduct weeks of many arrangements, Qi has managed to win the attention of one Du Yuesheng. An infamous gangster within Shanghai, he is renowned for all manner of illegal acts. Trafficking, laundering, abduction, if you can name it, Du would likely chime in that he's done it. Although Qi also happens to know of Du's connections with Kuomintang spymaster Dai Chunfeng, a secret he holds as a loaded gun.\n\nOne of the main leaders of the Green Gang, a renowned criminal \"enterprise\", as Du refers to it, within Shanghai, establishing a working business relationship between the League and the Green Gangs will undoubtedly prove mutually beneficial.\n\nSituated within a quiet hall in a small street in Wuxi, any passerby would be completely unaware of the dastardly deals being made within its confines. Numerating the room were of course, League Marshal Qi, Tian Wenbing, and a few other high level officers on the League's side. Opposite sat perhaps the most oppulent display of flagrant immorality this side of the Great Wall. Puffing cigars, with their feet propped up on the discussion table, were Du Yuesheng and his Shanghai mobsters.\n\nMost high level officials didn't even know of the meeting, and only minimal guards were present. Discussion occurred for hours, with Du playing particularly coy to Qi's advances for the majority. At the end however, a plan was devised and agreed upon. Unofficially titled \"The Du Nanjing Scheme\", it stipulates that Du will use his high level and shady business connections to funnel more capital through Nanjing, allowing Qi to maintain a stable currency balance. To pay for this, Nanjing will keep Du on a direct payroll, with the agreement that 40% of his wages will be used in pushing pro-Chinese business in the Legation Cities.\n\nWith Qi's gloved hand shaking Du's firm one, the two men and their respective parties nodded, parting ways into the dark of night. Following the meeting, many witnesses were dealt with, and payments began rolling in. On both sides."

Although they maintain numerous dealings all across the country, Shanghai has, and always will be, the main hub of their enterprises. However, with the recent cloak-and-dagger agreements made between Du Yuesheng and Qi Xieyuan, the Green Gang has began to infiltrate the urban maze of Nanjing too.\n\nThough the Nanjing police under Sun Chuanfang would normally have stepped in to try and curb the growth of illegal gangs, it would appear that the Nanjing polce commissioner has stopped such occurrences happening. Stating that the police should focus on beating \"enemies of the state\". Naturally many assume that he was paid off by the Green Gang. However, the truth of the matter is that the police commissioner himself despises bribes, and hasn't accepted any.\n\nPerhaps the fact that League Marshal Qi recently had Sun's police commissioner executed and replaced by his own personal choice might have some relevance..."

 league_events.30.d: "Perhaps League Marshal's declaration of total victory over the populace of Nanjing was premature. Although one can only say that in hindsight. Tensions have begun to erupt oncemore within Nanjing, in-part due to the rise of multiple Anti-League activist groups. Suddenly receiving inflows of staggering amounts of currency, weapons, and ammunition, violence has begun to erupt once more. With military police clashing with Anti-Qi terrorists and protestors, embers of unrest are being inflamed oncemore.\n\nConsidering his options, and wondering who their new benefactor is, League Marshal Qi has made no public comment on the rise of violence within Nanjing, althoug hrumours abound that he is drafting a plan to vanquish such inconceivable troubledoers for the last time."

Similarly, such a story is accompanied by a report that another two bodies have been found dumped on the streets in the slums of Nanjing. With the two victims having been identified as more high level Anti-Qi activists. They were also beaten to death, and rope marks on their hands and the extend of the beating implies they were tortured.\n\nEight men of different characteristics were arrested in suspicion of committing said brutal crimes. Upon further inspection, they were all identified as members of League Marshal Qi's personal policing unit. Only sitting within their cell for five hours, they were promptly released, with League Marshal Qi informing the Nanjing police commissioner that they were not connected to the murders at all. Qi himself emerged infront of journalists to formally announce the formation of a team to investigate these series of deaths. Albeit progress on such matters is unlikely.\n\nInterviewing the eight men after the fact, the Marshal would be informed that all fifteen victims had ties to the Green Gang, albeit nothing more than materiel support and financing. Despite the revelation, the Anti-Qi protests have had their ringleaders vanquished, and the city is safe once again."

Especially with recent information regarding their ties to Anti-Qi resistance groups that began to proliferate following our deal. Nonetheless, the League Marshal understands the callous, cutthroat nature of the Chinese underworld.\n\nRecently, the amount of our investments from Legations businessmen in Nanjing increased drastically, opening new factories, hiring workers, and boosting our economic sector. Despite his sentiments, Du is undoubtedly a man of his word, and has pulled through in directing Legation business towards the League."

Far dislodged from a wide sweeping insurgency, it nonetheless still proves dangerous for our men.\n\nReportedly conducting a regular patrol today, a group of our soldiers were ambushed by a band of Kuomintang guerrillas near [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Swiftly encircling our men, they successfully overpowered and killed them. Further parties were planned to be dispatched to find the culprits, but were ultimately deemed futile."

 league_events.42.d: "Apparently, while a local military transport train in [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] stopped to on-board supplies for the nearby market town, Kuomintang League of Ten agents waited for its passengers to depart, snuck up to the train, placed several bombs beneath it, and swiftly escaped. When the bombs detonated, they completely destroyed the train, all the supplies, as well as a section of the narrow-gauge railway it was on. Rendered completely useless and in need of immediate repairs, their terroristic act will undoubtedly cost the administration dearly. The League of Ten agents have still not been tracked down, most likely have folded into the peasant crowds for refuge."

 league_events.43.d: "Tensions remain high in the South, as we are forced to send more and more troops and military police over to keep the region secure. During some training of new military police in [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], multiple Kuomintang League of Ten agents infiltrated the barracks and executed multiple officers. Fleeing before the military police could catch them, multiple small bombs detonated around and inside the barracks. Killing half of the training squadron, and injuring the rest. Undoubtedly, the barracks themselves will necessitate repair too."

Just around midnight, sudden explosions echoed throughout the area, as multiple bombs were detonated within the industrial district. Nigh demolishing a factory, it has started to inspire the people of [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to rally the government to do something about the recent resistance efforts.

 league_events.45.d: "Since the defeat of Chairman Wang Jingwei and the MinGan Insurgency led by Song Qingling and Deng Yanda, tensions have remained high in [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The military presence of our units and the Kuomintang sympathies of the local populace have resulted in minor conflicts occuring commonly. Such scuffles and skirmishes were bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, walked past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to fire shots at them.\n\nKilling one soldier but being put down by the rest, his supposed sacrifice was but a mere distraction. As while our soldier's attention was diverted towards the singular target, a large group of National Revolutionary Army troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, vanquishing all of them.\n\nReceiving acclamation from the populace, the NRA soldiers began to secure more peasants for their little uprising. As the day went on, more of the League's loyal soldiers rose to challenge the NRA, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, as the NRA soldiers disappeared into the dark."

Today, multiple bombs were detonated in [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], centred around the main industrial complexes. Though there were no casualties, the factory has been nigh demolished, resulting in but a shell of mortar and concrete unable to produce. Leaving messages at the scene, the Kuomintang have denounced our League Government, and have called for the people to rise up in revolt of the autocratic League Marshal. A message many within [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are receptive towards."

 league_events.47.t: "Battle in [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 league_events.47.d: "[?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], still a hotbed of Kuomintang activities, has faced a massive uprising orchestrated by the National Revolutionary Army. Around 400 NRA troops went into the main square of the city, killed any police and soldiers in it, and quickly entrenched themselves with hastily put together fortifications. It took multiple offensives from our own men, and the rather unfortunate deployment of artillery to even be able to drive the NRA from the square. Amongst the chaos and the civilians who fled or perished in our artillery barrages, the Guerrillas quickly retreated back into the back streets, eventually harboured in the homes of many of the peasants living there.\n\nHowever, the officer leading the attack in the square, the one who authorised the assault, decided that he should drive the Kuomintang from [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] once and for all. Conducting a rather burtal raid, the officer sent over 200 soldiers on a systematic killing spree throughout the city. Hundreds of civilians were lined up and shot, and the houses of many were burned to the ground.\n\nUpon hearing the news, League Marshal Qi had it fed to him through the term of \"The [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Massacre\". Ordering the detaining of the officer, his retaliation was viewed as too little, too late, by the local population. Sentiments which were further inflamed upon the officer's release only three hours later."

Firing from the heights only to disappear minutes later, the much believed to be Kuomintang guerrillas have left only death and destruction in their wake. So serious is the problem that many local people now refuse to provide their services in moving goods through these areas, no matter how much they are paid.\n\nOfficials in the region have assured us that this problem will be dealt with in short order, no doubt by press-ganging civilians and doubling patrols. Unfortunately, it will take more than doubled patrols to truly cure this Kuomintang disease of the heart."

 league_events.49.t: "Multiple Factory Bombings"
 league_events.49.d: "In the very early morning, multiple factories were bombed across the south in our country. The attacks were obviously coordinated closely and such organised, systematic destruction can be produced by the Kuomintang's League of Ten. However, following recent attacks our own soldiers have been installed at such facilities. And therefore following this most tragic sweeping attack, numerous of our own men were brutalised."

 league_events.50.d: "Finally we have done it! After months of arduous tracking of Kuomintang activities, months of frustrating their efforts, months of planning. It has all finally paid its due diligence. Utilising contacts within the Green Gangs of Shanghai, we were able to capture a series of core members of the Kuomintang's League of Ten. After conducting brutal torture in-person, League Marshal Qi Xieyuan managed to extract the headquarters of Deng Yanda's last stand. Executing all League of Ten members there and then, the Marshal planned his next move.\n\nLocated within Fujian, Marshal Qi personally oversaw the encirclement and annihilation of the compound. Completely razed to the ground, not a single recognisable face remained. Most frustratingly however, key figures such as Deng Yanda, Dai Chunfeng and Ye Ting were nowhere to be found, even amongst the smoke. No matter, with their resources completely exhausted, and their second Insurgency smothered in its cradle, League Marshal Qi officially declared the movement of the Left Kuomintang destroyed."

 league_events.51.t: "Opium Storage Warehouse in Xuzhou Pillaged"
 league_events.51.d: "Naturally, the loss of any and all authority within the League has resulted in the vast proliferation of numerous bandit groups. Roaming the rural countryside, they are fighting not for any idealist revolution like the Kuomintang, but merely for their own survival and profits. Their natural inclination for the latter has resulted in an increase in attacks and raids on various illegal opium storage warehouses all throughout the League. Most recently that of Xuzhou.\n\nWhilst having less opium is not necessarily a negative, there are fears that they will proceed to sell and distribute the opium, strengthening the black market. Similarly, in their raid they managed to both kill the opium smugglers, and our own soldiers, before making off with their ill-gotten gains."

 league_events.52.d: "Continued their incessant preservation of chaos, carnage and anarchy, various bandit groups have robbed a series of merchant caravans in the North of the League, killing or abducting all of those that were travelling along with the caravan train. Petitioning local authorities for a ransom of those they captured, the local magistrates had no choice but to pay them, quite handsomely. Such acts of blatant extortion by those damnable bandits have shown a striking weakness in our governance, especially within Qi Xieyuan's direct province of Jiangsu."

 league_events.53.d: "Regular patrols of the League's soldiers are a normal, annual occurence in the aftermath of the League Collapse. With rural banditry having seen a startingly rise since the League War, even our own men are not safe from their clutches. Soldiers on patrol in a northern village were attacked out of nowhere by a large band of dozens of well-armed bandits. These people, whose had lost everything in the League War, reverted to robbing and looting to sustain their livelihoods. Such acts became infamous in the local village, leading to the local magistrate instituting a patrol. But still the village wasn't safe, as nearly twenty of its militia, and ten of our own soldiers have now been killed."

 league_events.54.t: "Town Invaded by Rural Bandits!"
 league_events.54.d: "Again the massive loss of authority within Jiangsu province has resulted in massive chaos occuring. This time however, one of the larger bandit clans managed to invade and occupy an entire town. After recruiting the former occupants, and imprisoning those who resisted, various soldiers under the authority of Zheng Junyan were sent to investigate. Only to be met with the entire town barricaded, fortified, and preparing for a siege. Drafting a larger amount of soldiers, Zheng Junyan's subordinate managed to drive away the bandits, allowing the village people imprisoned to be released. Despite killing hundres of bandits, many of them fled with their new recruits from the village, replacing their losses. Whilst our men that perished will not see as swift reinforcements."
 league_events.54.a: "You have got to be kidding me."

 league_events.55.t: "Bandit Groups Take Over Military Barracks"
 league_events.55.d: "In response to recent military encirclement campaigns enacted against the droves of roaming bandit clans, they have chosen to retaliate by attacking and taking over a military complex at the edge of a city in Jiangsu. Hundreds swarmed the barracks, killing many soldiers, after which they barricaded themselves within. Soon, the city fell into chaos as looting became widespread. Authorised under the League Marshal's authority as Governor of Jiangsu, Qi's elite German trained divisions managed to recapture the barracks and restore authority within the city with minimal casualties. However such an event should not have even occurred in the first place, and is a flagrant display of Qi's lack of authority."
 league_events.55.a: "They cannot keep this up for long."

 league_events.56.t: "Railway Occupied in Jiangsu"
 league_events.56.d: "Today, a series of bandit groups barricaded and occupied stretches of a railway outside the crucial rail junction at Xuzhou, even destroying it at some parts. As it is territory under Zheng Junyan's auspices, it had befallen under his command to see swift retribution. Encircling the bandits, Zheng proceeded to follow through with a systematic annihilation of their forces. Vanquishing all of the bandits, it did result in many casualties on our own side.\n\nMore imperative, to the League Marshal at least, is the infrastructural damage that the bandit's occupation wrought. Whilst they most stuck to seizing towns, attacking patrols, and other managable nuisances, the damage of infrastructure that is utilised by his German benefactors is most troubling. Practically the very veins by which the lifeblood of our country is transported upon, on which much of our economy rests. The bandits may very well sink the League."
 league_events.56.a: "\"I have toppled whole regimes! I can deal with bandits!\""

 league_events.57.t: "Massacre of Bandit Members"
 league_events.57.d: "Escalating the conflict against the rural bandits in the North, the League Marshal authorised a brutal policy of extreme prejudice. Perhaps viewing such insurrection within his own province as a personal slight, he has overseen the direct \"euthanisation\", as he calls it, of the bandit disease. Locating one of their local camps, situated dangerously close to a rural village, Qi ordered his soldiers to surround the village, and to goad the bandits into attacking.\n\nSwiftly things escalated, with the villagers terrorised and retaliating in fear, they were adjorned by the bandits nearby. As the soldiers turned around to execute the marauders, they would be attacked by the local villagers. Resulting in a bloodbath, nearly a thousand are dead. Whilst Qi fired the local officer for his use of excessive force, the media outlets have already caught wind of the massacre, and are haranguing the League Marshal about his brutality."
 league_events.57.a: "This doesn't look good."

 league_events.58.t: "End of the Rural Bandits"
 league_events.58.d: "Finally, all of the rural bandit clans that have appeared in the wake of the authority's collapse within Jiangsu have been neutralised. With the last clan being personally encircled by Zheng Junyan, its members were arrested and tossed into jail. A comparitively lighter punishment as opposed to what League Marshal Qi demands, Zheng has staked his own career on the line to see the bandits rehabilitated, claiming that they are merely victims of their circumstances. Nonetheless, a lot of lives were lost to restore order in the Northern Countryside, but Jiangsu can once again be declared wholly safe. The damage that the rotten bandits did to the province will undoubtedly live long in infamy, but now is a period of reconstruction and revision."

 league_events.59.t: "Business Acumen of the League Marshal"
 league_events.59.d: "Compared to the shady low down meeting with Du Yuesheng, Qi's meeting with the bankers of the Jiangzhe Caifa was a breath of fresh air. Meeting in one of the bankers' mansions in Shanghai, Qi and a few of his officers were treated to delicious food served by the bankers' maids and servants. Armed mercenaries stood guard around the building while the bankers arrived. Preliminary discussions were nice and calm, however the attitude changed when the group got to business.\n\nLeague-Marshal Qi made his stance clear: for the Jiangzhe Caifa to continue to do as much business as they do throughout the League, they must offer Nanjing resources and loans to be used \"to protect their business interests for them\". Of course, the bankers did not react well to this, claiming that they could protect their own financial institutions, and anyway, their profits from the League were minor compared to the profits they've found in the Legation Cities.\n\nQi was ready for this line though, as he stated clearly that should they not give these resources to Nanjing \"the Green Gang will make sure you never do business in Shanghai ever again\". Several of the men were shocked at what they heard. Perhaps Qi had made a mistake. It was an open fact that many of these bankers were also paying off the Green Gang, and most likely have better relations with their leaders than Qi, who has only met Du Yuesheng once.\n\nAs the bankers began to discuss the resources to be sent to Nanjing though, a wave of relief flowed through Qi. After another couple of hours of discussion it was decided, and the loans and resources will start coming in soon."

 league_events.60.d: "Reportedly the Ministry of Finance within the League has reported a large, mysterious, shipment of money and weapons. Whilst the clerks of the ministry are unsure of its origins, one thing is evidently clear: it is addressed towards the League Marshal. It would appear that Marshal Qi's dealings with the Jiangzhe Caifa Banking clan has finally bore fruit. Effectively amounting to a continued bribe to ensure their businesses within the League maintain functionality, Qi has taken one step further into turning the League into a truly corrupt network of fear and patronage."

 league_events.100.t: "Supremacy of the Usurper"
 league_events.100.d: "Following the tense aftermath in the wake of Sun Chuanfang's shooting, few imagined that the League would ever recover. Sun Chuanfang, the Smiling Tiger, he was as much the League as the League was him. Without the Marshal, could they withstand a chance? What of the future? Sun had been able to weather the storm with skillful diplomacy, raw conviction and military genius. Few believed that the usurper Qi Xieyuan, much derided by even his own \"allies\", would even be able to potentially harness a fraction of Sun's statesmanship.\n\nAnd yet, here he is. After many months of devastating fighting, besieged on all sides, the League of (now) Five Provinces remains. Skillfully crushing Chen Tiaoyuan's rival Anhui Army, the National Revolutionary Army down South, and many other dissidents, Qi finds himself at the top of the House of Cards.\n\nAll traitors, Kuomintang members, rural bandits, and Anti-Concessionists are undoubtedly planned to be crushed by the iron fist of Qi. However, his leadership is far from escure. Thought the Kuomintang have been beaten in the field for the third time by the League, reports have come back stating that units rallying around Deng Yanda are contiuing to wage a guerrilla war against the League. Similarly, the rural bandits have propped up their own, if disorganised, form of resistance.\n\nWorse still, the intellectuals, students, and Anti-Concessionists continue to hound the Marshal. As evidenced by Chen Tiaoyuan's betrayal, not even those who claim loyalty to the League Marshal are safe from persecution. For who knows if they are merely lying in wait to stab the League in the back. And of course, the spectre of the Smiling Tiger looms large. With the fighting now settled, Sun's associates have turned their attention to Qi, suspicion draped upon their eyes."

 league_events.102.t: "The Governor Question"
 league_events.102.d_1: "League Marshal Qi never trusted Chen Tiaoyuan. Even when they were both Governors underneath Sun. He was anti-German, refusing to see the benefit from partnerships with the European behemoth. His loyalty too, was untenable. Having briefly flirted with the Fengtian Clique, he maintained a very close friendship with the likes of Zhang Zongchang. Albeit that was not an oddity, as Sun himself was also friends with the Dogmeat General. Naturally, with Sun rendered incapable of leading, Chen staked his chance to secure leadership of the League. Nearly bringing it to the edge of ruin.\n\nIt is clear that, due to his anti-German policies, the province of Anhui is in dire need of a Governor pliable and at the whims of the League Marshal. Such a decision is paramount, as Anhui province is one of the more profitable, stable, and influential provinces within the nation. Realistically, at least to the League Marshal, there are two main options.\n\nThe first is appointing Sun Chuanfang's right-hand man, Xie Hongxun, to the position. Considered Sun's most indispensable general, and most loyal, these attributes would normally be viewed as a detriment. However many still see Qi as a usurper, and so placing a Sun loyalist to such a high level position within the League would undoubtedly prove a popular move. Although he is independently minded enough that he might prove an obstacle in the future.\n\nThe second option, suggested by Tian Wenbing, is particularly radical. With the League Collapse starting with Anhui's breakaway, perhaps it would be prudent to centralise the League slightly more. Placing Anhui under League Marshal Qi, this would result in two provinces, alongside Nanjing, all being under the control of a singular man. Undoubtedly propelling the League Marshal's power even further, it would allow the other provinces to be kept on a tight leash. Although such a move would be unpopular both with the Governors and the population at large."

However, the situation in the League is clearly unstable, and to make matters worse Sun himself has been shot. Thankfully, his replacement in Nanjing, Qi Xieyuan, is likely to become even more reliant on us than Sun was.

With Chen Tiaoyuan receiving arms and ammunition from his backers and the Kuomintang from the Internationale, the League insofar has had to rely upon its stockpiles and the Nanjing Arsenal. However it would appear that our German benefactors have not forgotten about our plight. Recently the League received a shipment of various sorts of infantry equipment, ferried through Shanghai. Carrying the branding of the German East Asian Administration, it would appear that the Admiralty and Colonial Office has noticed the situation within the League. Fearful of losing their influence within China, this carries as an informal recognition of League Marshal Qi's authority. At least from the German side."

 league_events.114.d: "Eradicating the Zhejun Clique from their province of Zhejiang has resulted in the local administration being bereft of leadership. Without Chen Yi's clique, or the forces of Shangguan Yunxiang, the province has been placed under a period of martial law until a new governor can be appointed to restore order. With Governor Chen Yi having long been a rather estranged factor within the League's requisite leadership, it was no surprise that he folded to Chen Tiaoyuan when the situation deteriorated. Taking with him the majority of the Zhejiang Clique, it has left very little options for the replacement of Zhejiang Governor. Although there remains at least two main candidates.\n\nFirst is that of Zhou Fengqi, reluctant garrison commander of Nanjing. A noted diehard supporter of the Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, Zhou was eyed with suspicion following Xia Chao's earlier rebellion in the 1920s. Placed within Nanjing by Sun, Zhou was forced into suppressing the Shanghai uprising of 1932. Harbouring a grudge against Sun, he would prove an amicable option for Governor. Albeit he is devoutly against centralisation.\n\nThe second option is that of Meng Zhaoyue. Another Sun Chuanfang loyalist, Meng himself has proven to be one of Sun Chuanfang's most resilient followers. Working together with Zhou Fengqi, he occupied the position of joint Garrison Commander. Commander of the Zhejiang 10th Composite Brigade, his installation would prove widely popular with the populace and government.

A competent general, Zhou's infamous for his levying of exorbitant taxes against the local population, resulting in the Kuomintang movement developing in droves. Nonetheless, Zhou commanded the various German advised encirclement campaigns against the National Revolutionary Army, bringing a level of control to Fujian that was not achieved by previous Governors. Unfortunately however, Zhou's main negative is that of his extremely close friendship to the late Sun Chuanfang. Having been classmates many years ago, their relationship was always a close one.\n\nWhilst Fujian has developed admirably under Zhou, it still remains one of the most impoverished provinces within the nation. Naturally the decision to replace Zhou has drifted into the League Marshal's mind, as it would remove a potential rival, and perhaps win a province's popular support.\n\nPresently his potential replacement is that of Kong Zhaotong. Having served in Sun Chuanfang's army ever since 1913, he would become commander of the 13th Division of the Beiyang Army, and would stay at Sun's side weathering the storm all throughout the 1920s. Particularly an open secret, Kong retains sensibilities and loyalties towards both the Kuomintang, the Anti-Concessionist movement, and other intellectual groups. The only reason he is on League Marshal Qi's radar is his malleability, and the fact that an appointment of a perceived radical will shore up both support in Fujian and across the whole League."

Fang Benren. Originally from Hubei, Fang would be transferred to the Jiangxi Governor's Office in 1913, becoming Garrison Commander of the Western and Southern portions of the province in the 1920s. Serving under Jiangxi Governor Cai Chengxun, Fang would instead see Cai deposed after being ordered to attack the revolutionaries within Guangdong, a group Fang has sympathies for.\n\nBecoming Governor himself, he would be the man who would formally incorporate Jiangxi into Sun's League of Five Provinces, however he would be forced to resign by Wu Peifu a year later. Briefly flirting with the Kuomintang, Fang would serve as Commander of its 11th Army, albeit he would flee once the German Intervention captured Guangzhou. Reportedly, he had already made overtures to both Qi and Chen Tiaoyuan about his potential re-appointment to Jiangxi.

Indeed Marshal Qi is reportedly grateful for Wu Peifu and Cao Kun's assistance, but he is the King of the Southeast, and his domain is hardly fit to become engulfed in the inferno entrapping the North.\n\nOr so we believe. Albeit our benefactors within the Nanking-Kommission, German Consulate and the AOG have other plans. Issuing a joint statement to the League Marshal, they have expressed their \"severe dismay\" at our lack of assistance for the war affecting Beijing, and have urged the Southern Zhili to back their Northern Counterparts. To sweeten the deal and entice the Marshal, they have also promised to supply modern German weaponry and capital to aid in our war effort.\n\nWhilst we can refuse, that would bring with it far more detrimental drawbacks rather than positives, and so accepting is highly favoured by Qi Xieyuan's staff. However, can the League Marshal tolerate being bossed around by perfidious Europeans?"

Indeed Marshal Qi is reportedly grateful for Wu Peifu and Cao Kun's assistance, but he is the King of the Southeast, and his domain is hardly fit to become engulfed in the inferno entrapping the North.\n\nHistorical animosity between the North and South Zhili branches naturally meant that neither Marshal Wang Chengbin nor Jade Marshal Wu peifu attempted to rally League Marshal Qi Xieyuan into the ZhiFeng War. And yet, it would appear even desperate times like these can bridge all divides. This morning a joint telegram addressed to Marshal Qi was received within the Marshal's Palace in Nanjing. Signed by President Cao, Marshal Wu, and Marshal Wang, it most eloquently requests the intervention of the League in the war against Fengtian.\n\nMaking no pretenses, it acknowledges that Qi is unlikely to accept, but it practically pleads for the Marshal to put away his grandstanding and scheming for a show of brief unity, lest both Zhili Cliques be vanquished by Japan."

 league_events.206.t: "Chen Xuezhao"
 league_events.206.d: "The daughter of peasants, Chen Xuezhao was born in Haining in Zhejiang province in 1906. She was educated at the Girl's Normal School in Nantong County and then was educated at the university level by attending the Shanghai Patriotic Girl's College. Here she joined the Qiancao Literary School and published her first work Wo suo qiwang de xin funü “The Women of my New Ideal” in 1923. Furthermore Chen published an article in the New Women Magazine that sought to explore the phenomenon of women choosing to remain single.\n\nAfter a brief stint of teaching in Zhejiang and Beijing, Chen moved to Paris in 1927, in awe of the new socialist regime that had taken place. An ardent leftist, Chen greatly admired the revolution in France and frequently met with the exiles of the leftist KMT such as Wang Jingwei. After completing her Ph.D. at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1935, she returned to her home country of Zhejiang in the League of Eight Provinces. The crushing of the leftist KMT and the suppression of socialism following the league's victory has not discouraged Chen from writing however. The writer has come up with “Talks in Paris on Arts and Literature”, a paper explaining the movement towards proletariat art and contains excerpts from influential French artists such as Andre Breton. While her work may be innocent and is certainly appealing with the masses who are interested in the arts abroad, there are many who believe her works are nothing more than radical socialist propaganda."

 league_events.207.d: "Born in 1895, in rural Yixing, Jiangu, Xu Beihong from an early age was trained in the arts of the classic Chinese works and calligraphy. After studying in Fudan University and Tokyo, he learned French and began to teach at the Peking University's Art school at the invitation of the educator Cai Yuanpei. Winning a scholarship at the prestigious National High School of Art in Paris in 1919, he would embark on a decade-long journey in Europe. His stay in Paris would be unexpected as the French nation fell into revolution and the new socialist regime began to take hold and influence art. Heavily inspired by the European traditions of classic art and culture, Xu took the name of Ju Peon while in France and studied at the prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. He would incorporate creative and innovative elements in his artwork inspired by the so called “proletariat” art. His journey in Europe ended in 1927 and he made his home in Nanjing where he began teaching at the National Central University.\n\nIn 1933, Xu organised an exhibition of modern Chinese art that travelled to France, Germany, and Belgium. Xu's work while highlighting the classic styles favoured by European audiences would also showcase scenes of Chinese life and culture - all of which was found to be very fascinating. For Europeans such as the Germans, the brilliance of Xu's Chinese brush and ink techniques combined with Western perspectives and composition were a sign of China's growing modernity."

 league_events.208.d: "Born to a poor fisherman's family in Nanchang in Jiangxi province, Chiungtze C. Tsen was forced to take intermittent breaks in his education to work due to his poverty. In 1917, he passed the entrance examination and was admitted to Jiangxi Provincial First Normal College in Nanchang. After graduation in 1920, he would go on teach in primary and secondary schools and entered the National Wuchang University with an emphasis on mathematics. In 1928, Tsen went to study overseas in Germany and attended the University of Gottingen where he studied algebra under Emmy Noether. He received his doctorate degree in 1934 and his dissertation on quasi-algebraic closure would lead to his proof of a fundamental theorem which was named in his honour. As a research fellow sponsored by both Chinese and German academic foundations in the hopes of fostering further goodwill between the two nations, Tsen would return to China in 1937 to teach at Hangzhou.\n\nDespite the chaos of the League War, Tsen has remained active in academic circles and has recently published his third paper in the journal of the Chinese Mathematical Society. As a professor of mathematics and a fluent reader of German, his work demonstrates that China can indeed catch up to the standards of Western education."

 league_events.209.d: "Her beautiful and unique voice rings out from gramophones from Shanghai's most fashionable clubs to the grand halls of Nanjing - Zhou Xuan has exploded into popularity across China. As the situation in China politically remains constantly at the edge and the country is plagued with internal and external issues, Zhou Xuan's music has remained a reassuring pillar in the turbulent times. Perhaps compelling is her own personal life story - a life full of poverty and woe and one that many of her listeners can relate to.\n\nBorn Su Pu and separated from her natural parents at a young age, she was sold by a relative at three. At the age of 13, she would take the name “Zhou Xuan” as her stage name, her name meaning “beautiful jade.” And indeed, like a beautiful jade that is admired, she has released hits that have been popular throughout China, such as “Nights of Shanghai/Ye Shanghai,” “Blooming Flowers and the Full Moon,” and the “Song of Four Seasons.” And yet, despite the glamour, her personal life has been marked with failed marriages, illegitimate children, and even rumoured suicide attempts. Yet, her life provides a respite to the chaos in China as her rise from rags to riches will undoubtedly inspire others. Performing throughout China and impressing foreign dignitaries, Zhou Xuan's music brings light in an otherwise dark period for the Chinese people."

 league_events.211.t: "Recovering the Lost Provinces"
 league_events.211.d: "Having long remained outside our true authority, the Western provinces of the Eight Provinces, being Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi, are an elusive bunch. Ostensibly expanding to encompasse those prior provinces in 1928, League influence would only finally reach the provinces in 1929, and even that was half-hearted. Following the Fourth ZhiFeng War, League Marshal Sun and the Jade Marshal would enter into a sort of standoff between the North and South Zhili Cliques. Caught inbetween, the whole Southwest was the battleground for power plays, pulling leverages such as autonomy or protection from the other party's encroachment.\n\nAnd so such an equilibrium was shattered in the League Collapse. Following the formal joint secession from the League by Guangxi and Guangdong, and later Hunan, the League would be embroiled in a fight for its very survival. Too focused on efforts in the East, it could hardly protest the proper independence of the Western provinces, to be expected anyway as they had been distancing themselves periodically ever since their incorporation.\n\nHowever here we are. Back and better than ever before. With our provinces reconstructed, our armies drilled, and our commanders drafting war plans, the campaign to reclaim the Western provinces of the League is upon us. After all, we are backed by the Central Government, we need only officialise things with our ever graceful Marshals Wu Peifu and Wang Chengbin."
 league_events.211.a: "Surely Beijing will accept..."

 league_events.212.t: "Expansion of the Southern Zhili?"
 league_events.212.d: "A series of twin telegrams reached the headquarters of Marshal Wang and Marshal Wu earlier today. Ostensibly addressed to both Marshals in a most eloquent manner, it appears to have arrived from the League Marshal within Nanjing. Before even beginning to decipher the text, Marshal Wu telephoned Marshal Wang, informing him of an imminent war council to assemble within Luoyang to address the telegram. Surprised, and only mildly belligerent as per usual, Marshal Wang agreed, quipping he was about to phone Wu to ask the same thing.\n\nAssembling rapidly, Marshal Wu's entourage and company retained that of Zhang Qihuang, Bai Jianwu and Li Bingzhi. With Marshal Wang entering the discussion chamber after him, he was flanked by the likes of Governor Xiao Yaonan, Minister Gao Lingwei and General Cai Chengxun. Sitting, as usual, on opposing sides of the table, for once Wang allowed Wu to speak first. Reading out the contents of the telegram, he began:\n\n\"Dear Marshal Wu Peifu\"\n\"I, your most humble ally and fellow Marshal Qi Xieyuan, most deeply request the Central Government's official permission to reclaim the territories of the League of Eight Provinces that were lost following Sun Chuanfang's truly terrible deposition. In exchange for your acquiescence, the League will most absolutely be the bulwark of the glorious Zhili Clique in the South, and aid in the national unification of the country.\"\n\"Signed, League Marshal Qi Xieyuan.\"\n\nThe silence in the room was practically deafening before Minister Gao spoke up: \"That's... it? He wants to sink the Zhili into another depraved war for useless illusions of grandeur?\" Many withing the room didn't know what to make of it, the brazenness, the stupidity, the bluntness. Usually such matters would be delegated to the Cabinet and the Ministry of War to deliberate upon, however cooperation with someone as unscrupulous as Qi Xieyuan is unpopular within Beijing.\n\nNonetheless, a decision has to be made, and with the two Marshals in agreement of general policy, their directive is sure to be followed."

Stopping just short of fully recognising the authority of the League over the full Eight Provinces, they nonetheless will join us in our conflict to come.\n\nNormally this would be a cause for celebration within Nanjing, however all throughout Qi's extended rule, his friends have become fewer and fewer between. With most of Sun's inner circle and numerous friends either purged, or refusing to communicate with the League Marshal, all he can do is sit alone, in the empty halls of the Marshal's Palace, planning his next move."

With both Marshal's thoroughly unimpressed by the League Marshal's telegram, their perfidious Ministry of War responded in utter refusal of the campaign to retake the West.\n\nCiting the unstable elements of nationaly integrity in the North, they instead fully expect the Southern Zhili to fall in line with the rest of the Zhili and aid the Cabinet in defending the Central Government. Such a slight cannot go unpunished! Those scarce few who still hang around the League Marshal's inner circle already report his persistent outrage at being played for by Beijing.

 league_events.215.d: "With the recent chaos unfolding due to recent events, many opportunists, schemers, and castaways alike have peered out of the shadows to re-enter the limelight once again. Most are turned away, for this is not their conflict nor their business. Hell most requests don't even make it to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s table, and yet a most enticing offer has finally reered its head.\n\nFormer Governor of Jiangxi Province, staunch Wu Peifu enemy, and rival of Incumbent Governor Deng Ruzhuo, Fang Benren has had a storied career full of numerous controversies. Having served under Governor Cai \"Tiger Cai\" Chengxun during his tenure in Jiangxi, Fang Benren would be the only one strong enough to drive him out of the province. Ruling in his stead, Fang would be the man who would enter Jiangxi into Sun Chuanfang's Five Province Coalition, and Fang would be rewarded with dismissal by Wu Peifu.\n\nReplaced by Governor Deng, Fang would flee briefly to exile, and then to Guangdong province to join the National Revolutionary Army, wherein he became commander of its 11th Army. However even that was brief, as Fang would experience steel, thunder, and bloodshed in the Northern Expedition, ensuring his men's safety but disbanding the army entirely. Having now lived a life of civilian entrepreneurship in Jiangxi, he has offered to serve in our army. For a price, of course.\n\nIn exchange for his innumerable skill, and all of the men he can muster, he necessitates the Governorship of Jiangxi after the conflict. A tantalising offer, naturally, as it has immediate benefits, although in the future the Jiangxi establishment may be rather... untenable for the return of Governor Fang to the scene."

 league_events.216.t: "Wrath of Fang"
 league_events.216.d: "Rather unfortunately it would appear that General Fang Benren is not a man to be crossed in the slightest. Enlisting in our forces under the formal agreement, even meeting directly with [ROOT.GetLeader], shaking hands and sharing in festivities, he was under the thorough impression that the Governorship of Jiangxi was all but secured. Under his reign, Jiangxi would once again bear witness to prosperity, instead of mismanagement from the perfidious Deng Ruzhuo.\n\nAnd evidently his faith in [ROOT.GetLeader] was utterly misplaced. Betrayed yet again, it would appear that Governor Deng has won out in their little rivalry, and Fang Benren is not an easy loser. Furious at the betrayal of his agreement, he simultaneously understands that outright revolt against the new League Marshal would be suicidal. However, he has mobilised all of those loyal to his new \"Rebel Jiangxi Army\" to engage in a campaign of belligerence within Jiangxi.\n\nWhilst normally of no concern, since the history of the League Provinces are wrought with uprisings and brutal crackdowns, Fang has the popular support of the majority of the province, and his skill at commanding guerrilla harassment is not to be underestimated. It is clear our efforts to incorporate Jiangxi will take far longer than expected."

Naturally he has burned many bridges. The Federalists, the Kuomintang, almost the Southern Zhili. Yet he is the most powerful man in the whole nation, that is utterly undisputable. And so it was natural for us to return the favour, as we'd be fools to continue Sun Chuanfang's grandstanding of his own Nanjing sphere.\n\nNaturally, this has caused much uproar with Sun Chuanfang loyalists, and those who despise Wu Peifu alike. While most are privy to Cao Kun's kind demeanour, Wu Peifu is but an object of pure ire and frustration. A particularly prominent, and recent, addition to the League High Command is that of General Fang Benren. Carrying with him immense influence, he issued his immediate resignation following the formal alliance between the Southern Zhili and Northern Zhili.\n\nClearly General Fang has not recovered from Wu Peifu forcing his removal from Jiangxi a decade ago, and still harbours an immense grudge. As Feng retires once more, so do his men, refusing to work with the army that betrayed their leader."

 league_events.218.d: "The bullet that sent the life of Sun Chuanfang spiralling stirred his League into complete and utter turmoil. Any news and word from Nanjing has been much harkened for, and invaluable to any of those whose interests are tied with the League. As the first official announcement after Sun's tragic death is being held today, countless reporters, both foreign and native, as well as foreign attachés, have gathered in the main hall of the Marshal's Office in Nanjing under strict security measures. All of them waiting eagerly for the very first official public announcement destined for their headlines and diplomatic reports.\n\nFrom the side doors, Qi Xieyuan, escorted by guards with German rifles and his most trusted staff, walked into the hall calmly and firmly. Standing on the podium, Qi's medals on his dress uniform shined under the flashlight of foreign cameras, making this short military man as prestigious and stand as tall as the Western military attaché present, despite visibly being the shortest amongst his group. Sweeping through the hall, glancing quickly, Qi initially started with seemingly sorrowful platitudes, before continuing.\n\n\"Today, we mourn the death of the League Marshal; Tomorrow, we shall make the plotters pay! The League will not allow any offence against its own well-being or any intervention in our policies!\"\nSwallowing slightly after reassuring the foreign, especially the German audience, Qi continues.\n\"Our great League, united in its shared sadness, so many of us brought together by a single loss, we have become one. Our socialist friends from the West will undoubtedly answer to their crime! The sin of complicity in the shameful assassination of Marshal Sun!\"\n\nDirecting the assassination attempt's origins towards the socialists of the Kuomintang, Qi all but confirmed that he shall inherit the legacy of the late League Marshal. His words are immediately jotted down by the audience. The microphone standing, quite amusingly, almost taller than him in front also meant that his words would be broadcasted across provinces. After concluding his speech with a final statement that he, as the acting League Marshal, would lead the League out of chaos despite the odds, Qi walked towards the exit without any hesitation, ignoring all questions from the audience. As the press conference ended with Qi's unexpected walkout, the audience was asked to leave by the office's guards.\n\nAlmost no worries concerning the future of the League were resolved. Yet, there are two things certain, the League now lies in the hands of this maniacal autocrat, and foreign interesst in the League will be preserved at all costs."

 league_war_character_events.107.d: "Through our daring initiatives, the bravery of our soldiers, and the resilience of our Generals, we have successfully managed to rescue our devoutly loyal Governor Shangguan Yunxiang of Zhejiang Province. Received by a detachment of the League Marshal's forces, Zheng and his soldiers have been escorted to Nanjing to aid in overseeing the retaliation against the Kuomintang and Anhui Army. A fantastic boon for our army, his forces, expertise and capability will no doubt prove useful. And understandably, his family, comrades and loved ones are ecstatic."

 league_war_character_events.108.d: "Lacking the resources to spare, our forces could do very little in aiding the isolated generals and governors trapped in their disparate provinces. With the League War raging on, League Marshal Qi, perhaps to lose potential rivals, or simply becaue he did not deign them worthy enough to save, left them to their fate. However he would surely have doubted their resilience. Initially trapped, Governor Shangguan Yunxiang of Zhejiang Province has managed to fight his way out and carve an escape route with his divisions northwards. Received in Nanjing by a surprised command staff and League Marshal, Shangguan could do nothing but spit and scowl in the face of the League Marshal."

 league_german_influence_events.1.t: "Meeting With the Nanking-Kommission"
 league_german_influence_events.1.d: "During the Northern Expedition, the German Empire became the primary benefactor of the Zhili Clique. While the Northern Zhili Clique under Wu Peifu and Cao Kun preferred to keep Berlin at a distance, Sun Chuanfang against his better judgement allowed then Jiangsu Governor Qi Xieyuan to reach out to the Germans for closer ties in the name of military modernisation. The German Military Mission, influenced by the ideas of General Max Bauer, promoted the idea to Qi that military modernisation required economic modernisation too, which necessitated stronger economic ties between Berlin and Nanjing.\n\nBehind the Smiling Tiger's back, Qi allowed German corporations such as Krupp to develop Jiangsu's economy, Qi was always keen to keep the League-Marshal in the dark, for Sun shared Wu's distaste for foreign cooperation. Qi's quiet scheming reached a breaking point in 1932, when the people of Shanghai became fed up with growing corruption from the authorities, and Sun allowed Qi to put down the uprising with zeal. This nearly caused the League to collapse, as Chen Tiaoyuan then began to take it upon himself to take control of the League, which he attempted after Black Monday.\n\nChen's attempted coup and the \"tragic\" death of League Marshal Sun nearly caused the League to fully collapse, but thanks to the timely intervention of League Marshal Qi, the League not only survived but rebounded, ousting \"the Fool\" from Anhui and finally putting an end to the Kuomintang menace in MinGan. However, the countryside now finds itself devastated from the conflict, and Qi's friends in Berlin are now needed more than ever to save the Chinese nation. It is time for the League to expand its collaboration with the AOG, starting with their main military and political arm, the Nanking-Kommission."

 league_german_influence_events.2.t: "AOG Establishes New Offices"
 league_german_influence_events.2.d: "In the name of Sino-German unity, the AOG has announced the opening of new offices in the city, further cementing the ties between our government and the German administration. Previously under Sun Chuanfang, overt German influence was kept away from the League Marshal's directly controlled territories. Extensive German influence was confined to the areas of Jiangsu north of the Yangtze and portions of Shanghai. Zhejiang was mostly free of German influence, while the Germans occasionally made inroads into Anhui. With traitorous elements in the League excised, League Marshal Qi's cooperation with Berlin can reach new highs as modernity reaches every corner of the Southern Zhili Clique. The League Marshal has already sent out a welcome party to greet the Germans in Nanjing."
 league_german_influence_events.2.a: "The Smiling Tiger was a fool to neglect Berlin's hand in friendship."

 league_german_influence_events.3.t: "German Involvement in the Assassination"
 league_german_influence_events.3.d: "The true lynchpin of the League was always Sun Chuanfang, the Smiling Tiger. Through him, the various governors of the Southern Zhili Clique were interconnected and great things were accomplished in the unity of the League. However, his assassination brought the house of cards falling down, and it is on League Marshal Qi to reassemble the once-great eight province coalition.\n\nAs no one is more committed than the League Marshal to find justice for Sun's death, Qi has put many resources into the investigation into Sun's assassination. However, a difficult complication has arisen during the investigation.\n\nWhile nothing has been proven as-of-yet, investigators have discovered a possible link between a prosperous German director in Nanjing and the assassin. Catching word of our suspicions, the AOG has informed us that the individual is completely innocent, and requests that we remove him from the scope of our investigation."
 league_german_influence_events.3.a: "If the Germans say the man is innocent, then he's innocent!"
 league_german_influence_events.3.b: "Guilty or not, implicating him will be useful."

 league_german_influence_events.4.t: "Rebuilding the ZheGan Railway"
 league_german_influence_events.4.d: "Since the Western powers first opened up China, developing China's rails was always a preferred method of modernisation. Rails helped transfer more resources in a timely fashion, which brought much profit into the hands of the French, British, and Russians. The Germans likewise spent much of their efforts in China on constructing and improving rail lines, especially in areas of the League where the Smiling Tiger had less control. Qi's cooperation with the Germans helped develop Jiangsu's rails extensively, but also led to the Wuhu Incident, incurring the fury of Chen Tiaoyuan. Large amounts of the Central China Railway were damaged during the League collapse, whether by protestors or defectors. With control of Eastern China mostly consolidated, Qi must begin rebuilding the ravaged Southern Zhili Clique, starting with its infrastructure. As government revenue must be allocated to all aspects of the League Marshal's administration, Qi hopes to reach out to Berlin for aid in reconstructing the railway lines, as it would be in everyone's interest to see the trains run on time again."
 league_german_influence_events.4.a: "Any monetary assistance will help in repairing China's rails."
 league_german_influence_events.4.b: "Berlin may repair the rails independently of our oversight."

 league_german_influence_events.5.t: "Unpaid Concession Leases"
 league_german_influence_events.5.d: "While the Germans were frequently China's primary loaner of funds, Black Monday has hit Berlin the hardest. What was once a greatly profitable enterprise is now low on funds, and the AOG finds itself in something of a crisis. Reliant on the profits of various operations and enterprises in the League and subsidies from Berlin, Black Monday and the League War have all but drained the AOG's financial assets. In a twist of fate, it is the AOG that finds itself unable to properly pay for concession fees. While League Marshal Qi has thus far been understanding towards his friends in Berlin, continued failure on the part of the Germans to contribute to the Sino-German partnership is not something he will tolerate. Qi plans to discuss with the AOG board shortly on the matter of payment."
 league_german_influence_events.5.a: "You'll get another loan extension, but just this once!"
 league_german_influence_events.5.b: "Our partnership isn't free!"

 league_german_influence_events.6.t: "Control of the Concession Factories"
 league_german_influence_events.6.d: "While the AOG's current financial weakness has hurt the League's finances too, it is also a time of opportunity. After the German Intervention in the Northern Expedition, German businessmen and interest groups flooded into China, all for their own interests. To the annoyance of League Marshal Sun, many foreign factories were established along the coast. The AOG's string of good luck ended with Black Monday, and the value of many of their assets in China plummeted. This gives Marshal Qi the perfect opportunity to strengthen his perception amongst the populace by buying back German factories to give back to the nation.\n\nOf course, much of the assets reacquired by the government will stay in the hands of the state in the name of preventing abuses by corrupt businessmen, but the laobaixing will surely rally to Qi's administration as a defender of the Chinese people! The other added value is that in time, these seized factories will help the League in revitalising its revenue streams so that the Jiangsu Opium lanes are not the League Marshal's only big source of cash flow, as was the case for Qi's original governorship of Jiangsu and the reason for why control of Shanghai was so valuable to him. Of course, Sun Chuanfang had cracked down on Opium use in the directly controlled regions of Jiangsu south of the Yangtze, but Qi of course can rectify that error."
 league_german_influence_events.6.a: "Business is booming!"

 league_german_influence_events.7.t: "German Investment Council"
 league_german_influence_events.7.d: "During Qi's lengthy cooperation with the Germans, AOG influence was mostly confined to the coastal regions of northern Jiangsu, but occasionally peeked into surrounding areas, which led to unrest, which themselves led to the Shanghai Uprising of 1932 and the Wuhu Incident. Extensive German influence was for the most part contained to Jiangsu due to Sun Chuanfang's dislike of the German alliance other than in the realm of military modernisation and collaboration, and Chen Tiaoyuan in Anhui adopted a staunch anti-concessionist outlook in order to rally support form the locals in the Southern Zhili Clique to compensate for Sun's sidelining of him in favour of Qi.\n\nHowever now that the Smiling Tiger and the Fool are gone, the AOG finds itself in a prime opportunity to head off the inevitable chaos of this veritable gold rush and establish an investment council to regulate German businesses in the region. While this is undoubtedly a boon, some have come to the League Marshal with concerns of German overreach, while others like Li Linsi have praised the strengthening of Sino-German ties to counter Japanese Imperialism."
 league_german_influence_events.7.a: "Wonderful."
 league_german_influence_events.7.b: "Their assistance is not needed."

 league_german_influence_events.8.t: "German Reconstruction Imports"
 league_german_influence_events.8.d: "In 1930, due to strong disagreements about demobilisation and relative weakness of the Beijing Government in the aftermath of the 4th Zhifeng War, Sun Chuanfang took the opportunity to incorporate the Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong Cliques into the League, albeit with more autonomy than the core five provinces. However, the Southern governors were always wary of LEP encroachment on their autonomy and chose to exit the League upon the Smiling Tiger's assassination.\n\nWhile the southern governors were politically autonomous, much of the internal league economy was connected in the name of development and modernisation. The loss of our southern territories has caused somewhat of a resource disaster in our country, with many traditional internal industries now cut off from us. To alleviate this, the AOG has suggested a relaxation of regulations on German imports into the country, only until our internal economy has righted itself, of course."
 league_german_influence_events.8.a: "For the good of China."
 league_german_influence_events.8.b: "Sun was right to keep them on a leash..."

 league_german_influence_events.9.t: "Battling Inflation"
 league_german_influence_events.9.d: "China's currency, the Yuan, has never been particularly stable. Although the Yuan had a brief period of prosperity in the decade after the 4th Zhifeng War, Black Monday and the League collapse has brought the Yuan on its knees. Thankfully, China was able to avoid the worst of Black Monday due to our lack of connectivity to Global Trade on the part of our less industrialised regions, but our monetary situation remains in a state of risk.\n\nTo prevent a complete financial meltdown, the AOG has pledged the support of the DAB in backing up the Yuan, in return for various financial concessions. Shoring up financial support would definitely help League Marshal Qi in touting the ability of his governance. Of course, it is not lost on Marshal Qi that the Germans have their own interests at heart, and it may not necessarily be the best course of action to become too financially reliant on Berlin."
 league_german_influence_events.9.a: "The consequences will be minor upon the League's return to financial stability."
 league_german_influence_events.9.b: "The League will be able to weather the storm without aid."

 league_german_influence_events.10.t: "DAB Loans: Begin"
 league_german_influence_events.10.d: "The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank is the largest surviving financial institution in the region, and under the thumb of the AOG. Under Sun Chuanfang, the DAB and League had contact, but substantial financial aid was limited only to the regional government in Jiangsu. With Qi in control of the entire League, increased collaboration with the DAB would help rejuvenate the League economy and remake it into the third great power of China once again. Of course, the political cost of such collaboration would in all likelihood inflame the anti-concessionist attitude of the Chinese populace. However, the League Marshal is prepared for all eventualities and won't let the unruly mob dictate the future of China."
 league_german_influence_events.10.a: "The banks will revive the League!"

 league_german_influence_events.11.t: "DAB Loans: Size"
 league_german_influence_events.11.d: "The DAB has agreed to assist the League Marshal in rebuilding the League economy through low interest loans with the tacit expectation that German business will be allowed privileges within League territories. Qi's primary concern now is to determine the extent of the loans that he will be taking out. A larger loan would be more cost effective, but it would make the League Marshal far more obligated to concede to Berlin's interests in the future, whereas a smaller loan would in all likelihood be enough to stimulate growth in the League, but there would be less capital to work with."
 league_german_influence_events.11.a: "Go big or go home."
 league_german_influence_events.11.b: "The League Marshal can't say no to free money."
 league_german_influence_events.11.c: "Ask for a little, the League Marshal prefers to be his own master."

 league_german_influence_events.12.t: "DAB Loans: Destination"
 league_german_influence_events.12.d: "Eastern China, as one of the richest regions of the nation, is the economic lynchpin of China. With the mouth of the Yangtze under the League, the Yangtze trade is very much in our control. Of course, that is why the LEC has opted to base itself in Shanghai, so that it too may regulate the Yangtze trade. The coastal cities have become wealthy regions and some of the only parts of China that have become well-integrated with the capitalist system.\n\nThe AOG, while now able to cross into all League territories, still bases itself in Jiangsu Province where the heart of its operation lies, thanks to Marshal Qi's friendship with them. Although the League War and Black Monday did much to disrupt our economy, the League stands firm against all traitors and socialist rebels. It has been suggested to Qi that due to the varying degrees of destruction, Nanjing should choose which industry to primarily reward with the loan money to maximise their effect."
 league_german_influence_events.12.a: "Prioritise consumer production output."
 league_german_influence_events.12.b: "Prioritise railroad construction efforts."
 league_german_influence_events.12.c: "Prioritise military industry."

 league_german_influence_events.13.t: "AOG Demands Early Repayment!"
 league_german_influence_events.13.d: "Collaboration with the Great powers has always been a double edged sword for China. While it is true that Western investment has helped propel China's economy towards modernism, there are always drawbacks. The Great powers come into China not for reasons of charity or Pan Asian idealism, but to make a profit for themselves.\n\nThus, it is not surprising that the AOG has shown its face and requested that the League government repay the DAB loans earlier than agreed upon, ostensibly behind the reasoning of increasing financial tensions in Eastern China. League Marshal Qi has already acquiesced  to the new terms laid out by the Germans. Unfortunately, the Germans hold much of the cards in this relationship, and there is nothing we can do."
 league_german_influence_events.13.a: "Those foreign rats!"

 league_german_influence_events.14.t: "AOG Banking Expands"
 league_german_influence_events.14.d: "While the German Empire may find its influence waning across many regions on the world stage, it seems that Berlin's interests in China have only been secured further. Due to the economic instability that followed Black Monday and the destruction brought about by Chen and the KMT, League Marshal Qi agreed to many deals with the AOG and DAB, which they've used to expand their financial monopoly in the region. While it is still not as extensive as Japanese control in the Northeast, their substantial influence has left many concerned with China's future. At the moment however, League Marshal Qi is willing to tolerate it for there is a direct benefit to the League economy, and prosperity in his eyes is the ultimate goal of China."
 league_german_influence_events.14.a: "Good for them, and good for us."

 league_german_influence_events.15.t: "DAB Buys out League Banks"
 league_german_influence_events.15.d: "It was imperative to League Marshal Sun that just as China should be in control of its own destiny, it should have been led by him. To that end, Sun began monetary reforms within the League, which resulted in the development of many banks in the region, especially Zhejiang and Jiangsu. However, these banks suffered greatly from Black Monday, as many investments failed and bank runs became common. Thus, the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has begun to buy out failing league banks across the region. This is a great blow to the ambitions of League Marshal Qi and a betrayal of the legacy of Sun Chuanfang. German efforts to undermine the economy have prompted many within the government to petition League Marshal Qi to defend the rights of the Chinese people against this foreign exploitation and capitalist game."
 league_german_influence_events.15.a: "Let the free market do as it will..."
 league_german_influence_events.15.b: "The banks will remain in Chinese hands, it is our bottom line."

 league_german_influence_events.16.t: "Opening the Interior: Begin"
 league_german_influence_events.16.d: "While the League has already opened its door to limited German expansion into the interior, such an agreement has not been formalised yet. League Marshal Qi has decided that it is finally time to formalise German access into the League interior, which will only see him concede little whilst earning him favours in the German lobby. The German delegation has just arrived in Nanjing to discuss terms with Qi. The League Marshal hopes to make the best deal for himself and his League.\n\nWhile Qi may be no Sun Chuanfang, years of experience in dealing with the Germans back in Jiangsu make him uniquely qualified to negotiate with the Germans. The Jiangnan Consortium sent a delegate of their own to ensure that the interests of Chinese merchants and businessmen are considered. The Jingxing Society too has sent one of their members to attend the negotiations in order to promote Sino-German partnership but also ensure that China is treated as an equal partner. The German delegation hopes to have the same privileges they enjoyed in Jiangsu expanded across the entire League."
 league_german_influence_events.16.a: "This had better go well."

 league_german_influence_events.17.t: "Opening the Interior: Status of the Chinese"
 league_german_influence_events.17.d: "With negotiations underway for the opening up of the interior of the League to German businesses, a matter of great priority for the League Marshal is the fate of Chinese businesses in the region. Sun Chuanfang helped foster many loyal businesses which helped organise the Jiangnan Consortium, a league of merchants working within the League. While formal German entry into the Chinese interior is a great business opportunity, the Consortium raises concerns surrounding the risks of competition.\n\nGerman businesses that enjoy subsidies from Berlin are feared to overtake and outcompete local Chinese businesses, destroying the livelihoods of many merchants in the region. Thus, the Jiangnan Consortium has sent a representative to the negotiations to promote the interests of Chinese businesses, hoping to have League Marshal Qi Xieyuan push for strong regulations on German businesses. The Germans in turn have asked that Marshal Qi give their businesses privileged status across the entire League, with a generous donation to Qi's government being floated as the incentive."
 league_german_influence_events.17.a: "German businesses will be regulated to defend Chinese interests."
 league_german_influence_events.17.b: "Chinese and German businesses will be subject to the same free market."
 league_german_influence_events.17.c: "Berlin makes a compelling case..."

 league_german_influence_events.18.t: "Opening the Interior: Status of the Germans"
 league_german_influence_events.18.d: "With the matter of Chinese business within the League interior settled, Marshal Qi has raised the second matter for the negotiations. Ever since the Western powers carved for themselves concessions along the coast, citizens of European powers have enjoyed privileges and higher status than local Chinese people.\n\nWhile Qi is not concerned with the status of Europeans in their concessions, the League interior is another matter entirely. Unlike the coastal concessions, the Germans do not possess any special rights within the region. Interior privileges were never discussed beforehand due to Sun Chuanfang's insistence to keep German influence contained to the coast. The Jiangnan Consortium has protested against granting German citizens privileges in the Interior, and have requested that League Marshal Qi draft a new set of laws pertaining only to German Nationals.\n\nThe Jingxing Society has floated a suggestion to treat German and Chinese citizens as equals in the Interior in order to promote an equal relationship. The German delegation has offered to pay the League Government a generous sum in order to extend concession privileges to all League territories."
 league_german_influence_events.18.a: "German Nationals must operate under new rules."
 league_german_influence_events.18.b: "Chinese and Germans will all be equal under the law."
 league_german_influence_events.18.c: "The Germans will be granted their privileges!"

 league_german_influence_events.19.t: "Opening the Interior: German Arrival"
 league_german_influence_events.19.d: "With most of the negotiations already finished, German businesses have begun expanding their operations from Jiangsu and the coastal concessions into the League interior. League Marshal Qi Xieyuan hopes that the increased German presence in the League will increase profits in the region, which will in turn be taxed and thus benefit the government.\n\nThe Jingxing Society has hailed the negotiations as a historic moment in Chinese relations with the West and hopes that Chinese trade with Berlin will positively impact China's image in the West. The Jiangnan Consortium is cautious about the German entrance into the League interior and is preparing businesses in the region to compete with German businesses. The AOG has already officially begun several projects in rural Jiangxi."
 league_german_influence_events.19.a: "The League Marshal is sure that everything will end up fine."

 league_german_influence_events.20.t: "Opening the Interior: Business Conflicts!"
 league_german_influence_events.20.d: "Unfortunately for League Marshal Qi Xieyuan, it seems that the German entry into the League interior has caused a good deal of trouble. Several Chinese businesses have filed complaints to the Jiangnan Consortium, alleging that the Germans have exploited the resources of the League's rural regions, especially Jiangxi's tungsten reserves. On top of that, they allege that the Germans have made a play for monopolisation of economic power in the region and have been financially bullying local Chinese businesses in regions which are under significant German investment. The Jiangnan Consortium has relayed their concerns to the League Marshal, prompting the AOG to claim that Chinese officials and businesses are not sufficiently cooperating and on occasion downright frustrating the actions of German business interests in the region. Tension is thick, and the League Marshal must decide which side to believe."
 league_german_influence_events.20.a: "The AOG should quit while they're ahead."
 league_german_influence_events.20.b: "The Jiangnan Consortium needs to stop making trouble."
 league_german_influence_events.20.c: "Both sides could take a lesson from this moment..."

 league_german_influence_events.21.t: "Opening the Interior: Finish"
 league_german_influence_events.21.d: "With the first rush of investment having finally settled down, our interior has entered a new state of normal. While the full ramifications of our decision will only be felt over the coming decades, we can already see the beginnings of such changes taking route in our economy. The AOG has ceased its agitation of Chinese businesses in the region, and the Jiangnan Consortium has calmed down from the initial friction. For the time being, Chinese and German businesses operate side by side, collectively boosting the regional economies of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. While the League Marshal would have hoped that there would be no trouble at all, the new state of peace has satisfied him."
 league_german_influence_events.21.a: "All the frenzy is finally over."

 league_german_influence_events.22.t: "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
 league_german_influence_events.22.d: "With German entry into the League interior settled, railroads in the interior have become a new focal point for discussion between Chinese and German diplomats. The Germans in order to extract and transport more resources have always put a great emphasis on railroad and infrastructure development during the whole Sino-German friendship, and are asking that League Marshal Qi grant the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft complete control of the rails in the interior.\n\nThe AOG claims that this will help facilitate faster rail construction, and the League Marshal will enjoy the most developed rails in the entire nation, and can show the rest of China his great governance. Officials aligned with the Jiangnan Consortium and Jingxing Society have asked that the League Marshal maintain some level of control of the rails. The Jiangnan Consortium has asked the League Marshal to even nationalise German owned railroads should the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft abuse their authority."
 league_german_influence_events.22.a: "The League Marshal will respect the German buyout."
 league_german_influence_events.22.b: "Qi demands that the government retains an equal ownership!"

 league_german_influence_events.23.t: "Railroad Payments"
 league_german_influence_events.23.d: "In order to develop the interior's infrastructure, the League government requested a large loan from the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank to invest into the railroad construction projects. League Marshal Qi opted to invest primarily in the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft, which has certainly helped speed up rural development.\n\nHowever, the profits of the interior have not yet paid back for the original loan. The Nanking-Kommission has politely reminded us that a reasonable repayment is expected, and soon. League Marshal Qi will have to find a way to pay back his German allies, though he has a mind to simply ignore payment, though this would likely have consequences."
 league_german_influence_events.23.a: "The Germans will get their money back."
 league_german_influence_events.23.b: "The Germans may accept deregulation of their businesses as payment..."
 league_german_influence_events.23.c: "What payments?"

 league_german_influence_events.24.t: "The Schantung-Eisenbahn Expands"
 league_german_influence_events.24.d: "With our continued support, the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft has continued to develop the rail infrastructure of the interior. Jiangxi now enjoys rail infrastructure that rivals those in Jiangsu, and Fujian has come to enjoy elevated connectivity between all its major cities on the coast and those in the interior. Despite this, the Jiangnan Consortium continues to feel uneasy about the current arrangement, but even they cannot deny that the Germans are good at making the trains run on time."
 league_german_influence_events.24.a: "Excellent."

 league_german_influence_events.25.t: "Rail Taxes?"
 league_german_influence_events.25.d: "The League cannot continue to fund the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft with the hopes of a quick return, as clearly Qi cannot pay back that many loans to the AOG. Several intellectuals have floated an idea originally raised in Beijing about levying a rail tax on the populace to pay for continued expansion. This would allow the League Marshal to avoid becoming too reliant on the Germans for funding.\n\nQi could still make use of their impressive business model in the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft. Some in the government have voiced concerns about this course of action, as taxing the population was what made the MinGan governors very unpopular, leading directly to the KMT Insurgency. Others have reminded Qi that Sun opposed taxation of the peasantry and his commitment to that helped him become a very popular ruler."
 league_german_influence_events.25.a: "Everyone will pay their fair share!"
 league_german_influence_events.25.b: "We'll exempt the peasantry in Sun's name."

 league_german_influence_events.26.t: "Germans Ask for Tax Exemption"
 league_german_influence_events.26.d: "While the new rail tax has gone surprisingly smoothly, the AOG has come with some demands. In a display of arrogance, the AOG has requested that all German businesses be exempt from our new rail tax. They claim that the taxes are hurting their economic interests in the region, and that if Qi cares about the Sino-German friendship, then the League ought to give them privileges in the matter. The fact that we raised this tax to pay for their railroads hasn't seemed to register, and they are quite insistent on this demand. The League Marshal is expected to respond to the Germans in the morning."
 league_german_influence_events.26.a: "We'll do the Germans a favour."
 league_german_influence_events.26.b: "Those arrogant buffoons should read the room."

 league_german_influence_events.27.t: "Eastern Resources Commission: Introduction"
 league_german_influence_events.27.d: "The Eastern Resources Commission, primarily drawn from Chinese business interests and AOG monopolists, have managed to put aside their many differences in the pursuit of a shared goal: profit. While Chinese interests provide the location and manpower for resource extraction, the Germans provide the technical know-how and equipment to properly extract such resources. In a surprising twist of unity, the Jiangnan Consortium and AOG delegation in Nanjing have both praised the efforts of the Eastern Resources Commission."
 league_german_influence_events.27.a: "A desire for profit makes strange bedfellows, I suppose."

 league_german_influence_events.28.t: "Status of Germans on the Commission"
 league_german_influence_events.28.d: "Apparently dissatisfied with the current status quo, the AOG has demanded a reshuffle of the Eastern Resources Commission, arguing that German interests are not adequately represented by the commission. By this, they presumably mean that they do not have full control of the board, and want to rectify this. While it is a blazon grab for power, without AOG backing, the commission itself is almost functionally useless.\n\nThe Jiangnan Consortium has denounced the AOG for destroying the original unity of the Eastern Resources Commission, and have asked League Marshal Qi to reject the AOG's proposal and call forth the Jingxing Society to provide local experts to compensate for the loss of German technical know-how. The Jingxing Society in turn has recommended to the League Marshal that he accept the AOG demands, but promote his own ultimate authority over the Commission."
 league_german_influence_events.28.a: "The Germans can have their majority..."
 league_german_influence_events.28.b: "The League Marshal will still have the final say, understand?"

 league_german_influence_events.29.t: "AOG Requests Renegotiation of German Rights"
 league_german_influence_events.29.d: "With the Eastern Resources Commission returning to its work and giving profits for everyone involved, the AOG has come forward with another ambitious request. While the Germans were given some privileges in the League Interior, they were still not as thorough as the privileges within the concessions.\n\nThe German delegation in Nanjing has asked the League Marshal to give German citizens and businesses equal privileges to those in the coastal concessions in perpetuity, promising him further German investment into the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft. The League Marshal understands that the privileges the AOG seek will certainly hurt Chinese businesses in the Interior, as the Jiangnan Consortium so often reminds him of, but remains uncertain."
 league_german_influence_events.29.a: "Very well, enjoy your elevated status, gentlemen."
 league_german_influence_events.29.b: "I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request."

 league_german_influence_events.31.t: "AOG Implements Exclusive Economic Zones"
 league_german_influence_events.31.d: "Whilst our relationship with the Krauts is that of a mutually beneficial one, there are cases in-which the League Marshal's administration is rather... restrained by promises to Berlin's businessmen. Recently utilising their disproportionate influence in the League, the AOG has implemented a series of Exclusive Economic Zones amongst urban centres. Effectively cinching their monopoly on League investments. While mostly a simple acknowledgement of the present reality, it has raised concerns that the AOG is able to wrangle and bend the League's Government to its own whims."
 league_german_influence_events.31.a: "This is for the Good of China."

 league_german_influence_events.33.t: "German Economic Takeover"
 league_german_influence_events.33.d: "Damnable news has reached the League Marshal's palace! Ever been a slowly encroaching influence, welcomed initially by the Marshal, the AOG has slowly sunk their teeth into every and all facets of our unscrupulous government. Through bribery, appointments, and forcing their hand by threatening economic repercussions, the Krauts have managed to finalise their cloak-and-dagger machinations. In a final economic coup d'état, the German East Asian authorities have seemingly Germanised the League in its entirety. German banks, German factories, and German shops throng the streets. The Mark is utilised far more than the Yuan, German is used as the language of business as much as Chinese. Marshal Qi fears that perhaps he has been played for a fool, as the League is effectively a German client state."
 league_german_influence_events.33.a: "\"What... have I done?\""

 league_german_influence_events.50.t: "League-Ostasien Relations"
 league_german_influence_events.50.d: "Whilst our technical obligations are with the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, the quasi-governmental organisation acts as an extension of the German East Asian Administration, sharing its governing Supervisory Board. With AOG interests very heavily tied to the German East Asian Colonial Office's, they are but mere middlemen for the machinations of the Kaiser in Berlin. In a show of earnest collaboration however, the AOG has asked that we extend formal diplomatic overtures towards the German East Asian Administration, to cement our shared economic interests."
 league_german_influence_events.50.a: "Better friends than enemies."

 league_german_influence_events.51.t: "AOG Requests Our Support!"
 league_german_influence_events.51.d: "It would appear that the League isn't the only polity suffering a breakdown of order and authority. The German East Asian Administration, having acquired their colonies on behalf of their spoils in the Great War, has never truly been able to maintain their control within Indochina in particular. With a revolt occuring as recently as earlier this decade, it would appear that the Indochinese are once again trying their hand at earnest liberation.\n\nThe situation has become so dire that the Admiralty, and the AOG, have so politely \"requested\" that the League send them ammunition, weapons, and other supplies. Many within the League Marshal's government balk at such a demand, as if the League isn't dealing with its own issue wherein such materiel would be incredibly valuable.\n\nNonetheless, the Germanophiles within our government, alongside the likes of the Jingxing Society under Li Linsi, have heavily lobbied for the League Marshal to acquiesce, as it would prove that the Chinese-German relationship is on equal footing."
 league_german_influence_events.51.a: "They shall have our full support!"
 league_german_influence_events.51.b: "Send some equipment their way."
 league_german_influence_events.51.c: "\"Make a demand of me? Amusing.\""

 league_german_influence_events.53.t: "League-Ostasien Connection Deepens"
 league_german_influence_events.53.d: "Increasing our ties with the AOG not only furthers our mutual economic agreements with their enterprising businessmen, but also of the colonial office pulling their strings. The German East Asian administration has sent overtures via telegram to the Marshal's Palace, praising his ingenuity and statesmanship. While the Marshal can see that it is blatant flattery, the AOG sweetened the deal. Drafting a new, formal, economic trade agreement by their local businesses under their control, that has actually been levied in our favour."
 league_german_influence_events.53.a: "Always good to have friends."

 league_german_influence_events.54.t: "AOG Requests Ostasien Docking Rights"
 league_german_influence_events.54.d: "Despite squatting upon their Chinese treaty ports in Shandong, possessing some of the nation's best and most sizeable dockyard facilities, the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung has sent a telegram to the Marshal's Palace. Its contents most humbly request that the League Marshal allow the German Pacific and East Asian fleet to utilise League dockyards in conjunction with their own facilities. They've covered their blatant intrusion on the League's sovereignty, by assuring the Marshal it is a simple precaution in the case of chaotic naval actions in the East China Sea."
 league_german_influence_events.54.a: "Better protect us from Japan."
 league_german_influence_events.54.b: "Let them keep their ships in Qingdao."

 league_german_influence_events.55.t: "AOG Requests Ostasien Military Access"
 league_german_influence_events.55.d: "Another perfidious telegram has arrived in the Marshal's Palace, written by the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung on behalf of their German East Asian Colonial overlords. In their most audacious request, the AOg has asked the League Marshal to authorise military access for German East Asian Colonial troops to allow them to cross and remain within League territories. Ostensibly to protect German interests within China, many believe, including Marshal Qi himself, that this is but a mere ploy to tighten the noose upon his neck. Practically ceding a large amount of our sovereignty to the Germans."
 league_german_influence_events.55.a: "Regretfully, we must accept."
 league_german_influence_events.55.b: "You're kidding, right? No."

 league_german_influence_events.56.t: "AOG Requests a Full Military Guarantee"
 league_german_influence_events.56.d: "Perhaps one of their more reasonable, but still extraordinary requests, the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung has telegrammed the League Marshal to insist upon the League offerring a full military guarantee of their colonial holdings within Asia. Citing rising tensions with the Rising Sun, they request that the League make a full showing of support for the German Colonies in Asia, and the promise of a League response in the event of any infringement upon their sovereignty. Effectively throwing the League with the Reichspakt, independent of the rest of China, it nonetheless seems like an inevitable conclusion. What with Fengtian and their Japanese backers angling for another conflict."
 league_german_influence_events.56.a: "Chinese and German, hand-in-hand."
 league_german_influence_events.56.b: "You know damn well we can't promise that."

 league_german_influence_events.57.t: "Transferring of the Concessions"
 league_german_influence_events.57.d: "It would appear that our \"partnership\" with the German Colonial Administration has reached the point of no return. In a blatant demonstration of their extra-territorial power and influence over the League, the AOG has decided, without the League Marshal's permission, to transfer direct control of the concessions within the League's land and coastline out of the League's hands. Whilst the League Army prepared to seize the land back with force, they were met by the full might of the German Colonial Army. Unable to enact retribution, League Marshal Qi has marched China directly into another Century of Humiliation."
 league_german_influence_events.57.a: "\"I may have gone too far in some places.\""

 LEP_governor_replace_decisions_desc: "The League of Eight Provinces was a complex web of bureaucrats, officers and generals. On top of those people were the governors of the different provinces, whom themselves acted with relative autonomy and answered only to League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang. When the League collapsed with Chen Tiaoyuan's uprising, this web broke apart, with many people rebelling or seizing power for themselves locally, and with governors trying to escape to get safety in Nanjing. With the League now back to a relative state of decency, it is high time we work on sending these governors back, and in many cases getting new governors, so that work can continue."

### Reusable Flavour ###
#Under Deng's regime, Jiangxi shares a number of traits with Anhui to its north, chief among them a predominantly poor and rural population. Much of the province has never truly recovered from the widespread destruction of the Taiping rebellion, and even after seventy years the ruins of abandoned cities can sometimes be glimpsed amid the mountains. Unlike Anhui Jiangxi has not quite escaped German attention. With virtually nonexistent infrastructure and few direct paths to the coast, the city of Nanchang and its surrounds are the planned terminus of the new ZheGan Railway, linking the city to Shanghai, opening up significant new markets and resources in the Chinese interior. Of particular interest to the Germans is the city of Jingdezhen, the porcelain from which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin, along with other less-legitimate pursuits such as the stolen antiquities trade. So far, the new railway has been built primarily with German financing, though there are rumours that the Germans mean to purchase the railway in its entirety; rumours likely lending strength to the KMT's supporters hiding in the province's south.
