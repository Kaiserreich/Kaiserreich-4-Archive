From the destruction of the Spanish Armada to the battle of Trafalgar and recently the near war winning naval starvation of the Teutonic hordes of central Europe, control of the sea has always been the priority of our nations armed forces. Yet, while we have cast off many reactionary traditions our love of the navy has remained, we must always be at the forefront of naval research and development. We must always Rule the Waves."

### Parties ###
 ENG_totalist_party: "Labour (Maximists)"
 ENG_totalist_party_long: "Labour - Maximists\n§LBuilt around Oswald Mosley's 'New Labour Association' (NULA), the successor of the independent Popular Revolution Party, the Maximists follow his Birmingham Proposals, which stressed the need for “total commitment to socialism and the maximum effort for the revolution”. While ostensibly still 'syndicalist', the clique has been marked by its growing divergence from the ideology, with key thinkers often referring to 'Maximist Socialism' as syndicalism's natural evolution. Maximism itself is rooted in Sorelian rhetoric but has also developed an independent doctrine and drawn inspiration from French Neosocialists. The Maximists rose to national prominence following Mosley's appointment to Deputy Chairman in 1933, with the youthful, dynamic movement sweeping up many congressional deputies with their momentum.§!\n"
 ENG_VAN_totalist_party: "Labour (Vanguardists)"
 ENG_VAN_totalist_party_long: "Labour - Vanguardists"
 ENG_syndicalist_party: "Labour (Federationists)"
 ENG_syndicalist_party_long: "Labour - Federationists\n§LThe Federationist wing of the Labour party is a broad alliance, comprised of the SPGB remnants that were absorbed by Labour following the 1924 State of Emergency, revolutionary figures with their radical roots in trade unionism and some revolutionary loyalists not at home with the Autonomists. Consolidating after the election of Tom Mann as Chairman, the Federationists had undergone the political influence of the late Arthur J. Cook, moulding it to the CGTist inspired Orthodox Syndicalism that it and the National Federation of Revolutionary Syndicates preach today. The Federationists are internally fractured with the only common thread uniting them being the preservation of syndicalism and the federal system. Influential leaders include Arthur Horner and Sylvia Pankhurst, who both command their own individual followings with very different opinions about how the Revolution should proceed.§!\n"
 ENG_CON_syndicalist_party: "Labour (Pankhurstites)"
 ENG_CON_syndicalist_party_long: "Labour - Pankhurstite Federationists\n§LThe Federationist wing of the Labour party is a broad alliance, comprised of the SPGB remnants that were absorbed by Labour following the 1924 State of Emergency, revolutionary figures with their radical roots in trade unionism and some revolutionary loyalists not at home with the Autonomists. Consolidating after the election of Tom Mann as Chairman, the Federationists had undergone the political influence of the late Arthur J. Cook, moulding it to the CGTist inspired Orthodox Syndicalism that it and the National Federation of Revolutionary Syndicates preach today. Sylvia Pankhurst's disciples have their roots in radicalism and council communism, advocating for a renewed social revolution with a focus on feminism, democratisation through workers' councils and a renewed commitment towards the transition towards socialism.§!\n"
 ENG_FED_syndicalist_party: "Labour (Hornerists)"
 ENG_FED_syndicalist_party_long: "Labour - Hornerist Federationists\n§LThe Federationist wing of the Labour party is a broad alliance, comprised of the SPGB remnants that were absorbed by Labour following the 1924 State of Emergency, revolutionary figures with their radical roots in trade unionism and some revolutionary loyalists not at home with the Autonomists. Consolidating after the election of Tom Mann as Chairman, the Federationists had undergone the political influence of the late Arthur J. Cook, moulding it to the CGTist inspired Orthodox Syndicalism that it and the National Federation of Revolutionary Syndicates preach today. Arthur Horner's disciples are a step more moderate than the radical Mannite militants. They propose revisions to the political system to improve political participation and allieviate draconianism, formalising Labour's position as a popular front of socialist societies, and a major push against political corruption.§!\n"
 ENG_radical_socialist_party: "Labour (Autonomists)"
 ENG_radical_socialist_party_long: "Labour - Autonomists\n§LAn eclectic, albeit loose-knit mixture of principled pacifists, christian socialists, regionalists and more, the Autonomists can trace their roots back to the old Wheatleyite wing of the defunct ILP. The libertarian socialist faction's common ground revolves around continued decentralisation of Britain to give Wales and Scotland formal home rule, the promotion of G.D.H. Cole's co-operative 'Guild Socialism' over than the Smilie-Moffat system of TUC-led economic planning, and diplomatic internationalism. Having gradually defected to Labour following Snowden's takeover of the ILP and its subsequent implosion when he rapidly shifted the party towards social democracy, the Autonomists make up a sizable proportion of the Labour Party but their ideological breadth and scattered nature limits their influence.§!\n"
 ENG_BLR_radical_socialist_party: "Labour (Actionists)"
 ENG_BLR_radical_socialist_party_long: "Labour - Council of Action\n§LOnce a Mosleyite-sympathising body of young deputies, the Council of Action has expanded into a body of 'moderates' aligned with, but not necessarily subordinate to, the New Labour Association and the wider Maximist movement. While by no means instinctual totalitarians, these socialist centralists are sympathetic to the Maximist State in its broad strokes, and garner a lot of power among the civil service and especially the Ministry of Finance, where Mosley's economic proposals are seen with great veneration.§!\n"
 ENG_social_democrat_party: "Social Democrats"
 ENG_social_democrat_party_long: "Social Democratic Party\n§LFounded in 1932 by Hugh Dalton, the Social Democratic Party can trace its roots to Philip Snowden's reformed, more social democratic ILP of the late 1920s. Built out of the Fabian-inclined \"XYZ Club\", a cohort of moderate intellectuals and economists, Hugh Dalton and his associates left the ILP to sit as independents in the early days of the Parliamentary Crisis, eventually establishing the SDP as an electoral vehicle for centre-left independents. While seen with some suspicion, the SDP have avoided crackdowns for being focused on economic theorising and discussion over political agitation. In kind, the SDP affiliates with an economic think-tank, Evan Durbin's Economic and Social Research Bureau, and holds an ideology around revisionist and centralist social democracy that sits to the right of Labour.§!\n"
 ENG_social_liberal_party: "Liberals"
 ENG_social_liberal_party_long: "Liberal Party - Samuelites\n§LThe Liberal Party was reorganised following the Revolution, reformed by dissident members and MPs who had left the National Government and sided with the rebels, but who had also not embraced socialism and joined Labour. Led by Robert Crewe-Milnes (though he was soon sidelined), Herbert Samuel and Percy Harris, the new party largely followed the 'New Liberal' tradition to an extreme, tilting leftward with support for social progressivism workplace democracy and 'controlled capitalism'. The de-facto 'third party' of the Union, the Liberals did well in 1931, scaring the syndicalist establishment, but their successes ended swiftly with the Parliamentary Crisis. Triggering a constitutional crisis with other members of the 'Second UDC', the ILP and NDP, the party fell alongside them. Samuel and his allies were arrested for sedition after protesting Mann's controversial prorogation of the Provincial Parliament to break the deadlock.§!\n"
 ENG_market_liberal_party: "Constitutionalists"
 ENG_market_liberal_party_long: "Liberal Party - Constitutionalists\n§LWhile the post-Revolution Liberal Party largely tacked to the left, this shift opened up a great divide with classically and conservative minded Liberals who hadn't boarded the boats to Canada. These liberal-conservative 'Constitutionalists' instead took an openly anti-socialist political line, while pledging to uphold the morals of the 'British Constitution'. Small in number and operating almost as a party unto their own within the Liberal Party, the fringe fell under constant suspicion of almost certainly being an entryist front for royalist subversives. Constitutionalist candidates would face often violent protests by Labour members, tainting the Samuelites by association. The Mond Affair in late 1931, wherein faction grandee Abraham England was proven to be in contact with the late Jewish financier, spelled their doom. Raids and arrests scattered the Constitutionalists, whose remnants fled to Ireland to avoid treason charges.§!\n"
 ENG_social_conservative_party: "New Democrats"
 ENG_social_conservative_party_long: "New Democratic Party\n§LThe New Democratic Party was founded in 1927 by Harold Macmillan, a Tory radical who was famously arrested by the National Government on the floor of the House of Commons itself during the General Strike. Bringing together many conservative splinters and independents, the NDP stood as a fresh face encompassing the right-wing of the post revolution order, having repudiated aristocratic Toryism to subscribe to Macmillan's brand of syncretic corporatism. The NDP was expressly loyal to the Republic, but some believed them to be an electoral vehicle for reactionaries. The NDP was at the heart of the Parliamentary Crisis, with perhaps unfounded paranoia growing over Macmillan's movement after he tried to affiliate with Labour, before getting rejected after a militant rebellion and joining the 'Second UDC'. While Deputy Chairman Oswald Mosley interned Macmillan and his associates soon after, the idea of 'constructive republican conservatism' still informs a number of Congressional independents who escaped arrest.§!\n"
 ENG_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Ruralists"
 ENG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Rural Party\n§LPractically non-existent on the national level, though powerful in some regional assemblies, the Rural Party was founded in 1932 after the post- revolution Agricultural Party merged with a variety of smaller 'Farmers' parties and representatives from several farmers' and agricultural workers' unions. Led by the old agrarian independent Herbert Matthews, the Rural Party ties a syncretic redistributionist ideology around a fierce defence of rural interests and smallholders within the often urban-biased syndicalist system. Though openly aloof to national political debate, the Ruralists have become notorious for the suspected harbouring of royalists in their local branches, following a rumoured entryist push by the CRGB to seed agents within the party. Matthews has denied such allegations, but this hasn't stopped the party's more rightist branches from being suppressed by the C.I.C.§!\n"
 ENG_paternal_autocrat_party: "CRGB"
 ENG_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Committee for the Restoration of Great Britain\n§LThe most influential exile organisation outside of Canada, the Committee for the Restoration of Great Britain was established in 1931, unifying several smaller groups operating on the continent, most prominently the Anglo-German Fellowship. While officially advocating for a royalist restoration in Britain, the leading members of the CRGB have Germanophilic tendancies and are more devoted to their aristocratic arch-conservative ideology than true loyalty to the crown.§!\n"
 ENG_national_populist_party: "NRL"
 ENG_national_populist_party_long: "National Republican League\n§LThe latest party created by retired veterinarian Arnold Leese, the Nationa Republican League represents a sect of radical anti-socialism that has also distanced itself from monarchist Loyalism in the years since the Revolution, instead embracing a revolutionary nationalist doctrine that calls for a \"revolt against democracy and a return to statesmanship\". Ideologically the NRL naturally draws from the writings of Russia's Boris Savinkov whom Leese idolises, but with explicitly extreme antisemitism. The National Populists are perhaps best known for a long running and violent feud between itself and Oswald Mosley's Maximist movement.§!\n"

### Focuses ###
 ENG_status_quo: "Embrace the Status Quo"
 ENG_status_quo_desc: "The syndicalist order has withstood an onslaught of political challenges, but has held firm. Britain shall keep its course, and continue to boldly and unapologetically champion the cause of the worker and the revolution above all else."
 ENG_united_britain: "United Britain"
 ENG_united_britain_desc: "Britain faces great adversity both within and without. While conflict with reactionary nations may prove unavoidable, surely our nation and its people should stand united. Enemies of the revolution must be confronted and eliminated by any means necessary."
 ENG_new_generals: "Promote Young Talent"
 ENG_new_generals_desc: "There exists an abundance of young, talented officers among our ranks, often overlooked due to superiors more interested in improving the conditions of their fellow pupils than the condition of their army. A new round of promotions, aimed at young officers with admirable performance in the military academies, will be conducted to give our military the shake-up it needs."

 ENG_the_common_land: "The Common Land"
 ENG_the_common_land_desc: "While Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, much of our nation remains rural and reliant on agriculture. To facilitate increased crop yields, all lands seized from noble estates during the revolution should be parcelled to rural syndicates. Britain's land shall now belong to her people alone!"

 ENG_cayley_plan: "The Hidden Fleet Plan"
 ENG_cayley_plan_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Their ultimate victory in the war has convinced influential groups of officers that to avoid our previous fate, Britain must rapidly expand its submarine fleet and restructure its doctrine with Germany as its model"
 ENG_anstice_plan: "The Aviation Fleet Plan"
 ENG_anstice_plan_desc: "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, believers of precisely such a thing assert the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, they propose that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded"
 ENG_dickens_plan: "The Grand Fleet Plan"
 ENG_dickens_plan_desc: "The Royal Navy was centred around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted effort to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
 ENG_merchant_marine: "Expand the Repair Yards"
 ENG_merchant_marine_desc: "Though our navy is among the world's largest, we must also have the means to quickly repair our ships should they incur battle damage, or our enemies may wear us down through attrition. Expanding our repair yards would not only achieve this, but also enable us to refit some of our older models in a timely manner."
 ENG_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 ENG_expand_dockyards_desc: "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
 ENG_new_admirals: "Promote Fresh Leadership"
 ENG_new_admirals_desc: "For too long the Republican Navy has been too much of an old boy's club and this could seriously damage our naval effectiveness. To combat this we should ensure that some fresh new faces can take the reins of leadership."
 ENG_submarines: "Submarine Effort"
 ENG_submarines_desc: "Per our efforts to shift the Republican Navy's focus, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models"
 ENG_destroyers: "Destroyer Effort"
 ENG_destroyers_desc: "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
 ENG_carrier_efforts: "Carrier Effort"
 ENG_carrier_efforts_desc: "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centrepiece of the renewed British Navy."
 ENG_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 ENG_naval_aviation_desc: "Traditional aircraft designs are unable to fulfil the unique requirements of naval aviation. We must develop new aircraft designed be operated from carriers and other situations where runway space is at a premium."
 ENG_battlecruisers: "Cruiser Effort"
 ENG_battlecruisers_desc: "While lacking the armour of a battleship, cruisers are agile and pack a versatile suite of guns. An expansion of our cruiser fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
 ENG_battleships: "Battleship Effort"
 ENG_battleships_desc: "Battleships are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
 ENG_republican_marines: "The Republican Marines"
 ENG_republican_marines_desc: "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
 ENG_revolutionary_admiralty: "Review the Republican Navy"
 ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc: "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
 ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves: "Britannia Rules the Waves"
 ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc: "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

 ENG_republican_air_force: "The Republican Air Force"
 ENG_republican_air_force_desc: "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
 ENG_new_pilot_training: "New Pilot Training"
 ENG_new_pilot_training_desc: "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
 ENG_flying_women: "Women's Flying Corps"
 ENG_flying_women_desc: "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
 ENG_aviation_unions: "Aviation Unions"
 ENG_aviation_unions_desc: "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
 ENG_aviation_fuel_administration: "Aviation Fuel Administration"
 ENG_aviation_fuel_administration_desc: "Without fuel, it does not matter how skilled our pilots are. It is likely that when war comes our fuel imports will be cut-off so we must work towards domestics sources of fuel; for the safety of the revolution we mustn't be depended on capitalist suppliers of oil. They can't be trusted."
 ENG_air_observer_corps: "Air Observer Corps"
 ENG_air_observer_corps_desc: "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to forewarn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
 ENG_expand_air_unions: "Expand Air Unions"
 ENG_expand_air_unions_desc: "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the air force now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

 ENG_international: "Britain Within the International"
 ENG_international_desc: "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches. With the turbulent 1936 special session of the TUC at an end, Britain's place in the world, and especially its relationship with its socialist comrades of the Third Internationale, must be reassessed."
 ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation: "Norwegian Comrades"
 ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation_desc: "A more equitable Norway has arisen, and we will stand arm in arm with our socialist brethren there. The Norwegian and British people have much to offer each other, and as a gesture of our goodwill, we shall offer Norway generous economic assistance in exchange simply for future cooperation."
 ENG_anglo_irish_friendship: "Irish Comrades"
 ENG_anglo_irish_friendship_desc: "With the light of socialism at last shining upon the Emerald Isle, the time for reconciliation between our historically closely linked peoples has come. Not only should we send diplomats and politicians to Dublin, but also representatives of the most successful British syndicates to help Ireland along the path of progress."
 ENG_class_warfare: "Class Warfare"
 ENG_class_warfare_desc: "War is upon us, and to preserve our great nation and secure our liberty, all working men must now unite for victory. We should promote the spirit of unity, self-sacrifice, and most of all, renewed class consciousness, to augment our war effort."
 ENG_bletchley_park: "Bletchley Park"
 ENG_bletchley_park_desc: "In the north of Buckinghamshire, a crack team of military intelligence researchers has emerged. Despite minimal funding, the Bletchley Park Electrician's Union, in coordination with our foreign intelligence service, has produced singular results. We should expand Bletchley Park's facilities and provide them with substantial state funding."
 ENG_support_comrades: "Support Foreign Comrades"
 ENG_support_comrades_desc: "If socialism is to survive, all socialist nations must thrive. It is our duty as socialists to assist the formerly downtrodden peoples around the globe who now valiantly rise up against their oppressors."
 ENG_mexican_comrades: "Mexican Comrades"
 ENG_mexican_comrades_desc: "The people of Mexico were among the first to cast off the chains of capitalist exploitation. Mexico remains, however, quite underdeveloped. We possess the means to help the Mexicans better their lot, and such assistance would surely foster closer ties between our nations."
 ENG_mission_to_australasia: "Mission to Australasia"
 ENG_mission_to_australasia_desc: "Socialism down-under is in dire straits. If our comrades are to fight capitalist tyranny successfully, they must have assistance."
 ENG_australasian_comrades: "Australasian Comrades"
 ENG_australasian_comrades_desc: "Now that socialism down-under has stabilised, we much give them what support we can to avoid them slipping back into their old ways."
 ENG_indian_comrades: "Indian Comrades"
 ENG_indian_comrades_desc: "Britain was once the oppressor of the Indian people. However, the strength of the relationship between our two peoples, regardless of the unfortunate circumstance in which it was built, is undeniable. Through economic assistance to the Bharatiya People's Republic, we can begin to put right the injustices of history, and in the process, strengthen the socialist cause."

 ENG_tuc: "The 1936 Congress of the Trade Unions"
 ENG_tuc_desc: "This year's congress will probably be a bit special - the ageing Chairman Tom Mann has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, the establishment but factionalised Federationists, and the radical, centralist Maximists are all vying for the control over Labour's incoming delegates for the Congress. These will be nights to remember..."
 ENG_central_industry_research: "Central Industry Research"
 ENG_central_industry_research_desc: "To prepare our Syndicalist industry for the fight against the Capitalists, we should establish the Department for Central Industry Research. This office will help us overcome inefficiency."
 ENG_local_help: "Local Help Initiative"
 ENG_local_help_desc: "Many Comrades in the Union of Britain are still living in great poverty. The bureaucracy has done little to help them. If we extended our support of the local councils, these suffering people would finally feel the blessings of the revolution."
 ENG_expand_industry_1: "Expand Industry: Wales and the Midlands"
 ENG_expand_industry_1_desc: "The capitalist regime of old neglected Wales and the Midlands for centuries, and allowed, if not outright encouraged, the gradual depopulation of the region as its labourers migrated to England's southern cities for menial jobs. The great economic potential of these regions and its people thus remains largely untapped; for the benefit of all, we must invest!"
 ENG_militarized_industry: "Militarised Industry"
 ENG_militarized_industry_desc: "Only through relentless efficiency and discipline, even in the most mundane of tasks, will we be able to beat the capitalists."
 ENG_expand_industry_2: "Expand Industry: Scotland"
 ENG_expand_industry_2_desc: "Scotland to has been left behind, had its people neglected and its wealth stolen by the capitalist pigs. No more; today investment will flow north!"
 ENG_british_rail_reform: "Renovation of the Motorways"
 ENG_british_rail_reform_desc: "The large roadway networks linking the Great British cities are in a horrid state. By investing into our infrastructure, we will assure flawless cooperation between Syndicates all over the island."
 ENG_local_talent: "Local Talent Initiative"
 ENG_local_talent_desc: "We cannot afford to waste innovative talent just because it is not centred in the metropolitan areas. We need to support local talent."
 ENG_local_initiative: "Expand Local Initiative"
 ENG_local_initiative_desc: "While we have granted much power to the local communes, they continue to deal primarily with the central government. We should make reaching the central government harder so that our workers will work with each other for true socialist progress."
 ENG_political_commissars: "The Central Intelligence Committee"
 ENG_political_commissars_desc: "Sometimes, even the most diligent Syndicalist needs a small reminder of his duties. Sometimes, that reminder should be given from behind a revolvers' sights."
 ENG_new_capital: "A New Capital"
 ENG_new_capital_desc: "London has long held a privileged place in Britain, and has become swamped by Centralism and bureaucracy; the TUC's current location reinforces this. Only by moving to a smaller city, one at the heart of Britain, and thus within reach of all its people, will we able to guarantee fair representation for all. This city will be Birmingham."
 ENG_home_rule: "Home Rule"
 ENG_home_rule_desc: "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
 ENG_dissolve_tuc: "Dissolve the National TUC"
 ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc: "The Trade Union Congress has served its purpose. While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many. With the success of our initial decentralisation efforts, the time has come to make the People's Palace the seat of a new, English TUC. The remains of the Union will be dealt with shortly."
 ENG_devolution: "Devolution"
 ENG_devolution_desc: "With the establishment of TUCs in Cardiff and Edinburgh, the process of Devolution will come to a successful end."
 ENG_evolution: "Evolution"
 ENG_evolution_desc: "Both the Autonomists and the Maximists are trying to change an already working machine. British Syndicalism is fine as it is; If only they would understand that..."
 ENG_merge: "The Grand Protector"
 ENG_merge_desc: "While it is unconstitutional, unifying the offices of Chairman and General-Secretary of the TUC, the latter currently held by the Deputy Chair, into the new office of Grand Protector of the Union of Britain will give us much more power to push through our reforms."
 ENG_revolution: "Revolution"
 ENG_revolution_desc: "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political programme a reality. This will be risky, though."

 ENG_centralise_officers: "Centralised Planning"

 ENG_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Britain sacrificed almost a million men in the Weltkrieg and had nothing to show for it. The next five years of anger, recession and crisis culminated in a national General Strike, which in turn ignited into revolution. The fleeing of the Royal Family at the end of 1925 saw the rise of a new Union of Britain, dominated by socialist forces, but the decade since has been stormy. Deadlock, paranoia over royalist subversion and a bitter political climate have led to growing authoritarianism, with a dominant yet deeply divided Labour Party at the helm. However, even if they're at each other's throats, everyone can agree on one thing: the Red Flag must keep flying."

 ENG_country_intro_header: "The New Britain"
 ENG_country_intro_content: "The Victorian golden era saw the British Empire ascend to a superpower status, the likes of which the world had never seen before, an empire on which the sun would never set. The Royal Navy dominated the seven seas, unchallenged by her rivals and the British Army could lord upon a colonial empire, the largest in history. But in 1914, decades of deft diplomacy and Continental politicking, the world would be set ablaze. Plunged into a conflict of such an immense scale, the geopolitical axis of the world would be thrown into shambles and entire generations of young men were sacrificed to the engines of war. The devastation wrought on the population coupled with the post-war economic decline, the Great Slump, brought Britain to her knees as the gap between the haves and the have-nots became a gaping chasm.\n\nAfter years of austerity and political scandal, prospective army cuts, by an unpopular Conservative-led National Government, pushed the nation over the brink at last and years of festering anger would boil over into outright rebellion. The British Civil War would devestate the island over the course of 1924 and 1925 during which George Lansbury and Arthur Cook declared the Union of Britain, the second major socialist state to come to fruition in the defeated West. After over a year of brutal fighting, rampant devastation and misery for the populace, the Red flag flew proudly over London and the old order had been driven from the Isles. To the shock of the world, Great Britain was now a socialist regime, isolated and rebuilding after the destruction of her revolution. While the scars of war ran deep, optimism set in and civil government would return under a markedly radical socialist regime led by a coalition parliamentary Labour notables, orthodox syndicalists and trade unionists. Old Labour and the trade unions had been converted to embrace the path of revolution at last, even if a more moderate one.\n\nBut by 1931, the growing syndicalist wing of the party had assumed control and finally took power under the syndicalist veteran, Tom Mann. The syndicalist orthodoxy was not yet cemented until 1932 when Mann forcibly disbanded the renegade Provincial Parliament and killed off the opposition with it, transforming Britain into a de facto one party state. Further scandals would abound and destroy his first administration, giving rise to the young and ambitious Oswald Mosley, of the growing "Maximist" movement. A rising star, Mosley's authoritarian tendency and the violence that surrounds his followers seems set to define the new politics, at least if he has his way. But the dream of the Autonomists - of a new Jerusalem, a more liberal republic - have since grown quietly in the more moderate circles of the Party who plot and scheme for their turn in Whitehall."

 union_of_britain_events.2.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."

 union_of_britain_events.5.t: "Military Policy Vote"
 union_of_britain_events.5.d: "The debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
 union_of_britain_events.5.a: "Max.: The military must be expanded and the local militias placed under TUC control."
 union_of_britain_events.5.b: "Fed.: The army must be expanded but only in self-defence."
 union_of_britain_events.5.c: "Aut.: A Scottish, English, and Welsh national army."

 union_of_britain_events.6.t: "The Resignation of Tom Mann"
 union_of_britain_events.6.d: "On the last day of the Congress, Chairman Tom Mann climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post immediately and have an interim committee take his place until the final ballots are cast. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do.\n\nWhile Mann's Chairmanship has had its ups and downs, he is still a broadly popular figure within the TUC and Britain at large, being a titan of British Syndicalism. It is little surprise then that the delegation present at the Congress was quick to give the Chairman a standing ovation, with everyone from the Maximist militants to fringe Autonomist pacifists giving him his due."
 union_of_britain_events.6.a: "The Old Mann finally bows out."

 union_of_britain_events.7.t: "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"

 union_of_britain_events.9.a: "Congratulations, Comrade Glais."

 union_of_britain_events.10.t: "Chairman Election - Draw"
 union_of_britain_events.10.d: "The TUC has voted repeatedly during the last few days and the deadlock continues. It would appear that, while he was clearly planning on retiring once this Congress had run its course, the venerable Chairman Mann is the only man who can unite the fractured Labour Party in this critical time, as Arthur Horner's attempts to negotiate his own coalition have fallen on deaf ears. Deputy Chairman Mosley, perhaps humbled by his lack of success, has indicated that he is willing to retain the current Federationist-Maximist coalition even if the tensions between himself and Mann are well-known. On the other side of the isle, the Autonomists have also come out in favour of a coalition under the Chairman, putting forward Niclas y Glais as their candidate for the Deputy Chairmanship.\n\nUltimately, the choice falls on Mann's shoulders: does he stick by Mosley, or bring in the Autonomists?"
 union_of_britain_events.10.a: "Despite the personality clash, the Mann-Mosley Government remains."
 union_of_britain_events.10.b: "Mann sidelines the Maximists, and appoints Glais as his Deputy!"

Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice.

 union_of_britain_events.27.t: "The Canadians Cower"
 union_of_britain_events.27.d: "The Canadians did not dare to send their fleet into the Atlantic allowing our force to operate freely. This has shown the power of socialism and weakness of the Imperialist 'great powers'."

Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored.

 union_of_britain_events.220.d: "Yesterday British Republican Army units tried to arrest many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley. However, many had left their homes and gone undercover after having been tipped off by sources inside the armed forces. There are also as-of-yet unconfirmed reports of many of them openly marching into the assembly hall of the Trade Union Congress under the massive cheers of anti-Mosley demonstrators, only leaving after being handcuffed at the speakers table to the "boos" of the assembly. This day will leave a clear mark on Maximist prestige."

 union_of_britain_events.221.d: "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman. Whatever this threat is it is obviously under control as the Maximist pass emergency law after emergency law; The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

 union_of_britain_events.222.d: "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman. This threat then became obvious as the military forces came under fire from private homes leading to prolonged battles all over the island. The number of casualties is as-of-yet unknown, but the Maximists pass emergency law after emergency law in order to contain the situation; The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

 union_of_britain_events.338.d: "The battlefields have fallen silent. But while our soldiers enjoy their well-earned rest, worried representatives of Industrial Syndicates have come forward, with statistics showing the large degree to which the Union's industry has been restructured to aid the war effort. For now, our economy is still somewhat stable - but the upcoming years will not be easy ones."

 union_of_britain_events.351.d: "Our economy was enlarged in the time leading up to the war. The extraordinary congress now has to face the decision of either pushing for further expansion or prioritising the healing of the wounds inflicted by the war."
 union_of_britain_events.351.a: "Onwards, British industry! Build, build, build!"

 union_of_britain_events.356.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 union_of_britain_events.356.d: "Comrade Mosley saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Maximism has led us well through this war and is still popular - but the people are growing tired of authoritarianism, and elements in the Maximists and the Pankhurstites are seeking to propose a new liberal way forward."
 union_of_britain_events.356.a: "Chairman-for-Life! Rule per decree!"
 union_of_britain_events.356.b: "Maximist liberals John Strachey and Eric Blair defeat Mosley!"

 union_of_britain_events.357.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 union_of_britain_events.357.d: "Our inimitable chairwoman has shown mettle like that of Elizabeth I as she led us reluctantly through this war. Today, however, she looks tired and unlikely to win re-election. Perhaps she can, though, if she looks to more unconventional allies..."
 union_of_britain_events.357.a: "The Maximist Mosley and his protege John Strachey win the top jobs."
 union_of_britain_events.357.b: "She turns to Radical Socialist Clem Attlee for support!"
 union_of_britain_events.357.c: "Perhaps a bit more of a feminine touch..."

 union_of_britain_events.358.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 union_of_britain_events.358.d: "It has been quite some time since Chairman Glais oversaw the de-federalisation of our Union, the creation of communal leadership and the autonomy of Wales and Scotland. Now, in the aftermath of the European war, we must decide whether his reforms will last or a restoration of the Chairmanship is in order."
 union_of_britain_events.358.a: "The Maximist Mosley and his protege John Strachey win the top jobs."

 union_of_britain_events.359.d: "The Chairman has saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Federationism has led us well through this war and is still popular - but Oswald Mosley is challenging him for the Chair, as is the up-and-coming Pankhurstite Ellen Wilkinson. Federationists may have to rely on an old ally to win the day..."

 union_of_britain_events.360.t: "Terminate Home Rule?"
 union_of_britain_events.360.d: "Now that the Maximists rule over the Union of Britain, they should realise their promise of limiting Home Rule once again. But while this promise has quite the following in the halls of London and other British cities, protests and demonstrations have been staged by our enemies already - and they will only grow stronger if we follow through..."
 union_of_britain_events.360.a: "It shall be done!"
 union_of_britain_events.360.b: "Maybe this wasn't the best idea..."

 union_of_britain_events.361.t: "A Cold, Wet Day for Eric Blair"
 union_of_britain_events.361.d: "Comrade Eric Blair, once an ally of Grand Protector Mosley, cannot stand it any longer. For too long the evil Mosley had perverted the constitution and made the Union of Britain his plaything. A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."
 union_of_britain_events.361.a: "His coup is successful!"
 union_of_britain_events.361.b: "Mosley sniffs out the coup!"

 union_of_britain_events.363.t: "The Oil Question"
 union_of_britain_events.363.d: "It has been decades since we forced the capitalists out, yet we can't rest. Not until they are all defeated will we be safe, but to defeat them the workers spirit will not be enough. There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."
 union_of_britain_events.363.a: "It will have to be enough..."

 union_of_britain_events.364.t: "Support from the Union of Britain"
 union_of_britain_events.364.d: "Today an envoy from the Union of Britain arrived. He brought with him promises of industrial assistance, naval advice and technological support, along with kinda words of admiration for our struggle. The capitalists may be strong and fighting us at every turn, but with allies such as these, we will best them regardless."
 union_of_britain_events.364.a: "Truly workers solidarity is shining out from Britain."

 union_of_britain_events.365.t: "A Change in Leadership?"
 union_of_britain_events.365.d: "The Chairman has saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Federationism saved us from Mosley's Tyranny, has led us well through this war and is still popular - but Mosley-disciple John Strachey is challenging him for the Chair, as is the up-and-coming Pankhurstite Ellen Wilkinson. Federationists may have to rely on an old ally to win the day..."
 union_of_britain_events.365.a: "The Chairman sees off the threat to their leadership."

 union_of_britain_events.1000.d: "Our Railway Syndicates have a tradition of giving out ridiculously difficult crossword puzzles in their newspapers. Only a few people manage to actually solve these puzzles. Now, however, the Mid-England Rail Syndicate has reported that for the past few months, anonymous letters have started arriving, always containing the correct solutions to the last crossword puzzle. Whoever is writing these letters must be some sort of genius - and could probably be of help to us..."

 union_of_britain_events.1000.b: "What do I care?"

 union_of_britain_events.1001.t: "Wrapped in a Mystery"
 union_of_britain_events.1001.d: "It took quite some time, but our intelligence services finally managed to find the man who still regularly solves the hardest crossword puzzles in the country with ease. His name is Alan Turing, a math professor before the revolution, currently living in London. He first tried to evade our men, but after some time, calmed down. And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."
 union_of_britain_events.1001.a: "Grant the funds!"
 union_of_britain_events.1001.b: "You what? Never!"

 union_of_britain_events.1002.t: "Inside an Enigma"
 union_of_britain_events.1002.d_1: "'He did it, the (expletive), he did it!' our leading scientists are cited in today's papers. The small project of this Turing, over time grown into a whole village near the former cottage at Bletchley Park, has finally seen success. He has constructed a strange machine, called 'Pudding' after the Yorkshire pudding Turing was enjoying when he had the idea, that has revolutionised cryptography. For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."
 union_of_britain_events.1002.d_2: "'He did it, the (expletive), he did it!' our leading scientists are cited in today's papers. The once small project of Alan Turing, grown massively since we provided handsome funding to the operation in Bletchley Park, has finally seen success. Turing constructed a strange machine, called 'Pudding' after the Yorkshire pudding Turing was enjoying when he had the idea, that has revolutionised cryptography. For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."
 union_of_britain_events.1002.a: "An extraordinary achievement!"

 union_of_britain_events.1003.t: "Wells Proposes a World Encyclopaedia"
 union_of_britain_events.1003.d: "Herbert George Wells has just presented before the Republican Institution plans for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being."
 union_of_britain_events.1003.a: "We must spread the Light of knowledge to the entire world!"
 union_of_britain_events.1003.b: "Every British family must be enlightened."
 union_of_britain_events.1003.c: "What a silly idea..."

 union_of_britain_events.1004.t: "Enid Blyton: The Smuggler's Island"
 union_of_britain_events.1004.d: "The Writer's Union publishing house has today released a new book by the famous British author and Pankhurstite Enid Blyton. 'Secret of a Lonely Island' is about the thrilling and romantic adventures of the siblings Julian, Dick, and Ann, their cousin Georgina, and her dog Timmy. While on a holiday with their Union Youth group in the Hebrides the children stumble over mysterious events including a lonely island, strange ships, and mysterious lights in the night. But with wits and courage the five friends are able to overcome any menace."
 union_of_britain_events.1004.a: "Blyton surely is a great author."

 union_of_britain_events.1005.t: "Comrade Blair's Book is Published"
 union_of_britain_events.1005.d: "Eric Arthur Blair's long-awaited vision of the future, entitled 'The Union in Forty Years', is finally running off the national presses. In it Comrade Blair offers an inspiring vision of how far the Union of Britain will have come by 1984; describing a period of peace and prosperity for workers not only within our island but across the world. The book will serve as a much-needed boost to morale in these trying times and has been distributed to all members of the armed forces and the national workforce."
 union_of_britain_events.1005.a: "An excellent read."

 union_of_britain_events.1006.t: "The World Encyclopaedia"
 union_of_britain_events.1006.d: "Comrade H.G. Wells has, with funding of the Union of Britain, gone through with his plan of the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. The whole world cheers on the endless efforts to bring the Syndicalist creed to even the most far-flung readers."

 union_of_britain_events.1014.d.leader: "Britain's ever-faithful servant and current Chairman of the Congress of Trade Unions Tom Mann has died in his sleep.

On a wave of sympathy with Mann's own Federationist faction, Arthur Horner has been elected to replace him."
 union_of_britain_events.1014.d.default: "Britain's ever-faithful servant and leading trade unionist Tom Mann has died in his sleep at his home in Grassington, Northern Yorkshire. A Revolutionary of the old guard, Mann spent his life serving the people of Britain, and even after retiring as Chairman in 1936 he made sure to remain a public figure, attending rallies and events right up until his last days. He will be sorely missed."
 union_of_britain_events.1014.a: "You will be missed, comrade."

 union_of_britain_events.1017.d: "After the recent developments in Ireland the British ambassador in Dublin has invited his Canadian counterpart and his attachés to a dinner party in order to finally alleviate the tension - or at least that's what the Canadian delegation thought. Instead, they found themselves in a Dublin gin joint being served grumpy stew. As they finally left the embarrassing meeting they had to parade through a street filled with Irish socialists cheering on the British delegation. With this spiteful parting gesture however the British campaign against Ireland seems to have come to an end."
 union_of_britain_events.1017.a: "Definitely worth it!"

 union_of_britain_events.1019.t: "The John Maclean Explodes!"
 union_of_britain_events.1019.d: "The John Maclean, named after the first president of the Union of Britain, was the largest airship ever built. She was constructed in 1935 as a propaganda tool, intended to show the world the achievements of the Union of Britain. In 1936, she made her maiden voyage, and soon started making regular traffic to Paris. Today, as she was about to dock at a Paris airfield, she burst into flames and crashed to the ground. 35 people out of 97 (plus one of the ground crew) died."
 union_of_britain_events.1019.a: "A tragedy!"

 union_of_britain_events.1020.t: "Comrade Mosley Calls a Meeting"
 union_of_britain_events.1020.d: "Comrade Mosley of the Maximist faction has invited Georges Valois, leader of the French Sorelians, the Swiss revolutionary Jakob Herzog and the Italian National Syndicalist Benito Mussolini to Birmingham to compile a manifesto stating their joint aims for a new kind of Socialism called 'Totalism.' Chairman Mann's Federationists should keep an eye on this development."
 union_of_britain_events.1020.a: "Worrying, to say the least."

 union_of_britain_events.1021.t: "Mosley Wants to Talk With Mussolini"
 union_of_britain_events.1021.d: "Oswald Mosley of the Union of Britain has invited the Chairman of the Fascio d'Azione Rivoluzionaria, Benito Mussolini, to Birmingham to discuss the common ground between their ideologies.

 union_of_britain_events.1022.d: "Oswald Mosley of the Union of Britain has invited the leader of the Sorelians, Georges Valois, to Birmingham to discuss the common ground between their ideologies. Valois has thanked him for the invite and set off in the name of internationalism, bringing with him as guests the Hungarian exiles Tibor Szamuely and Mátyás Rákosi, whose views are also very much in line with Mosley's and Mussolini's."

 union_of_britain_events.1025.t: "The Union of Arts"
 union_of_britain_events.1025.d: "For a few years now, a group of artists led by a German emigrant by the name of Hannes Meyer have pushed for their idea of a unified Union of Arts. They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set. Should we establish one Union for all our artists, or leave things as they are?"
 union_of_britain_events.1025.a: "The way forward is together!"
 union_of_britain_events.1025.b: "We don't need centralisation for centralisation's sake..."

 union_of_britain_events.1026.t: "Rebuilding the Crystal Palace"
 union_of_britain_events.1026.d: "Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1844, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

 union_of_britain_events.1034.t: "A Modern Day Witch?"
 union_of_britain_events.1034.d: "In an unusual turn of events, the government has today announced that the Witchcraft Act of 1735 is to be repealed and that all those currently tried under the law are to have their sentences halved. Under normal circumstances this would not raise eyebrows as many old laws were imported in the creation of the new constitution and progressively rescinded though this one has stuck out.\n\nOne week ago, a Scottish medium by the name Helen Duncan was arrested on the grounds of falsely claiming to procure spirit and obtaining money under false pretences before being sentenced to nine months in prison. Duncan will no doubt go down in history as the last person to be tried and arrested under the Witchcraft Act."

 union_of_britain_events.1035.t: "Arson At RAF Penrhos"
 union_of_britain_events.1035.d: "The Republican Air Force base at Penrhos was burned down last night in what seemed like a random arson attack. However, this morning the three culprits; Saunders Lewis; Lewis Valentine and DJ Williams turned themselves in at the Pwllheli Police Station. In an eloquent defence, Saunders Lewis referred to the construction of the airbase at such a historic cultural monument 'a crime against Wales' and that this was simply the act of a 'downtrodden people lashing out.' The Maximists of the TUC have called for the alleged ringleader Williams to be executed and his co-conspirators imprisoned. In a more calm tone, the Federationists have called for the three men to be arrested and finally the Autonomists have called for them to be acquitted."
 union_of_britain_events.1035.a: "Life imprisonment for the lot of them!"
 union_of_britain_events.1035.b: "A short stint in prison shall set these men right."

 union_of_britain_events.2000.intro: "The 1936 Trade Union Congress in the Union of Britain was made out to be decisive. Chairman Tom Mann declared his resignation, causing the three major factions in the Union - Maximists, Autonomists, and Federationists - to butt heads over the position."
 union_of_britain_events.2000.mosley: "$union_of_britain_events.2000.intro$\n\nAnd as the dust settled, Oswald Mosley, the current Deputy Chairman and leader of the Maximist movment, has been appointed as the new Chairman. Mosley's faction supports a strong central government and full state control of the economy, and are much more in favour of military action and British nationalism than any other faction."
 union_of_britain_events.2000.niclas_y_glais: "$union_of_britain_events.2000.intro$\n\nAnd as the dust settles, Welsh poet and leader of the Autonomists, Niclas y Glais, has been sworn in as the new Chairman. The Autonomists support further decentralisation of the Union of Britain and even greater autonomy to the Welsh and Scottish nations, perhaps even full independence."
 union_of_britain_events.2000.sylvia_pankhurst: "$union_of_britain_events.2000.intro$\n\nAnd as the dust settled, Sylvia Pankhurst, the leader of the Federationist dissidents, was elected the new Chairman, or Chairwoman in this case. Pankhurst is one of only a few female leaders on the planet, and her ideology of a radical feminist and egalitarian approach fit this situation."
 union_of_britain_events.2000.arthur_horner: "$union_of_britain_events.2000.intro$\n\nAnd as the dust settled, Arthur Horner, the current Welsh Secretary, has been chosen as Mann's successor.

To many, this is a sign of upcoming political inertia in the Union of Britain."
 union_of_britain_events.2001.a: "Interesting."

 union_of_britain_events.2002.t: "The Totalist Charter"
 union_of_britain_events.2002.d: "Mussolini, Valois, Herzog and other interested parties arrived in Birmingham today to discuss their common ground. It has been agreed that Maximism, Sorelianism and National-Syndicalism all share basic principles of the state's primacy in the socialist struggle, the role of national identity within the state and the importance of a strong central authority to preserve and build socialism. The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism.\nThese statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name \"Totalism\" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosley who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism."

 ENG_oswald_mosley: "Oswald Mosley"
 ENG_oswald_mosley_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 16th, 1896, in Mayfair, London, England§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet of Ancoats. At least until he cast off his titles in the 20s as a symbolic display of his revolutionary loyalty. Known as 'Tom' by his family and friends, this young man has scaled the dizzying heights of success from an ambitious young MP to now the undisputed Chairman of the Union of Britain. Beginning his rise as a progressive minded Conservative MP for Harrow in 1919, Mosley soon left to stand as an Independent to pursue his own programme before being swayed into the ILP by the Webb's. It was here he found his people: the dreamers and the ideologues; the young and the ambitious. First elected as an ILP MP, Mosley was either loved or loathed by his Labour colleagues, but was widely regarded as an up and coming PM. Enamoured with Keynes, Mosley first fused it with socialism during these years and it has remained a key tenet of his beliefs. So when the Revolution came, there was not a doubt in Mosley's mind who to support. Working as an administrator and orator for rebel forces, Mosley was instrumental in the 1925 Birmingham Uprising but in the post-revolution status quo, there was no call for young men who dared to dream. Spurned by dusty old union men, Mosley left the country and returned a man with ideas and ambition.\n\nForming his own Popular Revolution Party to advance his career within Labour, Mosley won a seat as an aviation unionist and he was once again thrust into the limelight, seen as a youthful man of action belonging to the next generation of politicians. With support from across the political spectrum swelling for his radical ideas at transforming Britain, Chairman Cook took notice and appointed him as a Junior member of the Ministry of Works in charge of public infrastructure. Mosley excelled and when his boss Jimmy Thomas was under fire for corruption, he stabbed him in the back, took his spot and come 1932 led the smashing of the Liberals. With a name for himself, it was only a matter of time before he became Mann's Deputy. And now with the old Mann gone, Mosley is ready to drag Britain into its glorious future.§!"

Coming off the back of Mosley's disgraceful collapse, Strachey has been poised to take the reins and has since taken the Maximists away from the cultist devotion that surrounded his friend and mentor. A self-proclaimed 'liberal Maximist', Strachey aligns closely with the economic organisation and principles of the Maximist state but is less so inclined to its totalitarian and ultra-statist philosophy.§!"

With Britain brought to heel and the Revolution restored, Dutt stands as a loyal collaborator in reshaping the revolution into what could have been.§!"

 ENG_arthur_horner: "Arthur Horner"
 ENG_arthur_horner_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril 5th, 1894, in Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorganshire, Wales§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe thought of a Welsh coal miner is unlikely to conjure up the image of Arthur Lewis Horner: a relatively small man sporting round spectacles and a bookish look about him. But this would betray the career of the revolutionary that is Arthur Horner.\n\nStarting his career as a lay evangelical Christian, the radical politics of the Rhondda Valley saw Horner follow Keir Hardie into the ILP and become the protégé of Noah Ablett, one of the earliest proponents of a 'rational syndicalism' in Britain. Under Ablett's tutelage, Horner became a committed Marxist and syndicalist but, opposing the Great War, he fled to Ireland and later fought for Jim Connolly's Irish Citizen Army during the Easter Rising. After a spell in prison, Horner followed Ablett and his friend, A.J. Cook into becoming founding members of the SPGB and later befriending his future ally, Tom Mann, with who he helped found the NMM.\n\nSoon, worker's discontent led to revolution. Horner served first as an organiser of rebel soldiers and then as a delegate to the renegade Cardiff Commune where he worked as Ablett's private secretary. When the revolution was won, Horner opted to enter the national TUC on his mentor's advice, but being too junior for a government posting he instead focused on restructuring the NMM, bringing him to Mann's attention. With Ablett struggling with alcoholism and cancer, Horner resigned his seat on the eve of 1931 and sought election to the Welsh Regional Congress to continue Ablett's work, soon being elected the Welsh Chairman. A savvy diplomat, Horner became a close ally in the Mann government - helping shore up Mann's administration in a region well known for its radicalism and nonconformity. It wouldn't be long before a growing clique of like-minded reformists began to surround 'The Negotiator': impressed with his pragmatic approach to politics and turned off by Mann's militancy. Now the Negotiator is in the driving seat, ready to build a new orthodoxy for all.§!"

 ENG_sylvia_pankhurst: "Sylvia Pankhurst"
 ENG_sylvia_pankhurst_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMay 5th, 1882, in Old Trafford, Manchester, England§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWhile most of the British Syndicalist establishment can claim to have participated in one victorious revolution, few can claim to have fought in two. For Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst, revolution started young. After all, the name Pankhurst has meaning: the suffragette movement.\n\nSylvia became a suffragette in 1906, dedicating her life to the work of her mother's WPSU. In that fight she was arrested eight times, and her hunger strikes brought her to national fame. Dissatisfied with the WSPU's social elitism, and with family friends Keir Hardie and Tom Mann supporting her, Pankhurst organised her own political outfit. It was here, as she opposed conscription in the Great War (breaking with her family over the issue) that Pankhurst radicalised to the left, going from suffrage fighter to fire-breathing revolutionary.\n\nBut Pankhurst was never loyal to institutions - she has belonged to 10 different political parties over the last 30 years. While she did join the SPGB upon its formation, the opponent of parliamentarianism left over the issue of affiliation with the Labour Party. Gaining a derisive reputation of being “politically promiscuous”, the zealous Pankhurst actively fought in the British Revolution, but still didn't reintegrate into the political establishment for years afterwards - eventually reconciling her “unhampered” principles with a need to be “among comrades”. It wasn't until 1933 that Pankhurst returned from the wilderness, becoming a lighting rod for reformers and radicals of all stripes. Her old friend has now retired, and Pankhurst's zealous, previously dissident form of syndicalism has replaced him. Sylvia Pankhurst is now the most powerful woman in the world, and she fully intends to use that power to free the peoples of the world.§!"

 ENG_tom_mann: "Tom Mann"
 ENG_tom_mann_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LApril 15th, 1856, in Coventry, Warwickshire, England§!\n§YBackground:§! §LIt'd be impossible to detail everything that Tom Mann, the Second Chairman of the Union of Britain, has done in his long life, but rest assured that his fingerprints are upon seemingly every syndicalist strike, movement and revolution since the late 1800s, in Britain, Australia, and beyond. Tom Mann also has the dubious honour of being the oldest head of state in the world, but it would be a mistake to see him as tired and infirm. A vigorous workaholic, Mann remains a \"volcanic\" rhetorical force, just as sharp as men forty years his junior.\n\nFrom a long engineering career, Mann became one of the nation's leading trade unionists and syndicalist leaders. When the bells tolled, after a life of service to the labour movement, Mann offered to take to the barricades. Denied due to his age, he became an organiser and toured rebel areas to provide much needed morale. When the revolution was won, Mann was now placed to be a leading figure in the new order. Indeed, as the President of the arch-syndicalist NMM, Mann was quickly appointed the new Minister for Labour, responsible for organising the nation's new trade union framework. The diligent Mann was able to swiftly organise a transition from the old to the new, even influencing the Minister for Finance, Robert Smilie. It seemed that Mann would soon head up the economy but when Chairman Arthur Cook resigned, he anointed Mann his successor. Old 'Uncle Tom' was elected decisively, defeating Arthur Henderson of 'Old' Labour. While the two men reconciled, syndicalism now dominated and 'Mannism' became the new vogue. Stepping onto the stage, there was much excitement. Perhaps, hope that was misplaced...\n\nSince rising to the challenge of leadership, Mann's ministry has been one of soaring heights and terrible lows. For every victory such as Abe Moffat's rapid industrial growth or the genius of Liddell-Hart's military reforms, there has been a crisis to match. The worst, the 1932 Parliamentary Crisis, saw British politics irrevocably broken with the disbanding of the Provincial Parliament; rising corruption; and the rise of Oswald Mosley and his radical 'Maximist' movement. But the nation still looks upon the old Mann fondly, and if he goes soon, he will be missed.§!"

 britain_puppet_events.1.t: "Restoration of the [GBP.GetAdjective] Throne?"
 britain_puppet_events.1.d: "With the military occupation finally finished, the time has come to establish a new administration for the isles. The most natural choice would be to establish a client republic to make the transition from syndicalism to orderly governance less painful. However, it has been proposed by some that we install Carl-Eduard of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the British throne. The so-called 'traitor prince' himself is open to the position and has previously expressed an interest in ruling over his birth country, though our new collaborators have warned he will be a liability and his mere presence could badly antagonise the British. Regardless England shall raise its fist against the Vaterland no more!"
 britain_puppet_events.1.a: "A German king shall sit on St. Edward's Throne!"
 britain_puppet_events.1.b: "Look what they did to the last king, a republic is more preferable."

 britain_puppet_events.2.t: "A New Order in Britain"
 britain_puppet_events.2.d: "Following the defeat of the Union of Britain, the occupation will now officially come to an end following the imposition of new borders. After three centuries of Union, England and Scotland have at last been divided once more.\n\nOur armies will continue to remain heavily involved, helping prop up the new English and Scottish governments, until at some point we may deem them more trustworthy. Loyal collaborators seeking to remake these lands anew will take over much of the day-to-day running, particularly in suppressing the ongoing 'continuation' insurgencies of Union loyalists.\n\nWhile the British may yet resist, in time the republics of England and Scotland will cement their place in the world and the concept of the 'British' nation will be relegated to the dustbin of history."
 britain_puppet_events.2.a: "The natural order of the isles has been restored."

 britain_puppet_events.3.t: "A New Order in Britain"
 britain_puppet_events.3.d: "Following the defeat of the Union of Britain, the occupation will now officially come to an end following the imposition of new borders. After half a millennium of union, England, Scotland and Wales have been divided once more.\n\nOur armies will continue to remain heavily involved, helping prop up the new English, Scottish and Welsh governments, until at some point we may deem them more trustworthy. Loyal collaborators seeking to remake these lands anew and revive once lost national identities will take over much of the day-to-day running, particularly in suppressing the ongoing 'continuation' insurgencies of Union loyalists.\n\nWhile the British may yet resist, in time the republics of England, Scotland and Wales will cement their place in the world and the concept of the 'British' nation will be relegated to the dustbin of history, once and for all."
 britain_puppet_events.3.a: "An isle once whole, shattered forever."

 britain_puppet_events.4.t: "A Little Gift from Zim"
 britain_puppet_events.4.d: "Not really sure how you got here but to whoever's playing their puppets, here's a little top up for your manpower, guns and factories. Enjoy being a German lackey."
 britain_puppet_events.4.a: "I promise I will!"

 britain_puppet_events.5.t: "Another Little Gift from Zim"
 britain_puppet_events.5.d: "... Uh you're not supposed to see this."

 britain_puppet_events.6.d: "...\n\nAre you seriously playing puppet Wales?"
 britain_puppet_events.6.a: "Yes."

 britain_puppet_events.7.t: "A New Order in Britain"
 britain_puppet_events.7.d: "Following the defeat of the Union of Britain, the occupation will now officially come to an end following the imposition of a new administration. After centuries of imperial hegemony and international power, Great Britain lies in tatters, a shadow of what once was.\n\nOur armies will continue to remain heavily involved, helping prop up the new British government, until at some point we may deem them more trustworthy. Loyal collaborators seeking to remake the nation anew will take over much of the day-to-day running, particularly in suppressing the ongoing 'continuation' insurgencies of Union loyalists.\n\nWhile the British may yet resist, in time the new republic will cement its place in the world and England shall rattle its sword no more."
 britain_puppet_events.7.a: "May we never experience the same fate."
