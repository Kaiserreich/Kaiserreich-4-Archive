#Main Country Leaders
 MAL_burhanuddin_al_helmy: "Burhanuddin al Helmy"

 MAL_zhuang_mingli: "Zhuang Mingli"
 MAL_zhuang_mingli_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! February 1909, in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Zhuang Mingli, or Chuang Ming-li as he is known in Malaysian Cantonese, was born to a Fujian peasant family. Many men in the family had taken up employment abroad, and his father found work as a boatman in the British territory of Penang, on the Malay Peninsula, tragically passing away in 1926.\n\nMingli travelled first to Penang, then to Binjai in the Dutch East Indies, where he found employment at a garage run by one of his uncles. There he got politically involved with overseas Chinese community activists, protesting against European and Japanese exploitation of his homeland. He joined a charity for civilian victims of the Jade Wind Incident and was vice-chairman of a youth group that boycotted foreign goods. These activities caught the eyes of the Dutch and he was deported back to China.\n\nHe sought employment in the factories of Quanzhou but soon became enamoured with radical trade unionism, forcing him to flee to back to Penang in 1930, fearing he would be killed if he remained in China. Mingli joined a number of new political bodies, such as the Fujian Overseas Chinese Salvation Congress held in Singapore, the Penang Philomathic Union founded by Sun Yat-Sen, as well as a number of local guilds and trade unions.\n\nThough only in his 20s, Mingli became one of the most prominent Chinese politicians in all of Malaya, writing fiery socialist screeds in the overseas Chinese press, under the pseudonym "Zhuangjia", which were broadly sympathetic to the KMT's Reorganised Comrades Association. His most notable accomplishment was creating a "Relief Committee for MinGan Refugees and Wounded Soldiers", to support the Kuomintang uprising in 1936.\n\nA credible trade unionist as well as a charismatic champion of freedom and democracy, Mingli became a natural candidate for a high position within the General Labour Union, the pre-eminent trade union in Malaya, but few had expected that he would be made its chairman. He was a compromise between the syndicalists, the anarchists, and the more moderate socialists, a youthful man that nonetheless had the wisdom and experience to be able to unite the squabbling factions behind a shared revolutionary struggle."

 ### Ideas ###

 MAL_rubber_plantation_idea: "Rubber Plantation Expansion"
 MAL_rubber_plantation_idea_desc: "Malaya has long been the largest producer of rubber in the world, and with the native government having much more control over the nation's rubber industry it has chosen to greatly support its development to hopefully reap the economic benefits that it can bring."

 MAL_perjuangan_melayu_idea: "Perjuangan Melayu"
 MAL_perjuangan_melayu_idea_desc: "To the [MAL.GetAdjective] government, the Malay identity is one that cannot be divorced from the Islamic faith to which a majority of the population adhere. To the government also, it is to these Malay Muslims to whom the nation belongs, and although it may not be explicitly opposed to those of other ethnicities or faiths, it makes clear that they are more akin to tolerated guests than a true part of the nation. Through this lens, the government ensures that it operates within a system which prioritises Malay Muslims over all others, while attempting to adhere to many core Islamic values to which its leaders view as fundamental to Malay society."

 MAL_malaya_merdeka_idea: "Malaya Merdeka"
 MAL_malaya_merdeka_idea_desc: "For the first time in centuries, the Malay peninsula has found itself free to mostly decide its own future, although of course supported towards this direction by those who aided in its freedom. With this newfound freedom, the [MAL.GetAdjective] government has set out to establish a democratic state in which the rights of both the nation's peoples, and the states which make up the nation, are equally respected."

 MAL_the_six_pillars_idea: "The Six Pillars"
 MAL_the_six_pillars_idea_desc: "Unlike many of the world's nations who in recent decades have embarked upon the path of socialism, those in the [MAL.GetAdjective] government are putting into practice their own vision as to how a state that balances socialist belief with nationalist thought may look. The values to which these views are derived are known collectively by the party as the Six Pillars, 'To Unite' the people, 'To Show Loyalty' to the nation, 'To Serve' the nation, 'To Be Happy', 'To Serve the People', and to show 'Courtesy' as leaders of the people."

 MAL_satu_untuk_semua_semua_untuk_satu_idea: "Satu Untuk Semua, Semua Untuk Satu!"
 MAL_satu_untuk_semua_semua_untuk_satu_idea_desc: "'One for all, all for one' is the phrase to which many within the government of [MAL.GetNameDef] chooses to represent its vision for Malay socialism. To the government socialism is a concept which must be enacted through a nationalist lens, one where Malay communities must band together to lift up the nation beyond its colonial past and lift all of its people up along with it."

 MAL_merdeka_dengan_darah_idea: "Merdeka Dengan Darah"
 MAL_merdeka_dengan_darah_idea_desc: "Inspired greatly by a combination of Chinese influence, Islamic theology, and wider Nusantaran politics, the [MAL.GetAdjective] government have developed a view of socialism in which all of these inspirations have coalesced into one socialist vision. It is through this vision that the future of the nation is seen as one in which all of its people must fight for their freedom, no matter their race, and it is through this fight that they may all be united under a singular banner and move past inequality or division."

 MAL_malay_confederation_idea: "The Malay Confederation"
 MAL_malay_confederation_idea_desc: "Rejecting a strong central authority, the [MAL.GetAdjective] government has chosen to greatly empower the rights of the individual states which make up [MAL.GetName]. While there remains a central government with direct authority over many matters of national interest and defence, power has been primarily placed in the hands of the local primarily Malay dominated governments of its member states."

 MAL_reformed_federation_idea: "Federal Reformation"
 MAL_reformed_federation_idea_desc: "Under colonial rule, under both British and German dominion, much of the Malay peninsula was governed as a federation united together under a central authority. Now free from the colonial shackles, the [MAL.GetAdjective] government has chosen to expand a reformed version of such a model to the entire nation, granting significant power to the states while investing executing authority in the nation's cabinet."

 MAL_army_idea: "The [MAL.GetAdjective] Armed Forces"
 MAL_army_idea_desc: "While historically the Malay states have fieled soldiers and even their own regiment for their colonial overlords, the burden of national defence is now one that cannot simply be pawned off to other people. As a result, the [MAL.GetAdjective] Armed Forces have been established to properly manage not only [MAL.GetName]'s national defence on land, but even on the sea and in the skies."
