 HYD_madapati_hanumantha_rao_sic_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 22nd, 1885, in Pokkunuru, Hyderabad State, India§!\n§YBackground:§! §LRao followed in the footsteps of his father and uncles when, in 1904, he joined the education department of Hyderabad. A diligent worker, he would switch tracks after 8 years and become a lawyer. It was here that he made his bones and acquired a highly respectable reputation as a social organiser, especially underneath the steely tyranny of the Nizam. One of the events which propelled him to the forefront was the controversy surrounding the 1921 Nizam's States' Social Reforms Conference. Conducted in English, Marathi, and Urdu, the absence of Telugu as a language was already controversial. When a participant was forbidden from moving a motion in Telugu, Rao and others capitalised on the outrage and assembled the \"Andra Jana Sangh\", an organisation which greatly developed sociopolitical consciousness among Telugu-speaking people. This same organisation would later become the Andhra Mahasabha.\n\nAs the man occupying the highest office of his nation, one can be assured that the future of his country will be one that treads past its ugly past of social inequality. His considerable popularity among the people keeps his position secure and keeps his foes from mounting an effective opposition.§!"
