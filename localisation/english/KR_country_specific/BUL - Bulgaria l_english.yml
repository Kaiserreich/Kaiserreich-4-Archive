 BUL_totalist_party: "FAKB"
 BUL_totalist_party_long: "Federatsiya na Anarkho-Komunistite v Bŭlgariya (Federation of Anarchist Communists in Bulgaria)\n§LThe scars of the Weltkrieg were only deepened by the chaotic Bulgarian interwar period, which has left a viable niche for far-left agitation against the government. Operating throughout Bulgaria's mountainous countryside, cells (chetas) of various left-wing revolutionaries employ guerilla tactics and terrorist attacks in hopes of ushering in revolution in the country.\n\nWhile somewhat decayed compared to their heyday in the years immediately after the Weltkrieg, this loosely aligned patchwork of communists, anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists remains a thorn in Sofia's side. In recent years, their leader Vasil Ikonomov and many of his followers have loosened on their anarchist views and have embraced French Sorelianism, attracted by its emphasis on personal, heroic action.§!\n"
 BUL_syndicalist_party: "ZPK \"Vlasovden\""
 BUL_syndicalist_party_long: "Zemedelskata Profesionalna Konfederatsiya \"Vlasovden\" (Agricultural Professional Confederation \"Vlasovden\")\n§LNamed after a traditional holiday in its native Haskovo region, \"Vlasovden\" is a loosely associated grouping of several anarcho-syndicalist groups and agricultural trade unions, modeled after their counterparts in France and Britain. In contrast to them, however, they maintain an agrarian outlook, viewing agricultural workers as the primary force of revolution.§!\n"

 BUL_radical_socialist_party_long: "Bŭlgarska Rabotnicheska Sotsialdemokraticheska Partiya - Tesni sotsialisti (Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party - Narrow Socialists)\n§LFounded at the close of the 19th century as a primarily reformist socialist party, the BRSDP's initial unity for the sake of the working class proved too fragile. In 1903, the issue of class collaboration, championed by a portion of the party over a background of significant peasant unrest, ended up splitting the party between orthodox Marxists and reformists.\n\nThe Narrow Socialists are the descendants of the former group, continuing to advocate for revolutionary socialism. They draw significant influence from the Russian Bolsheviks, believing in the supremacy of the industrial workers and the necessity of a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\".§!\n"

 BUL_social_democrat_party_long: "Bŭlgarska Rabotnicheska Sotsialdemokraticheska Partiya - Shiroki sotsialisti (Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party - Broad Socialists)\n§LFounded at the close of the 19th century as a primarily reformist socialist party, the BRSDP's initial unity for the sake of the working class proved too fragile. In 1903, the issue of class collaboration, championed by a portion of the party over a background of significant peasant unrest, ended up splitting the party between orthodox Marxists and reformists.\n\nThe Broad Socialists are the descendants of the latter group, who have since absorbed several other left-wing movements, leading to significant heterogeneity. The prevailing sentiment is, regardless, adherence to Kautskyian Marxist ideology, emphasising a gradual erosion of capitalism in the interest of avoiding premature revolution.§!\n"
 BUL_social_liberal_party: "BZNS \"Vrabcha 1\""
 BUL_social_liberal_party_long: "Bŭlgarski Zemedelski Naroden Sŭyuz \"Vrabcha 1\" (Bulgarian Agrarian National Union \"Sparrow 1\")\n§LThe BZNS finds its roots in a peasant professional organisation which ended up campaigning against perceived unfair taxation, carried out by the Radoslavist government at the start of the century. The movement-turned-party floundered until it was reinvigorated by populist Aleksandar Stamboliyski.\n\nThe Tsarist authorities imprisoned Stamboliyski twice over his republican and anti-militarist views, which has led to a split in the party. The \"Vrabcha 1\" faction is a moderate successor to the original BZNS, which has abandoned the latter's militant agrarianism in favour of participation in the democratic process.§!\n"
 BUL_market_liberal_party: "Petorka"
 BUL_market_liberal_party_long: "Komitet na Petimata (Committee of Five)\n§LThe Petorka is a loose alliance of party leaders from across the political spectrum, namely the heads of \"Vrabcha 1\", the Broad Socialists, the Democratic Party, the Radical Democratic Party, and the BZNS \"Pladne\". They stand as the last meaningful opposition to the near-complete erosion of Bulgarian democracy by Crown Prince Boris and his allies in the National Liberals. The group is actively campaigning for the abolition of the State Protection Act and for retaining the Tarnovo Constitution.§!\n"

Markedly Germanophilic and holding little regard for the democratic process, the Second Concentration acts primarily as a conduit for the will of Crown Prince Boris, who seeks to elevate the Bulgarian nation from its decades-long malaise without the distractions of party politics.§!\n"

They are also proponents of \"integral Yugoslavism\", seeking to resolve the issue of the Serbian minorities in the country's western regions through the union of all South Slavs into a single, Bulgarian-led nation. Unsurprisingly, Zveno's ideology is especially popular amongst the armed forces.§!\n"
 BUL_national_populist_party: "SBNL"
 BUL_national_populist_party_long: "Sŭyuz na Bŭlgarskite Natsionalni Legioni (Union of Bulgarian National Legions)\n§LThe decades-long slump Bulgaria has experienced in the years since the Weltkrieg has served to radicalise significant segments of the population, several of which have found representation in the far-right. The SBNL is clearly influenced by the Legion of the Archangel Michael in neighbouring Romania, making use of similar methods to gather influence, such as travelling to the countryside to aid villagers during harvest season, and taking this opportunity to spread the movement's propaganda.\n\nThe Legions view the \"greatness\" of \"Greater Bulgaria\" as tainted by traitorous politicians and minorities, viewing both with hostility. They view its preservation and purification as an absolute material and spiritual need. Despite this, they remain at least ambivalent towards the monarchy.§!\n"

It is strongly monarchist and Germanophilic, broadly acting as a vehicle for the ambitions of Crown Prince Boris. Divisions remain between the mainstream view, who often hold liberal democracy in little regard, and the old party members, who played a pivotal role in preventing the transformation of the Georgiev regime into a complete dictatorship.§!\n"

Of this group, those not unsympathetic to the idea of a Yugoslav state, albeit a less Bulgarian-centric one, have coalesced around the Democratic Party. Despite their stated intentions to reform Yugoslavia into a federation of equals, their suppression by Zveno and the animosity of the South Slavs towards Bulgaria means their dreams are unlikely to ever be realised.§!\n"

In the interest of \"integral Yugoslavism\", the regime now promotes a new, all-Yugoslav movement, whose stated purpose is to wipe away the \"false\" differences between the South Slavic peoples. Unsurprisingly, this has proven rather unpopular with the other nationalities in the new state, leaving \"United Yugoslavia\" as a primarily Bulgarian movement, in stark contrast with its name.§!\n"

 BUL_country_intro_content: "Bulgaria emerged from the Weltkrieg as one of the victors, and was awarded with all of the lands they wanted in the Balkans, thus the unification of \"Greater Bulgaria\" which had been the key goal of Bulgarian foreign policy ever since the Treaty of San-Stefano in 1878. However, the unification of Greater Bulgaria was the beginning of further troubles. Occupation of the new territories was costly, the country was severely in debt, and the political scene fractured.\n\nThe early 1920s saw a political dance between Vasil Radoslavov's National Liberals and numerous opposition parties — such as the Democrats, moderate Agrarians, and Broad Socialists. Though it was a continuation of the partisanstvo period from before the Weltkrieg, the traditional parties in the Sŭbranie were no longer certain of victory. In 1925, the British and Serbian revolutions emboldened local Agrarians and socialists in the Sŭbranie. In response, Crown Prince Boris encouraged his ageing father to put forward General Konstantin Georgiev, his favourite, as the new Prime Minister. Georgiev imposed martial law, restricted anti-royalist parties and passed the State Protection Act — an act which gave the government authoritarian powers in maintaining public order.\n\nDemocratic opposition in the Sŭbranie forced Georgiev to resign in 1928 before a full dictatorship could be imposed. While martial law was lifted and democracy returned, it was only in the shadow of the authoritarian Act. The so-called \"People's Bloc\" of Radical Democrats, Democrats and \"Vrabcha\" Agrarians fell after the Creditanstalt Crisis in 1933. In response, the National Liberals and the People's Progressives formed the Second Liberal Concentration, named after Vasil Radoslavov's Liberal coalition. Achieved with the backing of the Crown Prince, this coalition has a frail domestic and foreign policy. As 1936 begins, their delegated Prime Minister Petko Stainov must decide Bulgaria's future."

 bulgaria_events.2.t: "Operation Nishava"
 bulgaria_events.2.d: "As \"Greater\" as Bulgaria was after the Weltkrieg, it was and still is not uniform. Almost a half of its population is made up of minorities - Turks, Greeks, Romanians, Albanians, and especially Serbs. The latter have been the most problematic ever since the annexation of Skopje and Nish. During the Weltkrieg, Bulgarian forces did not hesitate to exterminate hundreds, if not thousands, and pave the way for the colonisation of the new Western provinces. While these measures were scaled down after the war, they never became soft.\n\nThe harshness of territorial integration depended on the government. Some sought Bulgarisation, others sought accommodation with the non-Bulgarians, even if that was despised by the radical far-right. When the Liberal Concentration came to power in 1933, they abandoned any attempts at compromise. As advised by the Bulgarian Army, they approved a mass operation against Serbian intellectuals and suspected separatists in Nish.\n\nWaving the State Protection Act in their hands, soldiers commanded by General Hristo Lukov arrested over three hundred Serbian politicians, writers and artists. Even three Members of the Sŭbranie were detained. Though the Operation was expected to pacify the region for good, as more and more harrowing stories came from Bulgarian prisons and martial courts, the more public opinion turned away from the government. They can no longer stomach a return to the terror of the Weltkrieg years."
 bulgaria_events.2.a: "But it had to be done."

 bulgaria_events.3.t: "Conflict in the Sŭbranie"
 bulgaria_events.3.d: "The mood in the legislature of the Tsardom, the Sŭbranie, was far from great. The arrest of three of its members, although short-lived, has reflected extremely poorly upon the government of Petko Stainov, and so have harrowing news from the Western frontier — especially when foreign correspondents began getting their hands on the information and decrying the events as \"classic Balkan blood-letting\".\n\nUnder the orders of the opposition, aligned with the Committee of Five, or the Petorka, Prime Minister Stainov was forced to step to the Sŭbranie podium for questioning, and had to defend himself for over an hour. Though he aimed to address as many of the concerns of his fellow parliamentarians as possible, it did not satisfy the agitated opposition, who were now out for blood - especially as several of the Concentration's members were openly sympathetic...\n\nTwo speeches followed - Konstantin Muraviev, the firebrand of the reformed Agrarian National Union and nephew of the infamous Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, and Georgi Genov, one of the five constitutionalist titans who give the name to the Petorka and a longtime leader of the Radical Democratic Party. Both of them announced the true culprit - the State Protection Act, a tool wielded by the absolutist Ferdinand and his son ever since the Act's adoption under their puppet, General Georgiev. A conspiracy has developed between the Dynasty and the Liberal Concentration, a plan to transform the country into an authoritarian dictatorship - and it is time for the Sŭbranie to start fighting back.\n\nIt is expected that as Bulgarian society is still in debate over Operation Nishava and the government's authoritarian powers, the Petorka will aim to push through an abolition of the Act - a decision Prime Minister Stainov will have to either resist, or support."
 bulgaria_events.3.a: "We have time for a debate on this..."

 bulgaria_events.4.t: "Muraviev Reaches Out"
 bulgaria_events.4.d: "Frontlines are being drawn both in and out of Parliament, and the greatest prize which either party could claim is the Prime Minister, Petko Stainov. In 1933, he was put forward as a controllable pawn, a jurist and diplomat with a long parliamentary career, but little experience in the highest levels of government, and an independent who could satisfy both the Liberal Concentration and moderate opposition members. Since then, however, his alignment has been more and more fluid, and those who know him well know that if push comes to shove, he will work for those who he believes will save Bulgaria.\n\nWith this knowledge at hand, Konstantin Muraviev has reached out to the Prime Minister directly, offering Stainov a private meeting in one of the restaurants in Sofia's Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard, where the two politicians would be able to discreetly discuss the matters of the day. Always straightforward, Muraviev laid out his position clearly - ever since the adoption of the Constitution of Tarnovo, the Tsardom has claimed more and more freedom and power from their hands, adding it to their possessions. Already, Bulgaria could hardly be called a democratic state, a shameful fall from grace for a country that was so proud of one of the first democratic constitutions in the Balkans. Now, this may sound great to a man who is serving as the Tsar's own Prime Minister - however, as Muraviev points out, is being the puppet of an unhinged autocrat really what you wish to be known as in the history books? Is it not morally right, for anyone who believes in democracy, to stand up and say that we've had enough?\n\nWhat is the Prime Minister's reaction?"
 bulgaria_events.4.a: "You are right, the Monarchy must be curtailed."
 bulgaria_events.4.b: "I will not seek advice from Stamboliyski's stooges!"

 bulgaria_events.5.t: "An Invitation from Colonel Georgiev"
 bulgaria_events.5.d: "Not all of the forces in the Tsardom operate in the parliamentary arena. The Military League has its allies in the Sŭbranie, sure, but the real power of this association comes from the many generals and officers, retired and active alike, who are under its aegis. The name of \"Zveno\", a political circle of Military League leaders and their civilian supporters, has been pronounced often in the past few weeks - the chaos in the Sŭbranie has only proved them right, as some say. It was only a matter of time before they began searching for an ally in the Prime Minister himself.\n\nMinisterial meetings with the Military League are not infrequent, but this time, the organisation made sure to fill the meeting with leading members of the Zveno circle - Damyan Velchev, Pencho Zlatev, and especially Kimon Georgiev, who had invited Prime Minister Stainov to their meeting circle in the first place. After initial introductions and polite exchanges, the conversation swiftly turned towards Operation Nishava, the State Protection Act, and the Army's judgment of recent matters.\n\nThey are not impressed - however, as Georgiev stated, it was to be expected. Ever since the adoption of the Constitution, the parliamentary system has only weakened Bulgaria, rather than strengthened it. It paved the way for the corruption and incompetence of the Partisanstvo system, and it cannot even fulfil the one goal it sought out to do - represent the people. Here, the true goal of the meeting lied. Georgiev briefly presented Zveno's plan for Bulgaria - a reformed, rationalised, disciplined system, which will sweep away the weakness of old and bring forth the strength of new. It cannot be achieved democratically, of course - however, is this really a price one cannot pay for a renewed and stronger Bulgaria?\n\nWhat does the Prime Minister say?"
 bulgaria_events.5.a: "Indeed, perhaps there is merit in your ideas..."
 bulgaria_events.5.b: "I will not be influenced by discount Codreanites!"

 bulgaria_events.6.t: "The Crown Prince's Blessing"
 bulgaria_events.6.d: "The Prime Minister did not follow the two siren calls - and so, there is only one man left for him to defend the cause of. Crown Prince Boris, the heir to the throne, has been increasingly active in the Tsardom's political arena, and as his father turns less and less capable to rule, he has taken over many of his crown functions, not to mention the informal powers he holds in connections. The upper class of Bulgarian society knows well who they're dealing with when the Crown Prince is on the stage.\n\nIt was he who orchestrated the authoritarian period of General Konstantin Georgiev - so to see his work be potentially shafted by an emboldened democratic opposition is not in the future monarch's interest. So, learning that he still has one man to trust in the government is quite a relief to him - perhaps, hand in hand, these two titans of Bulgarian politics will be able to finally put an end to the chaos of the past two decades and create a measured, strong regime which every Bulgarian can trust."
 bulgaria_events.6.a: "The Act is a necessary measure."

 bulgaria_events.7.t: "People's Progressives in Talk with Petorka"
 bulgaria_events.7.d: "The Second Liberal Concentration is not a party, it is an alliance of two parties with similar goals, yet wildly divergent backstories. The United People's Progressive Party is the lesser partner in the coalition, but holds a long and prideful history of being the final incarnation of the Conservatives. Back in the late 19th century, the cleavage between the liberal and conservative factions in the Constitutional Assembly in Tarnovo was the defining difference between parties - and while those days are long gone and who stood for what in 1878 is no longer relevant, the People's Progressives claim heritage to those who stood by the Prince and for a responsible parliamentary system so many years ago.\n\nTheir leader, Atanas Burov, has gained a reputation as a strong supporter of civil rights and maintaining the Tarnovo Constitution - a stance which has since led him to negotiate with the Petorka. Feeling confident in his sway over the incumbent coalition, Burov has thus requested a meeting with the Prime Minister, and presented his wish to see the Second Concentration take a stand for democracy. Not only should they not surrender even more power to the Tsar, but they have a moral prerogative to defend the document which signalled Bulgaria's rebirth as an independent state.\n\nHow does Stainov reply?"
 bulgaria_events.7.a: "Gospodin Burov, your ministers are no longer welcome in our cabinet."
 bulgaria_events.7.b: "I concede. With a heavy heart."

 bulgaria_events.8.t: "General Zlatev's Proposal"
 bulgaria_events.8.d: "The Prime Minister's principled stand against the Zveno circle has not gone unnoticed, and expecting it to have been borne out of Stainov's fears, they have chosen to take a different approach. Once again, he has been called to a meeting, this time with Pencho Zlatev, cavalry General and one of the leading members of the autocratic faction. The setting of the meeting was a visit and inspection of one of the Bulgarian Army's newly modernised cavalry divisions, who the General assured will play a leading role in any future war against their enemy in Belgrade.\n\nGeneral Zlatev aimed to assure the Prime Minister regarding any of his fears — they are not a Codreanite clique, far from it, and do not seek to involve themselves with the poisonous rhetoric of the regime in Bucharest. Rather, they see themselves as technocrats, masters of the craft of politics who will be able to transform the country for the better, if only they are able to have a say. The Prime Minister does not even have to imagine this as a violent revolution — there is no need for the Tsar to lose his head, or for all of Bulgaria's political tradition to be tossed out of the window. Zlatev can personally assure Stainov that he will do whatever it takes to prevent \"dangerous radicals\" such as Damyan Velchev from getting their way - all he wants from the politician is his support in their hour of need.\n\nWhat does Stainov say?"
 bulgaria_events.8.a: "What *I* want is for you to leave before I use that Act on your clique."
 bulgaria_events.8.b: "Perhaps this is the only way Bulgaria can be saved..."

 bulgaria_events.9.t: "Black Monday in Germany"
 bulgaria_events.9.d: "The ripples of the financial crash in Berlin have not left us unscathed. Though we are not as connected to the German market as we once were, our agricultural enterprises nevertheless relied on providing Europe's economic giant with their produce - and now, the payments from German businesses are stalling and loans from their banks have completely dried up. Thankfully, as our economy was already sluggish and not as severely attached to Germany as some of our peers, we have avoided the worst of the downfall."
 bulgaria_events.9.a: "Could be worse..."

 bulgaria_events.10.t: "Bankruptcy of \"Bratya Bŭklovi\""
 bulgaria_events.10.d: "The bank runs in Germany in the aftermath of the Black Monday Crash have reached Sofia. Fearing that something alike to what happened in Berlin will repeat here, investors and normal civilians alike began rapidly withdrawing their deposits from one of the largest commercial banks in Bulgaria, \"Bratya Bŭklovi\" (\"The Bŭklovi Brothers\"). Run by the aforementioned family, Bŭklovi rapidly expanded credit during the 1930s, riding off the wave of the economic miracle in Germany all while offering loans to more and more untrustworthy debtors. This might not have been an issue a few years ago, as the profits from their operations would be more than worth the risk, but now this overconfidence has bitten them back, millions of leva in loans are expected to never return to the bank, and its own debts mount by the day.\n\nA collapse of the bank is imminent, and would likely lead to the collapse of Bulgaria's financial system. It falls upon the Bulgarian State Bank and the Directorate of State-Guaranteed Debts to figure out a solution - to them, the only way out is to minimise the losses by forcefully merging the Bŭklovi with another major bank."
 bulgaria_events.10.a: "Now we're in for a bumpy ride!"

 bulgaria_events.11.t: "Bill Killed in Committee"
 bulgaria_events.11.d: "Not long after the bill to abolish the State Protection Act was proposed to the Sŭbranie, the parliamentary committee designated to review the bill has more or less killed it before it ever reached the floor. The loyalists of the Crown Prince and right-wing nationalists have held up the delegates of the Constitutionalist coalition in questioning their patriotic motives and the necessity of the bill, and as we lack support across the parliament, it appears we will not be able to push the abolition through."
 bulgaria_events.11.a: "We will try again later."

 bulgaria_events.12.t: "National Legionaries Grow in Strength"
 bulgaria_events.12.d: "The Union of Bulgarian National Legions is the most recent incarnation of a long history of nationalist Bulgarian paramilitaries, born from the vast amount of reservists and war veterans who were left on the streets after the Weltkrieg and sought a way to channel their frustration. Originally founded as the youth wing of \"Rodna Zashtita\", the National Legions swiftly overtook their fathers and consolidated themselves as the leading force on the Bulgarian far-right. Vehemently nationalist, anti-capitalist and anti-semitic, they are clearly inspired by the similarly named regime in Romania, even if they recognise that they are Bulgaria's biggest enemy.\n\nThe destitution across Bulgaria following the Black Monday crisis has empowered the Legions. Not only that, but its leader Ivan Dochev and other Legionaries took advantage of the crisis, organising massive rural relief actions to aid the peasantry in their hours of need. Thousands of Legionaries have marched to the countryside, aiding the peasants in their harvests and propagandising their ideals along the way.\n\nAt the moment, the Legionaries are an ally of Zveno - however, this alliance is brittle, and it's no mystery that the radicalised young officers have their own agenda."
 bulgaria_events.12.a: "Codreanu is the enemy, not an example!"

 bulgaria_events.13.t: "Army Generals Endorse the SBNL"
 bulgaria_events.13.d: "The radical nationalist goals of the National Legions, though hardly palatable to the average Bulgarian, have caught the attention of the army's highest-ranking leaders. Owing to the organisation's history and contacts with other right-wing Bulgarian paramilitaries, it can easily find support among the officer corps, and two notable generals have now spoken up in their favour.\n\nNikola Zhekov, a hero of the First Balkan War and the Weltkrieg, was the first to do so, writing favourably of the Legionaries in a piece published in the Military Union's official newspaper \"Izgrev\", describing them as an ambitious autochthonous movement whose ideas may have a lot of use in the Bulgaria of today. A staunch advocate of a pro-German course, Zhekov also finds considerable common ground with the movement there. Of course, the old retired general was still somewhat hesitant, because of his typical conservatism.\n\nGeneral Hristo Lukov was a lot more dedicated in his follow-up article - and the rumours say that he is directly involved with the Legionaries, even possibly considered as an alternate leader if they ever seek to make themselves more presentable to the general population. Both of these commanders were greatly critical of the current regime, of course - almost to the point of shunning democracy entirely. Rumours are abound of a Legionary march to Sofia as a signal for a military coup to overthrow the government of Petko Stainov and establish a hardline authoritarian regime... whether or not they can find an ally in the highest office."
 bulgaria_events.13.a: "I will not be influenced by rabid nationalists!"
 bulgaria_events.13.b: "Perhaps I should back them before they have my head..."

 bulgaria_events.14.t: "\"Vrabcha\" in Cahoots with Underground"
 bulgaria_events.14.d: "Because of the opposition of its leader Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski and many of its membership to the war, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union was banned during the Weltkrieg, and since then, it has lived a very on and off existence. The moderate elements of the former party who distanced themselves away from the radical agrarianism of their predecessors refounded the party after the Weltkrieg, its faction named \"Vrabcha 1\" after the address of the party headquarters. This faction rebuilt the power base of the original BZNS and even negotiated a release of their original leaders, including Stamboliyski himself, for a brief period of time in the 1920s.\n\nThe Serbian Revolution once again broke the party in twain, and Stamboliyski alongside the republican members of the party moved to the underground due to their unabated support for the revolution in Belgrade. Later events led to further splinters in the large, yet divided Agrarian movement. Today, five parties calling themselves BZNS exist in Bulgaria, although only three are relevant — \"Vrabcha 1\" and \"Pladne\" are legal and are represented in the Petorka, the latter a bit more radical than the former, and \"Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski\", or BZNS \"United\", which operates in the underground, openly cooperates with socialist forces, and declares itself fighting for a Bulgarian Republic.\n\nIt was believed that these factions had drifted apart significantly - however, as political battles grow tense across the nation, Bulgarian police are starting to reveal... connections between the underground BZNS and their seemingly moderate and innocent counterparts in the Sŭbranie. Shared membership, secret circles discussing the political situation... It would be very easy to threaten Dimitar Gichev and Konstantin Muraviev with this information, and seriously shake up the constitutionalist ranks. After all, they couldn't dare to work with suspected republicans..."
 bulgaria_events.14.a: "Perfect! I will speak before the Sŭbranie and reveal these connections!"
 bulgaria_events.14.b: "This would destabilise the country too much."

 bulgaria_events.15.t: "Our Men in Sofia"
 bulgaria_events.15.d: "Eyeing Bulgaria like a hawk stalking prey, we see that our neighbour is entering a period of political strife. Years of resentment towards the authoritarian regime of Tsar Ferdinand, his son Crown Prince Boris and their lackeys are finally exploding, as a considerable faction in the Bulgarian parliament are now openly campaigning for the restoration of full constitutionalism and the abolition of the State Protection Act. While our only interest in Bulgaria is the destruction of this hated hegemon, we in fact have \"our men\" in Sofia.\n\nThe Bulgarian Agrarian National Union \"Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski\" is the radical republican faction of the BZNS, an agrarian political party that was shattered by the Bulgarian government for their opposition to the war, and still struggles to pick up the pieces. It is led by Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski himself, a man who has no illusion of ever working within the royalist regime again and a rare Bulgarian politician who proudly calls himself a \"Yugoslav\" - the authorities in Bulgaria still believe that he is hiding somewhere in Sofia, when in reality, he is safe in Serbia, from where he is able to command his faction of the BZNS.\n\nHe still keeps some contact with the parliamentary factions of the BZNS, able to exchange information and sway a few of them to support the abolition of the State Protection Act - which, as Stamboliyski assures, will be the first step towards an Agrarian takeover of Bulgaria, which will be able to work with Serbia in peace. Should we support this gamble, or instead back more reliable options, such as Chetnik resistance in Niš?"
 bulgaria_events.15.a: "Getting Bulgaria soft is in our interest."
 bulgaria_events.15.b: "We don't care about Sofia. Chetnik resistance is our priority."

 bulgaria_events.16.t: "The Zveno Coup"
 bulgaria_events.16.d1: "A plot to overthrow the constitutional government of Bulgaria has come into motion, crafted by the four main leaders of the conspiracy — Kimon Georgiev, Pencho Zlatev, Damyan Velchev and Petko Stainov. Following the plan of action, the Prime Minister sent an order to call the Sŭbranie to a full session, especially including the leaders of the Petorka, all while army units were activated across Sofia and established an unofficial order of martial law in the streets. When the day broke out, Georgiev and Zlatev requested an audience with the Tsar and presented a pre-written royal decree which, upon signing, would put an end to several decades of Bulgarian democracy.\n\nNo support came across the city or outside of the country, and several politicians such as Nikola Mushanov, Konstantin Muraviev and Yanko Sakazov were detained by the conspirators. Under this pressure, Tsar Ferdinand I signed the royal decree, and later in the day, Petko Stainov promulgated it to the masses in Sofia. The royal decree called for the suspension of the Constitution, the removal of senior officers from the army staff, the consolidation of several ministries and the appointment of a new, \"responsible\" government that will steer Bulgaria in the crisis of today.\n\nZveno's takeover is complete."

 bulgaria_events.19.d2: "[?BUL.BUL_parliamentary_support] deputies in the Sŭbranie have voted in favour of the abolition of the State Protection Act, an unprecedented moment and a U-turn in what has been fifty years of growing monarchist power. Though full democracy in Bulgaria has not been guaranteed just yet, it is a major step forward and the majority has forced changes in the ruling coalition of Bulgaria. The National Liberal Party, crumbling in conflict between those who have accepted the outcome of the vote and those who still believe that the Act guarantees stability, has been forced to abandon the Second Concentration bloc and form an all-parliamentary coalition with the backers of the Petorka. This government has pledged to retain the victories of the Constitutionalist movement, guarantee the rights of the people, and ensure that a safe Election of 1938 comes to pass.\n\nAs he openly endorsed the opposition to the Constitutionalists and did not back down, Prime Minister Petko Stainov has been forced to resign from his position, and it is reported that he will no longer run for election or seek to return to power. His position has been assumed by Atanas Burov."

 bulgaria_events.20.t: "Serbian and Romanian Rearmament"
 bulgaria_events.20.d: "All of Bulgaria's primary enemies in the Weltkrieg - Greece, Serbia and Romania, and especially the last two specifically - were punished and dismantled, paving the way for a Bulgarian hegemony in the Balkans. Serbia was left a shell of its former self, partitioned and turned into a client state of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while Romania was forced to surrender Dobrudja and its vast oil reserves. Even this, however, was not enough to leave these two states silent - and while their revanchism should have been expected, their unprecedented rearmament and belligerence were not.\n\nBucharest and Belgrade increasingly vocally speak about the plight of their compatriots in Bulgaria, the former was the first to abandon the restrictions of their Weltkrieg treaties, and now, after the Vidovdan of 1936, Serbia has followed suit. Greece faced fewer restrictions than its two Balkan comrades and so its army is already ready for battle - and the Greeks too wish to take a bite from the Bulgarian lion.\n\nWith Austria and Germany seemingly uninterested in enforcing the post-Weltkrieg treaties, the Bulgarian general staff has increasingly resigned to the prospect of another Balkan war - the fourth one in thirty years. Increasingly frustrated with the politicking taking place in Sofia, marshals and generals demand the regime to do something. They have already laid out plans for early mobilisation and war preparations - all we need to do is find the political capital for such an action."

 bulgaria_events.21.t: "Ivan Burov's Compromise"
 bulgaria_events.21.d: "Another day, another visitor to the Prime Minister's office.\n\nToday, Petko Stainov was greeted by Ivan Burov — banker, industrialist, chairman of the Bulgarian Commercial Bank, or BTB. Not only was this mild-mannered entrepreneur one of the most powerful men in Bulgaria, but he was also the elder brother of Atanas Burov — the leader of the United People's Progressive Party.\n\nOnce the bankruptcy of the \"Bratya Bŭklovi\" was announced, the eyes of the business community turned towards Burov - his bank had cooperated with them in the past and many naturally expected him to absorb the former competitor, especially as one of its main shareholders, Petŭr Bŭklov, was swiftly employed to the Governing Council of the BTB. It might even be necessary to alleviate the pressure on the economy and prevent additional bank runs.\n\nKnowing his importance in the system, Burov now offers the Prime Minister a deal - he will personally ensure a smooth transition in the Bulgarian financial sphere, even taking the measures to lessen the monopolistic ambitions of the BTB to ensure long term economic health - while in exchange, the Prime Minister will allow a vote on abolishing the State Protection Act. Much like his younger brother, he is concerned about the health of Bulgarian democracy - after all, you can never know what anti-capitalist policies an unchecked Royal Dictatorship would pass.\n\nHow does Stainov respond?"
 bulgaria_events.21.a: "When such a deal is on the table, I can only take it."
 bulgaria_events.21.b: "Are you using the economy as your hostage?!"

 bulgaria_events.22.t: "The Constitutionalists Strike!"
 bulgaria_events.22.d: "In the past few months, support for the abolition of the State Protection Act has been rising in the Sŭbranie halls, even among the National Liberal Party — and as the government of Petko Stainov has failed to act against this trend, the Party has made its move. A \"gentle coup\" of sorts has taken place in Parliament, as the delegation of the Second Concentration now openly denies the wishes of the executive and has initiated a vote on the Act's abolition. Enjoying widespread support both in the government side and among the opposition, it is likely to pass..."

 bulgaria_events.23.d: "The opposition in the Sŭbranie does not plan to give up on their cause just yet. After half an hour of arguing and going through offices, representative Hristo Kalfov has acquired himself the parliament staff's approval for a long opening speech he will make right before the official debate on the abolition of the State Protection Act. It is not hard to imagine what the veteran's speech will be about.\n\nAn adjutant and teacher of Crown Prince Boris during the Weltkrieg, and a retired lieutenant, Hristo Kalfov sits in the Sŭbranie as an independent, Second Concentration aligned representative. Here, he has made a name for himself as a far-right royalist firebrand, swaying his less eloquent comrade with long-winded speeches about the necessary powers of the Tsar, the numerous enemies besieging Bulgaria from all sides, and the Tsardom's natural status as the hegemon of the Balkans, which must be defended via any means necessary. Should he be allowed to speak without any resistance, Kalfov will certainly cause numerous deputies in the National Liberal side to reconsider their stance on the bill. Meddling with the parliament bureaucracy and removing Kalfov's speech from the agenda will do the trick, but will resonate poorly with the legislature..."

 bulgaria_events.24.d: "For the military, the continued existence of the State Protection Act is the only guarantee of the Tsardom's stability. Having gotten used to the expectation that Serbian, Romanian and Greek rebels must be suppressed by force, they don't want to imagine a Bulgaria in which the method to ensure the legality of such actions is taken away. With this perception in mind, Colonel Kimon Georgiev has requested a private audience with Prime Minister Petko Stainov himself.\n\nThe Colonel did not mince his words, and clearly explained what awaits Bulgaria if the foolish parliamentarians continue — the military will take charge and put a \"responsible government\" in charge of the country, one which will be strong and capable enough to save Bulgaria from any challenges against it. That is, unless the Prime Minister sees reason, and withdraws this outrageous bill from the agenda immediately."

 bulgaria_events.25.d: "The bureaucratic apparatus of the Bulgarian Tsardom has gotten used to a few years of authoritarianism - it is much simpler to deal with and more efficient than the radically swapping and changing governments of the parliamentary era. Seeing that the potential of a royal authoritarian regime is being undone, however, representatives from the administration have started reaching out to the Prime Minister, seeking their audience.\n\nThey lodge protests, stating that such a sudden switch away from state consolidation is treacherous when the safety and efficiency of the nation is on the line, and propose the matter to be dropped for the time being. Perhaps our bureaucracy has gotten too rotten and too privileged for its liking?"

 bulgaria_events.26.t: "The Tsar Wishes to Speak"
 bulgaria_events.26.d: "Seeing that the nation is in the midst of potentially tremendous political changes, ones which he is in the centre of in spite of his minimised role, Tsar Ferdinand I has requested an opportunity to speak in the next session of the Sŭbranie. Though officially, the Tsar is the head of state of the country with significant powers, ones which he wielded with great effect during the first decades of his reign, Tsar Ferdinand has turned passive by now. Age has gotten to him, and doctors suspect that he has less than a decade left to live - hence, most of his duties are now being fulfilled by Crown Prince Boris.\n\nStill, Ferdinand is not completely infirm, and wishes to have a say on the affairs of state - and knowing the authoritarian tendencies of the Tsar in his youth, it is highly unlikely that he will speak positively about the abolition of the State Protection Act. And, unfortunately, being the Great Uniter of the Third Bulgarian State and all, Ferdinand commends unbelievable prestige which would sway many deputies in the legislature..."

 bulgaria_events.26.b: "Let him speak."

 bulgaria_events.27.t: "The Peasants' Strike"
 bulgaria_events.27.d: "The economic crisis settling in after Black Monday has caused destitution in the countryside. Sharply declined exports to Germany and elsewhere meant that thousands of peasants whose livelihood once relied to selling produce for large companies were now left with nothing - and help from the government in Sofia was meagre and came too late. Driven by this desperation, thousands have joined a nationwide strike, protesting for subsidies to the crumbling agricultural sector, for the abolition of the State Protection Act, and against imported agricultural produce.\n\nThough the strike is largely non-ideological, it has already been hijacked by the underground socialist and radical agrarian movement. The Stamboliyski faction of the Agrarian National Union, working underground, has been agitating in favour of the strike. In addition, many of the striking peasants are affiliated with the similarly underground Vlasovden Professional Confederation - an eclectic organisation seeking to implement syndicalist practices among the peasantry, promoting a socialisation of the land and a trade union organisation of agricultural workers.\n\nSeveral thousand peasants have joined the strike, organising protests and stopping roads with their vehicles, and it is likely to spread even further if nothing is done towards it."

All seats in the Sŭbranie are up for election in first-past-the-post constituencies, and the victorious party or coalition will submit a Prime Minister and a cabinet to the Tsar, who will lead the nation in the years ahead. Traditionally, parliamentary elections in Bulgaria are a chaotic and somewhat messy affair. Right-wing, liberal and conservative parties, namely the National Liberals, the Democrats, and their allies in the Radical Democratic and United People's Progressive Parties are likely to win, and could certainly work together - however, the left remains powerful. Organised around the Agrarians and Broad Socialists, they have a reasonable chance to form a majority as well."

 bulgaria_events.29.d: "A humiliating peace has concluded the Fourth Balkan War, ending the hostilities between Bulgaria and the Belgrade Pact. A mere year ago, Bulgaria prided itself in its hegemony over the Balkans - now, it copes with the loss of half of its country, with severe restrictions on its armed forces, and with the deaths of thousands, be it soldiers or civilians.\n\nThe ageing Tsar, though hardly influential in politics at this point, announced in a radio speech today that the responsibility for this catastrophe falls solely on his shoulders. It was he who failed to adequately lead the nation in its darkest hour, and missed the signs of danger coming towards Bulgaria beforehand - therefore, he shall surrender his crown and resign. His eldest son, Crown Prince Boris, will be crowned as the new Tsar of Bulgaria, Boris III, shortly.\n\nA melancholic mood has set across the nation, its people coping with the consequences of twenty years of pride and prosperity being undone. The younger generation, which grew up after the Weltkrieg, cannot comprehend a world without a Bulgaria stretching from Ohrid to Dobrudja - their parents and grandparents, however, more cognisant of Bulgaria's state before the Balkan Wars, are more accepting.\n\nTo all of them, however, this is Bulgaria's darkest hour."

 bulgaria_events.30.t: "The Abolition of the Monarchy"
 bulgaria_events.30.d: "The loss in the Balkan War has left Zveno's rationalist regime in dire straits. Trust in their ability to rule is wavering, and many put the blame on the Georgiev-Velchev-Zlatev clique for destabilising the country, leaving it weakened, and thus falling prey to the Pact's ambitions. No amount of repression and boots on the streets can quench this distrust.\n\nLacking other options, or perhaps sensing that their regime is coming to an end and they have to change as much as they can, Zveno has shifted the blame for internal unrest on the Tsar's institution. The republican faction of the circle has won, and on the day when the coronation of Boris III was supposed to take place, the Army has moved into Sofia, surrounded the government officers and enacted a self-coup. Boris III was put under house arrest, as well as several Royalist politicians and generals. Before gathered masses in Sofia, Kimon Georgiev announced the transition of power - the Tsardom of Bulgaria is no more, and a Republic takes its place. This Republic shall have none of the weaknesses of its antiquated, weak predecessor, and will be organised as a powerful, directorial state, commanded from above.\n\nThis transition seems to have only roused unrest across the nation, however."
 bulgaria_events.30.a: "Zveno shall endure!"

 bulgaria_events.31.t: "The Zveno and the Legions"
 bulgaria_events.31.d: "During the mid 1930s, the hidden Zveno political circle and the Union of Bulgarian National Legions formed an alliance against democracy. Few on either side believed it to be long lasting, as the two organisations did not actually significantly align. The Legions, inspired by the SZRS in Russia and the Iron Guard in Romania, are vehement radical nationalists seeking to recover a mystical idea of \"Bulgarianness\", whereas the Zveno are more of an ivory tower intellectual circle seeking to create the most rational and efficient political system for Bulgaria. Still, as the two had common enemies, they found it acceptable to leave these issues behind for some time.\n\nThe defeat in the Fourth Balkan War has reflected poorly on Zveno, its political strength faltering, while the Legionaries have only grown during said time. Unwilling to accept the catastrophic defeat, they call for a repudiation of the treaties with the Pact and vengeance for a so-called \"stab in the back\" to the Bulgarian Army, which was about to win the war and yet was betrayed. It is suspected that Generals Nikola Zhekov and Hristo Lukov sympathise with the radicals, and should they fall out of line, they may seek to overthrow our regime entirely. On the other hand, maybe keeping the Legionaries around is more trouble than it's worth?"

Thousands of Legionaries, led by Ivan Dochev, have taken to a march to Sofia, where they were welcomed by military units commanded by General Lukov, who defected to the Legionary side and disarmed loyalists of the Zveno regime in the city. Realising that their days are numbered, the leaders of the clique packed their things and fled before they could be captured by radical nationalists - and thus, after a bloodless coup, the military regime fell.\n\nThe Union of Bulgarian National Legions, supported by radical army commanders, has formed a new government, chaired by Dochev - which proclaims a change of course. In one swift strike, the humiliating National Catastrophe shall be undone!"

 bulgaria_events.33.d: "Zveno's decision to maintain their ties with the Legions have eroded the last bits of faith which their monarchist allies had in the organisation, and sensing a moment of weakness, General Pencho Zlatev has launched a military coup to overthrow the regime. Sofia was surrounded by monarchist loyalist forces and Zveno loyalists surrendered after a brief firefight, while their leaders - Georgiev and Velchev - were captured. Tsar Boris III has been invited to return to the country and assume his rightful throne at once - now in charge of a royal dictatorship which shall restore stable, responsible governance for a country which needs to recover from defeat."

 bulgaria_events.34.t: "Direction of the Economy"
 bulgaria_events.34.d: "Under the orders of the Zveno clique, several ministries responsible for various sections of economic life have now been consolidated into a single institution - the Ministry of National Economy, which has been tasked to not only manage the economy, but to bring more and more of it towards the control of the State. Already, several orders for nationalisation have been issued, mainly directed to the tobacco and alcohol industry, but the ambition of the Zvenari extends further. Kimon Georgiev and Damyan Velchev have ambitions to turn the Bulgarian economy into an organ of its state, and give examples across the world where state-planned industrialisation has yielded great results.\n\nThey are opposed by their conservative allies, however, who believe that the current economic structure of Bulgaria should not be upset too much. Instead, the regime's goal should be to streamline it, save or nationalise failing businesses, and provide relief for the farmers."

 bulgaria_events.34.b: "We should avoid upsetting the structure too much"

 bulgaria_events.35.t: "Subjugation of Culture"
 bulgaria_events.35.d: "The Directorate of National Renewal is a major, if not keystone reform envisioned by the Zveno political circle, a tool with a vast task at hand - to achieve a full spiritual renewal of Bulgarian society. Taking as fact that morality and natural order have decayed and degraded under the parliamentary era and a change in national morale is necessary for it to straighten, it has wide powers to censor, ban and publish publications, media and other forms of culture. This goal of national rejuvenation can be interpreted differently from person to person, however.\n\nThe republican members of Zveno, gathered around Damyan Velchev, see the Directorate as a tool to completely reshape Bulgarian culture. They lay down totalitarian goals for the institution, envisioning mass application of media, control of information and distribution of correct ideological material in order to imbue Bulgarian people with obedience, loyalty, and discipline. This is denounced as delusion by other members of the clique, however, who call for the Directorate to instead take up the call of moral crusade. Philistine drug habits and cultural degeneracy plague Bulgaria today, especially in Sofia and other cities, which need to be amended, and a simpler traditional life promoted."

 bulgaria_events.35.b: "Ensuring public morality should be our goal"

 bulgaria_events.36.t: "A New Administration"
 bulgaria_events.36.d: "The Zveno regime has completely restructured local governance in Bulgaria. Districts and municipalities have been consolidated into a small number of local administrative units appointed and controlled from Sofia, stricter teacher qualification standards have seen much of the education system cleaned of the old chaff and replaced with loyal appointees, numerous settlements have had their names replaced with more Bulgarian ones. How far this centralisation will go, however, and what form will the Zveno regime take in the future are still up to debate.\n\nWhile conservative members of Zveno would prefer to just create an autocracy, presumably with the Tsar still in charge, their opinion is not shared by everyone. The core republican faction sees value in not merely absolute leadership, but one with an empowered bureaucracy below it. The issue with old Bulgaria was the incompetency of the administration, they say, therefore Zveno's regime should pursue complete rationalisation of the political system and an emphasis on technocratic rule."
 bulgaria_events.36.a: "Pursue technocratic governance."
 bulgaria_events.36.b: "Pursue governance under a leader principle."

 bulgaria_events.37.t: "Zveno and Political Society"
 bulgaria_events.37.d: "Though Zveno pushed the old political establishment out of their offices when they overthrew the parliamentary regime, those corrupt politicians have come crawling back, seeking to make amends and collaborate with the dictatorship. As deplorable as working with them would be, the conservative wing of the circle makes a point that the Zveno regime is still in its infancy and therefore should seek allies wherever it can. This would involve making some concessions and possibly loosening the dictatorship somewhat, however.\n\nThe republican, radical wing of the circle instead seeks to establish an entirely new political system - a corporatist one. Their vision calls for a House of Corporations as a replacement for the old parliament, which, instead of election, would be formed by interest groups, state-owned trade unions and industries loyal to the dictatorship."

 bulgaria_events.38.t: "Position of the National Legionaries"
 bulgaria_events.38.d: "The political battles going ahead in Bulgaria are reaching a culmination - and thanks to a seeming policy of compromise and centrism between the two main factions, neither the royalists nor the republicans inside Zveno have an upper hand. There is tension in the air, and uncertainty over whether the future of the state fills many with worry of possible instability, coups, or possibly even a civil war.\n\nIt falls to the Union of Bulgarian National Legions, the secondary ally of Zveno in their dictatorship, to tip the scales one way or another. Historically, the Legionaries are a royalist movement, professing their loyalty to the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, even though the controlling nature of their monarchs and German birth make this stance rather eclectic. Perhaps it is time for them to finally change sides, and join the growing popular movement to finally overthrow the German monarchy to replace it with an ethnic Bulgarian leadership?"

Under the command of the Zveno circle, it has been successfully transformed into a directorial, centralised state, unshackled by the old burdens of \"liberty\", \"democracy\" or \"parliamentarism\". The Army is empowered and its colonels will certainly remain in power for many decades, continuing to guide the Nation through any geopolitical woes which may challenge it.\n\nIn the midst of this transformation, the outdated Bulgarian monarchy has been abandoned on the way's side. Depowered, failing to influence the monarchist faction of Zveno enough to ensure his survival, the Tsar has been finally removed and expelled from the country - in his place, a Republic of Bulgaria has been established. Kimon Georgiev has been elected as the first President of Bulgaria - and the cold, capable Colonel will certainly do a better job than the corrupt German prince Ferdinand or his son."

The Army is empowered and its colonels will certainly remain in power for many decades, continuing to guide the Nation through any geopolitical woes which may challenge it.\n\nIn spite of the determination of the putschists to not merely overthrow the political system, but the Tsar as well, they have been outmanoeuvred. Allied with the informal leader of the conservative circle of the regime, Pencho Zlatev, he has successfully plotted the removal and exile of the Republicans, including both Damyan Velchev and Kimon Georgiev.

Opposition both from the right and the left challenge his rule as the reason why Bulgaria failed in the first place - constitutionalists declare that abandoning the interests of the people for a personalistic dictatorship is to blame, the remnants of Zveno state that the Royal Dictatorship was not dictatorial enough, and has proven that the monarchy is an antiquated institution which needs to go for Bulgaria to be saved.\n\nSporadic protests and army mutinies are breaking out, and control over the countryside is slipping. For now, the Royal Dictatorship persists, the military observed steadily and the constitutional parties remaining banned - however, the Tsar is savvy enough to realise that this status quo cannot stand. One way or another, the bubbling tensions will explode outward - perhaps it is better to negotiate?"

Burov explained his reason for visiting simply - the Tsardom will not survive at this rate, a fact which neither of them can accept. Obviously, the Tsar does not want to lose his throne, while Burov believes that the alternative, a military-enforced republic, will be even more nighmarish.\n\nInstead, the politician offers a pact - full support not only by his party, but the entire Bulgarian democratic spectrum, in exchange for a new page in Bulgarian history. Not only does he demand the restoration of the Constitution of Tarnovo, but also full constitutional reform which will transform Bulgaria into a full constitutional monarchy. The role of the Tsar will be minimised to a ceremonial role, no different from the British monarchs. It will be an end to half a century of the Tsars' efforts to consolidate power, ended in a stroke.\n\nFinally, Burov assures that he and the other leaders of the constitutionalist movement have enough contacts and backing among civil society and the military to ensure a smooth transition, with no threat of a military coup."

Defeat in the Balkan War has allowed radicals of every ideological bent to come out of the woodwork and start raising chaos. The most worrisome of these has come from the left, however, as several movements fighting for the overthrow of the monarchy have finally chosen to join forces as a united front.\n\nThe Narrow Socialist faction of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, banned and working underground for over a decade, has begun working together with the Agricultural Professional Confederation \"Vlasovden\". The former is a vanguard socialist party inspired by the Russian Revolution, its central committee led by Georgi Dimitrov residing in Paris — the latter, however, is an underground confederation of agricultural unions, led by the anarchist demagogue Manol Vasev, which follows an agrarian interpretation of Syndicalist practice. These two socialist movements have been joined by an unlikely ally — Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, the infamous leader of the Agrarian National Union who resides in Serbia with the republican splinter faction of the BZNS.\n\nThough Stamboliyski is no socialist, he too believes that the Tsardom needs to be destroyed, thus, these three movements have joined forces as the so-called \"Fatherland Front\"."

A lack of funding, supplies and manpower has left law enforcement paralysed and gave way to a series of assassinations, committed by underground insurgents affiliated with the Fatherland Front.\n\nA few days prior, an assassination took the life of former General Konstantin Georgiev, Prime Minister during the 1920s and a controversial political figure - socialist insurgent Atanas Todovichin took his life in front of a church in Sofia while heading there for evening service with his granddaughter. The first step of a coup d'etat was complete - the second took place today.\n\nThe funeral service for General Georgiev in the Church of Holy Sunday in Sofia was to be attended by numerous politicians and commanders of the Bulgarian Army, many of whom received forged funeral invitations in order to increase the death toll. The Fatherland Front recruited Petar Zadgorski, the sexton of the Church, to allow a terrorist team led by Petar Abadzhiev to plant 25 kilograms of explosives to the attic, right above where the coffin of the General would arrive at the end of the procession.\n\nThree, two, one, and... fire!"

 bulgaria_events.48.d: "The Holy Sunday Church Assault has shaken the entire nation - however, the Tsar and his government survived, and so could retaliate against this gruesome act. The failings of the constitutional system have finally been revealed - in response, the Bulgarian Army has chosen to act. Sofia has been locked down and the government has been forced to resign, while the Tarnovo Constitution has been suspended for the defence of the country. Tsar Boris III has appointed a loyal government led by Georgi Kyoseivanov in their stead, which promises that it shall establish a strong, responsible regime which will guide Bulgaria through these trying times."
 bulgaria_events.48.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

 bulgaria_events.49.t: "The Question of Ethnic Autonomy"
 bulgaria_events.49.d: "Our victory against the lackeys of the Tsar and the proto-Codreanites of the Zveno circle could not have been possible without the support of Bulgaria's ethnic minority interest groups — Turkish, Serbia, Greek and Jewish deputies, among others, chose the Petorka as the least terrible option, provided they received concessions in turn. Now that new elections have been held and the country stable on the road to full democracy, these promises have resurfaced — and even many politicians in Bulgarian national parties believe that some reform in favour of ethnic minorities is valuable, if not because it will be a clear break from the policies of the past decade.\n\nThe right-wing National Liberals and Democrats prefer only minor concessions, or a territorial solution — creating a new class of municipalities and districts in non-Bulgarian territories where minority languages will be made official alongside Bulgarian and the local community will receive say in how said autonomy is ruled. The Social Democratic Workers' Party has grown increasingly attached to a different solution, however — National Personal Autonomy, championed by Austromarxists, which would grant complete education and cultural autonomy to all inhabitants in Bulgaria, effectively making the state \"ethnic-blind\"."

 bulgaria_events.49.c: "Choose National Personal Autonomy."

 bulgaria_events.50.t: "Fall of the Legionary Regime"
 bulgaria_events.50.d: "The Legionary regime, established upon Bulgarian search for vengeance against the Belgrade Pact, failed to deliver upon their promise and so has fallen. Their rule was shaky from beginning to end, challenged by pretty much everyone in the Bulgarian political sphere. Their government, meanwhile, had little political experience - the young officers and agitators appointed during the takeover could not manage their ministries and had to resort to brutish measures in order to keep the resources flowing - looting the nation as a result. A clique of Tsarist loyalists has thus found it easy to sweep the radicals away and invite the Tsar back to lead a responsible government."
 bulgaria_events.50.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

 bulgaria_events.51.t: "Expulsion of the Royal Family"
 bulgaria_events.51.d: "Victorious against the Belgrade Pact, the Legionary regime has been able to consolidate control over Bulgaria by using the high off their victory. Ivan Dochev and his clique are celebrated in every corner of the nation. With their opponents silenced, they have all the power to change Bulgaria to their whim.\n\nThough the National Legions began as a monarchist movement, their rise of power through an alliance with Zveno and open conflict with Royalists has soured their stance on the Tsar. At last, Dochev's regime has announced that Bulgaria shall be reorganised into the \"National Legionary State\", and the former Tsar and his family will be expelled from the country hereforth. They have chosen to settle in Germany instead, away from their former homeland."

 bulgaria_events.52.t: "Coronation of Tsar Kyril I"
 bulgaria_events.52.d: "Victorious against the Belgrade Pact, the Legionary regime has been able to consolidate control over Bulgaria by using the high off their victory. Ivan Dochev and his clique are celebrated in every corner of the nation. With their opponents silenced, they have all the power to change Bulgaria to their whim.\n\nIn the end, the National Legions were founded with the vision of a strong, national Bulgarian tsardom, and a period of unclear political system has finally been put to a close. Kyril, Prince of Preslav, the brother of the last Tsar of Bulgaria, has been invited to assume the throne as the new Tsar. Unlike his brother, he is far more political malleable and less capable, and was thus judged by Dochev and his regime as a fine monarch."
 bulgaria_events.52.a: "He will be a valuable puppet"

 bulgaria_events.53.t: "To Arms!"
 bulgaria_events.53.d: "Ever since the National Legions seized control of Bulgaria, the situation on the country's borders has been tense. Though fighting did not break out on day one, the Legionary call to immediately repudiate the peace treaties of the Fourth Balkan War and reclaim Bulgaria's rightful territories did not go unnoticed. Romanian, Serbian and Greek forces remained mobilised, and the beginning of the IMRO uprising in Macedonia was seen as inevitably leading towards a war in Bulgaria.\n\nEventually, such a war did break out, as Bulgarian forces openly crossed the border agreed upon in the peace terms and joined the Macedonian revolutionaries in seizing the city of Štip in Eastern Macedonia. Here, Ivan Mihajlov met the Bulgarian military in person and declared that the IMRO will be integrated into the Bulgarian Army for the purposes of waging the renewed Fourth Balkan War. Open warfare has broken out across the Balkans since.\n\nBulgaria is stretched to the limits of its population, economy and morale. The Legionary regime has pursued a brutal remilitarisation which has sapped the nation of resources that were already drained by the Fourth Balkan War - and even if the Legionaries miraculously win, they will preside over an exhausted and battered Bulgaria. Of course, the young officers and activists in Sofia are hardly aware of the situation on the front. To them, this is merely a game of big numbers."
 bulgaria_events.53.a: "The Catastrophe will be redeemed!"

 bulgaria_events.54.t: "Clashes Across Morava"
 bulgaria_events.54.d: "Two months ago, our forces defeated the Belgrade Pact and put an end to their resistance to our hegemony once and for all - and yet, any hope that this would permanently stabilise the Western outlands has proven to be premature. News reports are reaching us from the territories of the former Serbian republic, speaking of developing resistance in the hills and mountains of the region. Unwilling to accept Bulgarian occupation, veterans of the Fourth Balkan War, joined by armed peasants frustrated with military reprisals and food requisitions, are taking to the countryside - there, much like their fathers and grandfathers, who fought against Ottoman rule, they start a new life as guerrillas, hajduks.\n\nA growing Serbian resistance movement, inspired by the Serbian Chetnik Organisation which operated on Ottoman soil before the Balkan Wars, has been registered by Bulgarian forces operating in the West, and reinforcements have been requested immediately. Ohrana paramilitaries have mobilised and martial law has been established in the Vardar region. If the situation is not put under control immediately, it may lead to a long and gruelling war of resistance."
 bulgaria_events.54.a: "How long will these Serbs keep resisting?"

 bulgaria_events.55.t: "Rise of the Serbian Chetnik Organisation"
 bulgaria_events.55.d: "The Serbian Chetnik Organisation has been emboldened, as it has found a leader - Dragoljub Mihailović, former General in the Serbian Army who refused to put down arms in the aftermath of the Fourth Balkan War. With a small group of officers and volunteers, he took to the mountains of the Morava region, skirmishing with Bulgarian garrisons on occasion while slowly gathering forces in the underground.\n\nEnough time has passed for these unorganised bands and ad hoc partisan detachments to coalesce - and the first major attack on Bulgarian forces took place in Ravna Gora, near Užice. For a few weeks, the region was liberated of all Bulgarian presence, before the arrival of reinforcements and Ohrana volunteers forced the Chetniks to make a move.\n\nNow, they have transformed into a travelling hidden army, moving from region to region, causing chaos and disorder everywhere they go and building up their forces for a larger, much more powerful uprising - one which will free Serbia from the despised Bulgarian tyrants once and for all."

 bulgaria_events.56.t: "Chetniks Relocate to [BUL_chetnik_headquarters.GetName]"
 bulgaria_events.56.d1: "The mobile Chetnik regiments are once again on the move, and after weeks of treacherous travel through the mountains and valleys, the core of their forces have finally settled in [BUL_chetnik_headquarters.GetName], in a rural part of the region farther away from most population centres. Their journey was mostly unabated, and the Chetniks are reported to have only met light Bulgarian resistance along the way. In spite of that, this victory has been heavily propagandised across Serbia and hundreds of young men have left their homes to join the followers of Mihailović."
 bulgaria_events.56.d2: "The mobile Chetnik regiments are once again on the move, and after weeks of treacherous travel through the mountains and valleys, the core of their forces have finally settled in [BUL_chetnik_headquarters.GetName], in a rural part of the region farther away from most population centres. In spite of this, their journey was not easy, and heavy fighting against Bulgarian garrisons has depleted their ranks. Though Chetnik propaganda is trying to cover up this severe blow, they still have to grapple with the truth - that they are growing weaker."

 bulgaria_events.56.b: "One step closer to victory!"

 bulgaria_events.57.t: "The Third Serbian Revolution"
 bulgaria_events.57.d: "For many months, the Serbian Chetnik Organisation has waged a ceaseless guerrilla war against the occupying Bulgarian forces, and this period of struggle seems to have paid off. Joined by more and more volunteers across Serbia, Mihailović's Chetniks have rapidly grown in numbers, and they are no longer just a merry band of escaped veterans. Through capturing lost Serbian army equipment, looting Bulgarian army caches, and acquiring support from emigre communities overseas, the Chetniks are well armed and on the level of standing forces.\n\nHaving grown confident in the strength of his movement and seeking to show his teeth, general Mihailović has ordered the beginning of a mass rebellion in [BUL_chetnik_headquarters.GetName]. Chetnik detachments have seized control of local cities, defeated garrisons and pushed out the Bulgarian forces stationed there, seizing it in the name of the Serbian Chetnik Organisation.\n\nAlready, underground newspapers in Serbia have begun describing the events in [BUL_chetnik_headquarters.GetName] as a \"Third Serbian Revolution\", even though, ironically, the Chetnik leadership is staunchly monarchist and would not appreciate the comparison to the hated Republican Revolution of 1925..."
 bulgaria_events.57.a: "Someone will be hanged for this!"

 bulgaria_events.58.t: "Chetniks Defeated"
 bulgaria_events.58.d: "The strength of the Serbian Chetnik Organisation has grown so pitiful that the Bulgarian high command has found it safe enough to attempt a decapitating blow. A trap was laid for Chetnik detachments in [BUL_chetnik_headquarters.GetName], garrisons there were artificially weakened in order to draw the resistance there. The state was then soon cordoned and assaulted with full force, dozens of camps and armed partisan detachments seized, crushed and captured in a matter of days.\n\nDragoljub Mihailović reportedly attempted to escape by crossing the Bulgarian-Albanian border, but he was betrayed by one of his subordinates, Nikola Kalabić, who revealed his place of hiding in exchange for leniency. Unfortunately, we were unable to bring this reactionary terrorist to trial - Mihailović fell to the hands of Macedonian volunteers in the Ohrana, who gave him a gruesome execution.\n\nLeaderless, shattered, dispersed and destroyed, the Chetniks have finally ceased any significant resistance against our rule in all of Bulgaria, and our rule there is secure for good."
 bulgaria_events.58.a: "Victory!"

 bulgaria_events.59.t: "Resistance in the Mountains"
 bulgaria_events.59.d: "In the aftermath of the revolution, the Bulgarian army has effectively dissolved. Though the majority will eventually be brought back to the fold and reorganised to a new Republican army, large sections of the army corps have chosen to continue their resistance. In the mountains stretching across Bulgaria, these reactionaries can find a safe home where they can gather, plan their next action and spread royalist propaganda. General Pencho Zlatev has risen through the ranks of the remaining royalists, as one of the few leading army commanders who refused to go into exile and instead stayed behind.\n\nWith the death of Boris III, the Royalist resistance supports the claim of the Prince of Preslav, Kyril I, on the throne. Though this is bypassing the legitimate successor, the son of Boris, Zlatev argues that once socialism and Stamboliyski's stooges are wiped out, Bulgaria will need the capable hand of an adult monarch."
 bulgaria_events.59.a: "These reactionaries will be crushed!"

 bulgaria_events.60.t: "Defence of the Revolution"
 bulgaria_events.60.d: "With the dissolution of the Army, the most organised armed element in Bulgaria is the Orange Guard. Originally founded after the Weltkrieg as the paramilitary of the Agrarian National Union and led by Raiko Daskalov, it was forced into the underground and exile - however, it retained its leadership and was able to quickly rebuild itself after the Revolution. In comparison, the socialist factions in the Fatherland Front only have armed worker militias and peasantry under the Vlasovden Confederation, whose organisation and armament is poor.\n\nThus, Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski has argued that the Orange Guard should be called upon to defend the Revolution until a new army can be established. This proposal is harshly protested by the Syndicalists, however. Manol Vasev has declared that he will veto any proposal to use the Orange Guard as garrisons or as guards of Fatherland Front assemblies. Instead, the vehement revolutionary has offered to organise peasant militias in the countryside to come to the defence of the Revolution. Seizing the arms in stashes of the former army, they will be able to arm a large enough number of militiamen to deter any royalist coup attempts."
 bulgaria_events.60.a: "Allow the organisation of the Orange Guard."
 bulgaria_events.60.b: "Call peasant militias to the defence."

 bulgaria_events.61.t: "Orange Guard Counter-Coup"
 bulgaria_events.61.d: "Tasked to protect the fragile Fatherland Front government from royalist rebels, the Orange Guard swiftly turned their weapons against their former allies. Under Stamboliyski's secret orders, almost one thousand Orange Guardsmen seized control of Sofia in the middle of a Fatherland Front congress, taking the socialist deputies hostage and cutting off the capital from the rest of Bulgaria. By the time communications by letter and telegraph were restored, Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski was the undisputed ruler of Sofia, the old interim government was disbanded and a new one, staffed entirely by the Agrarian National Union, was proclaimed. The rest of the country surrendered shortly afterwards."
 bulgaria_events.61.a: "Long live the Peasant Republic!"

 bulgaria_events.62.t: "The Agrarian Betrayal"
 bulgaria_events.62.d: "In spite of being forced to share the duty of revolutionary defence, the Orange Guard chose to attempt a takeover regardless. During a congress of the Fatherland Front, all communications in Sofia were suddenly cut off and the Orange Guard moved in to seize control of the city. They were met by barricades and hundreds of armed workers, however, and their siege of the city was broken by peasant militias swiftly arriving from the surrounding parishes. A night of bloody street battles followed before the Agrarian forces were broken, and the arrest of the Congress was lifted. It immediately voted to expel all deputies of the BZNS from the assembly and order the destruction of the party. Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, Raiko Daskalov and other high ranking leaders of the party were swiftly arrested afterwards. No roadblock is left between the Fatherland Front and the proclamation of a socialist republic."
 bulgaria_events.62.a: "Finally, socialism!"

 bulgaria_events.63.t: "Marxist-Syndicalist Polemics"
 bulgaria_events.63.d: "Now that the Agrarian National Union has been purged and driven underground, there are two political tendencies left inside the Fatherland Front. While both of them declare themselves to be socialist and seek to create a socialist republic, they differ in their goals and ideology — an extraordinary congress of the Front has been called to elect new leadership of the organisation and decide on its direction hereforth.\n\nThe Narrow Socialists, colloquially called the \"Communist Party\", were the instigators of the Front and are led by Georgi Dimitrov. Though having spent most of his career in exile in France, Dimitrov has grown critical of the political system of the Commune, stating that is system is only effective in industrialised Western states and a socialist state in a country as backwards as Bulgaria must first focus on modernisation before it can implement orthodox socialist theory. Such a modernisation drive must be led by an educated, professional vanguard - Dimitrov points to the failed, yet famous revolution in Russia as an example of how a socialist revolution may be waged.\n\nThe Vlasovden Agricultural Confederation, meanwhile, is a trade union council seeking to unite the agricultural workers of Bulgaria. Led by Manol Vasev, it is clearly inspired by anarchist and Syndicalist theory - however, it seeks to implement these principles among the peasantry. Their vision for Bulgaria is that of a decentralised state divided into rural communes, with the supremacy of a trade union congress at the top, managing Bulgaria according to the interests of the organised agricultural workers.\n\nWhile the Narrow Socialists technically lead the Front, they are held back by their leadership only now returning from exile, while their Syndicalist peers had continued the fight back home and gained the respect of the people."

 bulgaria_events.64.t: "Conclusion of the Brigadist Movement"
 bulgaria_events.64.d: "The \"Build for the Motherland\" Movement, or the Brigadist Movement, has concluded after years of labour. Thousands of students, youths, and seasonal employees were drafted during this time, working in massive construction projects and laying the foundations for a new, industrial, socialist Bulgaria. New railways have been constructed, new bridges have been erected, entire hydroelectric dams have been built in such a short amount of time - and it was all achieved not by the wage exploitation of capitalism, but by the popular will of the people.\n\nThe dedication of our proletariat to socialist ideals has been proven, and the reactionaries will struggle to disprove our capabilities now."
 bulgaria_events.64.a: "This is how we shall build socialism!"

 bulgaria_events.65.t: "Royalist Putsch"
 bulgaria_events.65.d: "Though successful in seizing power across Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front never truly eradicated Royalist resistance across the country - the mountains of the country, desolate and sparsely inhabited, were especially rife with armed groups struggling to restore the natural order. For most of time, this resistance could safely be contained - however, the regime's decision to seek a path to peace with the Belgrade Pact, at a moment when their control over the state was still fragile, proved to be its undoing.\n\nIn spite of the horrors inflicted upon Bulgaria during the Fourth Balkan War and in the aftermath of the National Catastrophe, the Bulgarian people could not comprehend abandoning their heartland in Macedonia, Thrace and Dobrogea. They have suffered a lot while defending these territories, but those territories were inhabited by millions of their countrymen, so how could they possibly be left out? Protests against the initiating negotiations between Bulgaria and the Pact broke out almost instantly, followed by a sudden putsch by radical royalist paramilitaries descending from the southern mountains.\n\nIn a swift stroke and after a week of fighting, the Republic collapsed, and General Pencho Zlatev announced the restoration of the Tsardom in the heart of Sofia. As the socialists barbarically assassinated Tsar Boris III in the St. Nedelya Church before their takeover, his brother Kyril, Prince of Preslav, has returned from exile to assume the throne as Kyril I."
 bulgaria_events.65.a: "Long live Bulgaria!"

 bulgaria_events.66.t: "General Zlatev Captured"
 bulgaria_events.66.d: "After a raid into the southern mountains, our forces have captured one of the leading commanders of the Royalist resistance — former General Pencho Zlatev. According to reports, the General, who was residing in exile ever since the fall of the monarchy, crossed the border to rendezvous with Royalist guerrillas — however, he was captured by our forces and detained. For the past months, the strength of the Royalist resistance has been wavering, and they were unable to protect their leader.\n\nAlongside dozens of other high ranking royalists, General Zlatev has been given a death sentence by the \"People's Court\", as a show of force to all would-be traitors. This marks an important point in Bulgarian history - the dreams of a return of the monarchy appear extinguished, and the Republic is sure to last."
 bulgaria_events.66.a: "Thus onto all traitors!"

 bulgaria_events.67.t: "Worrisome Reports from Serbia"
 bulgaria_events.67.d: "We have received reports that the puppet government we established in Serbia is negotiating with underground remnants of the Konspiracija, and may be plotting an uprising against our rule. The regime of [SER.GetLeader] can no longer be trusted to uphold their bargains."

 bulgaria_foreign_events.1.d: "A delegation has arrived to our doorstep - and it comes from our enemies, turned allies, turned enemies once again, the Bulgarian Tsardom. Our relationship with this Balkan state has been far from stellar, and though Germany has forced us to bury the hatchet once so we would work together during the Weltkrieg, the tensions at the Thracian border have never vanished. Thousands of Turks languish under the Bulgarian boot, a policy of Bulgarisation imposed upon them - and a powerful lobby in Ottoman politics, mainly backed by the Muhacirs, refugees and descendants of refugees from the Balkans, seeks the reclamation of Turkish-populated regions in Bulgaria.\n\nOf course, the regime in Sofia is no idiot, well aware that a war between them and their rivals in the Balkan region will likely solicit our intervention - thus they have approached us, seeking a peacetime resolution to our tensions and a non-aggression pact. In these negotiations, we would have the upper hand, and would be able to extract significant concessions from the Bulgarians - although, is this really necessary?"

Bulgaria, meanwhile, has wavered on its stance towards its Turkish population due to this reason.

 bulgaria_foreign_events.14.d: "The Bulgarian delegation has refused our reasonable demands!

 bulgaria_foreign_events.15.d: "The negotiations in Kostantiniye are getting heated. Realising that a normal agreement is impossible to achieve, the Ottomans have laid down their final demand - a full, unilateral return of Western Thrace in exchange for their silence in the Balkans, without any room for negotiation. Returning with such an ultimatum in our hands will be a shame to the Bulgarian state for years to come - however, perhaps it's better than a war on four fronts?"

Concerned by the rearmament of their rivals in the region and Austrian inaction against them, they request financial and military support to aid them in a likely war. During the interbellum period, the Bulgarians drifted away from our sphere, citing lacking shared interests as well as their frustration with Bulgaria's treatment in the Weltkrieg - and yet they return to us grovelling. Should we spare something for their aid?"

 bulgaria_foreign_events.20.t: "Germany Refuses!"
 bulgaria_foreign_events.20.d: "The German hegemon, either because it believed itself to be slighted or simply because it lacks interest in the region, has refused our call for help - and so, we will be forced to make up for this loss with our own meagre experience."

 bulgaria_foreign_events.27.d: "[BUL.GetOldNameDefCap] has asserted itself as a Balkan hegemon and won a stunning victory against the Austrian empire. Today, a new state of Southern Slavs has been declared in Sofia, formally uniting Serbs, Bulgarians, Croats and Slovenes into one state. The concept for this country has been known as 'Yugoslavia' for quite some time, and it is expected that this name will become the de facto name for the new state.\n\nThe nation of Illyria was a previous attempt at creating such a nation but under Croatian leadership.

In spite of the ratification, however, the Treaties were soon abandoned, as the overlapping territorial claims became impossible to reconcile.

 bulgaria_flavour_events.1.d: "Newspapers from Varna report a spectacular story — an act of personal kindness by our very own Crown Prince, Boris. Visiting the beach resort by the city, the royal heard a voice coming from the distance — and as an avid swimmer, he took forward to investigate the matter himself. A few minutes later, he returned to the shore with six people in tow — they almost drowned, and the Crown Prince came in their hour of need.\n\nThis is far from the first time when Boris has made himself known to the public through personal acts of kindness — almost every Bulgarian village has a story of the \"People's Prince\" visiting with little to no guards and offering a ride in his car, and in 1934, he took control of a passenger train he was travelling in the middle of fire in order to stop it safely. The tale coming from Varna has added to this impressive repertoire."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.2.d: "New local elections have been held across the Bulgarian-controlled Nish region in the aftermath of Operation Nishava, as many of the former councillors and several mayors were arrested under suspicion of collusion with the government in Belgrade. In spite of this oppressive touch, however, the overwhelmingly Serbian population in the region has not yielded to pressure, and the local elections have revealed even greater turnout in favour of the Serb Democratic Party (Srpska demokratska stranka), which has gained over 54 per cent of the vote.\n\nThe SDS is an eclectic party, in part a progressive republican party owing to their affiliation with the ruling Republican Party in Serbia, while at the same time heavily nationalist, vehemently separatist and anti-Bulgarian. Because of the former, they support the progressive elements in the Sŭbranie and stand in favour of abolishing the State Protection Act, but because of the latter, their inclusion into the pro-constitution coalition has been protested by many Bulgarian deputies."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.3.t: "Ban of the Dobrogean Iron Guard"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.3.d: "Bulgaria's State Protection Act has claimed another victim - the Dobrogean chapter of the Legion of Archangel Michael, more commonly known as the Iron Guard. It was first founded in 1933, and received a head-start with the donation of hundreds of thousands of lev by the engineer Virgil Ionescu, which even earned him a promotion to lead the branch first in Constanta and then across all of Dobrogea. Though it officially declared itself to be a branch of the party in Bucharest, in practice, it was autonomous due to the difficulty of controlling this branch behind the tense Bulgarian-Romanian border. This autonomy has led to the Dobrogean Iron Guard working alongside local parliamentary Romanian parties, under the premise that all Romanians must work together, not unlike the PNR in Transylvania - an awkward situation considering the Iron Guard's stance towards the old parliamentary parties in mainland Romania.\n\nCiting the organisation's collusion with foreign elements, vehement anti-Bulgarian rhetoric, and their plotting against the security of the Bulgarian State, the authorities have finally dissolved it. Its headquarters in Constanta were raided by police, several of its leaders, including Ionescu himself, were arrested, and its property was seized. The ban went by without significant criticism in the Bulgarian parliament, but was met by protests among the Romanian minority in Dobrogea."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.4.t: "The Great Etatist Project"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.4.d: "State interventionism in the Bulgarian economy has existed ever since the restoration of the Bulgarian state. Lacking a strong local industry or the materials for one to develop naturally, Bulgaria resorted to promoting development via state directorates, controlling the distribution of resources, establishing strong protectionist laws and controlling the local financial sector. The first Prime Minister to fully dedicate himself towards economic development was Konstantin Stoilov — and his goals were ambitious. Seeing the industrial titans of Northwest Europe as an ideal, he declared that Bulgaria needs to one day become \"a Belgium in the Balkans\".\n\nIn spite of this, industrial development in Bulgaria has been insufficient, and the Balkan Wars completely disrupted it. Only the late 1920s saw an industrial boom start anew, and even it was meagre. In 1932, the People's Bloc government formed a board of Bulgaria's most esteemed economists, those who believed in an etatist economic system, at least, and drafted them to make a plan for a massive breakthrough industrialisation project.\n\nThis board included figures such as Todor Vladigerov, Konstantin Bobchev and the Historicism-influenced Bulgarian Economic Society. Though somewhat hesitant about full state intervention and calling for the need to include private initiative into the project, their draft is the most comprehensive document on the future of the Bulgarian economy by far — and has been accepted by the Ministry of National Economy as their guide.\n\nEnvisioning massive state-guided development in the fields of agriculture, industry, transportation and city design, it has rightfully been dubbed \"The Great Etatist Project\"."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.5.t: "Ambition of the Zvenari"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.5.d: "In the past few days, the last remnants of the old parliamentary system have been swept away. The Sŭbranie has been dissolved and absolute power has been concentrated in a small circle of civilian and military members of Zveno. Their plans are long and their ambitions are great - Zveno does not see itself as a yet another tinpot military clique nor as a mere National Populist dictatorship, their reformist goals are, if they are to be believed, of a unique Bulgarian direction. From their ivory tower in Sofia, Zveno envisions a thorough transformation of Bulgarian society, turning the nation into a clockwork machine. Irrational tradition will be uprooted, pointless distractions will be cleansed, little cracks and imperfections will be swept away, and a nation as efficient as an assembly line shall be built.\n\nAlready, however, tiny rifts are starting to form within the political circle. The faction of Zveno currently in charge, led by Kimon Georgiev and Damyan Velchev, see their ideology as a means to assume complete control of the state - overtaking even the Tsar himself, whom they see as a relic of the outdated past, and establishing a republic. This falls to direct opposition with the conservative wing of the circle, led by Pencho Zlatev, who are primarily composed of civilian politicians and outsider generals recruited to ensure the success of the conspiracy - their ambitions are nowhere near as totalitarian, and the Tsar still figures in their calculations.\n\nOne final factor to consider is the Union of Bulgarian National Legions, tentatively allied with Zveno and promoting their cause of political centralisation in civil society - sometimes with... rather violent means. Though they are of no threat right now, a great collapse of public legitimacy could lead to... something worrying."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.6.t: "The Bulgarian Horde"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.6.d: "Traditionally, Bulgarian historiography has viewed the established steppe origin of the Bulgars with conservatism. Though Khan Kubrat and his successors did lay the foundations for the First Bulgarian Empire, they say, the Turkic-descended nomads eventually merged with the local Slavs to form the Bulgarian nation — which was, fundamentally, a Slavic one. This belief is not held by Dimitŭr Sŭsŭlov, a historian — or so he claims — who has long fought for a reimagining of the Bulgarian national identity. A lawyer by trade and a veteran of the Weltkrieg, he has gathered a small elitist circle of intellectuals and officers named the \"Bulgarian Horde\" to proliferate his ideas.\n\nAccording to Sŭsŭlov, Bulgarians are not Slavs, but rather a separate Indo-European branch which has played a key role in the history of Europe. The Bulgars, and their ancestors, the Huns, were not Turkic nor were they mere nomadic tribes - rather, they were the flagbearers of a long-forgotten civilisation that could challenge Rome in its height and ultimately settled in Bulgaria. Sŭsŭlov continues his works by stating that this legendary Hunnic origin requires Bulgaria to return to its roots - to grant full prerogatives to the King, do away with Western parliamentarism and create a traditional, absolute state.\n\nHis historic theories are fringe and denounced as pseudo-science by many - however, Sŭsŭlov's works find a home among the Bulgarian far-right."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.7.d: "Ever since our victory in the Balkan War and the defeat of Bulgaria, the provinces we have annexed from them have been unruly. The Bulgarian population there refuses to accept our rule, and the mountainous terrain of Thrace means that resistance organisations have a field day in organising themselves and staying out of the reach of our forces.\n\nThe revanchist government in Bulgaria seems to have learned how to take advantage of this movement, however, and has conscripted the former Bulgarian army officer Dimitar Madzharov to establish a united resistance organisation in the southern provinces. Inspired by the success of the IMRO in Serbia, they have announced their presence as the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation. Fighting the deplorable conditions of the Thracian Bulgarians, officially proposing a free Thracian state while really just seeking to reclaim these lands for Bulgaria, the ITRO stages terror bombings, assassinations, and village attacks without restraint."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.8.t: "Zveno's Yugoslavism"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.8.d: "The Yugoslav movement, seeking to unify all South Slavs under one nation, has gone through several incarnations, be it the Illyrian movement or the limited Yugoslav irredentism championed by Serbia. The Serb defeat in the Weltkrieg put their role as the \"Piedmont of the South Slavs\" into question, however, all while a new great power arose in the Balkans — the Bulgarian tsardom, the only independent and powerful South Slavic state left in Europe.\n\nBulgaria was traditionally left out of Yugoslav nation plans, owing to their cultural distance from the other South Slavs — and the Bulgarians themselves were not dying to surrender to a greater South Slavic identity, either, as their national identity is already solid enough without it. However, there were politicians and philosophers, such as Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski and Ivan Meštrović, who included Bulgaria into the equation — and the activist officers composing Zveno hold some affinity towards the concept as well, although in a less... selfless light.\n\nKimon Georgiev, Damyan Velchev and their peers see Yugoslavism as the step forward for a truly Greater Bulgaria — by embracing Yugoslavism, it shall be able to paint its assimilationist tendencies in the Western provinces as merely seeking Yugoslav unity, and even use this as a banner to rally under for a challenge to Austrian hegemony."

Unlike their peers in the former Fatherland Front, the Syndicalists do not have a strong oppressive apparatus with which to maintain stability across the nation even in such a case of growing internal unrest - thus, an oppressive apparatus came to power.\n\nThe Federation of Anarchist Communists of Bulgaria, a Sorelian-inspired front for anarchist chetas organised in the Bulgarian mountains by Vasil Ikonomov, has taken advantage of the instability and seized power in Bulgaria in a swift stroke."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.10.d: "Established in 1880, the State Court, or Court of the State, is a non-permanent institution tasked to try large numbers of current or former government officials for egregious crimes committed against the state. Moribund for decades, it has now been revived with the publication of the Law on Punishment for the Perpetrators of the National Catastrophe. The Bulgarian nation demands someone to pay for the suffering it has endured during the Fourth Balkan War, someone who was responsible for the nation's inability to avert the catastrophe.\n\nThe Bulgarian army failed in battle during the war, and conservative army officers point to the wide-scale reforms initiated right before the war as the culprit. They say that the reforms of General Rusi Rusev proved inadequate in battle and only caused confusion in the military at a moment when tried and tested methods were necessary. Teodosi Daskalov, having commanded the armed forces during the war, is also likely to be imprisoned if the military-focused axis wins.\n\nAnother side claims that it was the civilian administration which brought Greater Bulgaria's undoing. Having grown decadent and corrupt over the interwar years, the politicians turned blind, unable to see Serbian and Romanian rearmament before it was far too late to react. Judges favouring this side call for a mass crackdown on dozens of opposition political figures and a full purge of the administration, even if it means our state economic sector, managed by these bureaucrats, will suffer greatly."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.12.d: "Riding from the north and sweeping across the mountains of the peninsula, numerous conquerors in the Balkans have tried to seize Constantinople and proclaim themselves as the new Emperor of the Romans — of them, few were as successful as Simeon the Great, who led the First Bulgarian Empire to its greatest territorial extent. Recognised as an \"Emperor\" by the Orthodox Church, he came close to seizing Constantinople itself and absorbing the Byzantine Empire, had it not been for his unfortunate death. Even today, he is still remembered as one of the most illustrious Tsars of Bulgaria, and the legacy of his claim upon Rome has not been forgotten.\n\nIt was one of Ferdinand I's dreams during the Balkan Wars — to seize Constantinople, unite the two coasts of the Bosphorus Strait, and restore the Byzantine Empire under Bulgarian shoulders. Though defeats in the Balkan War have tempered these ambitions, the Fourth Balkan War has reignited.\n\nFew could have imagined Bulgaria to be able to win the War so easily — in months, no, weeks, the Belgrade Pact has been completely vanquished, and the Ottoman Empire, foolishly expecting their stab in the back to succeed, has been driven behind the Sea of Marmara. The weakened, ageing, yet still ambitious Tsar has arrived to Constantinople for a victory parade — here, with the advice of his generals, he made a short speech, proclaiming that \"what had been taken away from Simeon, he has restored\". Today, Bulgaria shall no longer be a mere Tsardom. Today, it has asserted its claim to being an Empire."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.13.t: "The Universal White Brotherhood"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.13.d: "Founded by Petŭr Dŭnov after the Weltkrieg, the Universal White Brotherhood is a movement of occultist esoteric Christianity, and claims itself to be the successor to and unifier of \"the three great traditions from the Bulgarian lands\" — Ancient Greek Orphism cults, the work of Cyril and Methodius, and the Bogomilist movement. The \"Universal Brotherhood\" in its name is a sixth supranational race, which will be an organism of evolved human souls and extrasensory beings (angels) accomplished by studying the works and following the tenets of Dŭnov's teachings. Though it also has a racialist character, claiming that the souls of the white race, and specifically the Slavs, are the closest to reaching \"the sixth race\", it does not significantly pronounce these tenets.\n\nWhile the existence of such a pseudo-religious brotherhood would be of no concern to us, Nikola Nedev, one of the leading generals in the Bulgarian Army, is a personal friend of Dŭnov, and has been a member of the Universal White Brotherhood for a few years now. Recently, the General has been growing increasingly involved in the organisation, and has lapsed on his duties as General, which some say has had a negative effect on his ability to lead. Should we finally do something to curtail the growth of this Brotherhood, perhaps by getting city majors to refuse hosting for Dŭnov's speeches and getting Nedev to resign, or is this really not an issue?"

 bulgaria_flavour_events.14.d: "Ferdinand I, Tsar of the Third Bulgarian Tsardom, has passed away at the age of 87 in the Royal Palace in Sofia. An active, if authoritarian monarch, Ferdinand has presided over the most tumultuous period in Bulgarian history, from the humble beginnings as a mere principality still under the Ottoman Empire, to a glorious rise until the eventual unification of all Bulgarian peoples in the Balkans. Though this hegemony over the Balkans eventually turned out to be not as durable as imagined, Ferdinand's accomplishments cannot be underestimated regardless. Whether you love him as the greatest ruler of Bulgaria since the Middle Ages or despise him as an autocrat, you have to recognise that his reign has left Bulgaria changed to its fundamentals.\n\nThe crown of Bulgaria has been inherited by his son Boris, a seamless transition, as the Crown Prince has fulfilled much of his father's duties for the past two decades. Boris III is expected to reign over a new era of Bulgarian history, as the world around it changes again, and its waves will surely pick up the Balkans as well."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.15.t: "The Balkan Union"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.15.d: "Much like in the rest of Europe, the nineteenth century was an age of nationalism in the Balkans, where Serbs, Bulgarians, Greeks, Albanians and others began dreaming of independent nation-states - and yet, albeit weak, a concept of a Balkan Federation always persisted. Sometimes it took a narrow form, limited to the South Slavs and thus entangled with the Yugoslav project, other times, such as in the original proposal by the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, as a federation of all Balkan states. Sometimes it was proposed as a way to alleviate the ethnic tensions in the region, especially regarding the Macedonian question, other times it was seen as a way for Balkan peoples to collectively resist foreign aggression.\n\nBy the 1930s, a full federation is only limited to the socialist movement - however, concepts of Balkan integration still float about, and Bulgarian politicians such as Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, Yanko Sakazov, and the Radical Democratic Party have spoken out in favour of it. The abandoned Serbian-Bulgarian Treaties of 1904 have served as a possible blueprint for economic and political Balkan integration - by abandoning trade barriers, establishing diplomatic cooperation and uniting to a military alliance, peace in the Balkans might still be possible.\n\nPerhaps one day, the Balkan states can still unite to one peaceful superpower. Until then, however, Bulgarian victory in the Fourth Balkan War should be enough to force the other Balkan states into cooperation."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.17.d: "The formation of Yugoslavia has led to significant changes in the Bulgarian political spectrum, as the integration of the rest of the South Slavic lands has completely upended the nature of the state. The old 'Zveno' ('Unit') label, signifying the military clique's dedication to strength and rationality, has lost its lustre — after all, what better proof is there of the success of Zveno reforms than the fact that they have just defeated the Austrian Empire in battle?\n\nSupporters of the regime have begun to band under a new banner — the \"United Yugoslavia\" Political Circle, whose stated purpose is now the defence of \"united Yugoslav national interest\" against internal and external enemies alike. An official proclamation by the \"Zveno\" newspaper soon after the formation of Yugoslavia proclaimed the regime's approach to Yugoslavism — ripping a few pages from Integral Yugoslavist theory, the newspaper stated that cultural differences between Yugoslavs are a historical construct and a strong, centralised state is necessary to erase them. If unified not just physically, but spiritually, \"the Yugoslavs\" may become the flagbearers of a new great power in Europe, or at least a power capable to resist France, Germany and Russia alike.\n\n\"United Yugoslavia\" has attempted to reach out to Serbian and Illyrian intellectuals, as well as politicians, to recruit them to the administration, with little success. From start to finish, the Yugoslavist project will inevitably be a Bulgarian supremacist project - and while Bulgarian military might will certainly retain this construct for a decade or two, how long can millions of Serbs and Croats be controlled by sheer force alone?"

 bulgaria_flavour_events.18.t: "Aleksandŭr Tsankov Defends the Etatist Project"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.18.d: "The beginning of the Great Etatist Project has attracted criticism from foreign and domestic economists alike. In their eyes, such an escalation of state intervention in the economy will only destabilise it, and the idea tha it could possibly turn Bulgaria into a modern industrial power is ridiculous. These critics have received a harsh response from the University of Sofia, however, whose longtime professor of political economy, Aleksandŭr Tsankov, is a noted supporter of the Great Etatist Project.\n\nThough Tsankov was not a member of the economist board tasked to draft the plans for the project, he has been involved in state economic institutions in the past, most notably in the Directorate for Economic Care and Public Foresight during the Weltkrieg. Though Tsankov acknowledges some problems with the wartime directorate's work, he writes in his response article that a return to free-market economics would be ridiculous. To him, free-market capitalists are ideologues of economic systems that have outlived their time.\n\nTsankov finishes his article by responding to another common critique — that the Project is socialist — by stating that this is no cause of concern, as \"socialism must by necessity become a little bourgeois, and the bourgeoisie - a little socialist\"."

 bulgaria_flavour_events.19.t: "War of the Artists"
 bulgaria_flavour_events.19.d: "When the State Protection Act was adopted, it was not merely the minority communities or underground socialists who suffered. Free speech has been curtailed and Bulgarian literature has struggled since. While the Republican Revolution in Serbia led to an explosive revival of avant-garde art and literature, such as the Zenitist movement, Bulgarian literature has increasingly struggled to breathe. The government of Konstantin Georgiev, as well as subsequent governments, looked down on Symbolist, Expressionist or even the unique Diabolist currents, and instead cooperated with the Zlatorog magazine, edited by Vladimir Vasilev, who was much more cooperative with creeping authoritarianism.\n\nThe Bulgarian literary community has endorsed the designs of the Petorka, joining the campaign against the State Protection Act and against the censorship of literature. The poet, journalist and translator Geo Milev stands at the forefront of this literary movement. Milev was a socialist in his youth, dedicating poems to the French Revolution and to the struggle of Bulgarian communists, but he matured and moderated over time — still, however, he is a noted progressive and a supporter of the Broad Socialists. The Petorka's campaign against the Act has revived one of Milev's poems from 1926, in which he challenged the still rather recent Act:\n\n\"To be able to suffocate the proud consciousness, the voice that cries out, the eternal truth that lives forever — everyone discovered a single ax — today's rulers of Bulgaria invented the 'State Protection Act', to kill everything that cannot die!\""

Later that morning, handing over the sealed letter the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] demanded an answer on the official stance and support of our government on this \"terrorist\" organisation and why we seemingly doesn't care about its operation within our borders, hitting an almost outrageous tone.\n\nOf course, we don't need to respond to these mindless accusations at all, but annoyingly the letter also gathered some international spotlight, putting us under pressure not only from [FROM.GetName], but also from some of our trade partners as well, who are also in good relations with [FROM.GetName]. However, things are now in motion that cannot be undone, so even if we formally disband the newborn organisation, which would cut off a good chunk off their financial and material support, it would hardly be a deathblow to the ITRO.

Authorities even confiscated around 400 guns and 12 mortars in a Plovdiv warehouse, with two man arrested. Personnel leaving the military temporarily to join the ITRO were called back with immediate effect.\n\nHowever it speaks volumes, that other, supportive organisation to the ITRO's cause, like the Thracian Scientific Institute can continue to function without a problem in Sofia. Also in the [ROOT.GetAdjective]-[FROM.GetAdjective] border, the ITRO detachments couldn't care less about what the [FROM.GetAdjective] government announced, they still having a strong presence in the region."
 bulgaria_flavour_events.36.d_b: "Even after a week after submitting our formal protest there is still no answer from Bulgaria. Our countries' relation is worse than ever after our actions in the last Balkan War, to which their reaction was the organisation of ITRO. Our ambassador in Sofia was repeatedly refused entry to the foreign office to meet with their Bulgarian counterpart after previously handing over our formal protest, it seems like they chose to straight up ignore our diplomatic request. Not an entirely unexpected development, but a very ungentlemanly gesture from the Bulgarians."
 bulgaria_flavour_events.36.d_c: "In Sofia they surely took their time until we finally received their answer through official channels, though to call this diplomacy, is an absolute joke. It seems that they took our formal protest as some kind of proof of righteousness of their actions, as they spun a very aggressive rhetoric out of it with our formal protest flying right beside their ears completely.\n\nIn their reply they criticised our ambassador in Sofia of calling the ITRO a \"terrorist\" organisation, while in reality they are \"revolutionary\" freedom fighters, who fight against [ROOT.GetAdjective] opression of Bulgarians in the Thracia. Advisors in our government suggest that we withdraw our ambassador from Sofia until the storm calms down, as now the Bulgarians will no doubt double down on supporting the ITRO in the region, causing more headaches for us."

But this time, instead of the kind old man, it was none other than Madzharov himself who opened the door!\n\nUnbeknownst to our patrol, they had stumbled upon a high-ranking ITRO meeting, with several key leaders present.

 BUL_bozhurishte_grounds_desc: "The Bozhurishte Airfield near Sofia is the headquarters of the Bulgarian Air Force - however, it was built with an older generation of aircraft in mind. We must expand the landing strips and construct additional facilities to house even more aircraft as well as the maintenance staff."

 BUL_combined_arms_destruction: "Combined Arms Destruction"
 BUL_combined_arms_destruction_desc: "Our air doctrine must focus on the cooperation between the air fleet and ground forces - close air support planes can play the same role as artillery, except unabated by range nor speed, and the advance of infantry breakthroughs may soon only be possible with a sky defended by our fighter planes."

 BUL_naval_branch: "Conquest of the Two Seas"
 BUL_naval_branch_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw us consolidate our gains in the Aegean Sea, giving us an outlet to the ocean not reliant on Turkish whims in the Bosphorus, and though the sea was never the priority of the Bulgarian armed forces, we must take an advantage of this strategic position."

 BUL_submarines: "Post-Weltkrieg Submarine Tactics"
 BUL_submarines_desc: "Lacking the resources or funding to field a large surface field, we have to rely on submarines to harass and threaten enemy fleets from the safety of the depths. Our naval designers and admirals must focus on the adoption of new submarine tactics and the modernisation of our submarine fleet."

 BUL_battleship_modernisation: "\"Hrabar\" Modernisation Programme"
 BUL_battleship_modernisation_desc: "The battlecruiser \"Hrabar\", purchased from Germany in the 1920s, is the crown jewel of our modest surface fleet - but it is an old ship, and we must initiate plans to modernise it. Once again, the advances in ship design made in the West must be our guiding light."

 BUL_naval_defense: "Expand the Varna Port"
 BUL_naval_defense_desc: "Varna is the key port of the Bulgarian state, a shipping hub that allows us to export natural resources across the Black Sea and beyond. We must dedicate additional funding towards the expansion of dockyards and repair facilities in the port, all while laying down the groundwork for coastal fortifications to defend the city from amphibious assaults."

 BUL_the_great_etatist_project: "The Great Etatist Project"
 BUL_the_great_etatist_project_desc: "For too long, Bulgarian industry has atrophied, struggling to overcome the shellshock of the Weltkrieg. No more! With the aid of a plenum of Bulgaria's finest economists and engineers, we have drafted a plan for a great step forward, guided by the benevolent efforts of the State - and it is time we began implementing it!"

 BUL_mass_application_of_fertilizer: "Mass Proliferation of Fertilisers"
 BUL_mass_application_of_fertilizer_desc: "Bulgaria is a nation of peasants - therefore, the peasant needs to be immersed in our modernisation programme as much as the factory worker is. Our transformation of agriculture shall begin with the mass distribution of fertilisers and cheap credits for the purchase of tractors."

 BUL_national_radio: "National Rodno Radio Coverage"
 BUL_national_radio_desc: "Established in Sofia in 1930, Rodno Radio is the first large radio station in all of Bulgaria. In the modern-day, however, states can only prosper if they have full control of telecommunications and the media to give the right information and squash false rumours. We shall nationalise Rodno Radio, transform it to a state broadcaster, and expand its coverage to the whole country."

 BUL_cash_crops: "Cotton and Tobacco Farming"
 BUL_cash_crops_desc: "Cereals and edible crops, though vital to a nation, are not lucrative - and if we wish to have a strong agricultural sector that can finance industrialisation, we must transition some of our countryside towards cash crops. Cotton, tobacco, and other agricultural resources will be able to build up significant wealth."

 BUL_universities: "University Network Specialisation"
 BUL_universities_desc: "Though the University of Sofia is adequate for the needs of a smaller country, we need not just a general higher institution, but specialised universities for technicians, scientists and military officers, which will be able to grow our pool of educated intellectuals much faster and in directions we need it to."

 BUL_stoilov_industrialisation: "Second Stoilovite Industrialisation"
 BUL_stoilov_industrialisation_desc: "In his prime ministership, Konstantin Stoilov laid the foundations for industrialisation in Bulgaria, and dozens of companies still existing today were founded in his time. We need to capture the success of his era again and lay down the foundation for a second period of mass modernisation."

 BUL_ruse_industrial_centre: "Raise the Ruse Industrial Centre"
 BUL_ruse_industrial_centre_desc: "Ruse on the Danube River has been the industrial centre of Bulgaria for decades, and our victory in the Weltkrieg has rejuvenated the city, as we gained even greater control over the Danube at Romania's expense. We must establish new state-owned industries in the Ruse industrial region to capitalise on this."

 BUL_electricity_production: "Develop Production of Electricity"
 BUL_electricity_production_desc: "The twentieth century is an era of electric power - without safe access to electricity, we will never truly industrialise. To amend this, we shall dedicate resources to the construction of new hydroelectric and heat-based power plants across the country."

 BUL_textile_industry: "Subsidise the Textile Industry"
 BUL_textile_industry_desc: "The production of textile is an important sector of Bulgarian industry, though so far it has been limited to domestic consumption. With state funding for the modernisation of textile companies, import of new machines and expansion of facilities, we will be able to drastically increase output and even begin textile export."

 BUL_veshkovi_refinery: "Bratya Veshkovi Oil Refinery"
 BUL_veshkovi_refinery_desc: "In Ruse, the Veshkovi brothers established the first oil refinery in Bulgaria in 1933, although, as it was founded with their personal funds, it is small and nowhere near the output of modern Western refineries. The protection and care of the government will be able to ensure its growth, however."

 BUL_kremikovtsi: "Explore the Kremikovtsi Ore Deposits"
 BUL_kremikovtsi_desc: "Northeast of our capital, Sofia, lie large deposits of iron ore, even if its quality is rather mixed and iron mining there would endanger air and water health safety in the region. We should begin exploratory missions in the mountainous Kremikovtsi area and, if the situation allows it, establish extraction facilities."

 BUL_upgrade_berlin_baghdad: "Improve the Berlin-Basra Line"
 BUL_upgrade_berlin_baghdad_desc: "We are situated on the great Eastern express, going from Berlin to the coast of the Persian Gulf in Basra. It is our duty to maintain our part of the line and ensure that the flow of passengers and goods along this line only grows and grants us revenue."

 BUL_sub_balkan_line: "Construct the Sub-Balkan Line"
 BUL_sub_balkan_line_desc: "The Sub-Balkan line is envisioned as a branch from the Berlin-Basra Line and will connect Sofia with cities in the east - eventually leading to Burgas. This line will drastically increase traffic going from our industrial centres around the capital towards our main ports on the Black Sea, for both import and export needs."

 BUL_scenic_routes: "Scenic Narrow-Gauge Routes"
 BUL_scenic_routes_desc: "Mountains in Macedonia are untainted by man's touch and beautiful to traverse - a great attraction for tourists. Scenic routes snaking along these mountain ranges, built with narrow-gauge rail, can be an experience thousands of people across the world would pay for."

 BUL_southern_infrastructure: "Transition to the Southern Ports"
 BUL_southern_infrastructure_desc: "As useful as our ports on the Black Sea are, the everpresent possibility of trade flow across the Bosphorus being blocked forces us to search for alternate options. The state shall establish new ports in the south, on our Aegean coast - there, trade will not be choked by anyone."

 BUL_modernize_sofia: "The Muesmann Plan"
 BUL_modernize_sofia_desc: "Developed by German professor Adolf Muesmann, the Muesmann Plan is a vast project for the renewal of Sofia and its transformation into a modern capital city. It envisions a city designed with concentric zoning, divided into residential and industrial zones in the periphery and a central core banded by a ring boulevard. It will also allow Sofia to house over half a million people, with room for expansion!"
 BUL_muesmann_plan_tt: "§YSofia§! gains the modifier §YMuesmann Plan§!, which grants\n      $MODIFIER_STATE_PRODUCTION_SPEED_BUILDINGS_FACTOR$: §G+25%§!\n      $MODIFIER_LOCAL_BUILDING_SLOTS$: §G+3§!\n\n"
 BUL_rebuilt_sofia: "Muesmann Plan"

 BUL_summer_capital: "Develop the Summer Capital"
 BUL_summer_capital_desc: "Varna, our port on the Black Sea shores, is rapidly turning into a tourism hub, a so-called \"summer capital\". We can take advantage of this trend, expanding facilities in Varna, to draw hundreds of thousands of tourists for vacation to our shores."

 BUL_mass_urban_planning: "Mass Urbanisation Planning"
 BUL_mass_urban_planning_desc: "As our industrial base grows, more and more people are drawn to the cities - Sofia, Plovdiv, Ruse, Burgas, Varna and several others. Before we are struck with an overpopulation crisis, we should expand city infrastructure accordingly - renovate the water supply systems, build cheap housing in the suburbs and establish guest worker programmes."

 BUL_royal_dictatorship: "The Royal Dictatorship"
 BUL_royal_dictatorship_desc: "It is obvious to all of us that the Royal Family is the most benevolent and respectable force in Bulgarian politics of today. Therefore, to put an end to petty politicking, military plotting and revolutionary terrorism, all of the power must be bestowed solely to his persona."

 BUL_anti_partisanship: "Anti-Partisanship"
 BUL_anti_partisanship_desc: "Political parties are one of the main causes of our internal malaise. They only seek to enrich themselves and promote the interests of a fraction of the citizenry - the Tsar, meanwhile, has no nefarious interests and serves to all subjects by design. It will be much more effective to build a political system solely around him."

 BUL_anti_zveno_trials: "Trials of the Officer Conspiracy"
 BUL_anti_zveno_trials_desc: "The Military League has shown its face by throwing their lot with the Zveno conspiracy - therefore, this haven of disloyal generals and veterans shall be rooted out. We shall hold pompastic trials across the country and control the strings so Velchev and Georgiev are put where they belong - in prison."

 # Наредба-закон за запазване на моралната и материалната сила на войската
 BUL_moral_preservation_law: "Ordinance on Military Moral Preservation"
 BUL_moral_preservation_law_desc: "To prevent any further rebellion from the part of the military, we shall ensure civilian control over the army with an ordinance granting civilian institutions and courts further power in investigating officers as well as challenging them in court. New independent observers shall be established to keep track of all happenings in the military and secret cliques will be forcefully dissolved."

 BUL_discipline_subranie: "Discipline the Sŭbranie"
 BUL_discipline_subranie_desc: "The Sŭbranie, theoretically supposed to represent the people and the common interest, has been distracted by petty politicking and backstabbing. To ensure that they work for the interest of the people, not a chosen few, they need to be disciplined and their power needs to be curtailed."

 BUL_develop_class_solidarity: "Pursuit of Class Solidarity"
 BUL_develop_class_solidarity_desc: "While socialism does raise some good points regarding the needs of the common man, class warfare is not the way to accomplish this. Under the benevolent guidance of the Tsar, we shall create a society where all classes work in solidarity towards the common good."

 BUL_cult_of_the_tsar: "The Cult of the Tsar"
 BUL_cult_of_the_tsar_desc: "The Tsar and his royal family should be an example for all Bulgarians. Above all political squabbles, heroes of the Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg, who selflessly work for the good of the people, unlike their opponents - you cannot find a person or an organisation more fitting to rule. We shall encourage this cult of personality and instil a worship of the Tsar's persona in every home!"

 BUL_coopt_nationalist_right: "Co-opt the Nationalist Right"
 BUL_coopt_nationalist_right_desc: "Nationalist paramilitaries such as the Legions and Rodna Zashtita may be vehemently xenophobic and extremist, but they are loyal to the Tsardom nevertheless. Their youthful energy can be co-opted and wielded for the needs of the nation - with this goal in mind, we shall create an official youth organisation, named Brannik (\"Defender\")."

 BUL_promote_royal_patronage: "Promote Royal Patronage Societies"
 BUL_promote_royal_patronage_desc: "The Royal Family dedicates a lot of its time and resources to patronage - supporting societies and organisations such as soup kitchens, artist groups and the Bulgarian Red Cross. We shall promote these ventures, create a propaganda network centred around them, and let the people know that their monarch truly cares for them."

 BUL_state_corporatism: "State Corporatism"
 BUL_state_corporatism_desc: "Bulgarian prosperity can only be built via cooperation between business and state - we shall contract Bulgarian companies to work for public projects at a discount and start integrating them into the government. A loyal class of entrepreneurs working closely with government officials shall propel our nation forward!"

 BUL_royal_constitution: "The Tsar's Constitution"
 BUL_royal_constitution_desc: "Enough reforms have been implemented that limited electoralism can be restored across Bulgaria. There shall be no parties, of course, and the government of the Tsar will observe elections to ensure that only right and selfless people are elected to represent his subjects - but compared to the dictatorial goals of Zveno, it is a breath of fresh air, for sure."

 BUL_women_suffrage_tsar: "Promulgate Women's Suffrage"
 BUL_women_suffrage_tsar_desc: "There is no reason for women to not have the same rights as men when it comes to political action - and Boris has prided himself as a defender of women's suffrage for several years. Now that there are no obstacles to this reform, it can be safely implemented."

 BUL_nonpartisan_clique: "Expand the Non-Partisan Clique"
 BUL_nonpartisan_clique_desc: "Now that our control over Bulgaria has been consolidated, the non-partisan clique of politicians, officers and business representatives advising our Tsar can be expanded. Politicians from the opposition who have grown tired of never tasting power can return to our fold, and moderate Zvenari can be rehabilitated as well."

 BUL_political_rationalisation: "Political Rationalisation"
 BUL_political_rationalisation_desc: "Bulgaria has suffered greatly, decades of partocracy have driven it to ruin while the Tsar's sycophants threaten to suck the last juices out of its decayed carcass. It falls to us, the Zveno circle, to reinvigorate it. We shall transcend partisanship and the shackles of old, and create a new, powerful, rational Bulgarian state!"

 BUL_pars_not_toto: "Not Pars, But Toto"
 BUL_pars_not_toto_desc: "The word 'party' comes from the Latin word 'pars', meaning 'fraction' - and this lays a hint to their nature. They will never truly represent national interest, only a mere fraction which backs them in elections. We, the Zveno clique, are not so foolish. Whenever we act, we do so in the name of the entire nation!"

 BUL_state_labour_unions: "State-Controlled Labour Unions"
 BUL_state_labour_unions_desc: "Labour unions are an inherently divisive entity, forming rifts between classes in a period when the unity of all Bulgarians is mandatory. We shall eliminate this threat by establishing the Bulgarian Workers' Union and forcing all workers into this state-controlled organisation - which will be able to manage labour relations to our benefit."

 BUL_house_of_corporations: "The House of Corporations"
 BUL_house_of_corporations_desc: "Greatly popular in Zveno circles, corporatism is a perfect fit for their ideology - a system in which all social groups are integrated into an upper house where they can achieve a consensus in the name of national interest. As we have no need for the elected Sŭbranie, this shall be a fine replacement."

 BUL_ministry_of_national_economy: "The Ministry of National Economy"
 BUL_ministry_of_national_economy_desc: "Currently, several economic ministries manage economic affairs across our entire state, not to mention a plethora of directorates which are concerned with specific economic questions. This chaos and disorder shall end, and all of these institutions shall be consolidated into a single Ministry of National Economy."

 BUL_eliminate_parasitic_industry: "Eliminate Parasitic Industry"
 BUL_eliminate_parasitic_industry_desc: "Parasitic industry in Bulgarian jargon refers to industries and factories whose imports and exports are dominated by foreign goods - therefore they are a leech on Bulgarian society, employing our labour yet providing nothing for the local economy. This practice will be fought and economic autarky shall be established."

 BUL_agricultural_cooperative_bank: "Bulgarian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank"
 BUL_agricultural_cooperative_bank_desc: "The central banking system in Bulgaria could use some reform, and especially centralisation - we shall merge several state-owned banks into the Agricultural and Cooperative Bank, which shall place most banking operations in the country under the control of a single bureau and thus greatly enhance our control over the economy."

 BUL_general_directorate_of_renewal: "The Directorate of National Renewal"
 BUL_general_directorate_of_renewal_desc: "Bulgaria will not be saved via mere change of government - it can only be saved if it is renewed spiritually. The Directorate of National Renewal shall take up on this task, granted sweeping powers to control the media, direct cultural and intellectual life all for the good of Bulgaria."

 BUL_new_bulgarian_culture: "A New Bulgarian Culture"
 BUL_new_bulgarian_culture_desc: "The ultimate goal of the Directorate of National Renewal is to reconstruct Bulgarian culture for the modern era. To this goal, we shall foster obedience, loyalty, devotion to one's nation and the state, and determination. The new Bulgarian man shall be a loyal subordinate of a perfectly efficient technocratic machine!"

 BUL_monopolize_vices: "State Monopolies on the Sale of Vices"
 BUL_monopolize_vices_desc: "Vices such as alcohol, cigarettes and gambling are a threat to national integrity and to the positive labour of Bulgarian citizens. These vices shall be fought with state intervention - we shall impose monopolies on them and begin significantly curtailing their distribution, in the name of public morality."

 BUL_centralization_zveno: "Centralisation of the Political System"
 BUL_centralization_zveno_desc: "The political system must be transformed to an organ more powerful than ever before. New provinces shall be drawn, mayor elections will be abolished and replaced by central appointment, and the Constitution of Tarnovo will be officially abolished. And only we will tell what system shall replace it."

 BUL_leader_principle: "Order by the Leader Principle"
 BUL_leader_principle_desc: "The greatest weakness of democracy is that it lacks a figure to rally behind, while the Tsarist loyalists seek to rally the nation against an icon which should have stayed in the Middle Ages. No, a modern, efficient state needs a strong leader, one who will be able to command complete loyalty from his subordinates and guide Bulgaria to his will!"

 BUL_technocratic_hierarchy: "Construct Technocratic Hierarchy"
 BUL_technocratic_hierarchy_desc: "The old systems of patronage and democratic responsibility cannot effectively distribute resources anymore. No, we shall appoint ministers, governors and local officials upon their merit alone - we shall craft a system where only the most skilled and technically capable men assume posts of government."

 BUL_cessation_orchestra: "The Cessation of the Orchestra"
 BUL_cessation_orchestra_desc: "Years of reform are coming to an end. Today, it all shall culminate in one path or another - will Bulgaria maintain the Tsar on the throne, or will it abandon this ancient institution and become a Republic at last? No matter what, at least one member of the cabinet will end up purged in the end..."

 BUL_tarnovo_constitution: "Enshrine the Tarnovo Constitution"
 BUL_tarnovo_constitution_desc: "The Constitution of Tarnovo has defended the key principles of Bulgarian liberty for decades and we cannot give up on it now! Democracy must remain, and even though it has fallen to hard times, we can still reinvigorate it - and start a new era of liberty which will be brighter and more beautiful than the last!"

 BUL_military_trials: "Trials of the Conspirators"
 BUL_military_trials_desc: "While we were battling the forces of royal autocracy, the military took it upon themselves to plot our demise, planning a coup attempt which could have been an end to Bulgaria as we know it. Now that we have come out on top, it is time to put these potential traitors under the full prosecution of the law."

 BUL_legion_ban: "Dissolve the Legions"
 BUL_legion_ban_desc: "The Union of Bulgarian National Legions is one of the biggest threats to Bulgarian constitutionalism today - these radical veterans and imitators of other National Populists would topple democracy and establish tyranny if they were ever given the chance. We shall play it safe and ensure they can never grow to become a threat."

 BUL_ministry_of_veterans: "Ministry of Veteran Affairs"
 BUL_ministry_of_veterans_desc: "The official role of the Military League is to organise the veterans of Bulgaria's numerous wars - therefore, to depower them, we shall put this duty under the aegis of the central government. A new ministry shall oversee the distribution of veteran pensions, organisation and employment of the veterans, and closely observe the League and their sister paramilitaries."

 BUL_renew_political_trust: "Renew Political Trust"
 BUL_renew_political_trust_desc: "Decades of graft, corruption and political disarray have eroded the trust of the people in constitutionalism. As democracy cannot thrive in distrust, we shall fight it, making highly publicised crackdowns on minor corrupt officials and establishing an official modus vivendi of all parties in the Sŭbranie."

 BUL_privatize_state_trusts: "Privatise State-Owned Trusts"
 BUL_privatize_state_trusts_desc: "Previous governments, especially the Second Liberal Concentration, have moved more and more economic processes to state hands, earning the criticism of Bulgarian business. As democracy can only go hand in hand with the freedom of the market, we shall commence limited privatisation of state assets and begin scaling down our role in the economy."

 BUL_peace_with_the_tsar: "A Peace Branch to the Tsar"
 BUL_peace_with_the_tsar_desc: "Though we have won a battle against the Tsar in the political arena, this does not mean we should clash forever. The presence of a constitutional monarch is necessary to maintain the stability of a democratic state, therefore we shall negotiate with the Tsar and seek his official endorsement on policy questions, creating a system of cooperation."

 BUL_electoralism: "Safeguard Electoralism"
 BUL_electoralism_desc: "Prosperity and peace in a nation can only be achieved through a process of fair, equal elections, with a secret ballot. The Royalists seek to turn elections into a sham which approves the Tsar's appointees, Zveno does not value them at all - we, however, shall always protect this process and give the people choices."

 BUL_left_mandate: "Mandate of the Left"
 BUL_left_mandate_desc: "The election has been won by the Agrarians and the Broad Socialists, the \"People's Bloc\" which has briefly ruled Bulgaria in the past, though unsuccessfully. Their priorities differ, but they can agree that Bulgaria needs a responsible compassionate government which will provide welfare for the lowest rungs of society."

 BUL_right_mandate: "Mandate of the Right"
 BUL_right_mandate_desc: "The election has been won by the Democrats and National Liberals, restoring the status quo from before 1936, although in a more democratic form. Personal liberty, the rights for Bulgarian business, and maintaining the current political system are their primary concerns."

 BUL_cultural_autonomy: "The Question of Cultural Autonomy"
 BUL_cultural_autonomy_desc: "During the political battles of 1936, we received the support of Serbian, Romanian and Turkish minority politicians in the Sŭbranie, and now that we have successfully defended the Tarnovo Constitution, we shall have to make a decision on how we will pay back for this favour."

 BUL_interfaith_council: "National Interfaith Council"
 BUL_interfaith_council_desc: "Of our minorities, one of the largest ones, the Bulgarian Turks, follow Islam rather than Christianity, deepening the cultural and political division between them and the rest of Bulgaria. Some numbers of Albanian Catholics and Jews also reside in our country as well. To appease them, we shall establish a National Interfaith Council for dialogue with religious minorities."

 BUL_never_another_georgiev: "Never Another Georgiev"
 BUL_never_another_georgiev_desc: "Konstantin Georgiev's influence on the country has been tragic, but we have finally asserted the strength of the Constitution of Tarnovo, and of democratic governance. Never again shall Bulgaria slip towards tyranny - we shall consolidate our gains, amend the Constitution, and empower its democratic procedures."

 BUL_rural_development: "Rural Infrastructure Initiatives"
 BUL_rural_development_desc: "The Bulgarian countryside continues to struggle, many regions remain destitute, and the Black Monday Crisis has not given it any favours. We must dedicate investment to roads and irrigation in the countryside to improve the life of the poor average peasant!"

 BUL_progressive_taxation: "Implement Progressive Taxation"
 BUL_progressive_taxation_desc: "It is not fair that an impoverished peasant, a toiling worker and a wealthy businessman all pay the same portion of their salary to the treasury. The more well off must help those in need, and we shall make this state policy, implementing a system of progressive taxation."

 BUL_traditional_agrarianism: "Promote Traditional Agrarianism"
 BUL_traditional_agrarianism_desc: "As we progress to the modern era, we must never forget that human beings are naturally attached to the land, and prosper the most as individual landholders in the countryside. We must never forget to support agriculture with subsidies, beneficial policies and parliament acts."

 BUL_grain_trade_monopoly: "State Monopoly on Grain Trade"
 BUL_grain_trade_monopoly_desc: "To ensure that the Bulgarian peasantry have access to fair grain sales and purchases, instead of being ripped off by greedy salesmen, the state shall legislate a monopoly in this sector. All sale and purchase of grain in the country shall be controlled by state-owned corporations which will keep the interests of the peasantry in mind."

 BUL_protect_labor_rights: "Enforce Labour Rights Legislation"
 BUL_protect_labor_rights_desc: "We must not only expand labour rights in Bulgaria, reducing the daily working hours, promoting unionisation and limiting dangerous labour, but we must also establish a system which enforces this legislation. Audits and independent ombudsmen will crack down on offending businesses and ensure that the rights of labour truly are protected."

 BUL_state_production_monopolies: "Establish State Production Monopolies"
 BUL_state_production_monopolies_desc: "Certain sections of the economy are too dangerous for private businesses to control and must be placed under sole state supervision. State production monopolies will ensure that prices are kept low and the interests of the people are always kept in mind."

 BUL_free_trade_unions: "Empower the Free Trade Unions"
 BUL_free_trade_unions_desc: "The Free Trade Unions are the trade union organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, and represent the socialist side of legal organised labour in Bulgaria. We must empower this organisation by merging smaller trade unions into its aegis and prioritising its interests in business-union negotiations."

 BUL_renew_urban_centres: "Renew Urban Centres"
 BUL_renew_urban_centres_desc: "The urban populations of Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, Ruse and other cities are our arm of electoral support, hence we shall benefit them with additional funding. Urban centres shall be renewed and land clearances will allow cities to expand further into the countryside."

 BUL_right_to_wealth: "The Right to Wealth"
 BUL_right_to_wealth_desc: "Who are we to deny a thrifty, clever man the fruits of his labour? If he has established a business and built up sizeable wealth, then we can only endorse him and show him as an example, instead of taking that wealth away. After all, it is the businessman who creates jobs and employs those down-trodden."

 BUL_women_suffrage_dem: "Guarantee Women Rights"
 BUL_women_suffrage_dem_desc: "We, Democrats and other liberal parties, have consistently stood for the rights of the people since our exception - including the rights of women, which we have championed harder than most. It is time we make our promises reality, grant women the right to vote and make them equal with men!"

 BUL_political_opportunism: "Political Opportunism"
 BUL_political_opportunism_desc: "Doctrinaire politics can only take you so far. Ideologies will fail you in political practice, where everything is far more grey and complicated than on the drawing board in college. The Democrats and National Liberals are proudly opportunistic, clever enough to adapt to changing political conditions and guide Bulgaria in these trying times."

 BUL_liberal_nationalism: "Pursue Liberal Nationalism"
 BUL_liberal_nationalism_desc: "Nationalism and liberalism are not incompatible. As we reform Bulgaria into a true constitutional monarchy, we can instil pride in these liberal institutions and rally the people to guard them. The ideal of liberty is stronger in motivating people than mere loyalty to the Tsar or to the state, after all."

 BUL_directorial_governance: "Directorate Economic Management"
 BUL_directorial_governance_desc: "State-controlled directorates have increasingly become a part of the Bulgarian economy, and the Tsardom has become increasingly statist. This is not an issue - state directorates can manage the economy according to the needs of the government, and also offer numerous positions to appoint loyal cadres in."

 BUL_renew_partisanstvo: "Renew the Partisanstvo System"
 BUL_renew_partisanstvo_desc: "The Partisanstvo is a name generally used to described the clientelism of Bulgarian politics before the Weltkrieg, when parties were merely vehicles to put loyal allies in government jobs and lacked real ideology. While we should not say this out loud, is there really harm in renewing such a system?"

 BUL_faith_and_nation: "Faith and Nation"
 BUL_faith_and_nation_desc: "The endorsement of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church will aid us greatly in securing further electoral victories. As the leading conservative political force in the country, we already have numerous allies among the Bulgarian priesthood, and expanding our contacts will get religious officials to rally thousands of voters for us."

 BUL_young_officers: "Tyranny of the Young Officers"
 BUL_young_officers_desc: "When the Fourth Balkan War came, we fought bravely - but our forces in the front were betrayed by petty politicking and treason back home. When we should have fought without surrender, we raised the white banner. We, the Legionnaires, the bastion of Bulgarianness, will amend this historical mistake and repudiate the National Catastrophe at once!"

 BUL_macedonia_intervention: "Repudiate the Catastrophe!"
 BUL_macedonia_intervention_desc: "There is an easy solution to the National Catastrophe. Our experience of the Fourth Balkan War has shown that we were never truly beaten on the battlefield, merely stabbed in the back in their hour of need. Having recovered, rebuilt, and now led by a truly national and patriotic regime, we Bulgarians shall rise again, and claim what is ours!"
 BUL_macedonia_intervention_tt: "If the IMRO is defeated in Macedonia and we have yet to complete this focus, our regime will §Rcollapse§!!"

 BUL_legionary_revolution: "The Legionary Revolution"
 BUL_legionary_revolution_desc: "The era of incremental change and needless squabbling in the parliament is over. We Legionaries shall sweep away the old political system from its roots, our Revolution shall bring a just, fair and truly national society. Our regime shall be one of energy, strength, and raw terror!"

 BUL_nationalize_basic_industries: "Nationalise the Basic Industries"
 BUL_nationalize_basic_industries_desc: "Capitalists are only barely better than Syndicalists - these blood-sucking parasites siphon the wealth of the people and send it overseas. There is no reason why the basic industries - consumer goods production and the arms industry - should not be in our hands instead."

 BUL_green_terror: "Green Terror"
 BUL_green_terror_desc: "Weakness and pacifism are still rooted in Bulgaria. Our people were shaken by the National Catastrophe and cannot muster the will to sacrifice themselves for the national cause again. Through terror, arrests and summary executions, we shall make them fear, and so make them toe the line."

 BUL_primitive_resource_accumulation: "Primitive Resource Accumulation"
 BUL_primitive_resource_accumulation_desc: "Rearmament for our war against the Belgrade Pact will be costly - and what do you know, there is a lot of money residing in the pockets of our people. It is a primitive method of gathering funding for arms, but it is better than nothing - and we will pay back when we restore Greater Bulgaria, surely."

 BUL_unleash_bulgarianness: "Unleash the Bulgarian Spirit"
 BUL_unleash_bulgarianness_desc: "There is an inherent spirit of Bulgarianness residing in every one of our kind. It yearns to fight, to serve its nation, and to advance our cause no matter the cost. Whether by propaganda or via brute application of force, we shall channel this Bulgarian spirit into action."

 BUL_society_ceaseless_war: "The Ceaseless War of Society"
 BUL_society_ceaseless_war_desc: "Society is a ceaseless war - and yet the absolute majority of people, held back by laziness, age, habit or poverty, struggle to participate. Those warriors who fight for the advancement of Bulgarianness in all sections of society - art, culture, industry, politics - shall serve as their national vanguard, their unquestioned leaders, and they are the Legionnaires."

 BUL_categories_of_communists: "Four Categories of Syndicalists"
 BUL_categories_of_communists_desc: "There are four categories of Syndicalists - manufacturers of Syndicalism, the capitalists; provocateurs, foreign agents; fools who inadvertently aid Syndicalists; and rubber-heads who don't believe in truth, God and Bulgaria, and so support Syndicalism. All of them must be rooted out from Bulgaria."

 BUL_ideals_of_the_steppe: "Ideals of the Steppe"
 BUL_ideals_of_the_steppe_desc: "We Bulgarians are the heirs of a powerful steppe civilisation which once bent the Eastern Roman Empire to its knees. The vigour of Asparuh and his descendants still courses through our veins - and we shall glorify this history, inspiring entire armies to march to war and defend the glory of Bulgaria!"

 BUL_abolish_monarchy: "Expel the German Monarchs"
 BUL_abolish_monarchy_desc: "The House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has never truly been Bulgarian - they are German monarchs, imposed upon us by the foreign powers. Holding absolute power in the country, we can finally take the final step, and make the removal of the Monarchy official. The National Legionary State shall be ruled only by Bulgarians!"

 BUL_tsar_kyril: "A Silent Puppet on the Throne"
 BUL_tsar_kyril_desc: "Much of our organisation is still monarchist at the core, and cannot imagine a Bulgaria without a Tsar at the helm. Though Boris is too independent for our tastes, his brother Kyril, a bohemian prince with little agency in the political scene, can be a puppet we can easily control, while still appeasing the monarchists."

 BUL_mass_remilitarization: "Mass Remilitarisation"
 BUL_mass_remilitarization_desc: "We are a movement of the masses, and the masses demand blood! In one swift stroke, we shall rearm Bulgaria, converting any available resources to war production and shifting our industries to a full wartime capacity."

 BUL_paramilitary_units: "Raise Paramilitary Formations"
 BUL_paramilitary_units_desc: "Thousands of Bulgarians, veterans of the Weltkrieg and the Balkan Wars, organise into paramilitaries where they are able to apply their experience of war in street fights and protection. The Legions have maintained contacts with these paramilitaries for its entire existence. It is time to turn them into field divisions and send them to the front!"

 BUL_macedonian_refugees: "Arm Macedonian Volunteer Battalions"
 BUL_macedonian_refugees_desc: "The occupation of Macedonia has pushed thousands of its Bulgarian inhabitants eastwards, as they would rather die than live under Serbian oppression. Now, after equipping them with weapons and giving them basic combat training, we can send them back, to reclaim their homes."

 BUL_front_republic: "Declaration of the Bulgarian Republic"
 BUL_front_republic_desc: "The Tsar has fallen! An era of tyrannical monarchy is over! From the underground, from the exile, the Fatherland Front rises, and proclaims a new future for the Bulgarian people! From here onward, Bulgaria is the newest Republic on the Balkans, and it shall last for centuries!"

 BUL_orange_guard_coup: "Orange Guard Counter-Coup"
 BUL_orange_guard_coup_desc: "The Agrarian National Union joined forces with the Bulgarian socialist movement to overthrow the Tsar - however, they have no interest in playing second fiddle. Having restored its paramilitary organisation, the Orange Guard, the BZNS can sweep away its rivals on the left and seize complete power."

 BUL_reunite_party: "Reunite the Agrarian National Union"
 BUL_reunite_party_desc: "During the post-Weltkrieg period, the Agrarians fractured, divided between factions that accepted the political order and those who continued the fight in the underground. Now that we are in charge, and under Stamboliyski himself, we can begin the process of reintegrating these factions into one, greater Union."

 BUL_implement_populist_policies: "Implement Populist Policies"
 BUL_implement_populist_policies_desc: "Our leader, Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, is the tribune of the people, and the Fatherland Front once fought for the people, too, and so, what the people want, we shall provide. Thankfully, the average masses are quite simple folk, and so we do not have to put in that much effort before they are satisfied."

 BUL_city_sodomy: "Away From City Sodomy"
 BUL_city_sodomy_desc: "Corruption and evil fester in the cities of Bulgaria and their Westernised elite, much like Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible. A responsible, clean government can only be founded upon the backs of the peasantry. It is the peasant who creates the wealth of the Bulgarian nation, not the bourgeois or the cosmopolitan in the streets of Sofia."

 BUL_overthrow_royal_memorials: "Throw Out Royal Memorials"
 BUL_overthrow_royal_memorials_desc: "We shall make the victory of the Republic of the Peasants official, by abandoning all remaining royal memorabilia. Memorials will be removed, statues will be torn down, streets will be renamed and national symbols will be replaced. When this is done, the Tsardom may finally be forgotten."

 BUL_officialize_orange_guard: "Officialise the Orange Guard"
 BUL_officialize_orange_guard_desc: "The Orange Guard has served the Agrarian National Union well, battling its rivals and ensuring security in congresses of the Party. If we wish to consolidate our control in the country, however, we must turn them into the official paramilitary of the Republic."

 BUL_perfect_democracy: "Perfect Democracy"
 BUL_perfect_democracy_desc: "The National Assembly and all the other institutions of democracy shall be restored. However, to ensure that the Republic survives and adequately represents the people who build its wealth - the peasantry - democratic processes will be curtailed and the Agrarian National Union shall continue to dominate the country, permanently."

 BUL_organise_youth: "Organise the Bulgarian Youth"
 BUL_organise_youth_desc: "The Bulgarian youth are our country's future. We shall get them ready to build our future by establishing youth organisations and recruiting the Bulgarian youth for volunteer labour in the countryside. There, aiding the peasantry, they will learn hard lessons in life and prepare themselves for what life will give them."

 BUL_mass_volunteer_work: "Mass Pressed Labour Actions"
 BUL_mass_volunteer_work_desc: "An agrarian state must not abandon modernity. We shall transform Bulgaria into a strong modern state by pressing thousands of people to labour actions. They shall construct roads, drain swamps and dig canals alike, laying the foundations for a new Bulgaria."

 BUL_left_pivot: "Pivot to the Left"
 BUL_left_pivot_desc: "Though the Fatherland Front has vanquished the monarchy, it remains challenged by the right, as Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski and his lackeys prepare to subvert the revolution and establish their \"peasant state\". By purging them from the front, we can defend the achievements of our revolution and steer Bulgaria towards socialism!"

 BUL_agrarian_syndicalism: "Agrarian Syndicalism"
 BUL_agrarian_syndicalism_desc: "Who dares to say that Syndicalism can only be accomplished in cities, among industrial workers? There is a revolutionary fire burning in every poor peasant, a dream of liberty and communal freedom, which we shall express! Those who work the land can follow Syndicalist principles of union supremacy and liberty just as well as their proletarian brothers!"

 BUL_land_socialization: "Socialisation of the Land"
 BUL_land_socialization_desc: "This land is our land. We shall begin to steer away from private land ownership and turn all land into property owned by the people. We shall encourage communes of peasantry which work common land and prosper with each other's effort, rather than working small plots individually."

 BUL_agrarian_professional_unions: "Form Agricultural Professional Unions"
 BUL_agrarian_professional_unions_desc: "We shall transform Vlasovden into a union congress uniting all agricultural workers, and establish trade unions for all agricultural professions. These unions shall be empowered to manage administrative issues in their respective field - the farmers' union shall deal with crop agriculture and the herders' union shall deal with animal husbandry, and so on."

 BUL_federation_of_rural_communes: "A Federation of Rural Communes"
 BUL_federation_of_rural_communes_desc: "Central government is the root of many evils in modern society - Bulgaria shall instead seek the liberty of local governance. It will be transformed into a federation of rural communes, and these communes will manage administrative issues in their region. A federal congress of communal representatives will replace the dilapidated Sŭbranie."

 BUL_french_practices: "Replicate French Institutions"
 BUL_french_practices_desc: "Though the Commune of France is based upon industrial unions, their experience in creating a practical Syndicalist state will be invaluable. We shall replicate the BGT, popular militias and the Federal Army of the Commune, among other institutions. This way, we shall further the cause of Syndicalism in the Balkans!"

 BUL_collective_economy: "Communal Economic Organisation"
 BUL_collective_economy_desc: "We must abandon the bourgeois concepts of profit-making and exploitation. The new Bulgaria shall place one's labour as the only source of value, and hand the control of economic processes to the local communes. Vouchers shall replace bourgeois currencies, though they will be adapted to use for exchange and foreign trade, and businesses shall be returned to their workers."

 BUL_mutual_assistance_organisations: "Mutual Assistance Organisations"
 BUL_mutual_assistance_organisations_desc: "Those who are less able and experienced must be taught by their more capable peers. Every commune in Syndicalist Bulgaria shall establish organisations of mutual existence where agricultural expertise and practical knowledge shall be taught and shared."

 BUL_revolutionary_spirit: "Revolutionary Spirit of the Poor Peasantry"
 BUL_revolutionary_spirit_desc: "Since times immemorial, the Bulgarian peasantry has possessed a revolutionary spirit. Ivaylo, the Tsar of the Peasants, rose to power on their backs, and the Turkish yoke was overthrown by the resistance of the common folk. This spirit shall be rejuvenated, and the Bulgarian peasantry prepare to export their revolutionary vigour abroad!"

 BUL_village_militias: "Village Worker Militias"
 BUL_village_militias_desc: "All communes in Syndicalist Bulgaria shall establish militias, and all peasantry will be trained to use weapons. In the case of foreign invasion, these militias will be our last line of defence, making the occupation of our plains and mountains hell for any tyrant."

 BUL_empower_zpk: "All Power to the ZPK Union Congress"
 BUL_empower_zpk_desc: "The Union Congress of the Vlasovden Agricultural Confederation shall be vested with supreme power in the country. Composed of representatives from the agricultural workers and rural communes, it shall be a democratic institution which will safeguard the accomplishments of the Bulgarian Revolution."

 BUL_socialist_orthodoxy: "Guarantee Socialist Orthodoxy"
 BUL_socialist_orthodoxy_desc: "We, the \"Narrow Socialists\", have stood for the orthodox interpretation of socialism as laid down by Karl Marx and his successors. Syndicalism will not work in an agrarian nation such as Bulgaria - the ideas of Lenin, seeking to implement the revolution in a state as backwards as Russia, will be more helpful when we see to chart our path."

 BUL_minority_integration: "Minority Political Integration"
 BUL_minority_integration_desc: "The Bulgarian Turks, Jews, Serbs and other minorities have been suppressed by the previous bourgeois regimes for generations. It is time we put an end to these horrid practices and integrate Bulgaria's minorities into the political system, granting them positions in government and establishing peace with our fellow proletarians."

 BUL_integrate_ikonomov: "Integrate the Anarchist Chetas"
 BUL_integrate_ikonomov_desc: "Anarchist-Communist chetas, operated by men such as Vasil Ikonomov, have fought against the previous monarchist regime for years before the Revolution. In decades of resistance, they have turned... radical, but they nevertheless form an important armed contingent which can help consolidate our fragile rule in Bulgaria."

 BUL_fatherland_front_vanguard: "Consolidate the Fatherland Front"
 BUL_fatherland_front_vanguard_desc: "We must transform the Fatherland Front from a loose alliance of factions opposed to the monarchy to a more official institution. We shall integrate our fellow republicans into a grand political bloc - led by the Narrow Socialists, of course, as they are the revolutionary vanguard."

 BUL_modernization_priority: "Drive for Industrial Modernity"
 BUL_modernization_priority_desc: "An agrarian state must become a modern, industrial state with a large proletariat before it can advance into socialism. We shall accomplish just that. Our regime will be one which drags Bulgaria into the modern era by force, turning millions of peasants into factory workers!"

 BUL_anti_clericalism: "Escalate the Anti-Clerical Struggle"
 BUL_anti_clericalism_desc: "The Orthodox Church is an enemy of the socialist revolution, opportunistically endorsing the Monarchist regime and agitating against our revolutionary government. We shall begin curtailing the Orthodox Church, removing opposition priests and putting in loyal puppets, while starting a mass atheisation campaign to root out this superstition."

 BUL_agricultural_collectives: "Establish Collective Farms"
 BUL_agricultural_collectives_desc: "To ensure that the countryside is loyal to the socialist cause and provides the industrialising cities with sufficient foodstuffs, we shall replace individual land ownership with state-controlled collectives. These collectives will ensure the loyalty of the peasantry and make sure that the supply of produce is always secure."

 BUL_brigade_movement: "The \"Build for the Motherland\" Movement"
 BUL_brigade_movement_desc: "We need manpower to create Bulgaria's industrial future. We shall organise masses of volunteers, especially from the Bulgarian youth, to work for the nation and for the Revolution in the countryside.

 BUL_socialist_realism: "Revolutionary Art"
 BUL_socialist_realism_desc: "A socialist state has no need for bourgeois culture and the arts.

We shall organise the artists and writers of Bulgaria to dedicate their works to the Revolution and to a bright socialist tomorrow!"

 BUL_ds_establishment: "Establish the Durzhavna Sigurnost"
 BUL_ds_establishment_desc: "The Committee of State Security shall be the hammer which we shall use when all other tools fail. Sometimes, the Revolution can only be defended with an application of force - and we shall not hesitate to use it if the Revolution is on the line."

 BUL_dimitrov_constitution: "The Dimitrov Constitution"
 BUL_dimitrov_constitution_desc: "To turn our goal for Bulgaria official, we shall organise a new Constitutional Convention which shall replace the old, tsarist Tarnovo Constitution with a much more progressive document. Named after the First Secretary and President of Bulgaria, it shall establish the People's Republic of Bulgaria for good!"

 BUL_balkan_war_victory: "Hegemon of the Balkans"
 BUL_balkan_war_victory_desc: "Though challenged by our rivals across the Balkans, we once again stand victorious. Bulgaria's darkest hour has been averted, and its hegemony has been entrenched. A second victory against the Serbs, Romanians and Greeks will certainly ensure that they will never have the power to challenge us again - so we can feast, knowing that the Balkans are forever Bulgarian!"

 BUL_war_reparations_investment_fund: "War Reparations Investment Fund"
 BUL_war_reparations_investment_fund_desc: "Having defeated our enemies in the Balkan War, we are now entitled to massive sums in war reparations - however, without careful management and investment, they are likely to be squandered. We shall prevent that by creating a state-owned fund which will collect reparations revenues and create plans for investing them in our economy."

 BUL_ploesti_oil: "Enforce the Ploesti Oil Lease"
 BUL_ploesti_oil_desc: "The large oil reserves in Romania are an important strategic resource, and the Romanians took advantage of Germany's moment of weakness to throw away all of their duties to the Empire regarding oil production. Now that they are under the control of our puppet regime, we can seize control of Ploesti oil for ourselves."

 BUL_danube_commission: "Renew the Danube Mouth Commission"
 BUL_danube_commission_desc: "The Treaty of Bucharest posited the creation of a Commission on the Mouth of the Danube to regulate trade over the river, however, its power waned in the '30s thanks to Romanian interference. Now, we can safely renew it and reap the benefits of controlling trade over the Danube River."

 BUL_transfer_military_factories: "Transfer Military Factories"
 BUL_transfer_military_factories_desc: "To ensure that our Balkan neighbours are never a threat to us again, we shall enforce demilitarisation protocols upon them - arms-producing machinery and even entire factories will be transferred to Bulgaria and placed under our state control."

 BUL_seize_greek_fleet: "Seize the Greek Fleet"
 BUL_seize_greek_fleet_desc: "Defeated by us and turned into a pliable puppet, the Greek state no longer needs a fleet, while we could certainly use an expansion to our navy. We shall seize ships from the Greek navy, repaint them and rename them, and put them to use for our needs."
 BUL_seize_greek_fleet_tt: "Ships once controlled by the Greeks will be §Hseized§! and repurposed. This includes: 8 £GFX_ship_destroyer_icon_small §HDestroyers§! and 4 £GFX_ship_submarine_icon_small §HSubmarines§!."

 BUL_seize_thrace: "Descend Upon Western Thrace"
 BUL_seize_thrace_desc: "The treasonous Ottoman Empire stabbed us in the back in the Fourth Balkan War! Now, hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians languish in territories they have illegally occupied. The Turks must have bet on the hope that we will be crushed by the Pact and not rise to challenge them again - however, this did not come to pass. Rearmed and victorious, we shall return with a vengeance!"

 BUL_renew_pride: "Renew Pride"
 BUL_renew_pride_desc: "Another war against our neighbours is what we needed to convince our population that we must always stay vigilant. Greater Bulgaria should not be taken for granted, blood and sweat will need to be spent to defend it, and having recognised this fact of life, our people are more united than ever."

 BUL_integrate_territories: "Finish Integration of Border Territories"
 BUL_integrate_territories_desc: "With the defeat of the Serbs, Greeks and Romanians, the separatist resistance in our border regions has lost their benefactors and are thus swiftly losing support. This is the opportunity we need to finally integrate them into our state and leave resistance in these regions as no more than history."

 BUL_international_alliances: "Our Place in Europe"
 BUL_international_alliances_desc: "During the interwar period, Bulgaria grew distant from affairs in Europe, expecting to rely on German hegemony to keep the peace for generations. This hegemony is being challenged, however, and we once again have to make a choice - which side of the struggle we are on, who shall we join forces with in the Second Weltkrieg?"

 BUL_hijack_yugoslavism: "Hijack Yugoslavism"
 BUL_hijack_yugoslavism_desc: "Ever since the decisive defeat of Serbia in 1918, their role as the unifier of the South Slavs has been floundering, and now it has been crushed for good. Meanwhile, we Bulgarians have dominated the Balkans since then, and stand as the only free South Slavic state in existence. Many Zveno officers believe that it is our turn to seize the torch..."

 BUL_operation_march_drina: "Operacija: Simeon Veliki"
 BUL_operation_march_drina_desc: "Our South Slav brothers languish under Habsburg rule, and we have a duty of liberating them.

 BUL_state_mobilization: "All for the Final Struggle"
 BUL_state_mobilization_desc: "The final struggle against the Austrian Empire will require a full mobilisation of all of Bulgaria's assets. The state shall be militarised and new industries will be opened which shall solely produce armaments for the Bulgarian Army."

 BUL_montenegrin_identity: "Promote Montenegrin Identity"
 BUL_montenegrin_identity_desc: "Montenegro was integrated into Serbia and the Serbian government pursued a policy of Serbianisation in the state, seeking to erase the local Montenegrin identity and replace it with Serbdom. This shall be reversed and we shall make considerable concessions to Montenegrin intellectuals - in exchange for their support to the Yugoslav project."

 BUL_transylvanian_claims: "Endorse Romanian Claims on Transylvania"
 BUL_transylvanian_claims_desc: "Our puppet state in Bucharest may struggle to find legitimacy, but nationalist Romanians in Transylvania would still rather live in a nominally independent Romania than be Hungarianised. We shall endorse the designs of the Romanian government to claim Transylvania and prepare a Romanian uprising there when the time comes."

 BUL_attract_illyrian_yugoslavists: "Attract Illyrian Yugoslavists"
 BUL_attract_illyrian_yugoslavists_desc: "Though their numbers are shrinking constantly, supporters of Yugoslav unity still persist among the Croatian intellectual community. Let us sway them to our ranks and contact resistance cells in Illyrian territory which would be able to support us when the time comes."

 BUL_army_supremacy: "Supremacy of the Army Vanguard"
 BUL_army_supremacy_desc: "Much like Italy was unified by Piedmontian military might and Germany was unified by Prussian military might, the Prussia of the Balkans will unify the South Slavs on its own merits. The interests and concerns of the Bulgarian Army must be at the top of our list."

 BUL_national_liberation_war: "The War of National Liberation"
 BUL_national_liberation_war_desc: "The Austrian Empire is a prison of nations - inside it, the Germans and the Hungarians lord over Slav nationalities and force them to bow. As we strike the Habsburg lands, we must not forget this, and spread propaganda that we are coming to liberate all of the minorities in the Empire!"

 BUL_avoid_pretenses: "Avoid Impossible Pretenses"
 BUL_avoid_pretenses_desc: "Any pretence of us toppling the Austro-Hungarian Empire is exactly that - an impossible pretence. Our goal should be to claim the lands inhabited by the South Slavs, we should not entangle ourselves in endeavours of national liberation. How can we even reach Bohemia or Galicia, anyway?"

 BUL_YUG_hej_sloveni: "Hej, Sloveni!"
 BUL_YUG_hej_sloveni_desc: "Though not under the champion which most Yugoslavists were expecting, the union of all South Slavs has finally been established. A golden age for all Yugoslav people begins — and especially for the Bulgarian \"tribe\" among them, more equal than others. It is only fair that we continue to dominate - after all, we are the new Piedmont of the South Slavs..."

 BUL_YUG_integral_yugoslavism: "Embrace Integral Yugoslavism"
 BUL_YUG_integral_yugoslavism_desc: "Integral Yugoslavism is a theory that calls for a Yugoslav state to be forcefully centralised so the differences between the different groups of Yugoslavs, created by historical separation, swiftly vanish. It will be a useful guide for our new state - especially as we will be the ones to define what is Yugoslav and what is not."

 BUL_YUG_curtail_catholic_church: "Curtail the Croatian Catholic Church"
 BUL_YUG_curtail_catholic_church_desc: "While the Serbs are Orthodox just like Bulgarians, the Croats and Slovenes are Catholics, and the Croatian Catholic Church has already begun to position itself as an opponent to our integrationist ambitions. We shall treat them the same as we treat all of our enemies - root out and suppress with extreme efficiency."

 BUL_YUG_decrees_of_settlement: "Adopt the Decrees of Settlement"
 BUL_YUG_decrees_of_settlement_desc: "The Kingdom of Serbia employed several Decrees of Settlement to integrate the territories they annexed off the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria in the south. We shall study their experience and employ similar strategies to hasten the integration of newly annexed Illyrian lands."

 BUL_YUG_yugoslav_language: "Standardise the Yugoslav Language"
 BUL_YUG_yugoslav_language_desc: "A unified Yugoslav nation requires a unified language - though the languages of the South Slavs are similar, they have drifted apart over centuries. The Bulgarian language shall serve as a fine blueprint for a unified Yugoslav language, and we shall impose it upon our fellow South Slavs with no remorse. The Cyrillic script shall also become the official script of Yugoslavia."

 BUL_YUG_integrate_railways: "Integrate the Railways"
 BUL_YUG_integrate_railways_desc: "Before we can begin integrating our northern acquisitions, we have to connect them to the capital of the Union. Our borders no longer coincide with the main railroad tracks of the Habsburg empire, cities once connected to Vienna or Budapest must be reconnected to a Yugoslav rail network, and the Austrian policy of limiting inter-communication between South Slavic regions must be reversed."

 BUL_YUG_illyrian_resources: "Directorate of New Resource Management"
 BUL_YUG_illyrian_resources_desc: "Having conquered and liberated the Habsburg half of Yugoslavia, we have now gained possession of Illyria's vast natural and industrial resources.

 BUL_YUG_abolish_legal_codes_desc: "In pursuit of integration and centralisation, we must replace the old legal codes and administrative systems imposed by the Habsburgs, as well as the ones used by the Serbs, throw out or retrain judges and bureaucrats to follow a new Yugoslav legal code. Tradition and old practices will be lost, but the other South Slavs will eventually adapt."

 BUL_YUG_national_myth_construction: "National Myth Construction"
 BUL_YUG_national_myth_construction_desc: "Serb, Croat, Slovene, and Bulgarian national myths must become parts of one Yugoslav national myth. It wasn't just the Bulgars who formed Simeon's great empire - they fought in the name of all Yugoslavs. Though we have fought amongst ourselves and were briefly deluded by radicals such as Young Bosnia, the vision of the Zvenari has eventually brought us here."

 BUL_YUG_conscription_system: "Reform the Conscription System"
 BUL_YUG_conscription_system_desc: "As the integration of Yugoslavia continues, we need to extract more and more recruits from the former Habsburg provinces - let us reform the conscription system with this goal in mind.

 BUL_YUG_greater_ambitions: "Ambitions of a Great Power"
 BUL_YUG_greater_ambitions_desc: "Stretching from Ljubljana to Burgas, the greater Yugoslavia encompasses much of the Balkans and cannot be missed on a map of Europe.

 BUL_YUG_attack_ottomans: "Extinguish the Decaying Empire"
 BUL_YUG_attack_ottomans_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is a relic of centuries past, and a reminder of the yoke which the Yugoslavs suffered for many years before finally our liberation struggle.

 BUL_YUG_balkan_neighbourhood: "Establish the Yugosphere"
 BUL_YUG_balkan_neighbourhood_desc: "Yugoslavia is surrounded by small, weak Balkan states which do not deserve to stay independent. Our hegemony shall stretch across the entire Balkan peninsula, no matter the means we need to use to enforce it."

 BUL_third_empire: "The Third Bulgarian Empire"
 BUL_third_empire_desc: "The most glorious conquest since the era of Simeon the Great has been bestowed upon us. Under the brilliant leadership of Tsar Ferdinand, we have shocked all of Europe with our impeccable victory - and so, now, even the City of the World's Desire is in our hands, and the straits of Bosphorus wash the coasts of Bulgaria. Today, we are rightfully, truly, an Empire again."

 BUL_construct_hegemony: "Construct the Balkan Hegemony"
 BUL_construct_hegemony_desc: "Having established our unquestioned dominance in the Balkans, we can start isolating ourselves from European affairs and gather our satellite states around a new Bulgarian hegemony. Though still small, we have great ambitions, and the Hegemony shall see them pass."

 BUL_put_down_ottomans: "Finish the Empire Off"
 BUL_put_down_ottomans_desc: "Having lost its capital, the Ottoman Empire is like a man without a head - it has no reason to remain alive. It is time we finish off this stain in the world's history, and avenge centuries of Turkish yoke with a yoke of our own!"

 BUL_victory_arches_desc: "A true Empire requires monumental architecture, and Tsar Ferdinand shall provide. Massive victory arches shall be built in the Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard, where the names of all Bulgarian heroes will be engraved - this monument shall serve as a permanent reminder to the people of Bulgaria that they are citizens of a glorious nation"

 BUL_patriarchate: "Restore the Bulgarian Patriarchate"
 BUL_patriarchate_desc: "Once an autocephalous Patriarchate, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate after the Ottoman conquest, and since then we have never been able to overcome this stain to our honour. With the conquest of Constantinople, there is no challenge to a Patriarchate restoration - and we shall gain the favour of the Church by forcing it."

 BUL_ferdinand_cult: "The Second Simeon Veliki"
 BUL_ferdinand_cult_desc: "The conquest of Constantinople has propelled the cult of the Tsar to new heights. We shall wield this cult of personality and turn it into a pillar of our regime. Every town hall, school and home will carry a portrait of our glorious Tsar - the greatest ruler which Bulgaria has had since Simeon the Great!"

 BUL_restore_hagia_sophia: "Restore the Hagia Sophia to the Faithful"
 BUL_restore_hagia_sophia_desc: "After the conquest of Constantinople, the Ottomans transformed the Hagia Sophia from an Orthodox church to a mosque - a disgrace to our faith. We shall demolish the minarets built into the Hagia Sophia and return it to the Orthodox faithful!"

 BUL_byzantine_legacy_claim: "Our Claim to Imperial Legacy"
 BUL_byzantine_legacy_claim_desc: "The First Rome fell. The Second Rome fell. The Third Rome fell, and then abandoned its monarchs. It falls to us, the Bulgarians, who have claimed the mantle of 'Emperor of the Romans' for centuries, to continue this legacy. Our empire may be small on a map, but our people shall fight tooth and nail to defend it."

 BUL_thrace_integration: "Initiate the Integration of Thrace"
 BUL_thrace_integration_desc: "The region of Thrace is historically Bulgarian land, and thousands of Thracian Bulgarians were expelled from it after 1913. This brutal policy shall be reversed - we shall restore the Thracian Bulgarians and their descendants back to their homes, and begin the integration of Adrianople."

 BUL_renew_1904_treaties: "Renew the Treaties of 1904"
 BUL_renew_1904_treaties_desc: "The secret Treaties of 1904 intended to resolve the conflict between Serbia and Bulgaria and establish a healthy degree of economic integration between them, such as the creation of a customs union and uniting the telegraph lines of the two states. Perhaps these agreements can serve as a blueprint for peace in the Balkans?"

 BUL_nish_autonomous_region: "Establish the Nish Autonomous Region"
 BUL_nish_autonomous_region_desc: "To soothe Serbian fears over the Balkan Union project, we can give amends to their brethren and establish an autonomous region in Nish, where the rights of the local Serbs will be respected. Of course, most of our promises can stay as paper promises - but they will carry us plenty of diplomatic favour."

 BUL_balkan_customs_union: "The Balkan Customs Union"
 BUL_balkan_customs_union_desc: "The treaties with Serbia can be expanded to all of the Balkans, and mark the creation of a Balkan Union - a community of Balkan states united economically and, perhaps in the future, politically. Thanks to our resounding victory in the Balkan War, we can expect the rest of the Balkan states to agree to the proposal."

 BUL_promote_bulgarian_investment: "Promote Bulgarian Private Investment"
 BUL_promote_bulgarian_investment_desc: "A Balkan customs union is already proving beneficial in getting businesses going in-between the participating states. We can encourage large Bulgarian businesses to expand their operations in our neighbours with tax breaks and political pressure - and bring significant dividends back home, too."

 BUL_abolish_travel_restrictions: "Abolish Travel Restrictions"
 BUL_abolish_travel_restrictions_desc: "By abolishing visas and other travel restrictions between members of the Balkan Union, we can develop connections among our peoples and hasten the spread of information. Not only that, but it will soothe ethnic tensions in Bulgaria, by allowing Romanian, Serb and Greek countrymen to connect with their peers on the other side as if there was no border at all."

 BUL_annual_diplomatic_summits: "Balkan Diplomatic Cooperation Council"
 BUL_annual_diplomatic_summits_desc: "If the Balkans do not act together as one unit, we will be absorbed by the surrounding foreign powers.

 BUL_balkan_war_defeat_desc: "Our hubris was our undoing - in a powerful strike, the Army collapsed, our lands have been parcelled away and our peoples divided. A National Catastrophe has befallen Bulgaria, and it will take years before we can finally remove its shackles and try again."

 BUL_support_imro: "Aid IMRO Gunrunning"
 BUL_support_imro_desc: "Arrogantly expecting to be able to integrate all of the lands they lost in the Weltkrieg with the snap of their fingers, the Serbs now face off against a ferocious resistance in Macedonia.

 BUL_secret_rearmament: "Replicate Serbian Secret Rearmament"
 BUL_secret_rearmament_desc: "During the interwar period, the Serbs successfully rearmed in spite of the punishing terms of the Treaty of Wartholz, and their Romanian allies used similar strategies before they declared the Treaty of Bucharest null.

 BUL_restore_economic_base: "Restore the Economic Base"
 BUL_restore_economic_base_desc: "The Fourth Balkan War has ruined the Bulgarian economy, businesses and communities which relied on products from territories we lost are now starving.

A symbolic move, but one which will assert our ambitions to the world."

 BUL_path_to_peace: "A Path to Peace"
 BUL_path_to_peace_desc: "We have fought against Serbia for several decades, and since these wars began our borders consistently shrank.

The Fatherland Front came to power with a promise of peace, so we shall bring it!"

After all, the Belgrade Pact needs to be contained."

 BUL_anti_belgrade_pact_alternate: "An Alliance with the Eagle"
 BUL_anti_belgrade_pact_alternate_desc: "The dominance of the Germans and Austrians in the Balkans forces us to reconsider our previous distance from the bloc.

By the time we've managed to rebound from our Catastrophe, it has become clear that the continent is heading to a new world war - or, perhaps, it has already begun.

Now, hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians languish in territories they have illegally occupied. The Turks must have bet on the hope that we will be crushed by the Pact and not rise to challenge them again - however, this did not come to pass. Rearmed, we shall return with a vengeance!"

His party, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, was the first to be based not upon the schisms of the Tarnovo Constitutional Convention or the dictatorship of Stefan Stambolov, but instead upon a real ideological foundation vested in the rural peasantry. Borrowing Marxist argumentation, Stamboliyski declared that as the common Bulgarian peasantry contributes the most labour to the nation, they should also hold power over the nation. The state should thus be restructured to their interest. Stamboliyski was the first major Bulgarian political leader to denounce the monarchy, and thus his career has been marked by constant persecution.\n\nAt the beginning of the Weltkrieg, the peasant leader announced his support for the Serbian struggle against Austria-Hungary, declaring himself not a Bulgarian, but a \"South Slav\". A year later, his ferocious anti-war rhetoric landed him in prison. A life sentence was cut short, however. In 1923, negotiating with parliamentary Agrarian factions, Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov agreed to grant him amnesty in exchange for their support. This did not last, however, as Stamboliyski fled to Serbia as soon as the Serbian Revolution began, again standing against the monarchy. In Serbia he came to contact with the rest of the republican opposition, and struck an alliance with the socialists.\n\nAmbitious and thirsty for an opportunity to finally shape Bulgaria in his image, Stamboliyski speaks of \"peasant democracy\", but true democratic practice rarely figures in his vision. If Bulgaria needs to be shaped according to the desires of the peasantry, and he is their tribune, then is it not natural for him to hold complete power?§!"

As a young man, Sotirov was involved in the tobacco worker trade union movement in Kyustendil and rose to lead the trade union movement in the region. After Konstantin Georgiev's rise to power, he organised strikes of tobacco workers and fled Kyustendil after crackdowns began. He was sheltered by fellow anarchist leader Delcho Vasilev in Haskovo — here, Sotirov erased his old identity and became Manol Vasev, once again involving himself in the revolutionary struggle.\n\nAfter the Georgiev era and the subsequent years of growing royal control, Bulgarian anarchists and syndicalists changed their strategy. The Bulgarian labour movement was too small and weak to build a revolution on — however, the impoverished peasantry was in constant threat of rebellion, and could be channelled to their needs. Mass peasant strikes in 1932 led to the establishment of the Agricultural Professional Confederation \"Vlasovden\", a congress modelled after trade union congresses in Western countries which was intended to prepare the Bulgarian peasantry for revolution. This Confederation also experimented with communal practice, establishing agricultural cooperatives under Syndicalist principles in the Haskovo region and drawing the ire of local authorities.\n\nArmed peasant militias, aligned with Vlasovden, played a key role in the revolution which overthrew the Tsar after the Fourth Balkan War - and for once, the Bulgarian syndicalists could finally put their theory in practice, showing the world that Syndicalism can be adapted far and wide, not just in the industrialised West.§!"

Here, they lived poor factory worker lives, and all of their sons eventually became socialists, although only Georgi survived. In 1900, he became secretary of the Sofia Union of Printers, and joined the newly established Narrow Socialist faction of the BRSDP in 1903. During the prewar period, he organised trade unions in Bulgaria, and was elected to the Sŭbranie on a socialist platform in 1915. Dimitrov's career as a parliamentarian was short, however, as he was stripped of immunity and arrested two years later for protesting the treatment of wounded soldiers.\n\nTwo years later, Dimitrov was released and went into exile, eventually reaching the Commune of France and reconnecting with the rest of the party leadership. Though the success of the French revolution was inspirational, Dimitrov soon turned into a critic of the Communard regime, publishing treatises on how the French system cannot be adapted by more backwards states, such as Bulgaria — if a revolution takes place in Bulgaria, then a strong revolutionary vanguard must first dedicate itself to the modernisation of the country, and only then progress towards \"Western socialism\". The Narrow Socialists adopted his theses.\n\nPersonality wise, Dimitrov is hardly a flattering picture, described as having \"the coarse and calculating realism of the Bulgarian peasant\" and changing his mind on who to flatter and who to criticise depending on who is in power. Still, however, he is a determined revolutionary, and the fall of the Tsardom allows him to pursue his vision for Bulgaria at last.§!"

Few imagined that the effeminate, eccentric Austro-Hungarian officer could command a nation, especially when his predecessor Alexander von Battenberg failed. The following five decades would see their ups and downs, but ultimately, Ferdinand became one of the longest-reigning and most glorious rulers of Bulgaria.\n\nThough authoritarian and megalomaniacal, Ferdinand allowed limited democracy in Bulgaria under the Tarnovo Constitution. In exchange, he guided the Principality's foreign policy to decades of war against the Ottomans and fellow Balkan states. This earned Bulgaria the moniker \"Prussia of the Balkans\". In the midst of it all, in 1908, he was granted the title of Tsar, first of the Third Bulgarian State, and wielded it as a claim to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire itself. The Second Balkan War would temper these ambitions, but the Weltkrieg, as brutal as it was, allowed the Tsar to restore Greater Bulgaria for good.\n\nAgeing and in increasingly poor health, Ferdinand has delegated most of his power to his eldest son, Crown Prince Boris. However, he remains an important symbol for the Bulgarian people. The Great Restorer, the flagbearer of the Third Bulgarian State in all of its glory, and as long as he remains at the helm, Bulgaria shall prosper.§!"

From the moment of his birth, Crown Prince Boris was placed under the national spotlight to appease the overwhelmingly Orthodox nation which made him its prince. With the benediction of the Russian Empire, Ferdinand I ordered his son to be baptised in the Orthodox rite and given a Bulgarian name. The Crown Prince received a thorough and multi-disciplinary education during his childhood, including a full Bulgarian school curriculum, several languages, military officer training and even a course in the operation of a steam locomotive.\n\nThe Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg affected the prince personally, as he commanded a regiment and later served as a liaison officer for the Chief of Staff of the Bulgarian Army. He personally visited trenches, got to witness cholera epidemics rolling through the oversized and poorly maintained Bulgarian armies, and grew more and more pacifistic over the years. It is said that his father placed him under house arrest for days because of Boris' disapproval of the decision to join the Weltkrieg, although this is mostly hearsay. Once the war concluded, he continued his duties as Crown Prince in a peaceful postwar environment. By then, his father was growing increasingly old and incapable, and more of his official duties needed to be represented by his heir. Now, Ferdinand's departure has finally placed Boris on the throne itself.\n\nBoris III is different from his father in several ways - while Ferdinand was authoritarian and arrogant, Boris is calm, collected, and protective of his image, able to make friends with almost anyone. While he may be more open to negotiation and concessions than his dear father, if the opportunity arises, Boris could be even more capable of subjugating the nation.§!"

Much like his peers bereft of wealth, he enrolled in the Military School and graduated as an infantry lieutenant. His career in the Bulgarian Army saw him fight in both of the Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg, during which he lost one of his eyes. No longer able to command his unit from the front lines, he was appointed as an instructor and later into the army staff, allowing him to create the Military Union - an organisation of active and reserve Bulgarian officers seeking to represent their voice in politics.\n\nMuch of the 1920s passed without note for the Colonel, working as an army instructor, commanding units against Serbian chetniks in Macedonia and teaching in the Military School. The Serbian Revolution and the subsequent political events in Bulgaria changed all that. Alongside the Military League, Georgiev fully endorsed the authoritarian regime of Konstantin Georgiev and was appointed as Minister of Railways and Telegraphs in his cabinet. When the Prime Minister fell, Georgiev vehemently defended him. Not only was the State Protection Act a necessity to him, but the failures of the parliamentary regime increasingly frustrated him.\n\nGeorgiev turned to his comrades, especially Damyan Velchev, and the two founded the Zveno political circle in 1928, with the goal of a new, stronger regime for Bulgaria. Unlike the discipline of the Army, politicians are irrational, immoral and short-sighted - so surely, it falls to the good men of the Army to put things back into order.

Unlike his father and many of his peers in the National Legions, Dochev did not pursue an army career and enrolled to study law at the University of Sofia instead. Although poverty and problems with the law forced him to interrupt his studies several times. The activist students of Bulgaria were the first to recognise that there was something rotten to the core with their beloved Bulgaria. In spite of the half-hearted speeches and rallies to display Bulgarian greatness, the country was poor, weak, and politically paralysed. The great revolutionary upheaval in Europe did not miss Sofia, emboldening not just socialists, but also those who saw it as a disease.\n\nDochev battled his Serbia-sympathetic coursemates in the streets of Sofia after the Serbian Revolution and joined the organisation \"Rodna Zashtita\". Soon disillusioned with it, Dochev rallied his peers to a splinter group, the Union of Bulgarian National Legions. Vehemently nationalist, xenophobic and openly militant, it swiftly absorbed its fellow radical organisations and turned into a hegemon of the far-right, and Dochev was their \"Bulgarian Codreanu\". As the head of the Legions, he travelled across the country and, if the rumours are true, met one of the commanders of the Ohrana in the Osogovo Mountains, who offered his endorsement to the young student.\n\nThe Fourth Balkan War caught Dochev straight out of university, and alongside thousands of his peers, he served in the front, his resolve only growing stronger and his bitterness turning even greater when he learned of the humiliating peace. No longer was he merely a young student thrust into political life - he was now a veteran, and alongside thousands of veterans he marched, to bring his country back on track, no matter how much it costs.§!"
