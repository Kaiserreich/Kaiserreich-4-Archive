 EGY_backwards_economy_1: "Agrarian Economy"
 EGY_backwards_economy_1_desc: "The economy of Egypt is rather underdeveloped and largely agrarian in nature. Though some industrialisation has begun it has yet to truly affect the country. Major reforms are needed to get over this hurdle."
 EGY_backwards_economy_2_desc: "The Economy of Egypt is rather underdeveloped and largely Agrarian in nature. Things have started to change as an industrialisation programme has begun and the effects are starting to be noticed. However it will take time for the economy to become a modern economy."
 EGY_illiterate_populace: "Illiterate Populace"
 EGY_illiterate_populace_desc: "The vast majority of Egypt's rural populace is illiterate. In order to rectify this hurdle, a programme of education reform must be undertaken."
 EGY_inexperienced_officer_corps: "Inexperienced Military"
 EGY_inexperienced_officer_corps_desc: "The Egyptian Officer Corps is rather inexperienced as the British and Ottomans wished to make sure they did not grow too powerful. Many are still used to ways of fighting from before the Weltkrieg which is hampering the army. If we are going to make Egypt a modern country we shall need to do some proper reforms of the army."
 EGY_iqta: "Land Owning Elites"
 EGY_iqta_desc: "The vast majority of Egypt's land belongs to land-owning elites and nobles with less than 6% of Egypt's populace owning over 65 percent of her land. In quite a number of these estates the conditions are likened to that of the Iqta system of old."

 EGY_farouks_reforms_outlook_desc: "[EGY_farouks_reforms_outlook_text_desc]"

 EGY_farouks_reforms_just_started: "Farouk's Reforms: Unclear Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_just_started_desc: "The young King spoke of his vision for a 'New Egypt' - but details on what that vision will entail have been scarce, and all Egypt awaits them with abated breath."
 EGY_farouks_reforms_liberal_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Liberal Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_liberal_outlook_desc: "Farouk's reforms have taken a clearly reformist route; some have even called them, dare I say, liberal. One can only hope that they will lead to this 'New Egypt' the young King is dreaming of."
 EGY_farouks_reforms_conservative_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Conservative Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_conservative_outlook_desc: "'Why try to fix what is not broken?' Clearly this is the approach the young King has taken. His actions so far have mostly affirmed the status quo and codified it into law, padding it with moderate reforms here and there. Evidently, there are no big Surprises waiting for Egypt."
 EGY_farouks_reforms_absolutist_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Absolutist Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_absolutist_outlook_desc: "It has become increasingly clear that the young King has decided to take matters in his own hands, so to speak. Reform after Reform continues to consolidate more and more power onto his very own personhood."
 EGY_farouks_reforms_unclear_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Unclear Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_unclear_outlook_desc: "The young King's reforms have been... inconsistent, at best. With every measure contradicting the one before it, the critics' whispers can hardly be ignored any longer."

 League_of_Arab_States_tt: "Has Modifier: §YMember of the League of Arab States ([Root.GetName])§!"

#### Decisions ####
 EGY_cairo_pact_decisions: "Cairo Pact"
 EGY_cairo_pact_decisions_desc: "The Cairo Pact is to help support the interests of Egypt. To that end we should send out envoys to foreign countries to support our interests."

 EGY_press_ottoman_surrender: "Press the [OTT.GetFlag] §YOttoman§! Surrender"
 EGY_press_ottoman_surrender_desc: "With allied control over all the key Arab cities and the Turks pushed back into the Anatolian mountains, we can finally say with pride that the Arab homeland has been liberated."

 EGY_ally_with_morroco_decision: "Ally with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 EGY_ally_with_morroco_decision_desc: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has recently become independent. We should send a diplomat to meet with the Moroccans to see about them joining the Cairo Pact."

 EGY_ally_with_africa_decision: "Ally with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 EGY_ally_with_africa_decision_desc: "[EGY_ally_with_africa_desc_text]"
 EGY_ally_with_africa_desc_CEA: "As [FROM.GetNameDef] borders our southern border, we should seek to ally with them and bring them into our Sphere of Influence."
 EGY_ally_with_africa_desc_SOM: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] exists upon the edge of the Horn of Africa, they would make valuable allies to us."
 EGY_ally_with_africa_desc_generic: "As we expand our power we should look to bring [FROM.GetNameDef] into the Cairo Pact and into our sphere of Influence."

 EGY_egyptian_reforms_decisions: "Egyptian Reforms"
 EGY_egyptian_reforms_decisions_desc: "King Farouk, though still a teenager, has a grand vision of a modern Egypt. This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the King to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."

 EGY_improve_literacy: "Improve Literacy"
 EGY_improve_literacy_desc: "Egypt has crippling literacy and we must focus on improving literacy within the country."

 EGY_Integration: "The Integration of Greater Syria"

 EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions: "Libyan-Egyptian Unification"
 EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions_desc: "With the dust settled in the Levant, Egyptian hawks have set their sight on the struggling nation of Tripolitania. Having only recently received its independence, the state is still struggling to decide its identity with concepts such as nationality new to most Libyans. This has opened up a window for expansion as the Bureau for Arab Affairs in Cairo has proposed to use subterfuge to bring the HIMT to power and through them annex Tripolitania into a greater Egyptian state."

 EGY_promote_the_HIMT: "Fund the HIMT"
 EGY_promote_the_HIMT_desc: "Named the Egypto-Tripolitanian Unification Party, this small offshoot of the wider Arab nationalist movement is the initiative of 'Ali Rajab who enlightened by the greatness of Egypt during his visit to Alexandria pursues the integration of Tripolitania into the greater Egyptian state, claiming that Tripolitania on its own has not the resources nor power to stand on its own."
 TRP_promote_the_HIMT: "Egypt Funds the HIMT"

 EGY_pan_arabist_propaganda: "Pan-Arabist Propaganda"
 EGY_pan_arabist_propaganda_desc: "Used to great effect in the lead-up to the Levant Crisis, Radio Free Cairo and our network of Arab propagandists are working overtime to spread their message far and wide. Even in the tiniest village must Libyans be glued to their radio sets, listening to the great deeds of the Egyptian people and their immense martial prowess."
 TRP_pan_arabist_propaganda: "Egypt Promotes Pan-Arabism"

 EGY_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism: "Counter Tripolitanian Nationalism"
 EGY_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism_desc: "Although there has been a recent rise in Tripolitanian nationalism, exceeding the normal city and family ties that Libyans traditionally held sacred, it's still weak and through renewed efforts of our propaganda machine, can be replaced by a feeling of Arab statehood and with it a desire to become part of the Egyptian state."
 TRP_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism: "Egypt Counters Tripolitanian Nationalism"

 EGY_propose_unification: "Propose Unification"
 EGY_propose_unification_desc: "With our HIMT allies firmly in the saddle, the time has come to officially unite our two states. For the greater glory of Arabia, evidently..."

### Focus Tree ###
 Egyptian_Tree: "Egyptian Focus Tree"

### Focus Tree - Economy ###
 EGY_modernization_program: "Modernisation Programme"
 EGY_modernization_program_desc: "The extremely weak nature of the Egyptian industrial economy requires our attention, through a programme of subsidies and state-sponsored businesses we can bring industrialisation to Egypt and become a truly modern country."
 EGY_egyptian_oil: "Joint Petroleum Ventures"
 EGY_egyptian_oil_desc: "Egypt has rich oil resources, if we could only exploit them. Foreign companies are keen to gain access to our reserves and will pay top dollar for them, by setting up joint ventures between them and the state we can save on the equipment required and ensure we get our cut."
 EGY_nile_dams: "Utilise the Aswan Dam"
 EGY_nile_dams_desc: "In 1903 the Nile was dammed by British engineer William Willcocks. To support the electrification of Egypt, we have several further projects planned along the White Nile that will provide power for thousands of homes and cities."
 EGY_industrialization: "Industrialisation Plan"
 EGY_industrialization_desc: "Egyptian industry requires substantial investment if it is to bloom, and to that end we have prepared a battery of policies intended to foster the growth of both heavy and light industries."
 EGY_textile_expansion: "Expand the Textile Industry"
 EGY_textile_expansion_desc: "While Egypt exports an immense amount of cotton, these exports are largely in the form of unprocessed raw materials that wealthier countries import to process into finished goods. By expanding our burgeoning textile industry we can take advantage of our domestic abundance of cotton and use it to grow our civilian industries."
 EGY_mechanise_cotton: "Mechanise Cotton Production"
 EGY_mechanise_cotton_desc: "While we hope to one day boast a developed and diversified economy like those of Europe and the United States, for the moment Egypt remains highly dependent on the growth and export of cotton. By introducing modern methods and technologies, we can reduce the number of labourers needed to work the cotton fields and hopefully benefit from the knock-on effects in other agricultural sectors."
 EGY_state_enterprises: "Form State Enterprises"
 EGY_state_enterprises_desc: "With the global economy still badly damaged in the wake of economic crisis, the private capital necessary to fund the modernisation of the country simply is not available. To address this the state shall lead the creation of new enterprises in order to better meet domestic needs."
 EGY_red_sea_trade: "Expand Port Sudan"
 EGY_red_sea_trade_desc: "While Alexandria continues to dominate Egyptian naval affairs, we should not neglect the possibilities open along the Red Sea. By creating facilities for the construction of modern ships at Port Sudan we can better tap into commerce in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, while improving the site as a stopover for ships coming in and out of the Suez Canal."
 EGY_railroad_expansion: "Railroad Expansion"
 EGY_railroad_expansion_desc: "A vital part of meeting the needs of our growing economy is improving the capacity of our existing rail infrastructure and expanding new infrastructure out where feasible. While previously our railroads had been purely built for the purposes of transporting goods to ports for export, we intend to make the network much denser and provide for transportation between settlements for internal movement of goods and people."
 EGY_egyptian_airports: "Egyptian Airports"
 EGY_egyptian_airports_desc: "Aviation is more of a prestige project for us currently, showing Egypt to be the leading light of the Middle East in technical innovation. By constructing new airports with the help of European experts we can reinforce this notion and work towards a commercially viable aviation industry."
 EGY_domestic_arms: "Build Out Small Arms Manufacturing"
 EGY_domestic_arms_desc: "The first step in building up our arms industry is the expansion of small arms and basic equipment manufacturing. While for the moment we are producing licensed foreign designs in the future we can hope to transition into the production of fully native designs."
 EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria: "Dockyards of Alexandria"
 EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria stands as one of the most important ports of the Mediterranean and a cornerstone of the Egyptian economy. While its days as one of the greatest in the world have long passed, it remains vital to Egypt's future and its connection to the wider world. Expanding her drydock and anchorage will let us grow the young Egyptian fleet more comfortably."
 EGY_german_weapons: "Court German Firms"
 EGY_german_weapons_desc: "Germany itself may have no love for our ambitions, but it is home to prestigious firms that are more than willing to hedge their bets in the coming conflict. So long as we provide the right incentives we, should have little trouble bringing in these firms to help expand the Egyptian arms industry."
 EGY_unify_electrical_standards: "Unify Electrical Standards"
 EGY_unify_electrical_standards_desc: "Electricity in Egypt is entirely under the control of private companies, and as such there is very little standardisation of voltage and outlets. By introducing the Egyptian Electrical Authority we can bring electricity to rural areas as well as enforcing nation-wide standards."
 EGY_egyptian_cinema: "Hollywood On The Nile"
 EGY_egyptian_cinema_desc: "Our burgeoning middle class has shown a great appetite for the cinema and for the state it presents an untapped industry. Egypt is a sunny country with striking landscapes suitable for filming in, and as such large tax breaks should bring film companies flocking to our shores."
 EGY_egyptian_radio: "Egyptian Radio"
 EGY_egyptian_radio_desc: "King Farouk's coronation speech was the first nationwide royal broadcast in Egyptian history, bringing the masses closer to their king than many of them could have dreamed. Now by investing in our communications infrastructure the whole nation may hear the King's voice! The music is also popular."
 EGY_blue_nile_dams: "Blue Nile Dams"
 EGY_blue_nile_dams_desc: "Damming the White Nile was politically easy, given that over 90% of it lies within our realm. However the Blue Nile has presented a harder challenge, as much of it lies within the sometimes hostile nation of Ethiopia. We have resolved to press ahead with the project however and bring electrification to most of Sudan."
 EGY_synthetic_resources: "More Desert Oil"
 EGY_synthetic_resources_desc: "The success of our earlier oil ventures has given rise to a greater demand for exploitation than we have the resources to meet. By legalising and engaging in the sale of oil futures we can gain the capital to expand production extremely quickly."
 EGY_modernise_sudan: "Modernise Khartoum-Omdurman"
 EGY_modernise_sudan_desc: "At the confluence of the Blue and White Nile sit the twin cities of Khartoum and Omdurman, which are also the largest and most important cities in Sudan as a whole. If we are to further the development and integration of Sudan, our efforts should start with this area and extend outward as we push to modernise the region."
 EGY_expand_railroads: "Expand Railroads Southwards"
 EGY_expand_railroads_desc: "By expanding the rail network in Sudan and making it part of the wider Egyptian rail system we will not only improve the economy but ensure that Sudan is more strongly linked with Egypt proper than the rest of Africa."
 EGY_invest_in_sudan: "Invest in Sudan"
 EGY_invest_in_sudan_desc: "There are any number of rich people, Egyptian or otherwise, who wish to invest in our nation. Perhaps tax incentives could encourage them to take their money southwards, where it will breathe new life into the local economy."
 EGY_airports_for_sudan: "Airports for Sudan"
 EGY_airports_for_sudan_desc: "While the railway is a wonderful way to travel it just isn't fast enough for the breakneck pace at which business can move. By investing in air transport links with Khartoum we can ensure that businessmen resident in Cairo and Alexandria can look to their interests in the south at a moment's notice, as well provide air bases for the Royal Egyptian Air Force."
 EGY_resources_of_the_south: "Resources of the South"
 EGY_resources_of_the_south_desc: "We have it on good authority from a geological expedition by the University of Cairo that there are immense mineral deposits in Sudan just waiting to be tapped. Backing a new joint German-Egyptian Chromium concern will allow us to bring heavy industry to our southern reaches and diversify their economy immensely."
 EGY_new_universities: "New Universities"
 EGY_new_universities_desc: "It is not enough simply to rely on foreign experts to run our businesses. The creation of several new Austrian-style institutes of technology and research universities that will teach not just the liberal arts but physics, chemical engineering and nuclear science will greatly expand the knowledge base of our nation and provide skilled workers for modern industries."
 EGY_egyptian_steel: "Domestic Steel Production"
 EGY_egyptian_steel_desc: "Commensurate with our new commitment to technical education comes a need to invest in a broader resource base. Rather than shipping ore abroad we intend to set up rolling mills in Port Said to produce Egyptian Steel for domestic use."
 EGY_new_economy: "New Economy"
 EGY_new_economy_desc: "In just a few short years Egypt's economy has begun to turn around, far from being a backwards agricultural nation she now enjoys a strong industrial base, institutions of higher education and a modern transport system. Whatever else may be, nobody can accuse the new Egypt of being behind the times."

### Focus Tree - Politics ###
 EGY_black_monday_recovery: "Begin Economic Recovery"
 EGY_black_monday_recovery_desc: "While Black Monday has hit our relatively small manufacturing sector hard the biggest harm has been the fall in exports, particularly that of cotton. A vigorous programme of support for agriculture, the financial sector and industrial assets should begin as soon as possible."
 EGY_secure_cotton_fields: "Secure Cotton Fields"
 EGY_secure_cotton_fields_desc: "Cotton has a long history in Egypt, and is one of the crops most vital to our export economy. By taking unprofitable plantations into state ownership and consolidating them we can shore up the industry, as well as supporting our farmers and landowners."
 EGY_cotton_subsidies: "Cotton Subsidies"
 EGY_cotton_subsidies_desc: "The success of our purchase of cotton plantations has been apparent. Now that we have cushioned the impact of Black Monday on this sector we should institute a minimum price for cotton while simultaneously allowing estates to pass back into private hands, hopefully insuring us against another crash."
 EGY_secure_holdings: "Secure Holdings"
 EGY_secure_holdings_desc: "Not since the 1907 crash has the Egyptian stock market taken such a beating, the fallout from Black Monday is immense, but also opens up opportunities for us if we can manage matters correctly. For now we will close the Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges in order to carry out some emergency restructuring."
 EGY_protect_industry: "Protect the Industry"
 EGY_protect_industry_desc: "Protecting Egypt's small and fragile industrial base is a task best undertaken without too much foreign competition. With the introduction of tariffs and inducements to 'Buy Egyptian' we can show our support to our industrialists and aid them in weathering the economic storm."
 EGY_reopen_stock_exchange: "Re-open the Stock Exchange"
 EGY_reopen_stock_exchange_desc: "Allowing the Alexandria and Cairo Stock Exchange to remain closed any longer would be a mistake. The longer we keep one of Africa and the Middle East's most active stock markets closed the more we risk its position as a hub of trading. Reopening the market will show our confidence in the emergency reforms we have pushed through as well as allowing the recovery to begin."
 EGY_black_monday_over: "The Crisis is Over"
 EGY_black_monday_over_desc: "It seems that our programmes are beginning to pay off. While economies closer to the German sphere or embroiled in civil unrest continue sluggishly Egypt is already seeing a recovery in employment and economic growth."
 EGY_farouks_reforms: "Farouk's Reforms"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_desc: "King Farouk, though still a teenager, has a grand vision of a modern Egypt. This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the King to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."
 EGY_administrative_reforms: "Administrative Reforms"
 EGY_administrative_reforms_desc: "Currently in Egypt the state's power is based around notable locals, be they land owners or village headmen. This is an obvious area of priority for our young King, who aims to standardise administration into four dozen governorates. The question now becomes who should be appointed to each one, and how?"
 EGY_judical_reforms: "Judicial Reforms"
 EGY_judical_reforms_desc: "Egypt's court system was innovative in 1875, however jurisprudence has moved on. Now, with collaboration of jurists from the University of Cairo, King Farouk intends to overhaul the legal process. This affords the various factions in the Government to help influence exactly what that means."
 EGY_bureaucracy_reforms: "Bureaucracy Reforms"
 EGY_bureaucracy_reforms_desc: "Day-to-day bureaucracy is required to run a modern state with any kind of efficiency, to that end the hiring of officials must be overhauled to create a single system. Two camps are emerging pushing different ideas: one calls for meritocratic examinations to be given, the other for pedigree and tradition to be respected."
 EGY_islams_status: "The Status of Islam"
 EGY_islams_status_desc: "Farouk is obviously a devout Muslim and nobody sane would ever doubt his faith. However he sees the merit in secular governance on the French model, and is now contemplating the relationship between the Egyptian state and the Islamic faith."
 EGY_education_reform: "Education Reform"
 EGY_education_reform_desc: "Education will lay the groundwork for the future of our new Egypt, but the topic of history is one liable to cause controversy if not handled properly. Ultimately the King's word will carry great weight, and so it falls to him to decide if the focus of Egypt's history should be Pharaonic or if he should reject the pagan past in favour of our Islamic heritage."
 EGY_finish_reforms: "Finish Reforms"
 EGY_finish_reforms_desc: "The dust is beginning to settle on a period of massive social change for Egypt, and we can now only look to the future to see the Kingdom King Farouk has built."

### REVISED FOREIGN TREE ###
############################

 EGY_Third_Arab_Congress: "The Third Arab Congress"
 EGY_Third_Arab_Congress_desc: "Although former Arab congresses have had a strictly peaceful intention, an event to celebrate Arab culture and support movements willing to further the Arab cause, the King has indicated that this event will be anything but peaceful. The culmination of years of preparations and cooperation with underground movements in the Ottoman Empire, this congress will deliver the first shot towards the new Arab world."
 EGY_Radio_Free_Cairo: "Radio Free Palestine"
 EGY_Radio_Free_Cairo_desc: "An initiative of nationalists in Cairo and Palestinian exiles, Radio Free Cairo was set up as the rallying point for disgruntled Arabs in Palestine and to convince them to take up arms against the imperialist menace. Although the radio was initially aimed against the Zionists and their Western lapdogs, recently the radio has shifted focus towards the Ottoman Empire, blaming it for the demise of Arab culture and the destruction of Palestine."
 EGY_Coordinate_Al_Fatat: "Coordinate with Al-Fatat"
 EGY_Coordinate_Al_Fatat_desc: "Jam'iyat al-'Arabiya al-Fatat or the Young Arab Society was founded in the aftermath of the Young Turk revolution as an attempt to counter Turkish nationalism and strive for the autonomy of Arab citizens. During the war the organisation further expanded and played a key role in the abortive Hejaz revolt. Although many of its members were jailed after the war, it has continued to operate in the shadows, waiting for the right time to strike."
 EGY_Coordinate_Al_Ahd: "Coordinate with Al-'Ahd"
 EGY_Coordinate_Al_Ahd_desc: "Similar to al-Fatat in intentions, Jamyat al-Ahd or the Covenant Society has most of its followers amongst the Arab officers of the Ottoman army. Due to the large presence of Iraqis amongst there, the organisation has (contrary to al-Fatat) primarily expanded its operations amongst the Iraqi vilayets and strives for the creation of an Iraqi state. Although it is unclear how high up the conspiracy goes, it is rumoured that Yasin al-Hashimi also partakes in their activities."
 EGY_Society_Defence_Palestine: "Society for the Defence of Palestine"
 EGY_Society_Defence_Palestine_desc: "Forming the brunt of the Palestinian guerrillas in the former MOJ, the Society for the Defence of Palestine is an international organisation striving for the liberation of Palestine and the departure of Zionists. With our armies pushing North, the organisation has asked to be integrated into the Egyptian army as to improve communication with our officers."
 EGY_Support_the_Imamate: "Support the Imamate"
 EGY_Support_the_Imamate_desc: "Although seen by some as the home of Arabia, Yemen has nonetheless shown little desire to cooperate with the Arab liberation movements, fearing the creation of a pan-Arab state which would damage the integrity of Yemen. We will have to manoeuvre carefully around the Imam if we wish to count on Yemeni support during the war to come."
 EGY_Liberate_Tripolitania: "Liberate Cyrenaica"
 EGY_Liberate_Tripolitania_desc: "The Senussi Order is weakened by the accident that has left their Grandmaster incapacitated, leaving matters of state to a squabbling regency council. Idris I, the rightful heir to the Cyrenaican throne, still resides within Egypt and has been working with disgruntled Senussi princes towards the restoration of his throne. If we pledge our support to the Prince, we might be able to secure our left flank from Ottoman aggression."
 EGY_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels: "Support Maghrebi Rebels"
 EGY_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels_desc: "Subject to forced labour, slavery and other vile practices, the population of the Maghreb is being crushed by the last attempts of France to regain their grandeur. Through their actions, they have given rise to a whole network of resistance movements, many of whom look to Egypt for inspiration and assistance."
 EGY_Expand_Alexandria: "Modernise Repair Facilities"
 EGY_Expand_Alexandria_desc: "The Egyptian fleet is in a pitiful state, lacking both the ships and infrastructure to rival the Ottomans. If we are to have any chance of recovering from the damage we may face in securing trade or disrupting enemy shipping - let alone engaging in direct naval combat or confronting coastal batteries - we must prepare our dockyards to meet the demands of the conflicts to come."
 EGY_Coordinate_Peninsula: "Coordinate with the Peninsula"
 EGY_Coordinate_Peninsula_desc: "The [292.Owner.GetAdjective]s are unreliable at best, but for now our interests seem to align and it would be foolish to let old grudges get in the way of our ultimate goal. Lacking any sort of industry or modern equipment, the forces of [292.Owner.GetLeader] are reliant on capacity to supply them with the necessary armaments."
 EGY_Bureau_Military_Engineering: "Royal Bureau for Military Engineering"
 EGY_Bureau_Military_Engineering_desc: "When the British crossed the Sinai during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg, they brought with them a formidable apparatus of engineers and construction workers to lay railroad tracks and expand port facilities, ensuring that their supply lines to Egypt were fully operational. If we are to succeed in our own operations, we will have to prepare ourselves for similar works."
 EGY_Operation_Abu: "Operation Abu'l-A'war"
 EGY_Operation_Abu_desc: "A dastardly plan devised by a junior naval officer, the top secret Abu'l-A'war operation plans to even the playing field on the seas by executing a lighting strike on the Ottoman fleet in its Beiruti port. Utilising the latest in naval aviation technology, provided by the Union of Britain, it remains unlikely that the plan will succeed but with the odds so heavily stacked against us, we have no choice but to try."

 EGY_motorized_efforts: "Motorised Efforts"
 EGY_motorized_efforts_desc: "Cavalry is all well and good, but the future of warfare relies on motorised vehicles. By instituting a training programme that teaches our conscripts to drive alongside their basic training we can lay the ground for the mobile army of the 20th century."
 EGY_royal_camel_corps: "Royal Camel Corps"
 EGY_royal_camel_corps_desc: "The Royal Camel Corps is a continuation of the formerly British-officered Egyptian Camel Corps. Camels are hardy beasts suited to desert environments, and their use in warfare has been known for centuries. By formalising their place in our military doctrine we can further adapt our men to the environment of their homeland."
 EGY_shendi_horses: "Shendi Horses"
 EGY_shendi_horses_desc: "In order to ensure the cavalry have access to fine horses King Farouk has proposed a programme whereby land suitable for pasture in Sudan, situated mostly around the town of Shendi, would be given over to stud farming by the Royal Agricultural Society. The RAS will also offer favourable rates for purebred Arabians from the studs of the nobility."
 EGY_desert_mobility: "Fast as the Desert Wind"
 EGY_desert_mobility_desc: "Our theorists have been developing and formalising a doctrine based around coordination between units, in order to move as quickly as possible and conduct operations at a breakneck pace.

 EGY_desert_training: "Desert Training"
 EGY_desert_training_desc: "The defence of the Egyptian nation is best conducted away from her urban centres and the densely populated banks of the Nile. This means operating in the harsh desert conditions of North Africa and Greater Syria, to which end we have created specialised Desert Survival Camps to which all recruits are sent for two months as part of their basic training."
 #EGY_general_staff: "Egyptian General Staff" already defined above as an idea
 EGY_general_staff_desc: "By granting greater autonomy to the Chief of Staff we can create a department modelled on the German General Staff, dedicated to the study of all aspects of warfare and drawing up plans for mobilisation and campaigning.

 EGY_marine_focus: "Egyptian Marines"
 EGY_marine_focus_desc: "The use of naval assets for army operations has often been a source of service rivalry and contention.

 EGY_grand_navy: "A Grand Navy"
 EGY_grand_navy_desc: "The Egyptian Navy must be grand and imposing, and every bit as prestigious as her army.

 EGY_heavy_cruisers: "Heavy Cruisers"

 EGY_submarines: "Submarine Efforts"
 EGY_submarines_desc: "U-boats are one of the most sophisticated weapons in the hands of the Kaiserliche Marine, and the silent terror of the seas. By adapting some German designs we can further the science and possibly develop our own models."

 EGY_aviation_reforms_desc: "Currently the Egyptian Army Air Force exists as a branch of the army, wisely organised by our esteemed father. However the growing interest in aviation among the armed forces has prompted King Farouk to introduce legislation creating a separate Egyptian Air Force, which would coordinate with both the navy and the army while being an independent branch of the services."
 EGY_pilot_training: "Pilot Training"
 EGY_pilot_training_desc: "In 1928 when our ministry of war first called for volunteers to found the EAAF over 200 men put themselves forward.

 EGY_aviation_industry_desc: "During the Great War, both German and British aeroplanes soared over the Levant, scouting enemy movements, striking ground targets, and occasionally even clashing in fierce aerial duels. Now that we stand on our own, we must forge our own path to such power. With dedicated investment in state-owned factories, Egypt's first domestically built aircraft will soon take to the skies."

### Intro Screen ###
 EGY_country_intro_background: "GFX_EGY_intro"
 EGY_country_intro_header: "The Kingdom of Egypt"
 EGY_country_intro_content: "The history of modern Egypt conventionally begins in 1882 when Egypt joined the British sphere of influence, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's de jure position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914, the Protectorate was made official and the title of the head of state, which had changed from Pasha to Khedive in 1867, was again changed to King. This formally repudiated the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, who was backing the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed by the British and replaced as king by his uncle, Husayn Kamil. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I.\n\nWith the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, Egypt remained part of a now weakened British sphere. This would increase anger within the Egyptian populace that exploded in violence in 1925 during the collapse of the British Empire. This would become known as the Egyptian Revolution where Fuad I proved his legitimacy by leading the people in the revolution. The Revolution was largely nationalistic in nature, uniting Egyptians of all social classes, faiths, and occupations together to rid Egypt of the British once and for all. In the chaos of the revolution, an international coalition (primarily led by Britain and Germany) seized the Suez Canal, which Egypt was forced to accept in order to avoid an open conflict with the former central powers.\n\nSince the revolution there has been a conflict between liberals that seek to go further and make the monarchy a true constitutional monarchy and conservatives that wish to keep the status quo. Moreover, as 1936 arrives, Egypt's eyes go increasingly upon the Young Farouk, the heir to the throne who is being groomed for the throne. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, members of all political parties have begun to draft plans for a restoration of a mighty Egypt and dreaming of an Ottoman-free Middle East..."

 egypt_events.2.d: "Today tragic news hits Egypt, as King Fuad has died. As the nation is in mourning, the throne passes to sixteen year old Farouk. While he has enjoyed the proper education of a King-to-be, few have concrete ideas of how he will govern."
 egypt_events.2.a: "The King is dead, Long live the King."

 egypt_events.3.t: "Black Monday Hits Egypt"
 egypt_events.3.d: "Today, the economic crisis that has been gripping Germany has finally wrapped her tendrils around our proverbial neck. After our rather forceful departure from the British sphere, much of the foreign capital within our nation has come from Germany and her economic sphere. Now, with the situation of those foreign investors becoming increasingly unclear, our largely export-based economy is starting to crack under the pressure. The agricultural sector, particularly the cotton sector, was hit rather hard. The people are begging their representatives within the Royal Diet as well as the King to do anything they can to resolve the crisis."
 egypt_events.3.a: "May God save us."

 egypt_events.4.t: "Farouk's Grand Reforms"
 egypt_events.4.d: "Today, the young King has announced a plan to transform Egypt into a nation fit for the modern age. A series of reforms is to cover nearly every aspect of Egyptian life, government and society. Various ministers and courtiers are already rushing to try to influence or manipulate the young sovereign to their advantage."
 egypt_events.4.a: "Egypt shall be brought into the modern age."

 egypt_events.5.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 egypt_events.5.d: "Today is the long awaited election for the Prime Minister of Egypt. This year's election is particularly tense as it comes on the heels of the ascension of Farouk to the role of King. The main four parties as before are running their candidates and the question is whom shall the people elect to be the prime minister?"
 egypt_events.5.a: "The Liberal Constitutional Party."

 egypt_events.7.t: "Governorship Reform"
 egypt_events.7.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the question of Governors has come up. The liberals believe that governors should be elected. While the conservatives believe that they should be nobles. However a third option has come up, appointed governors by the King himself selected through a meritocratic system."

 egypt_events.7.b: "Noble Governors."
 egypt_events.7.c: "Appointed Governors."

 egypt_events.8.t: "Judicial Reform"
 egypt_events.8.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the question of the Judiciary has come up. The Liberals believe that the judicial branch should be independent in order to make sure that laws are properly enforced. However the conservatives argue that the government should have oversight of the Judiciary."
 egypt_events.8.a: "Judicial Independence."
 egypt_events.8.b: "Government Oversight."

 egypt_events.9.t: "Bureaucracy Reform"
 egypt_events.9.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the nature of the bureaucracy has been brought up. The liberals are pushing for a modern civil service system that is done on a meritocratic basis. While the conservatives believe that the civil servants should be appointed and heavily in favour of the nobility."
 egypt_events.9.a: "Civil Service."
 egypt_events.9.b: "Appointed Ministers."

 egypt_events.10.t: "Land Reform"
 egypt_events.10.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt, the topic of land reform has been brought up. The issue at hand is that less than six percent of Egypt's population owns more than 65% of the land of the country with less than 0.5% of Egyptians owning more than one third of all Fertile land. The liberals wish to combat this by redistributing the land to the people, principally through buying the land from the nobility. However, the conservatives despise such a notion and believe that such an action will only hurt Egypt's agricultural production. A third possibility has been brought up, and that would be to nationalise the land and have it all be the King's land - at least on paper, anyways. The King is already the largest landowner in Egypt, so this would not be impossible to implement."
 egypt_events.10.a: "Redistribute the land."
 egypt_events.10.b: "Formalise the status quo."
 egypt_events.10.c: "All land shall be owned in name by the King."

 egypt_events.11.t: "Legal Reforms"
 egypt_events.11.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the nature of the legal system has been brought up. The current legal system is an absolute mess with overlapping and conflicting areas of British, Ottoman, French and Egyptian Law all mixed together. Such a thing is not suitable for the new modern Egypt. To that end the laws must be reformed. However where one should look within the current laws for the main basis is a big question. The liberals believe that the British law within our legal system might be the best way to adopt, while conservatives believe that the French law is better. Finally some believe looking at the ideas of Muhammad Ali that he brought into the Egyptian system would yield the best system."

 egypt_events.12.t: "Royal Dietarian Reform"
 egypt_events.12.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of Royal Dietarian Reform has been brought up. The Liberals believe that the Royal Diet should be strengthened at the cost of the power of the Monarchy. While the conservatives believe that the current status quo works fine as a balance between absolutism and liberalism. Finally a third option is to strengthen the monarchy while weakening the power of the Royal Diet."

 egypt_events.12.c: "Strengthen the Monarchy."

 egypt_events.13.t: "Religious Reforms"
 egypt_events.13.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the nature of religion has been brought up. The liberals wish for us to focus more on secularism while the conservatives believe that Islam should be made the state religion with protections for minority faiths such as Judaism or Christianity."
 egypt_events.13.a: "Egypt is a Secular Nation."
 egypt_events.13.b: "Egypt is an Islamic Nation."

 egypt_events.14.t: "Education Reforms"
 egypt_events.14.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of education has been brought up. The issue is what should be taught within schools. The conflict is between the Pharaonists who believe that Egypt's identity is Mediterranean and looks to the pre-Islamic era, and the Islamists who believe that Egypt's identity is rooted in Islam and looks to the age of the Fatimids, Ayyubids and even Mamluks for identity."

 egypt_events.100.t: "Questions of Egyptian Identity"
 egypt_events.100.d: "When the Egyptian revolution of 1925 happened, questions of identity emerged: What does it mean to be Egyptian? When was Egypt great? It was the first time in centuries that the Egyptians were truly free and independent, so we were finally able to address these questions properly. Since then, two concepts of what it means to be Egyptian have formed, looking back on the past with romanticism, although they each look at radically different periods of Egyptian history.\n\nThe first camp is known as Pharaonism. They look to the pre-Islamic past, to the days of the Pharaohs, for a time when Egypt was truly great and powerful. They argue that Egypt is a Mediterranean civilisation and stress the role of the Mediterranean Sea within Egyptian culture, though they do not neglect the Nile. Largely it aligns with the Liberal parties - though strictly speaking it is not liberal, and even some of the Watani support it. It is by far the most influential form of identity of Egypt in 1936.\n\nThe second cultural movement is the Islamist movement, which arose as a counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism. They believe the period in which Egypt was most great was the era of Fatimid Caliphate and the Ayyubid dynasty. Instead of the Pharaohs, whom they decry as pagans and absolute tyrants, they look back to the time when Egypt was the centre of the Islamic world - when a multi-ethnic and tolerant Egypt was the dominant Islamic power. This cultural movement is more of a conservative counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism and is largely tied to the Conservative movements, particularly the Ittihad Party.\n\nIt should be noted that both camps support a multi-ethnic Egypt - both Pharaonists and Islamists believe that Egypt has always been a multi-ethnic state. Both concepts are largely romantic-nationalist in nature and have an impact upon culture and the arts."
 egypt_events.100.a: "We are all Egyptians."

 egypt_events.101.t: "Library Debate"
 egypt_events.101.d: "As part of the modernisation programme, one of the things that have been brought up is that we should build a grand new library to celebrate the new Egypt.

 egypt_events.101.a: "New Library of Alexandria."
 egypt_events.101.b: "New House of Knowledge."

 egypt_events.102.t: "Capital of Egypt"
 egypt_events.102.d: "The question of the capital of Egypt has been brought up. The Pharaonists believe that to symbolise the new Egypt the capital should be relocated to Alexandria. While the Islamists believe that the current capital of Cairo is better and has always been Egypt's capital since the cities founding."
 egypt_events.102.a: "Alexandria!"
 egypt_events.102.b: "Cairo!"

 egypt_events.103.t: "A New Lighthouse for Egypt"
 egypt_events.103.d: "The Port Said Lighthouse has served as a beacon for the Suez Canal since 1869. Built by the Khedive Ismail, it has been appropriated by foreigners since the Canal opened. Now with the Canal in Egyptian hands, this old lighthouse could use a new coat of paint.

Traditionalists in the treasury refuse to finance any additional work on the lighthouse."

The fact that Al-Azhar is one of the most prestigious universities in Egypt helps add to their influence. Today though a new Grand Imam must be chosen and the two leading contenders are naturally divided between the Pharaonist and Islamist camps. The Pharaonist candidate is Muhammad al-Zawahiri who has earned praise for his efforts to support the University as well as his reformist ideas. The Islamist candidate is Mustafa Hassan Abdul Razek who has earned praise for sparking a renaissance of Islamic philosophy within the University as well wanting to expand Islamic education throughout the realm. Whom shall be appointed as the next Grand Imam?"

 egypt_events.107.t: "The Damming of the Nile"
 egypt_events.107.d: "The Aswan Lower Dam was an ambitious project for the British, and its incomplete state a testament to the British legacy in Egypt. In 1935, King Fuad was approached by Greek Christian Adrian Daninos to build a second dam to control the Nile's annual flooding. Today is that glorious day. The Aswan Lower Dam is finally complete, allowing Egypt unparalleled control over the Nile. The only question that remains is who to honour. Should we honour Ibn al-Haytham, who first envisioned the dam in the days of the caliphate? Should we name it after our honoured guest Adrian Daninos instead? It was he that made this possible."
 egypt_events.107.a: "Adrian Daninos deserves to be honoured."
 egypt_events.107.b: "Ibn al-Haytham deserves to be honoured."

 egypt_events.108.t: "Ministry of Awqaf"
 egypt_events.108.d: "A bill has come before the Egyptian Diet regarding the Ministry of Awqaf, which oversees religious endowments and assigns imams to help run the Mosques.

The film's production in the hills above Cairo was disrupted by students from the Al-Azhar school. Despite this, the film has been released uncensored in major cities across Egypt. Students and teachers from mosques across Egypt are calling for this film to be banned."

The discovery of a new tomb in the Valley of the Kings while the palaces of Britain burned made it impossible for their findings to leave Egypt safely. Howard Carter is found dead today in his apartment in Luxor, the last in a series of deaths related to the tomb of Tutankhamun.

 egypt_events.182.d: "Founded in the slipstream of the Cairo Pact, the Arab League is meant to serve as a renewed confirmation of Pan-Arab unity with the stated goal to improve relations between all Arab nations, modernise their institutions and dictate a shared foreign policy against the combined forces of the Imperialist West.\n\nBesides these seemingly good intentions however, many see in the organisation a way for Egypt to directly meddle in their internal affairs and in a military alliance meant to protect the Arab world, a tool for warmongers in Egypt to expand their own imperial aims in Africa and the Middle East."
 egypt_events.182.a: "We will gladly join!"
 egypt_events.182.b: "The Egyptians can't be trusted."

 egypt_events.183.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Our Offer"

 egypt_events.188.t: "Rise of the HIMT"
 egypt_events.188.d: "Although few believe that the HIMT is a truly Libyan initiative, the party (which strives for the unification of Libya and Egypt) has seen a meteoric rise in support lately as its pamphlets, posters and propaganda pieces flood Tripolitania. Even though the government expects that this sudden influx of printing capacity and funds comes directly from Cairo, it has no hard proof and prefers to avoid a diplomatic incident for the time being."
 egypt_events.188.a: "Most suspicious..."

 egypt_events.189.t: "Pan-Arabist Propaganda Floods the Nation"
 egypt_events.189.d: "Inspired by the victory of the Arab alliance in the Levant Crisis, thousands of young Libyans are flocking to the banners of pan-Arab movements whilst clubs such as the Union Sports Club for Young Libyans and the al-Mukhtar Club sweep the masses with dreams of a grand, united Arabia stretching from Morocco to Iran."

 egypt_events.190.t: "Decline in Government Support"
 egypt_events.190.d: "With promises of a great, better Libya made by those that strive for the unification of all Arabs, the governments feeble attempts to instil a sort of Tripolitanian nationhood have fallen on deaf ears.

 egypt_events.194.t: "Egypt Proposes Unification"
 egypt_events.194.d: "Desiring the further pursuit of close relation between Tripolitania and Egypt, the government in Cairo has officially proposed the unification of the two states as to further the dream of a united Arab state. Our government, recently having taken over from their civilian predecessor, has been working tirelessly to achieve this union and is thrilled that the moment has finally arrived. Amongst the people there is less enthusiasm however as the man on the streets wonders if Tripoli should hand its newfound independence away this quickly."

 egypt_events.194.b: "Never!"

 egypt_events.196.t: "Tripolitania Refuses Unification"

 egypt_events.196.a: "Traitors!"

 egypt_events.197.t: "Tripolitania Counters Our Influence"
 egypt_events.197.d: "It seems that the government in Tripoli has caught wind of our latest attempt to pursue the pan-Arab dream in their state and pulled out all the stops in an attempt to 'protect' their citizens from 'foreign subterfuge'. A setback to be sure but the bureau in Cairo is confident that it is only temporary and is working hard to ensure that the next operation is all the more successful."
 egypt_events.197.a: "A small setback."

 egypt_events.201.t: "The Second Mahdist Revolt"
 egypt_events.201.d: "The Sudan has long been known as a land of religious firebrands and fierce peoples, a fact that even the British Empire at its peak was forced to discover at the end of the last century. Now it seems that the Egyptians are once more facing a serious revolt in the southern region, led by Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, the son of Muhammad Ahmad, the Mahdi of the original 1881 rebellion.\n\nCalling for God-mandated resistance against the Egyptian occupiers from a balcony in Khartoum, Abd al-Rahman's powerful rhetoric has contributed to a total breakdown of Cairo's rule in the region. Though it is unclear whether he has the backing of most of Sudan's tribes, it is clear that a brutal war lies ahead."
 egypt_events.201.a: "This should be good."

 EGY_fuad_i_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 26th, 1868, in Giza Palace, Cairo, Governorate of the Capital, Khedivate of Egypt§!\n§YBackground:§! §LFuad ascended to the Egyptian throne amidst the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and growing nationalism bolstered by continued British defeats in Europe. When the British Revolution broke out, Egypt revolted in turn. Fuad co-opted the revolution, presenting himself as an ardent nationalist, and promulgated a system of government modelled on that of Germany.\nFuad's subsequent social and economic reforms have raised questions in Egyptian society about the very identity of the Egyptian people and its place in a region still dominated by the hated Turk. Perhaps the seeds of progress sewn by Fuad will lead to glory. Perhaps his successors may succeed where other rulers have failed and lead Egypt to its rightful place as the shield and sword of an at last liberated Arab people.§!"
