 TRK_madamin_bek_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §L1893, in Margilan, Fergana Oblast, Russian Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LMadamin Bek, born Muhammad Amin, was saved from an ignoble fate of Siberian exile (earned in 1914 for his anti-Tsarist activities) by the sudden February Revolution. As the scion of a long decrepit house of Kokand nobility, the young upstart was named police chief of Margilan by the new revolutionary government in Tashkent in late 1917. When the Tashkent Soviet put Kokand to the torch, he pledged his militia to the cause of the Fergana freedom fighter “Little” (Kichik) Ergash Bek, quickly rising through the ranks of the native rebels. When Ergash Bek was gravely injured in the fighting outside Namagan, Madamin Bek was proclaimed Amir ul-Musliman, Commander of the Faithful, by the assembled Kurbashi commanders.\n\nIn the years following the establishment of the Turkestan Autonomy, Madamin Bek maintained a frosty but productive relationship with Mustafa Shokay’s liberal Kokand government, though he soon tired of the repeated concessions of privileges and rights made to maintain the peace with Moscow. When the Military Commissar of the region rose up in a doomed revolt against Moscow, Madamin Bek seized the opportunity to take power for himself and declare the independence of Turkestan. It was only through a careful dance of diplomacy that Madamin Bek, now the President-Amir of a new republic, would survive Russian retribution. Though he is a warlord-turned-president, Madamin is no autocrat, attempting to rule by consensus when possible and devoted considerable effort towards developing a feasible civilian administration. Madamin survives on the basis of his interpersonal connections and his compromising nature, expertly navigating the cutthroat world of tribal and sectarian politics to rule over a teetering coalition.§!"

 TRK_focus: "[TRK.GetName] Focus Tree"

 TRK_beating_heart: "A New Leaf for the Republic"
 TRK_beating_heart_desc: "For years, the senior most political appointments in our republic have been allotted to tribal leaders and Kurbashi warlords, the foundation of our political support. However, recent manoeuvring by respected reform minded religious leaders has unseated the conservative stranglehold on power, much to Madamin Bek's concern. Regardless, we must build a new consensus within the ruling Ittifaq ul-Musilmin to integrate these new reformist and Pan-Turkist voices."

 TRK_expand_the_foreign_ministry: "Expand the Foreign Ministry"
 TRK_expand_the_foreign_ministry_desc: "In the opening days of the Republic, under the rule of Shokay's puppet government, the foreign ministry was little more than a tiny office with no power in the face of Turkestan's special relationship with their Russian overlords. When Madamin Bek took power, the isolationist elements of his regime prevented any expansion. With a new, outward facing mindset, the time is ripe to finally build up this integral element of our nation."

 TRK_walking_the_turkestan_tightrope: "Walking the Turkestan Tightrope"
 TRK_walking_the_turkestan_tightrope_desc: "Leading the Turkestani state has always involved the careful balancing of various competing factions and power blocs, all vying for the domination or destruction of the Republic. While the introduction of the reformists into the governing coalition has certainly complicated matters, they have proven themselves to be a vital counterweight to the fundamentalist, providing Madamin with a fresh opportunity to consolidate his control."

 TRK_our_ottoman_brothers: "Our Ottoman Brothers"
 TRK_our_ottoman_brothers_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is, at its heart, a Turkish nation, and their government has long been a semi-clandestine supporter of our republic, long fueling our limited economic reforms with private investment. With the rise of Savinkovism, support from Istanbul has only increased, and it would not take much to convince them of our need for Ottoman advisors and military support."

 TRK_support_dissidents_abroad: "Support Dissidents Abroad"
 TRK_support_dissidents_abroad_desc: "Though our government is not exactly ideologically driven, our defiance against Russian imperialism in Central Asia has lent us credibility in the eyes of various Pan-Turkist organisations across the region. Using these foreign allies to shift the geopolitical tides into our favour will be crucial if we hope to maintain our independence and work towards freeing our neighbours from Russian domination."

 TRK_contacts_with_young_bukharans: "Contacting Bukharan Dissidents"
 TRK_contacts_with_young_bukharans_desc: "At one time, the city-dwelling merchant and intellectual class of Muslim Jadid reformers was Madamin Bek's greatest opponents, agitating against his authoritarian practices and aiding the Soviets in their invasion. Today, however, the Jadids know that in Central Asia, Madamin Bek is their greatest ally against the continued rule of the Emirs and Khans."

 TRK_tashkent_verniy_railway: "Tashkent-Verny Railway"
 TRK_tashkent_verniy_railway_desc: "In the years immediately following the deviation of the Weltkreig, rail lines into Central Asia became a symbol of Russian-German economic cooperation, and a number of small joint projects were launched. In the years following, however, these prestige projects have been left to rot, abandoned by the distracted German industrialists and the increasingly hostile government in Moscow. We should refurbish them to better connect our lands to our Kazakh friends."

 TRK_supplies_to_kazakhs: "Aid the Kazakh Militias"
 TRK_supplies_to_kazakhs_desc: "Conflict between the clandestine Kazakh militias and the Alash puppet government has been brewing for a decade now, threatening to light the spark which will once again draw Russian eyes south. There is no doubt in our minds, however, that if such a conflict should break out we must protect our allies within the militias, lest their defeat be the first domino to fall in the face of new Russian imperialism."

 TRK_turk_brother_nations: "Brotherhood of Turkic Nations"
 TRK_turk_brother_nations_desc: "The Pan-Turkist project has the potential to be plagued by the divergent visions of each of the great turkic peoples and nations, losing sight of our goals in favour of narrow sectarian views of Turkdom. We will not make this mistake! Any nation which is home to the peoples of Turkic blood or who have opened their doors to the great many Turk refugees shall be our friends and our brothers!"

 TRK_studying_caucasus_tactics: "Studying Caucasian Tactics"
 TRK_studying_caucasus_tactics_desc: "In the months following the conclusion of the Great War, there were many in both the Russian and Ottoman armies who saw that the tactics employed by both sides in the Caucasus front were woefully out of date. Instead of listening to these young officers, both nations chose to blame the local populations, unlucky weather, and a host of other excuses. We will not make the same mistake."

 TRK_court_moderate_clergy: "Court the Moderate Clergy"
 TRK_court_moderate_clergy_desc: "The moderate muftis of Tashkent and Fergana have long played a critical role in the maintenance of peace in our nation, often acting as mediators between the mutual hostility of the Uzbek and Kyrgyz tribes. We need to unite these moderate groups behind our government to stabilise our rule, for if the faithful do not see our government as legitimate it will not survive long."

 TRK_favor_yaushev: "Favor the Yaushev Brothers"
 TRK_favor_yaushev_desc: "The Yaushev family of minor Tatar nobility have long been one of the most influential metropolitan clans in Central Asia, with family members and contacts scattered across the Ural and Alash regions of Russia, as well as in the city of Tashkent. With the death of Mullagali Yaushev, his sons Iskander and Hasan have taken up the mantle of leadership among the Yaushev merchants. Their support could prove invaluable in the coming conflict against Russia."

 TRK_ties_deep_in_russia: "Create the National Security Department"
 TRK_ties_deep_in_russia_desc: "Our republic has no formal body devoted to clandestine activities, putting us at a disadvantage compared to the major powers, and most notably our Russian opponents. While we do not have the funds to create an intelligence outfit from whole cloth, we can use our Foreign Ministry to leverage their contacts and trading partners in foreign lands to help narrow the gap, just by keeping our ears open."

 TRK_favor_katta: "Favor the Ergash Brothers"
 TRK_favor_katta_desc: "While Kichik (Little) Ergash and Katta (Big) Ergash are not necessarily related by blood, they are certainly brothers in arms, fighting together in the struggle against the socialists. Neither man escaped unscathed, with Katta losing control over the Mujahideen and Kichik nearly losing his life. Regardless, these two men have forged deep connections among the Kurbashi, connections Madamin could leverage to secure control of his party."

 TRK_eliminate_party_factionalism: "Eliminate Party Factionalism"
 TRK_eliminate_party_factionalism_desc: "The Europeans have had a free hand in Central Asia for centuries, pitting brother against brother to further their own imperialist ambitions. In our struggle against the Russian menace, we have been shown what the true strength of our people could have been, were it not shackled by petty sectarianism and autocratic selfishness. It is time to rise above years of stagnation and division, so that we may forge a new nation."

 TRK_tashkent_city_fathers: "Amend the Tashkent Treaty"
 TRK_tashkent_city_fathers_desc: "While officially Tashkent is the capital of our young Republic, the reality is slightly more complicated. Having negotiated significant autonomy during the Tashkent Crisis, the city is largely self-governed by a council of Muslim and Russian figures, with only marginal input from Madamin Bek's government. With a hungry Russia on the borders, the time has come to renegotiate the Treaty and bring Tashkent into the Republic fully."

 TRK_reaffirm_anti_bolshevik_pact: "Integrate Russian-Led Militias"
 TRK_reaffirm_anti_bolshevik_pact_desc: "The Fergana Provisional Government was founded on the back of an alliance between the Muslim People's Army of Madamin Bek and the Russian Peasant's Army of Konstantin Monstrov, an alliance which saved Turkestan from Soviet rule and kept the peace. The victory of the Whites undercut the foundation of the alliance, but with the new rise of Savinkovism in Russia there is a new opportunity to unite the peoples of Turkestan against tyranny!."

 TRK_reconstructing_turkestan: "Reconstructing Turkestan"
 TRK_reconstructing_turkestan_desc: "Years of war and neglect have left their mark on Turkestan, with crumbling infrastructure connecting the empty factories of our dilapidated urban centres. The foundations for a healthy nation remain, however, hidden behind a pessimistic veneer. If we could once again stoke the fires of industry and mend the railways and roads, Turkestan could truly rise as a modern nation."

 TRK_exploit_petrol: "Exploit Petroleum Deposits"
 TRK_exploit_petrol_desc: "Our republic sits atop a significant wealth of petroleum deposits, most which remain entirely untapped. While there were some half-hearted efforts to exploit these resources during the rule of Mustafa Shokay, we lack the resources and know-how to properly develop this industry. We will need to look outwards to larger, more industrialised, nations if we want to begin collecting this black gold."

 TRK_focus_on_heartland: "Connecting the Heartland"
 TRK_focus_on_heartland_desc: "Long have we found favour among the merchants of our cities, and long have we tailored our policies to retain their support. When the great men of Tashkent and Kokand prosper, all of Turkestan prospers…especially those worth bribing. Word travels fast among merchants, and there are many cities scattered across the steppes whose monied men who fast join us in our crusade against the backward autocracy and violent revolution."

 TRK_syr_darya_gold: "Syr Darya Gold"
 TRK_syr_darya_gold_desc: "The Syr Darya River dominates Turkestan, with it and its tributaries feeding the lush Fergana Valley with fresh water. The river does not only bring cool waters to the farmlands of Turkestan, but also carries gold deposits across the plains, driving an economy of collection and exploitation. Unfortunately, local warlords who funnel the wealth of this literal goldmine into their private armies and personal stashes. We will have to shake this system up if we hope to stake our own claim."

 TRK_building_a_war_chest: "Building a War Chest"
 TRK_building_a_war_chest_desc: "It is a universal truth that wars cost blood, sweat, and most importantly, gold. Our goal in the upcoming conflict is to bleed out the Russian bear through a prolonged guerilla war, but if we wish to outlast our enemies we will need deep pockets and well stocked arsenals. By taxing our new sources of revenue and carefully saving our earnings, we can be much better prepared for the violence to come."

 TRK_meet_with_kurbashi: "Host the Andijan Summit"
 TRK_meet_with_kurbashi_desc: "During our fight for independence, some took up arms to protect their families and their homes, a simple struggle for survival. On the other hand, others felt the draw of a more holy cause, pledging themselves as warriors of Islam. These figures have the potential to be zealous allies if we convince them of our support, and dangerous opponents if we turn our backs to them."

 TRK_form_professional_army_core: "Form a Professional Army Core"
 TRK_form_professional_army_core_desc: "The biggest hurdle towards modernising the military of Turkestan will be the centralisation of the army into a core of professional national units. While Madamin has a personal army of loyal cronies to draw from, no other Kurbashi would willingly give their soldiers to an army which may one day be used to destroy them, and few able bodied men wish to serve in an army which does not reflect their own tribal allegiances."

 TRK_integrate_militia: "Arm the Militias"
 TRK_integrate_militia_desc: "It is no secret that our army is little more than an amalgamation of small bands of soldiers, loyal only to their commanders and bound by bonds of tribal heritage, rather than national or civic duty. These commanders, the Kurbashi, each follow their own whims and morals, bound by covenants of greed and personal gripes far beyond any supposed ideology. It is by the will of these men that the army of Turkestan be born or die in the womb."

 TRK_horsemen_of_turkestan: "Horsemen of Turkestan"
 TRK_horsemen_of_turkestan_desc: "Turkestan has a long history of talented horse breeders and horse riders, and though the culture of horsemanship is not as prevalent in the Fergana Valley as it is on the steppes further north and east, there are still clear lessons to be learned from our legacy. The modern role of the horseman is increasingly clear - while cavalry charges will no longer define battles, information gleaned from talented scouts and outriders is more important than ever to achieving victory."

 TRK_inspect_ottoman_inspectorate: "Inspect the Ottoman Army Inspectorate"
 TRK_inspect_ottoman_inspectorate_desc: "The Ottomans have put a great deal of effort into modernising their equipment and tactics since the end of the Weltkrieg. Their Army Inspectorate, which works tirelessly to organise the dysfunctional logistics running from Anatolia to Fezzan, is a shining example of this spirit. We should look to replicate their successes, and avoid their mistakes."

 TRK_supply_the_outposts: "Supply the Outposts"
 TRK_supply_the_outposts_desc: "Our armies are divided between local Basmachi commanders and militia chiefs, some armed with little more than spears and matchlocks. If we hope to resist foreign invasion, we will need to share the wealth of the capital with these far flung outposts, supplying these commanders with rifles and arms. Hopefully, such actions could help to further our control over the countryside."

 TRK_from_bribes_to_salaries: "From Bribes to Salaries"
 TRK_from_bribes_to_salaries_desc: "While efforts have been made to institutionalise the patronage networks and informal relationships which serve as the bedrock of our administration, the truth is that our nation still largely plays by feudal rules. Now that we have sufficiently centralised our governance, we have the opportunity to burn out the rot and rebuild our Republic, from top to bottom, as we see fit."

 TRK_begin_wartime_rationing: "Wartime Rationing"
 TRK_begin_wartime_rationing_desc: "While we are loathe to restrict the buying and selling of foodstuffs and key war materials, it is a necessary sacrifice we will have to make to strengthen our defence and keep our war machine limping along for as long as we can. All of our citizens will do their part to make sure our soldiers march on full(ish) stomachs, and that the armouries and arsenals of Tashkent remain well(ish) stocked. To this end, the war begins on our plates - and every household is a squadron of fighters!"

 TRK_proclaim_holy_war: "Proclaim Holy War"
 TRK_proclaim_holy_war_desc: "Our lands are truly united by one thing - the glory of our faith. The Ulemma have long been a guiding force of stability in Central Asia, and with the support of these wise fathers of the faith, we will be able to officially sanction our war against Russia as a Jihad of the sword. This is not an undertaking we will carry out lightly, but is there no better example of Jihad than the struggle against foreign domination, and the destruction of our very way of life?"

 TRK_rely_on_sufi_orders: "Rely on the Sufi Orders"
 TRK_rely_on_sufi_orders_desc: "While the Sufi Orders are religious institutions of the study and transfer of mystical teachings, all in the pursuit of haqiqa - the ultimate truth - there is no question that they are also powerful institutions for the mobilisation of men. We will need their wholehearted support and conviction if we hope to resist our enemies in the field. It is lucky for us, then, that a number of our leading figures are all leaders of various Sufi chapters."

 TRK_banner_of_the_amir: "Banner of the Amir"
 TRK_banner_of_the_amir_desc: "When Kichik Ergash nearly perished at Namangan, the spirit of the national movement did not die with him. Instead, his banner - demanding freedom for the people of Fergana - found its way into the hands of Madamin Bek. The president accepted the weighty responsibility weaved into this banner because he, like all the patriots, freedom fighters, and true believers riding with him, knew that Turkestan is worth fighting and dying for."

 TRK_strengthen_the_party: "Strengthen the Party"
 TRK_strengthen_the_party_desc: "The Union of Muslims was the first mass party in Turkestan, calling upon the support of the vast Muslim peasantry long before the National Union was founded or the Russian yoke thrown off. Today, it is largely the vehicle for Madamin Bek's national movement for independence, but continues to stand as the voice of the common person in Turkestan. We must not forget the role of the party, it is a critical symbol of our unity and commitment to native democracy!"

 TRK_reorganize_the_garrisons: "Reorganise the Garrisons"
 TRK_reorganize_the_garrisons_desc: "While many of our Kurbashi have argued that the only way we will defeat Russia is by taking the battle to them, the truth is that to survive against Russia we must take full advantage of any and all defensive advantages afforded to us. We will centralise local garrisons under the umbrella and control of the central government, so that we can better coordinate the disposition of our forces and prepare for the attacks which will surely put our walls to the test."

 TRK_create_wartime_coalition: "Create a Wartime Coalition"
 TRK_create_wartime_coalition_desc: "There is little love lost between Madamin Bek and his Union of Muslim party, and the liberal and progressives of the National Union party. However, the recent alliance between our government and the party's exiled Kazakh leader has provided the avenue for a true wartime agreement between these parties and the full normalisation of relations, which have been decidedly rocky following Madamin Bek's coup in 1929."

 TRK_begin_the_revolt: "March for Samarkand!"
 TRK_begin_the_revolt_desc: "Some wars are fought for inscrutable reasons, complex webs of factors leaving historians to debate minutiae for the centuries to come. This is not one such war. The people of Samarkand beg to be freed of that corpulent Bukharan Emir, and we will answer their call. The cheers of the liberated quicken our march and the wails of the oppressed drive us forward!"

 TRK_returning_our_favors: "Return of the Kyrgyz Volunteers"
 TRK_returning_our_favors_desc: "The nucleus of the East Turkestan revolt was forged in the revolutionary spirit of Turkestan proper, with many leading figures in the revolt driven from their homes during the fires of the Urkun. Now, a group of Kyrgyz irregulars led by Id Mirab have sent word from their remote bases in the Tian Shan foothills that they wish to join our struggle. We shall invite them as heroes!"

 TRK_the_fergana_porcupine: "The Fergana Porcupine"
 TRK_the_fergana_porcupine_desc: "To succeed in this war of survival against our Russian foes we must change our thinking, attacking the Russian resolve, as well as its armies. By focusing on attriting the Russian invaders, and smuggling the “true” details of Russian casualties to international sources, we will force Moscow to recognise that Turkestan will cost them more blood and treasure then they can afford to spend."

 TRK_rapid_adaptation: "Rapid Adaptations"
 TRK_rapid_adaptation_desc: "While we did our best to prepare for the realities of a protracted conflict against Bukhara and Russia, it did not take long to recognise serious deficits in our strategy and organisation. By drawing on our relationship with foreign advisors, we can identify a few key areas to invest additional funding and effort, alleviating our worst inadequacies."

 TRK_deal_with_leftover_russians: "Deal with Leftover Russians"
 TRK_deal_with_leftover_russians_desc: "While there are even less ethnic Russians who happily call Turkestan their home now than there were prior to our war with the Russian bear, they still exist as an active minority with political and economic influence beyond what their numbers would betray. We will need to secure their right to live and work in our nation, while gently subsuming their outsized political control."

 TRK_crush_bukharan_exiles: "Crush Bukharan Exiles"
 TRK_crush_bukharan_exiles_desc: "A great number of Bukharan military and political leaders have fled across the border to Afghanistan, where their King harbours and protects them from any form of retribution, even as they raid our bordering towns. We will need to deal with them one way or another, either by negotiating with our Afghani counterparts or by simply crossing the border ourselves to take care of these dangerous dregs of the late puppet Emirate."

 TRK_behead_the_bandits: "Behead the Bandits"
 TRK_behead_the_bandits_desc: "Where there is war, there are those who profit off of the misery of the combatants. Bandits can range from those who know their station, attacking the innocent with reckless abandon to eke out a living at their country's expense, to those who are even worse - bandits who disguise themselves in the pomp and circumstance of ancient and forgotten titles, excusing their robbery behind cruel traditions."

 TRK_secure_our_borders: "Secure our Borders"
 TRK_secure_our_borders_desc: "Twenty years ago, there were few who believed that our proud lands would ever be free from the yoke of foreign masters. Today, our nation's mothers can breathe easy as militias return to their villages and well worn rifles are sent back to storage. The time of national emergency has passed, but the unfortunate truth is that the fires of war lurk on the horizon. The only way to guarantee our peace is to prepare for the next war, honing our abilities and remaining vigilant."

 TRK_expand_the_conservative_coalition: "Expand the Conservative Coalition"
 TRK_expand_the_conservative_coalition_desc: "All across Central Asia, millions believe in the righteousness of moderation, stability, and tradition. However, these people are divided by their tribe, their language, and the very traditions they seek to defend. Regardless, we must welcome this new cadre of citizens and leaders into the Union of Muslims, so that we may continue to be the leading voice of all Central Asian Muslims."

 TRK_divide_the_leftists: "Divide the Leftists"
 TRK_divide_the_leftists_desc: "In the cities, men tainted by poisonous foreign philosophies attempt to unseat thousands of years of history by the stroke of a pen. They brandish the outrageous quotes of dead men as though they were weapons, and threaten to tear apart all that is sacred. To prevent the insidious rise of this “National Union,” we must move to undercut their support by dividing the two wings of this dangerous party of radicals."

 TRK_draft_a_presidential_constitution: "Draft a Presidential Constitution"
 TRK_draft_a_presidential_constitution_desc: "We are still working off of the constitution written by the intellectuals of 1919, who envisioned Turkestan as an autonomous parliamentary republic under the Russian boot. We must reform the constitution to better reflect what our young nation needs, a strong and decisive executive to watch over a subordinate and steady federal legislature, both organs working in sync."

 TRK_develop_national_turkism: "Develop National Turkism"
 TRK_develop_national_turkism_desc: "Long have the conversations surrounding Pan-Turkism been dominated by progressive and left-wing voices, while the more conservative elements of our republic remain divided by ethnic sectarianism. We will need to forge a new national identity, centred around our shared faith and the binding forces of recent history. This new ideology of 'National Turkism' will be the glue which binds our people together, and in time will be able to call upon the support of committed ideologues."

 TRK_formalize_limited_federalism: "Formalise Limited Federalism"
 TRK_formalize_limited_federalism_desc: "Our nation is divided between Russian and Turk, Uzbek and Kazakh, Tribesmen and Jadid. The strife of violent conflict threatens to tear our people apart, but we cannot give in to the base desire to overpower and dominate those territories newly incorporated into our republic. We shall instead build a nation of balanced compromise between order and autonomy, founded on the principles of fruitful coexistence."

 TRK_exercise_executive_powers: "Exercise Executive Powers"
 TRK_exercise_executive_powers_desc: "A key element of the powers vested in the presidency through the new constitution is his unilateral control over foreign policy, and his expansive formal influence over the nation's economic policy. While the government has always revolved around Madamin Bek, it is always better for these powers to be institutionalised and for the president to truly have a free hand to dictate the republic's path."

 TRK_moderate_statist_reorganisation: "Moderate Statist Reorganisation"
 TRK_moderate_statist_reorganisation_desc: "If we are to survive and prosper in this new epoch, we must pursue industrialisation and modernisation. As odious as it is to some, to meet this challenge the state will need to intervene in the development of our railways, our manufacturing, and our modern farming. We will look to socialist nations and the work of the Ottoman modernisers to model our own ‘Turkestani Industrial Revolution.'"

 TRK_marshal_turkestans_resources_desc: "Central Asia is a bountiful land, one which has the tools and resources to supply our young industries, so long as we are able to access and properly excavate these natural boons. We must not allow petty local grievances to prevent the progress we seek, and we cannot afford to rely on foreign companies to lead our resource extraction efforts as some in the past once did. We must instead stand on our own two feet and dig with our own two hands."

 TRK_care_for_the_countryside: "Care for the Countryside"
 TRK_care_for_the_countryside_desc: "Nearly all of our citizens live in rural communities, eking out a living farming and grazing. While much of our land is harsh and barren, there are fertile regions of bounty which can serve as a new breadbasket for the Turkestani state, no longer sucked dry by hungry bureaucrats and merchants from Moscow. We must extend support to the farmers of Fergana and the River valleys, so that they may modernise their techniques and increase their production!"

 TRK_assimilate_panturkist_rhetoric_desc: "Not everyone in our government truly believes in the pan-Turkic ideal which our Federation was founded upon. They may see the necessity of cooperation, or even the value of our unity during the struggle against the Russians, but they do not subscribe to the cultural and civic nationalism of the more ardent pan-Turkics. Regardless, we see the value of the pan-Turkic ideal towards the maintenance of peace and stability in our lands, and will relentlessly promote these views."

 TRK_humour_the_education_reformers: "Humour the Education Reformers"
 TRK_humour_the_education_reformers_desc: "Chagatai Turkic was the shared language of our realm for centuries, but in the last two hundred or so years local dialects have diverged sharply from their now archaic origin. However, there is a cadre of brave intellectual thinkers who believe that, with the proper modernisation and implementation, we could once again forge a shared language, modelled on Chagatai but not beholden to some of its most difficult quirks."

However, without the proper guidance, our Republic could be subverted by demagogues who mislead our citizens into acting against their own interests. To protect against this, we will temporarily maintain the martial law which saw our nation through these difficult last years."

 TRK_fund_the_sufi_orders_desc: "Many of the leading figures within our republic, the President included, have long standing ties with the Sufi Orders of the region, especially the Kadyriya chapter centred in Fergana. These tariqas - meaning order or teaching tradition - are central to the practice of Islam within our nation, and our continued support of their goals is unquestioned. By increasing our funding of and legal support for these orders, they will serve as a bedrock of our local support across the Republic."

Now more than ever the people need a symbol they can look to for strength and honour, a light guiding the whole nation forward. The Amir may just be a man, but his title is invested with the power of the great Caliphs, of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, and of the old Khans of Kokand - power which should be used to hold our country together! "

 TRK_pragmatic_warlordism: "Pragmatic Warlordism"
 TRK_pragmatic_warlordism_desc: "When you rule over a vast territory of harsh lands and harsher people, you cannot afford to be blinded by ideology. Our goal must be that of a united and peaceful republic, bound by a universal rule of law and beholden to democratic leadership. In reality, much of the land is ruled by Kurbashi tribal commanders, and most of our people are uneducated and detached from the world outside their village. These issues will be resolved by pragmatism, not idealism."

 TRK_ensure_governor_loyalty: "Ensure Governor Loyalty"
 TRK_ensure_governor_loyalty_desc: "Some people would say that the best way to rule over bandits is to think like a bandit. They are wrong. To maintain order in the southern territories, we will have to rely on firm military men that we can trust, lest the Uzbeks, Turkmen, and Kyrgyz get any ideas about where they stand on the pecking order. To ensure that our governors are both capable and loyal, they will be drawn from Madamin's personal staff."

 TRK_cast_aside_ideology: "Cast Aside Ideology"
 TRK_cast_aside_ideology_desc: "The minds of both our allies and our enemies are clouded by ideological dogma and impractical sentimentalities. Frankly, there is little room for such notions in our harsh domain. We have cast aside the philosophic creeds which blind others, and will rule instead through pure, hard-headed realism, whether the radicals like it or not."

 TRK_strength_in_stability_desc: "While the liberal intellectuals bicker about high-minded democratic ideals, the reality is that a federation of people, divided by language, ethnicity, and class, must be united by a firm hand. The politicians fret about the lyrics to a national anthem while they ignore the true issues which plague our state. Madamin Bek will serve as this guiding hand, leading our nation towards a bright future!"

### Ideas ###
 TRK_legacy_of_tashkent: "Legacy of the Central Asian Revolt"
 TRK_legacy_of_tashkent_desc: "We spent five decades under Russian hegemony, a time which irreparably damaged our culture and saw our lands infested with Russian settlers. In 1916, the people of Central Asia finally decided that enough was enough and rose up in rebellion. We fought long and hard, exploiting the Russians' civil war to retake our old territories. In the end, we finally regained our freedom but the price we paid was nearly unbearable. Huge portions of our population had been slaughtered, or deported from Central Asia, forced to seek refuge in the Chinese territory of Xinjiang. The Kirghyz population was particularly devastated by this, they came to dub this event the “Urkun” or “Exile”. A small trickle of refugees are now migrating back to Turkestan, hoping to return to their old homes. The Central Asian Revolt marked the birth of the Basmachi as an organised military and political movement, it served as the last straw which finally won us our independence. We will never forget what the Russians did to us and what they have taken from us. We will never bow to them again."

 TRK_shackles_of_tashkent: "Shackles of the Tashkent Treaty"
 TRK_shackles_of_tashkent_desc: "When we cast off the shackles of Russian oppression through a patriotic conflagration, we were forced to make a number of compromises to secure international recognition and bring an end to the Central Asian conflict. The Treaty of Tashkent forced us to grant de-facto independence to the Russian-dominated districts of our capital. and clauses within the treaty gave special rights and privileges to Russian interests throughout our Republic. Reclaiming our rightful capital and its vast industries will be of utmost importance in the near future, we must strive to strike at the Russians, at their first moment of weakness."

 TRK_basmachi_army: "Basmachi Army"
 TRK_basmachi_army_desc: "The term Basmachi is an Uzbek word for a bandit or attacker, a label employed by the Bolsheviks and White Russians alike to slander the freedom fighters who battled for Central Asian freedom. Though these warriors earned the respect of their opponents on the battlefield, our nation continues to be derided by foreigners as the “Basmachi Republic,” and the stain of warlordism and banditry will take a long time to wipe clean. The bravery of our soldiers is a source of pride for our Republic, regardless of what they may say abroad."

Truly, we have stepped into a new era of native Russo-Turk cooperation! Economic regulation, once aimed entirely at choking out native Turkic industry, has been replaced by common sense regulation, and the outrageous byzantine structure of autonomous government has been replaced by the executive fiat of the Tashkent Council.

With practical protections to native business interests and peasant farmers, the people of Turkestan, both Russian and Turk, stand proud behind Madamin Bek. Our new, comprehensive agreement has made our republic stronger and more united than ever."

These loose bonds of affiliation hold the nation together today, but simply cannot withstand the stress of open conflict. After all, when the peace of the post-war was shattered by the New Year's Coup in '29, Shokay's autonomy immediately collapsed into civil war. While Madamin Bek has a much tighter grasp over Turkestan than his predecessor, the Republic remains incredibly divided.

 TRK_country_intro_content: "At the opening of the Russian Civil War, Bolsheviks in the city of Tashkent, the hub of Russian controlled Central Asia, rose up in support of the Red Revolution, ousting the Russian colonial government and declaring the Turkestan Socialist Federative Republic. In response, liberal nationalist and pan-Turkist political movements declared rival governments, aiming to secure autonomy and democratic representation in return for loyalty to the Whites.\n\nIn Kokand, a group of liberal Jadid elites formed the Turkestan Autonomy (dubbed the Kokand Autonomy, as it was based in Kokand rather than the Bolshevik dominated Tashkent), led by Kadet and Alash notable Mustafa Shokay. While the Red forces in Tashkent had the initiative to begin with, rapid nationalisation campaigns and a lack of vital grain shipments quickly eroded their support among the peasantry, both Russian and otherwise.\n\nWhile the White forces in the north began to consolidate and secure their positions against the Reds, the various factions of the Fergana Valley shifted their allegiances. Ergash Bek's lieutenant, the moderate figure Madamin Bek, was able to forge an alliance between the Russian Peasant Army of Fergana and the Basmachi Movement. This new coalition army captured the cities of Osh and Andidzhan, though Ergash Bek was gravely injured in the siege of Andidzhan, leaving Madamin Bek as the undisputed head of the White movement in Fergana. Meeting the White forces of Pishbek, Madamin was recognised by the White government as the commander of the newly formed Fergana Army, made from a reconstituted Peasant Army of Fergana."
 TRK_country_intro_content_1: "With the Civil War coming to a close, the newly formed Constituent Assembly in Moscow officially recognised the Alash and Turkestan Autonomies, granting limited political privileges to the democratic governments in power in Alash-Qala and Kokand in return for continued Russian control in the region. The Turkestan Autonomy was granted de-jure control over the former Fergana, Syr Darya, and Samarkand Oblasts, while the Transcaspian Oblast remained under direct control of the Russian governor in Ashgabat. To oversee Russian military and economic influence in the region, the military commands were unified under the Commander of the Turkestan Military District, who projected the authority of the central government from his posting in Tashkent. With the power of the authorities limited to little more than minute regulations and meaningless squabbling, cities like Samarkand quickly turned to the Tashkent Command rather than the Commissar of Turkestan for support and stability.\n\nWith the close of hostilities, the old conflicts which had brewed underneath the surface of the Central Asian Whites bubbled back to the surface. While the liberal government of the Turkestan Autonomy was recognised as official by the new government in Moscow, Mustafa Shokay, Madamin Bek, and Konstantin Monstrov each fought to wrestle dominance over this new governmental apparatus. Though it appeared at times that the arguments would devolve into civil war, the three powers would eventually be able to create a power-sharing agreement which gave the majority of civilian control to Shokay and his progressive Shuro-I-Islam alliance, while granting Madamin personal control over much of the Fergana Valley and integrating most of the warlord armies into the new Automony's army, allowing Madamin to maintain his military supremacy.\n\nFor Monstrov and the Russian peasants, a series of treaties were drafted which gave Russian settlers and the Russian quarter of Tashkent some special privileges, while also tying the Autonomy closer to the economy of the Russian heartland. While Madamin and his close relationship with the Russian soldiers and merchants was instrumental in reaching this accord, he was shrewd enough to allow the civilian government to take credit for what would quickly be seen as unequal and hated treaties, driving many moderate Muslims from the Shuro-I-Islam to Madamin's allies in the conservative Shuro-I-Ulema."
 TRK_country_intro_content_2: "When Boldyrev launched his New Year's Coup in Moscow, the peace in Central Asia shattered. Vladimir Dmitriyevich Grigoryev, the Commander of the Turkestan Military District pledged himself to the putschist cause (assuming that the putch had Kornilov's support), along with most of the Russian soldiers stationed in the region, namely the Semirechye Cossacks and a significant portion of the garrison in Tashkent. Seeing this as an opportunity to secure true independence, Madamin rapidly assembled an army of loyalist Russians and Basmachi warriors and marched on Tashkent. Rapidly garnering the support of several key Jadid and Russian figures in the city, Madamin was able to rapidly depose the rebel commander and secure the city.\n\nWith the situation in Russia proper unknown and an army of loyalists at his back, Madamin crossed over the Rubicon, declaring himself President of a new Turkestan Republic. While Mustafa Shokay and his allies initially attempted to resist this declaration, they were forced to flee into the Alash Autonomy when forces loyal to Madamin captured Kokand in a surprise attack.\n\nIn the frenzy following the Tashkent Coup, local commanders loyal to Madamin Bek moved to secure contested regions and to depose Russian governors in Samarkand and Semirechye. Alash forces, which had remained loyal to the civilian government, had already clashed with the Cossacks in Semirechye. With Madamin's forces joining the fray from the south, the Cossacks were crushed and the region was divided in two as small raiding parties and warlord bands battled for disputed pockets of land. Samarkand would prove to be a more elusive prize for Madamin, who had collected a significant portion of his most loyal armies to march on the city. Sensing an opportunity to expand his influence, Emir Alim Khan declared himself the “Protector of Samarkand,” intervening in the conflict. Seeing the devastation of Semirechye, the city accepted the armies of Bukhara into their gates, and the leader of the Emir's armies, the disciplined Ibrahim Bek, began to prepare for a siege. Worried of a Russian or Alash attack from the north, and recognizing a hardened foe to his south, Madamin called off the invasion of Samarkand and prepared to defend his newly won territories."
 TRK_country_intro_content_3: "Madamin Bek was able to stabilise his regime, focusing on transitioning from an upjumped warlord to a genuine political statesman. To this end, he aligned himself with the urban merchants of Tashkent, bringing many of them into his nascent cabinet which would give his government a distinctly technocratic character, balancing this new group against the loyalty and satisfaction of the Ulema and Kurbashi, the foundations of his support. His willingness to settle with the Russians and pragmatic support for civilian government would serve to alienate him from some of his Basmachi warlord underlings, but he used the years of peace to purge disloyal officers and build an army more loyal to Madamin personally.\n\nRecent years have found Madamin growing more and more paranoid of Russian aggression, especially as reports increasingly indicate that Moscow eyes the borders greedily. Believing that only a unified Central Asian nation would stand a chance against the Russian eagle, Madamin Bek has increasingly subscribed to a pragmatic Pan-Turkist position, perhaps a further reflection of his increasing cooperation with the liberal merchants and Jadids. Using these ideological trappings, Madamin has begun escaping from the diplomatic isolation wrought by the Tashkent Crisis, notably forging clandestine ties with anti-Russian figures across the northern border and in Khiva."

 trkrep.99.t: "Legacy of the Central Asian Revolt"
 trkrep.99.d: "When Mustafa Shokay negotiated Turkestani autonomy with his Russian counterparts, he sacrificed much to prevent the ire of the central government in Moscow. Ignoring the years of diligent service against the Red menace, the Russian government held the Basmachi fighters in contempt and did much to chip away at the autonomy's control and authority. When political instability in Moscow threatened to disrupt Turkestan, Madamin Bek rose up to cast off the yoke of Russian oppression, and to forge a new independent republic in Central Asia, ousting Shokay and his progressive regime and clawing away limited territorial gains in Semirechye. While Madamin Bek was initially supported in his revolt by the wild Turkmen commander Junaid Khan, intervention by local Russian garrisons and the corpulent Emir of Bukhara forced him to the negotiating table, leaving Turkestan isolated and insular, and Madamin Bek's position uncertain.\n\nIn recent years, Madamin Bek has been able to stabilise his regime, focusing on transitioning from a warlord to a genuine statesman. To this end, he has further aligned himself with the urban merchants and trade unionists of Tashkent, bringing many of them into his nascent cabinet, giving his government a distinctly technocratic character. Balancing this new group against the loyalty and satisfaction of the Ulemma, the foundation of his support, Madamin Bek's control of the republic grows while his control of his party loosens. His willingness to settle with the Russians and pragmatic support for civilian government has served to alienate him from some of his Basmachi warlord underlings, but he has slowly isolated and eliminated some of his most zealous opponents.\n\nRecent years have found Madamin Bek growing more and more paranoid of Russian aggression, especially as reports increasingly indicate that Moscow eyes the borders greedily. Believing that only a unified Central Asian nation would stand a chance against the Russian vulture, Madamin Bek has increasingly subscribed to a pragmatic Pan-Turkist position, perhaps a further reflection of his increasing cooperation with the liberal merchants and the Jadid education movement they bankroll. Using these ideological trappings, Madamin has begun escaping from the diplomatic isolation wrought by the Tashkent Crisis, notably forging clandestine ties with anti-Russian figures across the northern border. Only time will tell, however, whether Madamin Bek's revolt against Russian domination of Central Asia will survive the weary eye of the awakening bear."
 trkrep.99.a: "For a Free Turkestan!"

 trkrep.100.t: "The Reshuffle"
 trkrep.100.d: "For the last six years, Turkestan has been led by the Ittifaq ul-Musilmin, a quasi-party of religious leaders, warlords, and tribal chiefs. From his position as president, Madamin Bek has balanced the whims of these various groups, awarding loyal subordinates and allies with ministerial posts and punishing sedition with demotion. In many ways, the maintenance of the nascent Republican institutions has been Madamin Bek's greatest achievement in his short tenure as leader of the nation, and while there are few who would call Turkestan a true democracy, that does not mean the voice of the people is not heard. It is just usually ignored!\n\nIn the last couple of years, however, new voices have grown louder from within the party. Some are the former cronies of the exiled Mustafa Shokay, who adequately kowtowed to Madamin Bek and his new government, while others are loyal members of the party who rode with our movement from the beginning. They all clamour for a great Pan-Turkist revolution, one led by Madamin Bek and aimed at uniting the whole of Central Asia against the Russian yoke. While this group began as a small band of outsiders, they can no longer simply be ignored. Recently discovered corruption (beyond the usual, acceptable corruption, of course) has provided Madamin Bek the political capital to sack two aging conservative ministers, giving him the opportunity to shuffle his government and introduce fresh blood. He has decided that prominent reformists Alihan Tura and Eshon Babakhan will take on the coveted positions of Foreign Minister and Minister of Sharia, respectively, finally giving the reform faction of the party a voice in his government.\n\nTura and Babakhan have immediately set to work reorienting the Republic towards their goals. They hope to strengthen our relationship with Turkmen leader Junaid Khan, reform the relationship between our Russian and Turkic citizens, and to open the door to allow more progressive clergymen into the lower levels of our bureaucracy. Whether they will meet all of their targets is yet to be seen, but Alihan Tura has already departed for Khiva and Eshon Babakhan works tirelessly to take a census of our Qazis."
 trkrep.100.a: "A new direction for the Republic!"

 trkrep.96.t: "The Turkestani Balancing Act"
 trkrep.96.d: "When Madamin Bek came to power in 1929, it was at the head of a large and unwieldy coalition of those dissatisfied with the stagnation and weakness of Mustafa Shokay's Turkestan Autonomy. He is beholden to village chiefs, Kurbashi captains, wise and unwise mullahs, and his ethnically Russian allies, and can only rule through the careful balance of these groups and the construction of consensus. Madamin Bek has spent the last seven years slowly chipping away at the traditional conduits of power, building a cadre of loyal party-members centered around his even keeled political ideology and a nascent cult of personality. After all, there is only one man who has been able to curry the favour of merchants and mercenaries, village beks and highland bandits, Russian industrialists and radical Mujahideen.\n\nMadamin Bek has the opportunity to reform the Union of Muslims Party and Turkestan as a whole, but to do so he must deal with the disparate wings of the party. The reformists, led by Alihan Tura, push for the dismantlement of military power in the civilian government and the eventual peaceful transfer of power to a more parliamentary government. The fundamentalists, led by Katta Ergash, have instead pressured Madamin Bek to disband the National Assembly and to concentrate power in the hands of the military defenders of the nation. Madamin Bek must balance these forces and strengthen his hold of the country if he wishes to survive a conflict unscathed."
 trkrep.96.a: "Tell me about these fundamentalists"
 trkrep.96.b: "Tell me about these reformists"

 trkrep.97.t: "Beks and Kurbashi"
 trkrep.97.d: "The traditional axis of power in the fundamentalist wing of the Union of Muslims and the region as a whole has long been the village chiefs and tribal leaders, commanding the personal respect and loyalty of their kinsmen far beyond any notions of civic obligation or ideological duty. The countryside of Turkestan is dominated by a patchwork of small hamlets, each led by a prominent figure titled 'Bek', an honorific meaning lord. Like the 'Beys' of the Ottoman Empire, many leading figures in Turkestan go by their title as chief, such as prime minister Madamin Bek, who was born Muhammad Amin. Some of these Beks took up arms during the violence of the last decades, gathering loyal cadres of relatives and friends to defend their homes from bandits and socialists. While some of these bands soon turned to banditry themselves, many coalesced around charismatic figures, who began titling themselves as “Kurbashi,” or leader of a band, or “Minbashi,” the leader of a thousand men. While the national military need for these warbands largely dissipated in the years following the Civil War, there is no question that the countryside of Turkestan is not ruled from Tashkent, but rather from the tents and houses of the innumerable Kurbashi warriors."
 trkrep.97.a: "Tell me about these reformists"
 trkrep.97.b: "They may need to saddle up again!"

 trkrep.98.t: "Progressives and Merchants"
 trkrep.98.d: "Outsiders look upon Turkestan with disdain and disgust, regarding our culture and people as backwards and ignorant. Of course, they are the ignorant ones, for the mark of the Islamic Renaissance and the great metropolitan Silk Road has left our nation with a powerful class of intellectuals and businessmen, who could debate the ear off even the most committed sophist. Starting with the widespread reform of the maktab schools, the progressives combined a modernist interpretation of religious texts with veiled anti-colonialism to create an ideology which demanded a modern and independent Turkestan. While some of these men aligned themselves with the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, many of them fell in behind Madamin Bek in his pursuit of a state guided by wisdom of Sharia. In recent years, Madamin Bek has increasingly invited many prominent Jadids and merchant families into his government, creating a civilian government which blends the conservatism of the Ulema with the progressive interpretation of Sharia proposed by the reformists. While the power of the civilian government is certainly limited, the Jadids and merchants maintain a huge amount of soft power in Turkestan, especially in the cities of Tashkent, Kokand, and Andijan."
 trkrep.98.a: "Tell me about these fundamentalists"
 trkrep.98.b: "Their cooperation is vital!"

 trkrep.101.t: "Our Treaties with the Russians"
 trkrep.101.d: "The conclusion of the Russian Civil War saw the construction of a new relationship between our region and the government in Moscow, forming Mustafa Shokay's Turkestan Autonomy. As the twenties rolled on, few thought that there would be much change to the status-quo. While the aging Basmachi and Jadid bickered, the Commander of the Turkestan Military District kept the cotton flowing north from his post in Tashkent. When Commander Vladimir Dmitriyevich Grigoryev marched his forces in support of an anti-government coup, the time was ripe for change!\n\nMadamin Bek dissolved the old autonomy and declared the independence of a new Turkestan Republic, before marching on Tashkent with an army of loyal patriots. When he got to the city, however, he found that General Grigoryev was already dead, murdered by loyalists, and that the Russians had largely demobilised and withdrawn to deal with the shockwaves of the failed coup. Meeting with elder merchants and leaders of Tashkent, Madamin forged an agreement which granted special privileges to the city in return for their loyalty. With his new territories secured and the Russian position in Central Asia rapidly deteriorating, Madamin was able to forge the Treaty of Tashkent with Russian agents, formalizing the sovereignty of Turkestan and his newfound dominion over the former heart of the now dead Military District, in return for continued Russian domination of trade and the humiliating recognition of Russian dominion over New Tashkent."
 trkrep.101.a: "Many compromises were necessary..."

 trkrep.102.t: "The Coming Storm"
 trkrep.102.d: "In comparison to the stormy days of the New Year's Coup, the last half decade has been a period of peace and stagnation, as all sides lick their wounds and hope to recover. Central Asia stands today as a pot teetering on the edge of boiling over, with intellectuals, bandits, revolutionaries, and despots all looking to carve away at the status quo. Across the borders, the Russian command staff draws out plans and calculates logistics, gleefully awaiting the moment when the humiliations of the Tashkent Crisis can be avenged, and generals champ at the bit, waiting for permission from their superiors to crush the autonomies and protectorates once and for all. It is only a matter of time before open conflict once again breaks out in Central Asia, and yet the armies and militias of the states found within the region are universally undisciplined, underfunded, and barely functional. It will take quite a bit of work to reforge peasant rabble and upjumped bandits into true armies, and one can only guess how each polity plans to reform their armies.\n\nHowever, there is one thing which is certain - §Rthe peace of ‘29 will not last.§!"
 trkrep.102.a: "The road to independence is paved by the army!"

 trkrep.103.t: "Black Monday Arrives in Tashkent"
 trkrep.103.d: "Nearly a month ago, the Stock Exchange in Berlin collapsed, wreaking havoc across global markets and damaging even the most isolated and distant economies. Most notably, the nearby economic hegemon in Moscow has been deeply wounded, as the ruble plunges in value and German and Austrian investment into the industrial market dries up. The investments made in Central Asia during the rule of Mustafa Shokay have tied our economy incredibly closely to that of Russia, with industrialists from Moscow, Petrograd, and Berlin bankrolling much of the construction in the cities of Kokand and Tashkent. With these figures rapidly abandoning their shaky investments in our lands, our loyal economy has all but frozen solid, but we have the opportunity now to resecure our economic sovereignty, after decades of foreign control. While the market for the cereals produced in the verdant Fergana valley has remained steady in the face of a global agricultural slump, the nascent cotton export market has been irreparably crippled by halted Russian interest. This is a moment of opportunity and danger in equal portions, and our government will have to tread carefully."
 trkrep.103.a: "We will need to rebuild"

 trkrep.104.t: "A Meeting with the Khivans"
 trkrep.104.d: "When Madamin Bek rose up against Russian domination, his only real ally came from an unexpected place, namely the Turkmen dictator of Khiva, Junaid Khan. While the Khivans officially maintained their loyalties to Russia in the peace which followed, Junaid Khan's march against the flailing Transcaspian administration and Alash Loyalists marked a key shift in Khiva's relationship with Moscow. In the years following, Junaid Khan's trusted lieutenant Aziz Khan has worked closely with our government, coordinating a plan of future resistance and building a network to funnel arms from Europe into the hands of the Basmachi commanders of Turkestan. Today, Khiva and Tashkent stand as the axis of a secret Central Asian liberation project, tempered only by Junaid Khan's Turkmen chauvinism and Madamin Bek's noncommittal attitude towards the pan-Turkism of many of his compatriots.\n\nMost recently, Aziz Khan and our new Foreign Minister Alihan Tura have met in the backrooms of the Khivan Khan's Royal Palace, hidden from the prying eyes and ears of Russian agents and Royalist spies. They used this meeting to propose a new round of coordination between the two rogue states of Central Asia, broadly centred around protecting against the increasingly hostile posture of the Russian government following the election of Boris Savinkov. These fresh negotiations are merely the latest in a series of diplomatic manoeuvres between our nations, which reached their zenith in November of 1935 with the Secret Pact of Assistance, a mutual assistance treaty forged in secret between the two nations by Alihan Tura (a feat which earned him his present role as Foreign Minister) in the wake of a particularly firebrand speech wherein Boris Savinkov called for the wholesale reversal of the Treaties of Tashkent. "
 trkrep.104.a: "His belligerence gave us the opportunity we needed."

 trkrep.105.t: "Turkestani Gold"
 trkrep.105.d: "While we lack much in the ways of industry, our lands are blessed with bountiful sources of gold, either mined by corvee labour in great open pits, or panned out of the great rivers which carry tonnes of gold dust out of the highlands each year. Much of this gold gathering infrastructure is controlled by a cabal of wealthy Kurbashi, who maintain their independence through regular and generous personal gifts to Madamin Bek, usually in the form of gold embroidered silk clothing, gold woven carpet, as well as beautiful gold jewellery fashioned by some of the finest zargar jewellers in Tashkent and Andijan. The sale of these products into Russia and abroad into the markets of Mitteleuropa has fueled Madamin Bek with vitally needed foreign capital, giving him a means to import specialised goods and fund foreign policy initiatives."
 trkrep.105.a: "Gold for a new golden age!"

 trkrep.106.t: "Expanding the Secret Pact"
 trkrep.106.d: "As we expected, Russian manoeuvres to shore up their control in the Khanate of Khiva have backfired with word just reaching Tashkent this week, detailing the bungled Russian diplomatic manoeuvre. They attempted to remove Junaid Khan's favoured Russian agent, General Ivan Zaytsev, who has long stood as the most solid nail holding down Russian control of Khivan politics. To have made such a move can only mean one thing - Moscow is looking to ruin their shaky relationship with their unhappy Khivan ally, presumably in an attempt to provoke them. It is now clear that Russia seeks to justify a conflict in Central Asia, and that the only way we will survive is through the continued expansion of the Turkestan-Khiva Secret Pact. Junaid Khan's trusted lieutenant Aziz Khan appears to agree with our appraisal, at least insofar as he has agreed to meet with us on short notice to discuss the Khanate's pivot towards closer coordination with our government.\n\nIn preparation, Alihan Tura has gotten the greenlight from Madamin Bek to pitch a radical new direction for our two nations. We would propose a large, public conference between the leading statesmen of Turkestan and Khiva, as well as dissidents, exiles, and rebels who share our desire for Central Asian cooperation and our firm stance in resistance to Russian domination of the region. In the days following the Christmas Coup throughout the chaos of the Tashkent Crisis, Junaid Khan and Madamin Bek coordinated their forces in indirect support of one another - why should they not stand together today, as Russia greedily eyes our lands and marches on our borders? A conference for cooperation would serve as the first step towards building a new Pan-Turkist liberation project, regardless of Junaid Khan's Turkmen chauvinism and Madamin Bek's noncommittal attitude towards his minister's idealism. Alihan Tura will invite Junaid Khan to personally attend this meeting so that he may once again meet Madamin Bek - hopefully the personal charms of Turkestan's president will be enough to convince the Khivan warlord to come on board, but regardless such a meeting will mark a new era of unity between our people! We need only to choose how we will approach Aziz Khan and the Khivans with our proposals - we want to entice their support, but we cannot appear to look weak by kowtowing too deeply towards the Khivans. After all, they need our help as much as we would like theirs."
 trkrep.106.a: "Sweeten the pot with additional arms deals and gifts!"
 trkrep.106.b: "Shout about unity all you want, but remember that this is an alliance of necessity, not desire."

 trkrep.107.t: "The Ballad of Mustafa Shokay"
 trkrep.107.d: "When the Tashkent Soviet marched on the newborn Kokand Autonomy in February of 1918, the then Minister-Chairman Mustafa Shokay fled north from the city, entrusting the defence of the city to its police chief Kichik Ergash and popular mullah Katta Ergash, a duo who, despite losing Kokand to the godless Reds, would go on to form the nucleus of the Fergana national liberation movement. As the Basmachi commanders bled and died in droves for Turkestan, Shokay spent his days rubbing elbows with Russian military and political figures, ingratiating himself to them as a ‘reliable native.' It was thus that when, two years later, the last vestiges of Bolshevik resistance surrendered in Perovsk, it was Shokay who the provisional government looked to for guidance and support. It was thus under Shokay's guiding hand that Turkestan spent a decade atrophying from Russian exploitation, as he repeatedly tried and failed to reach any sort of lasting political reform through negotiation with Moscow. That is not to say that Shokay was not a Turkestani patriot - as Moscow showed its disinterest in any form of reasonable or fair accommodation with the autonomy, he increasingly led the charge against Russian highhanded overreach, risking his position within the Russian backed National Union government to fight for true Turkestani liberty. Unfortunately, when Madamin Bek cut the Gordian knot of Russian intransigence with his march on Tashkent, Mustafa Shokay chose not to support this new independent government, instead fleeing north into the Alash Autonomy, where he today lives in exile."
 trkrep.107.a: "Perhaps we can convince him to rejoin our cause?"

 trkrep.108.t: "Turkestan Invites Us to Pishpek"
 trkrep.108.d: "Aziz Khan has informed us of a dramatic new development on our borders - the Turkestan Republic has proposed a grand conference of Central Asian leaders in their city of Pishpek, gathering all those who would oppose Russian domination in the region. While officially the conference's purpose is to negotiate comprehensive trade agreements across the region, it is an open secret that the leaders assembled will discuss much more than copper coins. In fact, Aziz Khan appears convinced that this gathering will lead to a true alliance against Russian domination among the people of Central Asia. He claims that we have had incredible success in dealing with Turkestan's Foreign Minister Alihan Tura in preliminary meetings to expand the limits of our Secret Pact with Turkestan, forged against Russia at the height of the Tashkent Crisis half a decade ago.\n\nWith our relationship with Moscow deteriorating rapidly following their arrogant moves against our independence, we will need to forge closer relations with our neighbours, especially Turkestan. However, Junaid Khan has personal concerns over tying ourselves to any other nation, especially a nation which has spurned the natural order of the world - with the ruled serving upon the heavens' chosen as a Khan - in favour Socialist notions of the ‘republic' and ‘elections.' What is to stop Madamin Bek from being voted out in favour of yet another Russian lackey in ten years' time? However, Aziz Khan is right about one thing, Khiva cannot afford to wait, sitting on its hands while Russia prepares an intervention. Whether our would-be allies are godless heathens or the khans of old reborn, we must meet with them to stand against Moscow. The only real question is whether Junaid Khan himself should attend. He is the undisputed ruler of Khiva, but is also advanced in his age and paranoid of some sort of foul play in foreign lands. He could just as easily send Aziz Khan as his agent, considering our lieutenant is very knowledgeable on matters of foreign affairs, and has worked closely with Alihan Tura in the last couple of months. He can be trusted to get us the guarantees we need."
 trkrep.108.a: "We will go to Pishpek together!"
 trkrep.108.b: "Better to be safe than sorry - send Aziz Khan with my orders."

 trkrep.109.t: "The Pishpek Conference"
 trkrep.109.d.trkjk: "The assembly was a diverse patchwork of men hailing from various tribes, countries, and walks of life. Fergana and Khorezm Kurbashi sat muttering in small huddles, while rival intellectuals from Samarkand and Tashkent eyed each other warily. Men of the Alash Autonomy, in equal numbers liberal statesmen and hardened soldiers, sat stoically together, joined by a quiet agent from the Ottoman government. In the back of the room, a rough looking band of exiles hailing from Xinjiang talked tersely amongst themselves. Junaid Khan sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by his couriers, looking decidedly uncomfortable. All would turn to attention once Madamin Bek laid out his plan for the future of Central Asia: while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table.\n\nBefore he could move forward in his attempts to convince the other attendees, however, Alash commander Sadyk Amanzholov rose to speak. According to the Kazakh militia leader, there was a widespread conspiracy brewing in his Russian controlled homeland, with significant portions of the Alash Party and militia leadership looking to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. Amanzholov claimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nImmediately the various parties began excitedly discussing the viability of such an endeavour, and how the various groups present would need to help to bring it to fruition. It was not long before the outlines of a coordinated uprising in the same vein of the 1916 revolution had been drawn up, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. As discussions continued, more and more parties began proposing various schemes and ventures the alliance could undertake to better unify the nations and groups involved. Of course, such schemes require funding, and the question remains as to how much the Turkestani Republic will contribute."

 trkrep.109.d.khinojk: "Aziz Khan sat quietly in a dingy, smoke-filled back room of the Pishpek Teahouse, growing increasingly excited. He was surrounded by a room full of exotic strangers. To his left, a gaggle of dusty looking Kazakh officers, joined by the proteges of Turkestani exile Mustafa Shokay, discussed strategy in hushed tones. To his right, wealthy merchants and a famed poet mused about the latest cultural developments in Samarkand, and behind him veterans of the Urkun, swapped war stories. Aziz Khan was by no means an uncurious man, and his ear wandered into the various conversations, picking up hints and bits from various different groups before a sudden hush fell upon the room. Madamin Bek had arrived, quickly launching into a grandiose presentation of his plans for Central Asia.\n\nHe argued that while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table.He had just begun explaining how those assembled could contribute to such a cause when Sadyk Amanzholov, Alash Party insider and commanders of Kazakh militias, rose to speak, proclaiming that significant portions of the militia leaders and Alash Party members looked to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. Furthermore, he claimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nThe news hit Aziz Khan like a bullet - if what Amanzholov claimed was true, the combined forces of Turkestan, Khiva, and the Alash rebels stood a serious chance of bleeding the Russians dry on the steppes.  It was not long before the outlines of a coordinated uprising in the same vein of the 1916 revolution had been drawn up, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. As discussions continued, more and more parties began proposing various schemes and ventures the alliance could undertake to better unify the nations and groups involved. Of course, such schemes require funding, and the question remains as to how much the Khanate of Khiva will contribute - while Junaid Khan will likely be upset should Aziz Khan make serious commitments, he has some leeway to choose the level of investment their realm will pursue."
 trkrep.109.d.khijk: "Junaid Khan sat quietly in a dingy, smoke-filled back room of the Pishpek Teahouse, slowly growing impatient. Aside from his most trusted bodyguards and Aziz Khan, he was surrounded by strangers. To his left, a gaggle of dusty looking Kazakh officers grumbled, their ‘friends' from Turkestani exile Mustafa Shokay's Turkestan National Army looking uncomfortable next to them. To his right, chubby merchants and writers fretted in chittering tones about some new play making waves in Samarkand, while behind him rough looking exiles from Xinjiang complained loudly about some inconvenience. For the Serdar Karim of Khiva, this social bombardment was far more deadly than the artillery barrage his fighters faced outside Urgench or the hail of gunfire he braved at the walls of Petro-Aleksandrovsk. Luckily for the Turkmen general, the room would hush upon the arrival of Madamin Bek, who immediately set about laying out plans for their new shared mission.\n\nThe plan he painted was simple - while Russia could easily crush any individual attempt to dislodge their grip on Central Asia, if the disparate regional resistances pooled their strength they would present a difficult enough foe that Russia would be forced to the negotiating table. Junaid Khan had serious doubts about the benefits of Madamin Bek's vision, but the equation was turned on its head when Kazakh commander Sadyk Amanzholov rose to speak. According to Amanzholov, there was a widespread conspiracy brewing in the Alash Autonomy, with significant portions of the Alash Party and militia leadership looking to break ranks with the Autonomy's leadership to stand against Russian domination. It was Mustafa Shokay who had drawn him to Pishpek, but now that he was here Amanzholov proclaimed that in as little as two years he would be ready to lead the Kazakhs to freedom by overthrowing the pro-Russian government - a spark which would likely lead to Russian intervention.\n\nClearly excited by these new prospects, the various bodies began discussing the hows and whens of any such coordinated uprising, along with the provisions which would underline a new secret defensive alliance, not only between Khiva and Turkestan, but also with this new Kazakh Conspiracy. Junaid Khan could not help but begin to drift away from the room, and back to the battlefields which surely awaited them all. Either he would save the Turkmen people in battle, or doom them to an eternity of Russian slavery. He was brought back to the present by Aziz Khan whispering in his ear, asking him how much the Khanate could afford to invest into the new alliance."
 trkrep.109.a: "We'll give them whatever you think is reasonable."
 trkrep.109.b: "An investment into this alliance is an investment into our freedom!"
 trkrep.109.c: "Be frugal! We will not put more into this than what we get out."
 trkrep.109.e: "Investments? This is an alliance, not a company. We will invest on the battlefield!"

 trkrep.110.t: "Our Frontman in the Alash Autonomy"
 trkrep.110.d: "When we signed ourselves to the support of the Kazakh patriots within the Alash Autonomy, we opened the door to the complex web of interpersonal and political relationships within this grand officers conspiracy. While nominally allies, and personally friendly with one another, Mustafa Shokay and Sadyk Amanzholov are diametrically opposed in their vision of the future of the Kazakh people. Shokay is a true believer in a unified federal republic of all Turkic peoples in Central Asia, modelled after German and American federalism, and believes that should the allies of Pishpek succeed in their goals, they should join together to form a country powerful enough to stand up to the domination of the region by foreign powers. While Amanzholov shares his desire to maintain the independence of the future Kazakh Republic, he is clearly less interested in any form of unification, coloured by Kazakh nationalism instead of Shokay's Pan-Turkist inclinations.\n\nThese conflicts of ideology have trickled down into all of our dealings with our erstwhile Kazakh allies: to whom do we send support? In the last months, we have focused much of our aid to Shokay's Turkestan National Army, as old ties between Shokay's exiles and our countrymen have been revived by the recent warming of relations and the expansion of our domestic Pan-Turkist propaganda. Shokay has welcomed these investments with open arms, and has proposed a number of further opportunities for cooperation between his personal army and our northern Kyrgyz Kurbashi. Amanzholov has privately reached out to us, requesting that we limit our future aid to Shokay and his allies, explaining that the rapid expansion of the Legion has worried Alash loyalists and Russian spies, and that Shokay was struggling to plausibly deny his recent alliance with us. Behind this potentially reasonable excuse, there is the matter of Alash politics, as Amanzholov potentially feels threatened by the growth of Shokay's power as a force in the Autonomy not subordinated to his command. On the other hand, we generally agree with the stalwart militia commander, as Shokay is a slippery fish, and empowering him further may give him increased leverage to cause trouble in the future."
 trkrep.110.a: "Shokay is our closest ally in the Autonomy, give what he needs."
 trkrep.110.b: "Amanzholov is right, let's focus on our own soldiery."

 trkrep.111.t: "Focusing the National Security Department"
 trkrep.111.d: "When Alihan Tura took control of the foreign ministry, he was realistic about the resources available to him - his was a poor ministry in a poor nation. However, increasing focus on the ministry has resulted in some new pockets of funding to be carved out to specific missions, hand selected by Madamin Bek himself with the approval and guidance of Tura. The most recent foray into expanding the foreign ministry has been the National Security Department, a new group with a nebulous purview but the zealous support of Madamin Bek. At the end of the day, the department could be oriented to serve one of two separate and opposite missions - either the expansion of Turkestan's clandestine network of informants and agents in the Russian controlled Alash Autonomy, or the strengthening of our domestic protections against foreign intrusion, namely from Russia. There is not enough funding to pursue both opportunities, and diffusing the money into both projects in a half-hearted attempt to have it all would likely lead to neither achieving the objectives that we set out. Alihan Tura has little love for this new department, seeing it largely as an attempt by Madamin Bek to inject some of the more ‘old guard' party men into Tura's new little reformist fiefdom (a fear that is probably accurate), and so he has not weighed in on the situation, perhaps hoping that without his intervention the Department will be shelved and the funds rolled back into the ministry as a whole. Without his guidance, it is wholly up to Madamin Bek to determine the direction this new group will take."
 trkrep.111.a: "Prioritise coordinating with our Kazakh allies."
 trkrep.111.b: "Focus on protecting our leaders from potential attacks."

 trkrep.112.t: "Where do Russians Fit in a Pan-Turk World?"
 trkrep.112.d: "To say that Madamin Bek has a tumultuous relationship with the majority of his Russian citizenry would be an understatement. To most, he is the man who overthrew Shokay's “Russian-friendly” government and began a cooldown with Moscow that saw their businesses suffer and their livelihoods called into question. However, the last five years has seen the mood among Turkestan's Russians warm to Madamin Bek: he granted significant privileges and accommodations to his Russian friends, and those most angry about his rise left to return to their homeland. However, even the most loyal of Tashkent's Russians are concerned by the recent outpouring of Pan-Turk sentiments from Madamin Bek's government, seeing this new native nationalism as a threat to the delicate balance forged between the Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Sarts and the comparatively tiny Russian community in the Republic. While obviously our intention was never to alienate our Russian citizenry, there's no doubt that all of our propaganda espousing the virtues of ‘Unity Among Turks' and' Turks Standing Together' have ruffled some feathers, especially as tensions have risen between Turkestan and Russia proper. Of course, the vast majority of ethnic Russians living in Turkestan are loyal only to their homeland, but there are some who see this nation as their opportunity to carve out a little Russia in their image of the nation, a springboard by which change might be exacted in Moscow or a petty fiefdom in their own image. For them especially, the new emphasis on Pan-Turkish is threatening, and Madamin Bek must find a way to bring them back into the fold."
 trkrep.112.a: "Personally assuage these key leaders of their doubts."
 trkrep.112.b: "Tone down the more questionable rhetoric."

 trkrep.113.t: "The Pishpek Pact Grows Closer!"
 trkrep.113.d: "While officially, the Pishpek Pact is a binding agreement allying Khiva and Turkestan, the truth is that the two nations are not particularly unified in practice or purpose. Driven together by their shared hatred of Russia and, to a lesser extent, Bukhara, there is little love lost between Junaid Khan and his fiercely independent autocratic monarchical regime and Madamin Bek, whose rule is cemented by limited democratic allowances and a nascent republican Pan-Turkic ideology. Despite their significant differences, recent developments have allowed the two nations to more closely coordinate with each other. One never knows when something as simple as a meeting and handshake between two minor Kurbashi will pay dividends, when and if the two men are thrust together into a desperate defence or hopeless assault. Supply lines supplement one another, ammunition is traded to supply weapons equipped by one side or the other, and key phrases in Turkmen, Uzbek, and Tajik are exchanged, strengthening our armies and our resolve. These small improvements, added together, are beginning to be noticed throughout our nation."
 trkrep.113.a: "Together, we will stand tall against Russia!"

 trkrep.114.t: "The Cover"
 trkrep.114.d: "The smoke filled teahouse at the centre of Pishpek has always been a meeting place for a diverse group of peoples, with the city sitting in the midst of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek tribal lands. However, today the teahouse has been graced by men from all corners of Central Asia, along with a few brave or curious Russians. Outside, a wizened old aide from Madamin Bek's office quietly ushers a sharply dressed journalist and his photographer  through a rear door into the building. They have been sent south by a middling Petropavlovsk paper to cover the “Sart Merchants' Meeting in Pishpek,” aiming to generate the sort of dry meaningless drivel that businessmen with too much time on their hands tend to read. The journalist is guided through a couple of rooms filled with mustachioed merchants abuzz with discussions of denars and trade deficits in mixed Russian, Uzbek, and Sart. Finally, they were guided into a room with a few grizzled looking interviewees, who all droned on in monotones about cotton prices and rail expansions. Growing weary and worried that whatever story came from this Turkestani rathole wouldn't even catch the eye of the most tedious Petropavlovsk cloth merchant, the journalist couldn't help to inquire about a rumour he had heard on his way in - that the Turkmen dictator of Khiva, Junaid Khan, was in attendance.\n\nThe response captured his attention: while the Khivan leader would not take interviews and did not wish to be photographed, Junaid Khan was present, regardless of his interest in any of the trade deals being made here. He had supposedly joined the deliberations to symbolise his commitment to native cooperation and his rejection of Russia, and vocally hoped that the Russian people would take notice of his breaking with the Russian merchants of his court to travel to the heart of anti-Russian sentiment in Central Asia. The journalist couldn't help but perk up when he heard that Junaid Khan's manoeuvre was intended to ‘catch the attention of and anger the Russian people.' Manoeuvres like these tend to catch eyes and make money. Snapping a few hasty photographs, the journalist quickly but politely retreated from the tea house, hoping to catch the next train north. He had gotten his headline, and little else mattered.\n\nTwo rooms over, hidden behind a generous layer of wealthy bores, Madamin Bek addresses the motliest band of commanders, bankers, merchants, teachers, leaders, and chiefs that has ever been assembled in Central Asia, all eager to plot Russia's defeat."
 trkrep.114.a: "The Russians may be angry, but not for the right reasons..."

 trkrep.115.t: "Local Squabbles Reach the President"
 trkrep.115.d: "The foundation of the Turkestan Republic is a very carefully constructed network of regional administrators and governors, allowing local chieftains and warlords to manage their own affairs, usually without any direct interference from the central government. Whilst this has cleared up resources and time that otherwise would have to be expended on a more heavy-handed administration, it also means we don't have any concrete means to bring these local officials in line. Most are simply pledged to their own interests, or to the most influential Basmachi leader around.\n\nIn some cases, conflicts between local leaders grow heated enough to draw the attention of Madamin and his government. Recently, a village chief has resisted the frequent ‘requisitions' issued by his local warlord, leading to a violent squabble over their overlapping authority. The village chief has petitioned Madamin directly to intervene, as his village has been driven to starved resistance in the face of their Kurbashi's gluttony. Marching government forces against the warband of an unscrupulous but otherwise loyal Basmachi commander would send reverberations among Madamin's commanders, but ignoring the plight of oppressed citizenry would only strengthen the notion that Madamin is little more than an upjumped cutthroat himself."
 trkrep.115.a: "Intervene on behalf of the Bek."
 trkrep.115.b: "Allow the Kurbashi free rein."

 trkrep.130.t: "The Nature of the Secret Pact"
 trkrep.130.d: "The Secret Pact between Khiva and Turkestan is limited in scope, requiring the two nations to provide specific and limited forms of assistance to one another should they be threatened by Russian intervention, but stopping short of a real military alliance. However, in the months following the nations have added additional provisions and commitments, having most recently negotiated the transfer and distribution of their respective map covering the lands of their shared Bukharan neighbour and the surrounding area.\n\nAlong with these shared improvements to our military reconnaissance, the two men were able to settle a number of feuds simmering between the Kurbashi and Chiefs operating in the nebulous Syr Darya borderlands, and the Khivans have agreed to sell us a shipment of freshly smuggled small arms, snuck past the prying eyes of their Russian ‘advisors.' While these sorts of small agreements are a boon to us both, it is the hope of Alihan Tura that the Secret Pact is merely the foundation for a new, expansive alliance between our nations against the Russians. Frankly, based on the annoyance of Aziz Khan towards the arrogance of his Russian counterparts, it appears that it is only a matter of time before the Russians overplay their hand in Khiva, alienating Junaid Khan and giving us far more leeway to cooperate without the shackles of informal Russian overlordship."
 trkrep.130.a: "We can be patient for such a boon."

 trkrep.131.t: "Shokay Buries the Hatchet"
 trkrep.131.d: "Mustafa Shokay has today come down from the foothills of the Dzungarian Gate, a mountain pass which cuts through the Dzungarian Alatau mountain range along the border between Turkestan, the Alash Autonomy and Xinjiang, serving as the main trade corridor between China and western Russia. He has spent the last half of a decade building an army in the mountains, dubbed the ‘Turkestan National Army,' drawing recruits from his fellow Kazakhs of the Alash Autonomy, as well as exiles from Turkestan and those wishing to return from the ‘Urkun,' the violent expulsion of tens of thousands of Kazakhs and Kyrgyz into Xinjiang by the Tsarist government. Shokay has whipped these disparate groups into a relatively cohesive fighting force, funded by tariffs on the trans-Dzungarian trade and supported by Moscow, who was happy to have an ally planted firmly in this key pass.\n\nWe have long viewed Mustafa Shokay as a dangerous threat to our republic and his army in the hills as a Sword of Damocles hanging over us, too well fortified and supported to dislodge without great losses, but not quite powerful or dangerous enough to demand intervention. Regardless, recent developments have done much to throw our standoff into confusion, as Mustafa Shokay has reached out to Alihan Tura to request an invitation to our upcoming conference in Pishpek. While Madamin Bek has serious reservations about bringing his greatest rival back into the picture, Alihan has already accepted the former Turkestani statesman's request, inviting him and some of his closest allies to the meeting. The foreign minister has argued that Shokay has long struggled against Russian domination of the region, and were he to join our cause, he would rob Russia of a foothold in the Altai Gap, give us a hardened cadre of warriors, and give us a greater avenue to coordinate with other Kazakh dissenters. In fact, Shokay has already offered to extend our invitation to Kazakh officer Sadyk Amanzholov, a key leader within the Alash Autonomy well known for his increasing hatred of Russian rule."
 trkrep.131.a: "The past is the past - welcome him as a fellow son of Turkestan."
 trkrep.131.b: "We may forgive, but we'll never forget - keep this weasel under close watch."

### Post Unification ###

 trkrep.700.t: "Turkestan Stands Triumphant!"
 trkrep.700.d: "Few within our coalition thought we would ever defeat the odious Emir, the duplicitous Khan, and the oppressive Russian boot. Yet here we stand, looking out over a new dawn for Turkestan, one where the liberty and prosperity of our peoples can be secure.\n\nWith our victory has come expectations, with promises made in darker days coming due. The liberal wing of the Union of Muslims, our allies within the Jadid movements, and Mustafa Shokay's National Union Party, have remained silent to the gentle authoritarianism of our regime throughout the war, understanding that Turkestan needed a President vested in the extra-legal powers of the ‘Amir ul-Musliman' to survive the dangers of Russian intervention and intercommunal strife. Even Shokay, who fled our nation in the days following the 1929 March on Tashkent, chose to advocate loudly and stoically for Madamin Bek and the freedom he promised.\n\nWith our victory, this self-censorship has come to a precipitous end. Today the city of Tashkent clamours with demands for the end of martial law, the full return of civilian rule, and free and democratic elections. Both the Nation Union and Alihan Tura's bloc within the Union of Muslims clamour for elections, to ‘secure the stability of Turkestan and confirm the legitimacy of the government.’\n\nTheir desire for democracy is admirable, but surely these men understand that our republic is still deep in the throes of an emergency? The corpses of the Emir and Khan's regimes may still yet breed the flies of banditry and insurrection and the Russian bear looms large to our north - ever watchful for an opening. An election would be plagued by the lack of national unity, and stripping Madamin Bek of his emergency powers would provide an opening for foreign powers or domestic insurgencies to threaten our hard-won peace. Madamin Bek will need to decide now whether the republic will be founded around the glory and power of his leadership, or rather around the institutions of a new democratic order."
 trkrep.700.a: "We must respect the democratic process!"
 trkrep.700.b: "We cannot hold elections until stability is fully returned..."

 trkrep.710.t: "Unification with the Kazakhs?"
 trkrep.710.d: "The Kazakhs owe much to us - we helped to arm and organise them, we offered them asylum and staging ground for the Turkestan National Army. But it was Kazakhs themselves who ultimately liberated their nation. Sadyk Amanzholov's regime has greatly stressed equality with us, and tried to give the impression that the cause of Kazakh liberation is not subservient to our more militarily powerful regime. The Pan-Turkists, like Shokay, hold government positions, but Amanzholov has adopted more of a Kazakh nationalist stance as a way to consolidate power. \n\nTo us, this seems like a lack of vision. The Kazakhs obviously have their own noble traditions and culture, but from political-military point of view, we cannot remain divided. The Russians will return - and only a strong, unified Turkestan can stem the tide when they come, and if this is not possible, we at least we must have a permanent defensive alliance."
 trkrep.710.a: "There will be one, unified Turkestan."
 trkrep.710.b: "We shall respect Kazakh sovereignty and only strive for an alliance."
 trkrep.710.c: "Avoid it."

 trkrep.711.t: "Turkestan Proposes an Alliance"
 trkrep.711.d: "An offer has reached us from Tashkent. While it was initially expected that Madamin Bek would offer a unification between our two nations, he has perhaps seen the writing on the wall with regards to [KAZ.GetLeader]'s Kazakh nationalism. Still, Turkestan and Kazakhstan have much in common, and, more importantly, have shed blood together. All he proposes is a military alliance, which will safeguard the independence of the Turkic brothers, especially if the Russian army is to return - and make no mistake, it very likely will."
 trkrep.711.a: "Yes!"
 trkrep.711.b: "No!"

 trkrep.712.t: "The Kazakhs Accept Our Invitation"
 trkrep.712.d: "A handshake between [TRK.GetLeader] and [KAZ.GetLeader] has signalled the birth of a new defensive pact. Now and forever, the Turkic peoples of Central Asia shall seek their own path together, vowing to never again be subjects of Moscow."
 trkrep.712.a: "Great!"

 trkrep.713.t: "The Kazakhs Reject Our Invitation"
 trkrep.713.d: "[KAZ.GetLeader] has shown that he values himself over the shared prosperity of the Turkic peoples. He has thoroughly rejected our invitation for an alliance, making it clear that a unification is also off the table. It seems that Turksetan will have to be united by sword, not by pen."
 trkrep.713.a: "Those bastards!"

 trkrep.714.t: "Turkestan Requests Unification"
 trkrep.714.d: "Madamin Bek's government has come to [KAZ.GetCapital] offering an interesting premise: unification between our two nations. Tashkent has for some time been a hub for Pan-Turkic ideals, and it seems that they are intent on fulfilling a united Turkestan of all Central Asian states. The argument is simple: a united, Turkic Central Asia is much more suited to forge unity between our peoples, develop a prosperous economy and military. That being said, we have no obligation to join them. We could offer them an alternative, tying together the economies and militaries of our states without compromising our independence."
 trkrep.714.a: "Yes!"
 trkrep.714.b: "What about an alliance?"
 trkrep.714.c: "Absolutely not!"

 trkrep.715.t: "The Kazakhs Accept Our Invitation"
 trkrep.715.d: "The dreams of many enlightened Turkic intellectuals have finally come to fruition. [KAZ.GetLeader] has put his country above all else, and that the best course of action is to unify with Tashkent. Few believed that this day would come, but the strength and tenacity of the Turkic peoples have proven that anything is possible. The accession treaty has already been signed, and the prospects of the future are hopeful."
 trkrep.715.a: "Great!"

 trkrep.716.t: "The Kazakhs Reject Our Invitation"
 trkrep.716.d: "[KAZ.GetCapital] has made one thing clear: they are completely unwilling to 'sell out their independence to foreigners again'. With unification of the pen off the table, we are only left with one option."
 trkrep.716.a: "Those bastards!"

 trkrep.717.t: "The Kazakhs Counter with an Alliance"
 trkrep.717.d: "[KAZ.GetLeader] is not willing to unify our great nations, his government has made clear in negotiations. Still, the Kazakhs understand the equation - a military alliance, as well as economic ties, are necessary to safeguard Turkic independence."
 trkrep.717.a: "Yes!"
 trkrep.717.b: "No!"

 trkrep.718.t: "The Turkestanis Accept our Counter"
 trkrep.718.d: "Tashkent was satisfied with our counteroffer. We will fight together and die together once again - as separate nations, yes, but brotherly nations."
 trkrep.718.a: "Great!"

 trkrep.719.t: "The Turkestanis Reject our Counter"
 trkrep.719.d: "[TRK.GetLeader] was clear: only a united Turkestan can properly safeguard the independence of the Turkic peoples. If the Kazakhs will put their own selfish ambitions above that, there is no reason to negotiate any further."
 trkrep.719.a: "Those bastards!"

### Fired by Focus ###

 trkrep.1005.t: "Dealing with the Kyrgyz Hinterlands"
 trkrep.1005.d: "In the highlands of the far west, most of our subjects barely recognise that they are a part of a larger Republic, knowing nothing more than the lands and feuds surrounding their hamlet. Most of these tiny communities offer their taxes in goods to a local Kurbashi with clan and tribal affiliations, who uses their support to field their private army, perhaps sending a pittance towards the government in Tashkent if obligated by personal debt or pride. Some villages sit completely beyond the scope of our rule, beholden to no Kurbashi and answering to no one but their own chiefs. Many of the Kyrgyz tribes have little love or loyalty to our Republic, and would rather fight than bend the knee to what they consider to be a foreign warlord.\n\nThat's not to say that these tribes have no connection to the Kurbashi commanders of the east, with many often interacting with the Uzbek commander Kurshirmat and the Kyrgyz commander Muetdin Bek, two commanders with a degree of personal enmity towards Madamin Bek, and wavering support for his legitimacy as Amir ul-Muslimin.\n\nIn response to Madamin Bek's initiative to unify the armies of Turkestan, Kurshirmat has requested funding from the government to lead a new expedition into the eastern highlands, to bribe or browbeat the remaining holdouts of Kyrgyz independence. While the Kyrgyz warriors would be a great addition to our armies, Madamin Bek has little love for Kurshirmat, and would do anything to prevent him from gaining influence over even more bands of soldiers. Muetdin Bek would be a more reasonable commander for these wayward tribes, but with Madamin Bek's history of conflict with many of the Kyrgyz chiefs, it would take serious concessions to convince him to lead such a venture."
 trkrep.1005.a: "Send Kurshirmat on this expedition"
 trkrep.1005.b: "Why not send Muetdin Bek instead?"
 trkrep.1005.c: "We do not need more disloyal soldiers..."

 trkrep.1006.t: "Local Jadids Seek Protection"
 trkrep.1006.d: "Established around the turn of the century, the Jadid movement is a current of reformist thought among many Turkic intellectuals and progressives which advocates for the cultural reformation of Central Asian Turks through the revival of old Islamic teachings and the adoption of modern European technology and institutions. Though this movement is distinctly Islamic, the Jadids are largely opposed by the Ulema, who they call Qadimists, for upturning the traditional moral framework of Central Asia, while the Jadids largely decry conservative clergy and Sufi mystics for corrupting Islam and acting as self-serving elites. While the Jadids are far from a unified political movement, their use of modern media and grassroots activism has given them a vast army of supporters across Turkestan and Central Asia more broadly.\n\nWhen Madamin Bek liberated Turkestan from the weak rule of Mustafa Shokay's puppet government, many Jadids feared that a massive crackdown against the progressive elements of the republic would occur. Instead, many of these learned masters were brought into the framework of his new civilian government, developing into the reformist wing of the Ittifaq ul-Musilmin. However, many in Madamin Bek's army continue to view letters as sorcery and socialism as the work of the devil, making the teachers and thinkers of the progressive movement an easy target for banditry or harassment from independent Kurbashi. To further exacerbate this divide, some Jadid figures continued to actively agitate against Madamin Bek's enlightened rule, calling for him to step down in favour of free elections or the return of Shokay and his allies. With their words isolating them from our grace, many have come to recognise them as easily bullied, and a number of low level thugs and vagabonds have taken to extorting these figures, emboldened by a lack of government intervention.\n\nThe leaders of our civilian administration, Alihan Tura and Eshon Babakhan, are adamant that swift action should be taken to protect the remnants of the Shura-i-Islamiya and reestablish the rule of law in our Republic. Katta Ergash and the military wing of our government have countered, stating that these men turned their noses up at our offers of alliance a decade ago, and are now simply suffering the consequences."
 trkrep.1006.a: "Let Tura draft a law to protect them"
 trkrep.1006.b: "Let Babakhan draft a law to protect them"
 trkrep.1006.c: "Grant them informal protections"
 trkrep.1006.e: "Protect our enemies? Are you mad?"

 trkrep.1008.t: "Rise of the Novokyrgyz"
 trkrep.1008.d: "The Fergana Valley has long been the breeding grounds of world-renowned horses, with the blood of the legendary Argamak flowing in the veins of all Central Asian breeds. For this reason, a number of horses, ranging from the Russian Don to the English Thoroughbred, were forged in part from the lineage of the noble Turkomens, Kyrgyz, and Qorabayirs. More recently, an enterprising group imported fifty Thoroughbreds to a stud farm on Issyk Kul, crossbreeding them with Kyrgyzh mares to create a new breed which coupled the stamina and endurance of a Kyrgyzh, which descended from the great Mongol steppe horse, with the speed and agility of a racing Thoroughbred. This farm has found great local success with their "New" Kyrgyzh, or "Novokyrgyz," breed, refining sought after qualities through continued mixes between Kyrgyzh, Thoroughbred, and Russian Don crossbreeds. The development of the breed has been incredibly limited in the years following the Tashkent Crisis, however, as the necessary funding for the expansion of such a breed has been limited, to say the least."
 trkrep.1008.a: "An excellent initiative! Fund it."
 trkrep.1008.b: "Unfortunately, money is still tight"

 trkrep.1011.t: "Reaping the Black Gold"
 trkrep.1011.d: "Oil has been drilled and refined in the Fergana region for over fifty years now, with the first real oil wells in the region established in 1885 in the Shorsu area near Kokand. The kerosene produced by these wells would be brought to the cities of Tashkent, Kokand, and Andijan, carried on the backs of the camels and carts, supplying these cities and generating revenue in the region, as well as helping to fuel the first railway between Tashkent and Kokand. At the turn of the century the first major deposit of oil was discovered in Chimyon, another hamlet in the heart of the Fergana Valley. With the help from investment coming from the Nobel Brothers, whose oil empire was based out of Baku, the Chimyon field was developed with a number of wells and a local refinery plant, as well as the Vannovskaya Pipeline, which carried oil west, connecting Turkestan with the Azerbaijani oil infrastructure of Baku. While there was great excitement for the bright future of Turkestani oil development, the shock of the civil war, the disruption of British interests in the Azerbaijani oil market, and the economic stagnation of the thirties have left us with little progress beyond the marginal exploitation pursued decades ago.\n\nFollowing the models laid out by Ivan Gubkin in 1932 and with the assistance of old partners in Baku, we have begun a new wave of drilling and exploitation, mainly centred around Madamin Bek's base of support in Fergana. New wells have been built in Changyrtash, Nefteabad, and South Alamyshik, funded in part by Branobel and the Royal Dutch Shell Group, a resounding international vote of confidence in the security and legitimacy of our government and a lucrative source of taxable wealth. Using the pipelines which rule from our nation through Persia and into Azerbaijan, we are able to bypass Russian interference, though we are still beholden to the offensive taxes levied by the Bukharans, who allow our black gold to flow through their borders. While we would obviously prefer complete control over our vast reserves of natural gas and oil, these recent developments have brought us closer than ever before to the economic freedom we seek."
 trkrep.1011.a: "We will not let them drink our milkshake!"

 trkrep.1012.t: "Meeting with the Tashkent City Fathers"
 trkrep.1012.d: "When Russian Commander Vladimir Grigoryev declared his support for Boldyrev's New Year's Coup the tenuous thread of harmony between the Russians of Tashkent and their Muslim neighbours was rapidly unspooled. When Madamin Bek marched on the city at the head of a vast army of Kurbashi, however, he chose not to ride the wave of sectarian violence, instead reaching out to his allies among the merchants to broker a new peace between the Russians and Turks. The Tashkent Council was convinced to subordinate itself under the rule of Madamin Bek's new Turkestani Republic in exchange for pragmatic economic concessions and local autonomy, forging a political compromise which was instrumental in dissuading Russian intervention into Central Asia in the aftermath of the Tashkent Crisis.\n\nThe relationship between Madamin Bek and the Russian led Tashkent Council has since been relatively fruitful and peaceful, but dire times require difficult decisions. While the Tashkent Treaty has served us well in the last decade, we cannot stand to be divided when Moscow marches south. Luckily, the Tashkent Council bristles at the authoritarianism of the present Russian regime, worrying that should Moscow once again rule over Tashkent, it would not take long for a tin-pot dictator to attack them for their long standing cooperation with Madamin Bek and his government.\n\nThe de-facto leader of this group, former mayor Nikolay Mallitsky, has indicated that the council is willing to step back from many of the more onerous concessions of our Treaty to strengthen the ties between Russian and Muslim. Unfortunately, a few Russian politicians have manipulated rules of council procedure to prevent the reform legislation from being heard. They would almost certainly acquiesce if minor reforms were proposed, and could be swayed or cowed if pushed by the right people. However, some in our government have suggested that we arrest these obstructionists on suspicion of corruption, only for a few days, so that our allies in the council can push through an amendment to the Treaty. Of course, jailing these council members would be highly unpopular, and would require Madamin Bek to make use of his emergency powers as Amir ul-Musliman."
 trkrep.1012.a: "Mayor Mallitsky outmanoeuvres the dissenters!"
 trkrep.1012.b: "Gavrilov bribes the key obstructionists"
 trkrep.1012.c: "Let's push for limited economic amendments instead"
 trkrep.1012.e: "Jail the obstructionists and push the legislation through!"

 trkrep.1013.t: "Negotiating with Russian Officers"
 trkrep.1013.d: "Not long after the destruction of Kokand, Red forces in Central Asia were pushed out of the Fergana Valley, retreating back to Tashkent. For the average Russian peasant settler, this meant that the only remaining Russian authority in the region had abandoned them to the whims of the Muslim freedom fighters. While Madamin Bek treated these farmers with some respect, many Basmachi took to indiscriminately looting Russian settlements. In response, the Russian colonists banded together, electing retired Tsarist officer and miller Colonel Konstantin Monstrov as their commander. Seeing them as a useful tool against his Basmachi enemies, Konstantin Osipov (then Military Commissar of the Tashkent Soviet) recognised this new “Fergana Peasant Army” and sent them arms so that they may join him in the fight against Madamin Bek. In the following year both Monstrov and Osipov would betray the socialists and join the growing army of Madamin Bek, bringing much needed legitimacy to the Basmachi movement.\n\nIn the years following the end of the Civil War many Russian settlers returned or fled north to Russia proper, leaving only the most hardy or ingratiated figures behind. As more and more Russians left the republic, bodies once wholly controlled and operated by Russians – notable banks, the garrison of Tashkent, railway companies – became much more heterogeneous. In most cases organisations have become divided hierarchically, with native soldiers and workers led by Russians. Russian officers in the militias and garrisons understand their grip over their subordinates is tenuous, and have done everything in their power to retain control in the face of demographic realities. These remaining officers are wary of Madamin Bek himself, but the Turkestani president has always ruled through a vast patronage network, and he counts Konstantin Monstrov and Konstantin Osipov as valuable allies. Despite his advanced age, Monstrov holds significant informal control over the peasant militias, and Osipov has the ear of most remaining Russian officers in Tashkent. Madamin Bek could use their support to mollify the small cadre of Russian officers in the militias or garrison – either by convincing them to continue their support of Turkestan in the face of increasing tensions with Russia, or by forcing them out so that their native Turkestani soldiers can come under the comfortable control of Madamin Bek and his friends."
 trkrep.1013.a: "Use both Monstrov and Osipov to secure control over these disloyal groups"
 trkrep.1013.b: "Use Monstrov's grip over the militias"
 trkrep.1013.c: "Leverage Osipov's control of the Tashkent garrison"
 trkrep.1013.e: "Siphon off as much manpower as we can from these disloyal groups"
 trkrep.1013.f: "On second thought, leave them be"

 trkrep.1014.t: "The Andijan Summit"
 trkrep.1014.d: "In 1898, Sufi elder Muhammad Ali Madali led a movement of anti-Russian Turkestanis in the city of Andijan, surprising the local Tsarist garrison before being routed, quickly putting an end to the first true insurrection against Russian rule in Kyrgyz Turkestan. Now, decades later, the memory of the short-lived revolution lives on in the hearts of our citizens and our Basmachi fighters. After all, the reasons behind Ali Madali's revolt against the Russian yoke resonate very clearly with those who suffered through the last decades of Russian rule, and who rose up to finish the battle that these men began. These brave souls rose up, fought, and died to fight against the disruption of Sharia, the Muscovite meddling with zakat and wafd law, and the slow dissolution of traditional morals in families and communities across the region. Today, Madamin Bek has called for representatives from all of his hosts to meet him at the site of the old revolt, to settle disputes and discuss the future of the republic. While officially, a parliament of representatives meets in Tashkent, they serve as little more than an advisory board to the president. The true arbiters of Turkestan's fate are the Kurbashi and Khans who meet in informal gatherings, where they hash out disputes between their zones of influence, though none of these meetings have been as ambitious as Madamin Bek's present project.\n\nHe took the opportunity at Andijan to push forward a bold new platform to his commanders, demanding a new consolidation of power in his hands as Amir ul-Muslimin, to better prepare against the coming Russian tide. While there is a considerable amount of grumbling from many of the lieutenants in the face of Madamin's proposed reorganisation of Turkestan's army, the stalwart support of Katta Ergash Bek and a few well placed bribes has silenced all but the most audacious commanders. As the night progressed, however, a nucleus of dissent formed around the spirited Uzbek Kurbashi Kurshirmat, mainly revolving around Madamin Bek's proposed ability to press Kurbashi fighters into national units in times of emergency. Most view this power as a thinly justified breach of traditional rights, though few but Kurshirmat would dare to allege that Madamin Bek may use these newfound powers to bleed dry Kurbashi commanders who oppose him. While Madamin Bek cannot afford to back down from his radical reforms, some of his closest advisors have suggested elevating one of Kurshirmat's closest allies (and brother) Nurmuhammad Bek as Deputy Minister of Ordinance, a position which could serve to mollify Kurshirmat, but would mean extending his influence into even more elements of our administration."
 trkrep.1014.a: "Grant concessions to quell dissent"
 trkrep.1014.b: "Stay the course! We must bring them to heel!"

 trkrep.1015.t: "Choosing a Commander"
 trkrep.1015.d: "Flags and banners wave from overlooking windows and balconies, bombastic marching songs echo through the streets, and smartly dressed cavalrymen soothe their beautiful native steeds. Madamin Bek rides at the head of this column, his pride visible to all in the crowd, at least any who can see past the throng of his massive personal bodyguard. A decade ago, the president hid in farmhouses and caves, surviving off of the fruits of the land. Today, he stands flanked by a great modern army, the president of a proud and free republic, and the face of a grand Pan-Turkist resistance. This new “Army of the Republic” is structured unlike any other military force in the country, untainted by the stench of warlordism, with great resources and effort devoted towards bypassing the tribal cliques and sectarianism which has long held our nation back. It has a strong core of non-commissioned officers in the style of European armies, with a hierarchy of command based on merit rather than nepotistic relation, and is armed with the finest armament that smugglers can buy, with an organised logistical train. Truly, this new force is the finest yet assembled in Turkestan, the result of years of preparation and work.\n\nNow, the question on everyone's lips is who will lead this new, unified national army. While subordinating this new force under the command of a Kurbashi warlord may seem counterproductive to Madamin Bek's political goals, the truth of the matter is that the president has found himself increasingly preoccupied with his civil responsibilities, leaving him potentially unfit to efficiently lead his own army. Katta Ergash Bek is the most obvious candidate to lead in his stead, as he has long proven himself capable and loyal, regardless of his ties to the conservative elements of the republic. Some of the members of the civilian wing have pushed for Madamin Bek to take official command, and to then delegate his powers to the junior officers to better build a new, non-partisan, officer corps. Of course, others have pushed for the elevation of an outsider, the rebellious Kurbashi Kurshirmat. They have proposed that by bringing Kurshirmat into the court more fully, he could be monitored, controlled, and mollified. Of course, Madamin Bek could simply commit himself more fully to his role as commander, though this would potentially distract him as president and worry some of his more anxious lieutenants, who already view the centralised army as a threat to their powers and privileges."
 trkrep.1015.a: "Madamin Bek must lead personally!"
 trkrep.1015.b: "Katta Ergash is capable and reliable"
 trkrep.1015.c: "Kurshirmat is a bold leader, however unreliable..."
 trkrep.1015.e: "Perhaps the reformists are right..."

 trkrep.1016.t: "Conflict Among the Russians"
 trkrep.1016.d: "Generally, the ethnic Russians of Tashkent have remained a powerful minority within the Republic, organising around various political organisations and groupings, often sisters to leading movements within Russia proper (i.e. the SRs, Kadets, and Svobodniks all have small Tashkent branches). While many of the Russians who had settled in Tashkent and Fergana returned to Russia once Madamin Bek ended the autonomy and declared the Republic's independence, those who remained have become key players in the informal cooperatives and patronage networks which remain the bedrock of Turkestani politics. Konstantin Osipov, the once universally hated red commissar - turned Basmachi - turned government minister is one such example of the powers of informal power. From his position as leader of the  Union of Russian Veterans (SRV) and his seat as an SR party man he has solidified a large base of power in Tashkent, even as the Veterans retreated north and the SR voters largely disappeared, Osipov has found ways to remain prominent and useful to grease the wheels of Tashkent politics and business.\n\nOf course, he has long been buoyed by his personal relationship with Madamin Bek, whose side he fought alongside in the closing days of the Civil War. However, for every friend, Osipov has two enemies, and former mayor of Tashkent and leading conservative Russian leader Nikolay Mallitsky has launched a newly invigorated attack on Osipov's position within the Veterans Union, calling to question his actions in the opening of the Civil War and rallying support for his electoral overthrow. Madamin Bek is at a crossroads - while Osipov has long served as an ally, he is nothing if not dubiously loyal and ultimately entirely self-serving. Mallitsky, on the other hand, retains loyalties to Moscow, loyalties which could prove devastating in the near future. Of course, Mallitsky could presumably be convinced to make a deal: should the President campaign stringently on his behalf, he could be swayed over to official neutrality or tepid support for Madamin Bek's government."
 trkrep.1016.a: "Throw our support behind Mallitsky"
 trkrep.1016.b: "Protect our old friend Osipov"
 trkrep.1016.c: "Madamin Bek manages to play both sides"

 trkrep.1017.t: "The Old Bear Fends Off Challengers"
 trkrep.1017.d: "In the most glorious days of the Civil War, Madamin Bek marched alongside Russian peasant leader Konstantin Monstrov, an old miller who rose to the occasion to band together the Russian militias of the Fergana Valley into a formidable fighting force. While initially hostile to the reds and Basmachi alike, Madamin Bek would broker an alliance between his Fergana detachments and Monstrov's Peasant Army at the height of the Civil War, and Monstrov was named the Minister of Defence of Madamin Bek's Fergana Provisional Government, declared after their audacious victory together at Andijan. In the years following the reimposition of the Turkestan Autonomy and Madamin Bek's subsequent coup, Monstrov held court among the Russian settlers as the head of the Fergana Peasant Association, maintaining his position due to having Madamin Bek's ear. He has served as a valuable source of information for the government, channelling the grievances of the Russian farmers to Madamin Bek, and generally keeping them in line, even as the relationship with Russia proper grows strained.\n\nHowever, times have changed since the glory days of Andijan, and Monstrov grows weary and impotent in his elder years. A new figure, the wealthy tobacco farmer Mikhail Alekseyevich Gavrilov, has risen to contest his position as head of the Fergana Peasant Association, and has further vied for his informal network of patronage and control. While Gavrilov has little personal connection with Madamin Bek, he is a shrewd businessman, and has indicated that he intends to stake his business to Turkestan's success if Madamin Bek backs him, regardless of any future conflict with Russia. His deep pockets may come in handy should Madamin Bek need to “convince” Russian settlers that they should remain loyal to Tashkent over Moscow, a dubious proposition to say the least. On the other hand, Monstrov carries a legacy as a Russian who put his faith in Madamin Bek and was subsequently rewarded, serving as a symbol of Russian advancement to his compatriots, and he has a much deeper relationship with the serving president."
 trkrep.1017.a: "Defend Monstrov, he's young at heart!"
 trkrep.1017.b: "We could use some fresh blood like Gavrilov."
 trkrep.1017.c: "Keep our heads low and make no promises"

 trkrep.1018.t: "Reformists Achieve their Goals!"
 trkrep.1018.d: "When Madamin Bek elevated Alihan Tura and Eshon Babakhan into positions of power in his civilian government, it was clear that the short lived era of the ‘Cabinet of Kurbashi,' who dominated Turkestani politics immediately following Madamin Bek's coup, had run its course. This duo and their allies within the broader Reformist faction of the Union of Muslims has succeeded in actioning a number of the policies they had proposed to Madamin Bek last year to convince him of their viability within the government. With their recent successes, the role of the Reformists within Madamin Bek's government is firmly set in stone, and many of the loudest voices from the right criticising these ‘Turan radicals' have been silenced, either by the actions of the ministers or the firm hand of the president himself. To officially voice his approval for these recent developments, Madamin Bek has made a significant change within the ministries - pushing for the retirement of Minister for Military Affairs, Yormat Makhsum, a close ally of Katta Ergash from his days in Kokand. He has replaced this Kurbashi minister with his deputy, Bahrom Bek. Bahrom Bek is a famed Kurbashi known for his sympathy to Jadids and for his openness to reform and liberal ideals, which made him the most progressive member of Madamin Bek's government prior to his most recent appointments.\n\nWith the elevation of Bahrom Bek, the president has strengthened the hold of the Reformists to the point where they can seriously challenge Katta Ergash and his allies on some matters of policy, though Bahrom Bek is a consummate moderate, protective of the powers of the military ministry and uninterested in some of the new policies that Babakhan and Alihan have pushed for. Alihan Tura is particularly excited to have Bahrom Bek heading the Ministry of Military Affairs, as much of the funding that he has been able to scrounge up has been driven through the generosity of Bahrom Bek, who was happy to provide a small sliver of the military ministry's bloated purse to the scrappy reform minded ministers. With this new funding and support within Madamin Bek's cabinet, the Reformists are poised to make lasting changes to the republic."
 trkrep.1018.a: "So long as they remember who they work for..."

 trkrep.1019.t: "Turkestani Thermidor"
 trkrep.1019.d: "When Madamin Bek elevated Alihan Tura and Eshon Babakhan into positions of power in his civilian government, it was clear that the short lived era of the ‘Cabinet of Kurbashi,' who dominated Turkestani politics immediately following Madamin Bek's coup, had run its course. However, following disappointing results from these new reform minded leaders and cabinet ministers, it appears that the President's patience has run out. He has expressed his displeasure with these two figures not by firing or chastising them directly, but rather by shuffling the Deputy Minister of Military Affairs Bahrom Bek into Alihan Tura's Foreign Ministry. Bahrom Bek is a famed Kurbashi known for his sympathy to Jadids and for his openness to reform and liberal ideals, which made him the most progressive member of Madamin Bek's government prior to his most recent appointments.\n\nThis idiosyncratic Kurbashi minister has been replaced by the Mystic Sheik and renowned Kokand pugilist Islamqul “the Wrestler” Polvan, a protege of Katta Ergash. While Alihan Tura may be happy to have another capable and ideologically sound man in the Foreign Ministry, with a stroke of his pen Madamin Bek has cut the number of Ministries with reformist inclinations by a third, and even worse has put a close ally of the already powerful Katta Ergash in a leading position within what is arguably the Republic's most vital ministry. While this is far from the death of the new push for reform, it is clear that these reformists no longer have Madamin Bek's full confidence, and they will have to work doubly hard to secure the changes they seek. More pragmatically, because most of the government's money passes through the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Reformists ability to finance their policies has been significantly limited by the recent changes."
 trkrep.1019.a: "The Kurbashi once again descend on the ministries"

 trkrep.1020.t: "Tensions Flare in Old Tashkent"
 trkrep.1020.d: "The city of Tashkent has long been the fulcrum of power in Turkestan, and the tenuous support from its population allowed Madamin Bek to successfully liberate the realm of Mustafa Shokay's puppet regime. With the city split between various factions of Russians and Turks, however, the pot of sectarian strife simmers away, requiring near constant attention from Madamin and his lieutenants.\n\nJust recently, the mayor of the Russian administered section of Tashkent, Nikolay Guryevich Mallitsky, has come forward requesting support in the prosecution of a Muslim owned business. He claims that the owner has repeatedly ignored the laws and regulations of Russian Tashkent and snubbed any attempt to bring them in line, hiding behind his wealth and connections. While ignoring the law would set a bad precedent, the factory owner in question has a number of friends among the Muslim merchants of Tashkent, some of the key supporters of Madamin's regime."
 trkrep.1020.a: "The law is the law."
 trkrep.1020.b: "Perhaps some leniency is in order..."

 trkrep.1021.t: "Merchants Request Investment"
 trkrep.1021.d: "While the days of the bustling silk road metropolis are long past, there are still many in our realm who are in the business of taking a few silver tengas and turning them into a few more Russian rubles. Some of these petty bourgeois traders and stall owners produce refined goods, while others still facilitate the trade of the lucrative Uzbek cotton which passes through our cities. Traditionally, these figures found little other than disdain from the rulers of these lands, with the Russian snubbing native merchants in favor of their blood, and the bloodthirsty warlords having little time for figures and projections.\n\nMadamin Bek, on the other hand, has long been thought of as a friend of the merchants, and it was their support which secured his control of the cities at the height of the Central Asian Crisis. A group of beleaguered craftsmen, having heard of Madamin's interest in business, has come forward, proposing a government-backed tailoring venture. They claim that with some forward investment, they will be able to provide goods in support of our forces. There is always risk in business, however, and we are in a position where every cent counts!"
 trkrep.1021.a: "Give them what they need."
 trkrep.1021.b: "They ask for too much."

 trkrep.1022.t: "Returns on our Investment!"
 trkrep.1022.d: "It appears that our investments in the tailoring sector have produced significant returns! While the monetary returns are always helpful toward balancing the republic's stretched finances, more important is that Madamin may use this to secure his position as a merchant lord. As an added bonus, some of the materials which we have secured from the merchant families would allow us to equip our soldiers with actual uniforms, helping our armies to take on a more cohesive and modern look!"
 trkrep.1022.a: "Fantastic!"

 trkrep.1023.t: "Popular Commander Caught Smuggling"
 trkrep.1023.d: "During the heavy fighting of the Russian Civil War and especially during the tense fighting of the Tashkent Crisis, our reliance on regional commanders to lead our republic's armies proved to be invaluable. Without an overbearing central command, local units were able to outmaneuver their opponents and defend key locations, while remaining lean. In the years following the Kurbashi commanders became de-facto governors, carving the nation into fiefdoms and leaving the central government as little more than an intermittent distributor of arms for the various autonomous commands stretching out across the steppes.\n\nThere comes a time, however, when even absent oversight stumbles upon foul play. Recently, a talented and charismatic minor commander from the southern border has repeatedly reported that a number of their armaments were pilfered by a local bandit gang. While our initial inquiries into the region proved that a gang of well-armed smugglers did operate in the area, funneling our weapons into the hands of the Bukharans, more in-depth assessments of the situation found evidence that the commander was ‘misplacing' weapon caches in return for a cut of their ill-gotten gains. While some within our inner circle are calling for this commander's head, our evidence of foul play is tenuous at best, and this warlord, though duplicitous, is still a Kurbashi. If we were to move against him, we would potentially draw the ire of all of our lieutenants, especially considering few if any of them have clean hands..."
 trkrep.1023.a: "We cannot let such crimes go unpunished!"
 trkrep.1023.b: "Now is not the time to remove talented commanders!"

 trkrep.1024.t: "Dealing with Untrustworthy Merchants"
 trkrep.1024.d: "A not insignificant portion of our commerce comes from our trading relationship with Russia, and it is no surprise that the streets of Tashkent are filled with well-dressed Russian businessmen. Though these merchants remained largely apolitical at the height of the Tashkent Crisis, relations between our young government and Moscow have remained frosty, leading many to worry about the danger this monied fifth-column poses against our nation. Most recently, suspicion has fallen upon a small group of arms dealers, who have made a good living selling surplus European rifles to our government. Some of the more paranoid members of the military council have voiced their concerns about how close these Russian dealers have become to certain bureaucratic elements of our government, worried that information regarding our combat readiness has been slowly leaked to these dubious figures.\n\nOf course, the figures in our government closest to these dealers claim that no information has been shared with them, and go further to remind the government that most arms dealers are loyal only to their wallet. Our position is not enviable - by weeding out these merchants we would risk striping our government of a valuable source of decent quality arms, but by ignoring the security risk they pose we could expose ourselves to deeper infiltration by our enemies."
 trkrep.1024.a: "Better to be safe than sorry."
 trkrep.1024.b: "Sometimes businessmen are just...businessmen."
