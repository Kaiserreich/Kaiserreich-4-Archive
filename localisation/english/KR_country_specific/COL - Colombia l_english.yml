### Intro Screen ###
 COL_country_intro_background: "GFX_COL_intro"
 COL_country_intro_header: "Colombia's Place in the World"
 COL_country_intro_content: "Weakened by civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), Colombia had to acknowledge U.S. rights of control of the Panamá Canal in the Hay-Bunan-Varilla Treaty of 1903, ending the conflict between the two countries about the building of the Canal. When the Colombian Congress refused to ratify the treaty the United States forced the secession of Panamá from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total 25 million Dollars. Colombia formally recognised Panamá in 1921.\n\nThe conservatives pursued the modernisation of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850 Colombia had been exporting tobacco, after 1900 coffee and bananas were added (with the aid of U.S. capital), after 1905 petroleum. The liberals formed a government in 1930 which enacted a land reform, dispossessing big landowners, and social reforms, with economic benefits for the middle class, the workers' class and the peasants."

 colombia_events.2.d: "This year's Presidential election has begun and while it's predicted that the Liberal Party will continue control of the Presidency, the Conservative party can just as well win the post.
