### Parties ###
 GEO_totalist_party: "SKP"
 GEO_totalist_party_long: "Sakartvelos Komunisturi Partia\n§gThe Georgian Communist party was founded towards the tail end of the Russian Civil War by Bolshevik aligned Georgian nationalists and a handful of the Russian Communist Party's own agents within the country. It failed to gain any meaningful traction and saw heavy political repression in the aftermath of Georgia joining Germany's sphere of influence. It is a tiny, illegal organisation that mostly meets in secret, and has begun to broaden their views to form more esoteric combinations of Communism and Georgian nationalism, noticeably adopting several elements of Western European Totalism. Some members of the party maintain ties with the Sotsialuri Revolutsionerebi, in hopes of influencing the only legal far-left party in Georgia to adopt more Communist and Totalist oriented beliefs.§!"
 GEO_syndicalist_party: "SSP"
 GEO_syndicalist_party_long: "Sakartvelos Sindikalisturi Partia\n§gThe Syndicalist Party of Georgia are the ideological heirs to the late “Anarchist Prince” Varlam Cherkezishvili's political societies of the early 1900s, as well as the numerous impromptu factory committees which sprung up in Georgia during the Russian Revolution. It lacks any real coherent party structure and is simply a loose coalition of Pro-Internationale agents, radical trade unionists, and a handful of sympathetic mainstream politicians in the Sotsialuri Revolutsionerebi.§!"
 GEO_radical_socialist_party: "SR"
 GEO_radical_socialist_party_long: "Sotsialuri Revolutsionerebi\n§gThe Georgian Socialist Revolutionary Party was formed in the summer of 1918 by radical political figures who took a stand against what they perceived as weakness on part of the Georgian Mensheviks, particularly in regards to their commitment to women's rights and social justice, but especially in regards to their class politics, as the SR's feared that Georgia was squandering a valuable moment in history to fully commit itself towards revolution. In the aftermath of Georgian independence, the party mellowed its views to avoid censorship and suppression, and fear of drawing ire from the German hegemon. Both the Mensheviks and SR's in Georgia have maintained a distance from each other, never entering into an official coalition before, even if such a proposal has often been debated and discussed.§!"
 GEO_social_democrat_party: "SSDP"
 GEO_social_democrat_party_long: "Sakartvelos Sotsial-Demokratiuli Partia\n§gThe Social Democratic Party of Georgia, more commonly known as the Georgian Menshevik Party, emerged from two separate crises in the Georgian nationalist movement. In the late 19th century three groups emerged, fittingly dubbed the First, Second and Third Group, each with different ideas for how Georgian independence should be achieved. The Third Group, under the leadership of Noe Zhordania and Irakli Tsereteli embraced Marxist ideology and sought to meld Georgian nationalism with socialist beliefs. In 1903 the second crisis erupted, when the Third Group voted to join the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, despite the protests of prominent members like Noe Zhordania. This tenuous alliance did not last long, on the advent of the Russian Revolution many Georgia based members of the party decided to end their cooperation with the Russians, although some Georgians like Tsereteli remained faithful to Russian branch of the party. Zhordania emerged as the leader of the newly dubbed SSDP and helped establish an independent Georgian republic, guided by a mixture of socialism, humanism and nationalism, whilst rejecting the more extreme Bolshevik currents that had swept across the Eurasian labour movement.§!"
 GEO_social_liberal_party: "SSPSP"
 GEO_social_liberal_party_long: "Sakartvelos Sotsialist-Pederalisturi Sarevolutsio Partia\n§gEstablished in 1904, the Georgian Socialist-Federalist Revolutionary Party was initially derided by many of its leftist peers as a bourgeois party for the propertied class, but in time grew to appeal to both landowners and peasants, with a platform focused on agricultural issues. A critical moment emerged when the party leadership embraced violent revolutionary struggle, in line with the Socialist Revolutionaries' “Combat Organisation”, and began to endorse expropriations and violent reprisals against unjust landowners, despite condemnation from Georgian conservatives. This won them a great deal of support from the lower classes, and helped build a coalition with left-leaning and progressive parties throughout the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, the SSPSP joined forces with the Georgian social democrats and have been in a coalition ever since, but in time their agrarian focus has caused conflicts with the more urban, labour oriented policies adopted by the social democrats. It remains to be seen if the coalition can endure these disagreements.§!"
 GEO_market_liberal_party: "MMEP"
 GEO_market_liberal_party_long: "Mitsis Mesakutreta Erovnuli Partia\n§gThe National Landowners Party of Georgia is a splinter group of the National Democratic Party, and was initially known as the “Independent National Democratic Party”. As its current name implies, the party prioritises its political messages to appeal to large scale landowners and urban industrialists, as well as the nation's conservative and liberal intelligentsia. Even though it was initially formed by a schism within the NDP, its leaders have maintained an amicable relationship with their old colleagues, and cooperate in a Liberal-Conservative coalition in congress.§!"
 GEO_social_conservative_party: "EDP"
 GEO_social_conservative_party_long: "Erovnul-Demokratiuli Partia\n§gThe National Democratic Party is one of the oldest Georgian nationalist groups still in existence, having originally been founded by “The Father of Georgia”, Ilia Chavchavadze. In its first few years of existence it was nearly moribund, but in 1917 Spiridon Kedia alongside the elder statesman Niko Nikoladze led a revival of the party, and participated in the first Georgian elections as well as the Georgian provisional government. The party stood for the rights of the peasants, the moderate intellectuals and the traditionalists, against what they deemed to be a tide of radical socialist ideology, sweeping across Georgia. Although unable to stem this tide, the National Democratic Party nevertheless solidified itself as the de-facto leader of the opposition against Noe Zhordania's Mensheviks, consistently gaining more and more of an edge on him in recent elections. Following Ekvtime Takaishvili's ascent to party chairman, the National Democrats have also sought to cultivate stronger ties with their fellow agrarian minded parties, and opened up to the possibility of cooperating with Georgian monarchists to secure power.§!"
 GEO_authoritarian_democrat_party: "KTK"
 GEO_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Kartvel Traditsionalistta Kavshiri\n§gFounded some time after Georgia's declaration of independence, the Union of Georgian Traditionalists is a pro-monarchy lobbying group, largely dominated by members of the Georgian military and landed nobility. Various factions exist within the union, favouring either the idea of a German or native Georgian king to unite the country behind. The Georgian claimant George Bagration is ostensibly a member of the group, but the real mastermind behind the Bagration-Mukhrani dynasty's activism is his politically savvy son, Irakli. The germanophile faction is led by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the eccentric prince Georges V. Matchabelli. Although the union believes in establishing a constitutional monarchy, it has frequently been accused of trying to further the influence of the nobility in Georgia, or promoting German collaborators to higher positions of power. It maintains aloof ties with the more extreme, staunchly pro-Georgian Tetri Giorgi.§!"
 GEO_paternal_autocrat_party: "Tetri Giorgi"
 GEO_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Tetri Giorgi\n§gThe Patriotic Union of White George, which derives its name from the figure of Saint George, emerged from the German backed Georgian Independence Committee over disagreements about Georgia's future. The Committee, which was made up of numerous military men, cultural activists and nobles, had a staunch belief in establishing a free and independent nation that could revitalise the Georgian people's cultural identity, but were outraged when Germany began to impose more and more economic and political demands on the nascent state. Rejecting their former patrons, the Tetri Giorgi gathered in the 1920s and rallied to the cause of total sovereignty, believing in the establishment of a free Georgian state under the guidance of a monarch, or similar national figurehead. More radical members of the party have openly expressed admiration for the far right Legionary and Integralists movements in Europe, perhaps hoping to imitate their ascents to power.§!"

 GEO_pipeline_issue: "Re-Examine the Treaty of Poti"
 GEO_pipeline_issue_desc: "The Treaty of Poti is an agreement signed by the German and Georgian governments in 1918 to secure German protection and recognition of the new Georgian Republic. This came at a price however and Georgia was to allow Germany unfettered use of all Georgian railways and creating an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan. Perhaps it is time to reevaluate this treaty?"
 GEO_pipeline_seized: "The Treaty of Poti is Dead!"
 GEO_pipeline_seized_desc: "The Treaty of Poti was a shameful scar on Georgia and tied our nascent economy to the German robber-barons. While it may only improve our economic woes mildly, by tearing up the treaty and nationalising the oil pipeline we can send a clear message to our people and the Germans."
 GEO_kept_pipeline: "Stand by Germany"
 GEO_kept_pipeline_desc: "Germany, for all their faults, have stood by us since 1918 and kept the Ottomans at bay. It is an unfortunate and necessary evil we maintain our ties with the Reich so as to prevent even further economic collapse."
 GEO_nationalisation: "Nationalise Vital Industries"
 GEO_nationalisation_desc: "Many industries that are essential to the Georgian economy are ready to go under on account of the unprecedented crisis before us. We cannot allow this to happen and must nationalise them. It may be costly in the short-term, but there will be dividends in the long-run."
 GEO_farmers_fund: "Establish the Georgian Farmers Fund"
 GEO_farmers_fund_desc: "The agricultural sector of the country has been horribly hit and is rapidly falling. To prevent wide-scale collapse and poverty among Georgia's farmers we must step in to make sure they remain afloat with government subsidies."
 GEO_seize_companies: "Temporarily Seize Foreign Investments"

 GEO_dam: "Construct the Lajanuri Dam"
 GEO_dam_desc: "Lajanuri is home to a large reservoir and there have long been plans to construct a dam in the area. With Black Monday ravishing the economy and leaving many unemployed, by finally initiating this project we can see many unemployed men be put back to work."
 GEO_state_bank: "Establish Sakartvelos Erovnuli Banki"

 GEO_modernize_existing_industry: "Industrial Education Programmes"
 GEO_modernize_existing_industry_desc: "Much of Georgia's native industry is decrepit and out-dated, worsening our economic woes. If we are to ever escape Black Monday we must modernise and quickly. Specialised industrial education programmes will help get our workers up to scratch and improve our industrial capabilities."
 GEO_bailouts: "Bailouts for Foreign Companies"
 GEO_bailouts_desc: "Many foreign companies operate within Georgia and they are the lifeblood of the economy. Allowing them to fail would spell certain economic doom for us so by sparing government funds to keep them afloat is a necessity."
 GEO_manganese: "JSC Manganese Chiatur Subsidies"
 GEO_manganese_desc: "The JSC Manganese Chiatur mining company is an important employer and mining operation in the aforementioned city. Subsidising the mine will ensure a less painless recovery from Black Monday and keep the workers in employment."

 GEO_the_azeri_armenian_pipeline_desc: "The oil fields of Baku are isolated from the rest of Europe on account of Azerbaijan's placement on the Caspian sea. Constructing new pipelines between Baku and the Poti Harbour will be a greatly beneficial investment to both parties."

 GEO_support_equipment_development: "Support Companies"
 GEO_support_equipment_development_desc: "The People's Guard has made few strides in development of its support companies, often leaving the soldiers to toil themselves. Further developments in this region should be made a priority."
 GEO_navy_focus: "Sakartvelos Sanapiro Datsva"

 GEO_oil_tankers: "New Oil Tankers"
 GEO_oil_tankers_desc: "The transport of oil through Georgia is one of the main components of our economy. New tankers should be procured to keep the industry going and performing even better than before."
 GEO_protect_batumi: "Protect the Batumi Harbour"
 GEO_protect_batumi_desc: "Batumi Harbour is once again our main export harbour for Georgia and without it our economy would be significantly worse for wear. Special fortifications must be erected to ensure it remains defensible from those who would seek to take it and its pipeline from us."
 GEO_navy_excercise: "Naval Exercises"
 GEO_navy_excercise_desc: "Our naval staff have become complacent and out of shape. A few exercises on the Black Sea should get them back into shape and fighting order in no time!"
 GEO_batumi_returned: "The Return of Batumi"
 GEO_batumi_returned_desc: "One of the biggest slights to Georgia at the Treaty of Poti was the allocation of Batumi to the Ottoman Empire. At long last this miscarrage of justice has been corrected, and we find ourself governing the region once more. There is much work to be done, but the denizens of this historic city can rest easy now that they are back under their mother country."

 GEO_expand_the_tanker_fleet: "Expand the Tanker Fleet"
 GEO_expand_the_tanker_fleet_desc: "Georgia now finds herself in control of not one but two major ports on the Black Sea. This will allow us to greatly expand the amount of oil tankers we can operate and increase our exports as a result. No doubt this will only serve as a boon for the Batumis economy."

 GEO_air_focus: "The SSSD"

 GEO_air_tech_desc: "Georgian plane models have fallen behind much of the world. Some simple funding allocations can see new designs and licences purchased."
 GEO_night_bombing: "Night Missions Training"
 GEO_night_bombing_desc: "Air combat is relatively young and night-time missions often prove too dangerous to new pilots. Training for this occasion will better strengthen our air forces."
 GEO_aa_investments: "Anti-Air Investments"
 GEO_aa_investments_desc: "As warfare advances forward, with it attacks from the skies are becoming more prevalent. Taking necessary precautions to counter this is a worthy investment."
 GEO_at_investments: "Anti-Tank Investments"

Following a string of agreements with Germany and the Ottoman Empire, Georgia was safe, and under the charismatic leadership of Noe Zhordania, decades of peace and relative stability were achieved. However, Zhordania grows old and is planning on retiring. With tensions rising across the Middle East, the peace he's brought may go with him..."

### Intro Screen ###
 GEO_country_intro_header: "The Democratic Republic of Georgia"
 GEO_country_intro_content: "Georgia gained its independence during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, following its break from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. During the chaos, Georgia went to Germany for help in defending against the enemies surrounding the nation. Georgia signed multiple agreements with Germany, notably the Treaty of Poti, placing the country under the protection of Germany in exchange for several economic concessions which have resulted in a clear German dominance within the economy. Also in the Treaty of Batum, Georgia gave all of its Muslim majority regions to the Ottoman Empire. Asserting its hard won independence, Georgia has since remained a peaceful and stable state.\n\nWhile a part of Russia, Georgia was a centre of Menshevik activity, which remained the case when it gained independence, with the Menshehvik Social Democratic Party of Georgia ruling since 1918. Following Noe Ramishvili's brief stint as Chairman in 1918, Noe Zhordania has ruled the country for 18 years solid. The Mensheviks have had complete political dominance over Georgia the whole time, though their vote count has shrunk over the years. In the election of 1935, the Mensheviks almost lost their majority, but were able to keep hold. The National Democratic Party, the EDP, garnered a large amount of votes, with their leader, Ekvtime Takaishvili beginning to work closer with monarchist groups. The popularity for a monarchy has grown over the years, with the two main candidates as king being Prince Joachim of Prussia, son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and George Bagration, head of the old Georgian royal family, the Bagrationi Dynasty.\n\nGeorgia stands as a beacon of stability in a world of growing uncertainty. Late last year, the old and popular Noe Zhordania announced he would resign as Chairman, to be replaced by Evgeni Gegechkori, who has worked in Zhordania's government since independence, though is notably less popular than him. However, unless disaster were to suddenly strike the nation, nothing is set to change politically until the next election in 1939."

### Events ###
 geo.2.t: "Re-Examine the Treaty of Poti"
 geo.2.d: "The Treaty of Poti was signed with Germany when Georgia was under direct threat from most of its neighbours, and wasn't internationally recognised. This is not how things stand anymore. Georgia has strong international recognition, and though tensions grow with its neighbours, some in the country argue that protection is not worth being stuck under the German fist. People specifically point to the fact the Treaty gives Germany great control over Georgia's infrastructure, and set up a company that has great control over the Georgian mining industry. Though it would be economically beneficial in the short term, it would alienate our greatest economic partner in Germany, and set us on the anti-German path.\n\nPrince Joachim of Prussia recently announced that, should Georgia suspend the Treaty and nationalise the company, he would refuse any request to be enthroned, stating \"Georgia and Germany need each other\". On the other hand, George Bagration recently announced the opposite, that he would refuse to become monarch should Georgia stand by the Treaty, claiming \"Georgia has lived too long under the fist of Germany. Now is our only chance to stop this.\"\n\nThe foreign policy implications of the decision are massive. By sticking to the treaty, we reaffirm our loyalty to both Germany and, by connection, their strong ally the Ottoman Empire. However, if we were to end the treaty, it would allow us to act more aggressively, and take back territory that our nation claims, like Batum, currently under the control of the Ottomans."
 geo.2.a: "The Treaty is ended, and its company nationalised."
 geo.2.b: "We cannot alienate the Germans. Bail out the company."

 geo.3.t: "The Baku-Poti Pipeline"
 geo.3.d: "Over the years, since the Ottomans gained control of Batum following the Treaty of Batum, a new pipeline between Georgia and Azerbaijan was built, that being the Baku-Poti Pipeline, made specifically for the transport of oil rather than Kerosene, which is the focus of the Baku-Batum Pipeline. The Baku-Poti Pipeline was funded mostly by the Azeri government, even though a massive amount of it goes through Georgia and the trade from it happened at Poti, in our land. Some of the more nationalistic in our government have suggested that to help finish solving the Black Monday crisis, we should nationalise the Pipeline, and take its profits for ourselves. Relations between Azerbaijan and Georgia have always been tense, stemming mostly from Azeri control of Zaqatala, a city claimed by Georgia."
 geo.3.a: "Nationalise the Pipeline!"
 geo.3.b: "No need to anger the neighbours."

 geo.4.t: "Georgia Has Nationalised the Baku-Poti Pipeline!"
 geo.4.d: "Though our relationship with Georgia has never been strong, they allowed us to invest and construct a new pipeline, the Baku-Poti Pipeline, through their territory, specifically made for transport of oil. Most of the funding for this pipeline was from our government. However, news has just reached us that the Georgian government has decided to nationalise their part of the pipeline, and take the profits for themselves! This will only boost the already tense relations between our two governments."
 geo.4.a: "Damn them!"

 geo.5.t: "The Army's Annual Budget Evaluation"
 geo.5.d: "With tensions across the world growing more and more, and with the economic crisis of Black Monday hitting the nation, the military commission has decided that it is time to re-evaluate the budget of the military, specifically whether the army should focus more on its defensive or offensive capabilities."
 geo.5.a: "A more offensive approach is needed."
 geo.5.b: "Digging in has proven to be the best tactic in the previous wars."

 geo.6.t: "Black Monday Hits Our Nation!"
 geo.6.d: "After the Berlin Stock Market crashed a few days ago, the effects have reached our country too. In a matter of a few hours, our economy was ruined, inflation is sky-high, many businesses going bankrupt and thousands of workers are being fired from their job every day. The situation is becoming worse and worse by the hour, with reports of food riots already flooding in. Though Evgeni Gegechkori has only been chairman for a few weeks, his popularity has already plummeted, and the Constituent Assembly has been in chaos, with other parties already claiming the government is not doing enough."
 geo.6.a: "We must act as soon as possible."

 geo.7.t: "Food Prices Skyrocketing"
 geo.7.d: "Since many farmers have left the countryside, and other farmers refuse to sell food cheaply, less food is available in the urban areas, and as such, prices are rising by the hour. A lot of men, women and children can't buy food anymore, because they earn too little, and as such, some have resorted to violent solutions. Shops that sell food are raided almost every day, and police presence isn't enough to stop them. Many vendors have died, and others are too scared to continue with business and have closed their doors, making the situation even worse. "
 geo.7.a: "You can't change the market."
 geo.7.b: "Try to establish a food pricing commission."

 geo.8.t: "Mass Food Riots"
 geo.8.d: "Following the decision of our government to do nothing against the increased food prices and shortages, food riots everywhere in Georgia have escalated, with reports of people going to the countryside to raid farms for their food. This situation has become almost uncontrollable."
 geo.8.a: "Who could suspect it was going to be so bad?"

 geo.9.t: "Establishment of the Agricultural Goods Commission"
 geo.9.d: "Today the parliament has accepted the proposal to create a food pricing commission to keep prices under control and to provide food for all. Although farmers aren't going to be happy with this, it will prevent a small famine."
 geo.9.a: "They will do a great job."

 geo.10.t: "Importing Food?"
 geo.10.d: "Considering the current unstable situation of our agricultural economic sector, and more so because of the violent food riots that are happening in the cities, many prominent party members have proposed to temporarily import essential foodstuffs to prevent the situation becoming worse. Of course, doing this would most probably stop the food riots, but we need to keep the fact that our state debt will rise significantly if we do this into consideration."
 geo.10.a: "Agree with the plan."
 geo.10.b: "This is too risky."

 geo.11.t: "Food Situation Stabilises"
 geo.11.d: "After the government's decision to start importing food from abroad, the shops slowly started to fill again and the overwhelming majority of people is able to feed itself legally once again..."
 geo.11.a: "This had a price, but it's worth it."

 geo.12.t: "The Situation Becomes Worse!"
 geo.12.d: "After the government's decision not to start importing food from abroad, even less food products are available and the people are becoming more violent. We're criticised by almost every other party because of our poor judgement."
 geo.12.a: "This is really bad."

 geo.13.t: "Farmers Lower Their Prices"
 geo.13.d: "After the worsening of the food riots, our government reopened talks with the peasantry, this time more willing to make compromises. After many hours of debating between representatives of the SSDP and multiple farmers organisations, the two groups have reached an accord. In exchange for various pro-agrarian measures, the farmers have accepted a lowering of the prices, thus resulting in a stabilisation of the situation in the urban areas."
 geo.13.a: "Very well."

 geo.14.t: "Tiflis Protests"
 geo.14.d: "Thousands of people have gathered in Tiflis this morning, protesting against the leadership of Evgeni Gegechkori, and the rough economic situation they are now in. While some call him a puppet to the Germans, others say he's purposely working against them for personal gain. These protests have been led by multiple of parties in Georgia, everywhere from Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP to Leo Shengelaia's SRs. Though wildly different, they all ask for the same thing: new elections. At the protests, Ekvtime Takaishvili spoke to a large crowd, about how the situation of Georgia has changed since last year, and the current government is unfit to fix it. Evgeni has not commented yet."
 geo.14.a: "This doesn't look good at all..."

 geo.15.t: "Noe Zhordania Retires"
 geo.15.d: "Announced in December last year, Noe Zhordania is stepping down as Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. He has ruled the nation for 18 years, and under him Georgia has grown close to Germany, and has become a strong and relatively stable nation. However, with his popularity beginning to falter following some failed reforms and the economy stagnating, Zhordania decided it was his time to retire.\n\nHis replacement, Evgeni Gegechkori, has worked closely with Zhordania over his 18 years of leadership, serving in his cabinet at Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice and Minister for Internal Affairs. Due to the relative stability of Georgia at the current time, and decent economic outlooks, the public should have time to get to like Gegechkori just as much as they like Zhordania."
 geo.15.a: "Zhordania has served well."

 geo.16.t: "Tiflis Protests Spread"
 geo.16.d: "The massive protests in Tiflis have continued a week later, and have began to spread across the country. Protests have grown in Poti and Kutais, calling for the resignation of the government and for new elections. Worse still, George Bagration has joined the protests in Tiflis, calling for \"the end of socialism in Georgia\". Evgeni Gegechkori tried to hold a speech outside the Constituent Assembly earlier today, but protestors stopped this from happening, making Gegechkori look weaker still."
 geo.16.a: "Could this get any worse?"

 geo.17.t: "The Minority Situation Worsens"
 geo.17.d: "The situation with the main minorities of Georgia has worsened greatly. The People's Council of Abkhazia, a council set up representing the Abkhazian people, has officially stated that the central government should call new elections. Protests have increased in Sukhum and Sochi in recent days, feeling empowered with the Council's support.\n\nThings are far worse in South Ossetia, however. Though they have been relatively peaceful since the end of the Ossetian uprisings in 1920, it seems the economic collapse has once again sparked conflict in the area. The Georgian Army have tried to keep the Ossetian revolters down, but the conflict is causing much damage to the area."
 geo.17.a: "Damn them."

 geo.18.t: "Pressure Grows on Gegechkori to Call New Elections"
 geo.18.d: "Pressure on Evgeni Gegechkori to call new elections has been increasing on all sides. Protests continue in Tiflis and across the country, and some industries are talking of strikes against the government. The opposing parties in the Constituent Assembly, led in opposition by Ekvtime Takaishvili, continue to call on the government to resign and for new elections. What is even more worrying, though, is the growth of resistance against Gegechkori by his own party. Multiple cabinet ministers are beginning to speak of how new elections might be best to try to preserve whats left of Georgian stability."
 geo.18.a: "Maybe elections are necessary."

 geo.19.t: "Evgeni Gegechkori Calls for New Elections"
 geo.19.d: "Following the massive uproar throughout the nation against the current government, Chairman Gegechkori has reluctantly decided to call for new national elections in 4 months time. Though it is clear that the SSDP is unlikely to achieve a majority, if it even wins at all, the country could not go on without one."
 geo.19.a: "It had to be done."

 geo.20.t: "Protests End and Campaign Begins"
 geo.20.d: "With the calling of new elections, the protests in Tiflis and across the country have almost completely disappeared, with only a few stragglers left slowly petering out. Construction projects to repair the damage caused by the protests have already begun, as have the campaigns of the political parties.\n\nThe minor parties, the SSPSP, the SR, and the MMEP, are not likely to achieve anywhere close to a majority, and are instead potentially options for coalitions in a possible minority government. The key parties campaigns are the SSDP and the EDP.\n\nGegechkori and the SSDP are running on a continuation of the current system and government, talking about the success Georgia has achieved in the past 18 years. The EDP, on the other hand, are campaigning on the failures of the current government, primarily the failures of the government to quickly deal with the Black Monday crisis. The EDP are also picking up votes with monarchists, after Ekvtime Takaishvili promised that if the EDP win the election, they will hold a referendum on the monarchy."
 geo.20.a: "Peace returns to Tiflis."

 geo.21.t: "Prince Joachim Announces Support for the EDP"
 geo.21.d: "Recently, the popular German prince, Prince Joachim, has announced his support for the Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP. In a statement, he claimed that it is clear that the time for socialism in Georgia has come to an end, and a proper, responsible, conservative government is established, and that the people's voices are heard in regard to a monarchy. Joachim talked about the undeniable successes of the German constitutional monarch system, which has helped them become a global hegemon."
 geo.21.a: "Too close to Germany, perhaps?"

 geo.22.t: "George Bagration Announces Support for the EDP"
 geo.22.d: "Recently, the popular monarchical candidate, George Bagration, has announced his support for Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP. In a statement, he claimed that the socialism Georgia has been ruled under has led to the constant chaos we have seen for the past few months, and that a proper monarchist, conservative, nationalist government should be established for Georgia to survive."
 geo.22.a: "Monarchies are too old fashioned."

 geo.23.t: "Growth in Opposing Left Wing Parties"
 geo.23.d: "With the SSDP still struggling to gain its popularity back, the other left-wing political parties have begun taking more and more SSDP voters from them. From the right of the SSDP are the SSPSP under Iese Baratashvili, a party focused on federalism and decentralisation. To the left of the SSDP are the Georgian SR, a radical party focused on agrarian socialism and the idea of land socialisation, or the division of land to peasant tenants. Though neither party will come close enough to forming a government, their growing popularity along with the SSDP's weakness means its all but assured the SSDP will be forced to form a coalition with one of these parties."
 geo.23.a: "Splitting the vote?"

 geo.24.t: "Growth in Polarisation"
 geo.24.d: "With the collapse of the SSDP hegemony over political power, and the growing chaos both inside and outside the country, polarisation is growing, with more and more people on the outskirts of society supporting more radical parties. On the left, many people, some even former Bolshevik supporters, are beginning to support the SR more and more. On the right, some who believe the EDP do not go far enough are beginning to support the Patriotic Union Tetri Giorgi, a right-wing nationalist party led by former general Leo Kereselidze and professor Mikheil Tsereteli. The group has been rallying for monarchism for years, but are still seen as too radical for most, with the EDP announcing they will refuse to form a coalition with them should they need to."
 geo.24.a: "Worrying times are ahead."

 geo.25.t: "EDP and MMEP in Coalition Negotiations"
 geo.25.d: "The EDP, looking more and more likely to win the upcoming elections, have already entered preliminary coalition talks with the MMEP, a landowners party, that had split off the EDP years ago. Due to them seeing eye to eye on most issues, and the fact that though the EDP are likely to win they are unlikely to win a majority of seats, it can be assumed they will form a coalition with Grigol Veshapeli's MMEP."
 geo.25.a: "They haven't won yet..."

 geo.26.t: "Evgeni Gegechkori and Noe Zhordania Hold Massive Rally in Tiflis"
 geo.26.d: "In a last ditch attempt to secure votes for the election only a couple of weeks away, the SSDP has hosted a major rally in the centre of Tiflis, attended by many high level SSDP politicians, including Evgeni Gegechkori and the ever popular Noe Zhordania. Both held speeches, receiving loud cheers from the massive crowds. Though this rally was seen as a massive success, many in the media are calling it too little too late, projecting a close victory for the EDP."
 geo.26.a: "Could they pull it back?"

 geo.27.t: "Ekvtime Takaishvili Announces Referendum on the Monarchy"
 geo.27.d: "Though Ekvtime Takaishvili and the EDP are officially republican, one of the main policies they ran on was a referendum on whether Georgia should become a Constitutional Monarchy. With the popularity of the monarchy growing over the last few years, this policy was one of the main reasons they were able to win the election.\n\nNow, however, comes an important question. Should the EDP and MMEP officially take a side in the referendum? If the government takes a side, and then that side loses the referendum, it'll destroy the confidence in the government. However, not taking a side could risk a side we disagree with winning."
 geo.27.a: "Officially side with the Republican Campaign."
 geo.27.b: "Take no side."
 geo.27.c: "Officially side with the Monarchist Campaign."

 geo.28.t: "The Tetri Giorgi Holds Rally in Tiflis"
 geo.28.d: "Shalva Maglakelidze is a high ranking general of the Georgian military, yet still heavily involved in politics, especially on the side of monarchism. A strong right winger who had always been highly suspicious of the Menshevik Government, he helped found the Tetri Giorgi, a right wing anti-socialist and anti-syndicalist nationalist organisation. Though the group itself is minor, many of its politicians, including its leader Leo Kereselidze and especially Shalva Maglakelidze, are very popular in Georgia, and helped push the idea of monarchism to the forefront of Georgian politics.\n\nToday, the organisation is holding a pro-monarchist rally in Tiflis, attended by thousands of Georgian citizens. It started off peaceful, though throughout the day more and more counter protestors, mostly coming from left wing parties and groups, began to join against the Tetri Giorgi rally. Following a few light clashes between the socialists and monarchists, the police were forced to step in to try to split the groups. However, both sides saw it as the police trying to suppress their side, and so the violence got worse, leading to large brawls between socialists, monarchists and police. By the end of the day, there were many injuries and much damage was done to the city, though thankfully no one died."
 geo.28.a: "This is worrying..."

 geo.29.t: "United Socialist Front Forms Against Monarchism"
 geo.29.d: "Evgeni Gegechkori, the former Chairman of Georgia, has recently announced in Tiflis a \"United Socialist Front\" against monarchism in the country. After entering into negotiations with both the Socialist Revolutionaries and the SSPSP, they all came to an agreement to campaign together against the monarchist campaign. In his speech in Tiflis, Gegechkori discussed how the creation of a Kingdom would undo any progress done by socialism in Georgia, and that any true socialist should be diametrically opposed to the monarchist campaign. He also denounces our holding of a referendum on the topic, claiming it was a cheap attempt to get votes while dividing the country."
 geo.29.a: "A sore loser."

 geo.30.t: "The Joachim Interview"
 geo.30.d: "Recently, an interview of monarchist candidate Prince Joachim of Prussia was published in the largest newspaper in the country. The interview covered his life story and his aspirations for Georgia.\n\nJoachim discusses his early career in the 1st Foot Guards of the Royal Prussian Army, and his service on the eastern front. Later he discusses his wife Marie and son Karl, and the massive change in their life living in Georgia was. He even discusses his own mental health and struggles with the Georgian language. When asked if it was the right time for Georgia to become a monarchy, with tensions in the world growing, Joachim asserted that this was the best time for it. He claimed that the monarchy can be a point of stability following months of political chaos, and his connections to the Germans allows Georgia to grow closer to the world hegemon.\n\nThough some see Joachim's poor mental health and struggling with the Georgian language as weak, most of the country is sympathetic, and like the honesty and boldness for him to discuss this. His popularity has skyrocketed with this interview."
 geo.30.a: "But do we want a German on the Georgian throne?"

 geo.31.t: "The George Interview"
 geo.31.d: "Recently, an interview of monarchist candidate George Bagration of Mukhrani and his son Irakli was published in the largest newspaper in the country. The interview covered his life story and his aspirations for Georgia.\n\nGeorge discusses his early life, as part of the Russian nobility, and his military education at the Page Corps. He talks about his history of involvement in Georgia and struggles for the Georgian cause, including his fighting against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. On the issue of politics, George discussed how the monarchy should be an apolitical body in the country, and stated his son Irakli was more political, to which he agreed. Irakli went on to say how the monarchy should act as a point of stability in the country, and should be able to \"correct the course of the country should it go too far\".\n\nThough George himself came off quite well in the interview, controversy has started over the comments of his son. His statement about \"correcting the course\" has been seen by many as an affront to democracy, and they claim that Irakli does not really want a constitutional monarchy, just more power. Still, George remains quite popular, especially within right-wing circles, who venerate George's military experience against the Bolsheviks and in many ways agree with the statements of his son."
 geo.31.a: "Do they want democracy?"

 geo.32.t: "Referendum on the Monarchy"
 geo.32.d: "Finally, after weeks of campaigning and political violence, it is time for a referendum on the monarchy. The people of Georgia have come out in droves today, and it looked to be close. In the end, however, victory went to..."
 geo.32.a: "... the Monarchists."
 geo.32.b: "... the Republicans."

 geo.33.t: "Socialists March in Tiflis"
 geo.33.d: "After hearing the results of the monarchy referendum, socialists across the country were furious. Important republican leaders, including former chairmen Noe Zhordania and Evgeni Gegechkori, denounced the results and the referendum as a whole. Now, the day after the referendum, thousands of people have flocked to the streets of Tiflis to protest against the fact that their country has been turned into a kingdom. Fiery speeches by Zhordania caused the crowd to begin to turn violent, with some vandalism and clashes with police taking place later into the day. There were even rumours that Valiko Jugheli, a prominant member of the SSDP who is also a general of the country, was in Tiflis supporting the protestors. It seems things will get worse in Georgia before they get better."
 geo.33.a: "But it's the will of the people!"

 geo.34.t: "Valiko Jugheli Reforms the People's Guard"
 geo.34.d: "The People's Guard of Georgia was a volunteer force, mainly made up of Mensheviks, in the early days of Georgia's independence. It was dissolved after control of Georgia was secure, and Germany guaranteed Georgia's independence. However, Valiko Jugheli, former commander of the People's Guard, has recently announced that with the monarchy winning the referendum, Georgia is under threat once again, and that the People's Guard must be reformed. He also earlier that day resigned his post as a general in the army. Already, thousands of socialists have joined the rank of the People's Guard, and there are now fears Jugheli wishes to perform a coup in Tiflis, to restore an SSDP-led republican government, and ignore both the democratic elections and democratic referendum that have taken place."
 geo.34.a: "Jugheli is a danger to Georgia."

 GEO_remove_jugheli_effect: "§YValiko Jugheli§!:\n   stops being a Military High Command\n   stops being a General"

 geo.35.t: "General Shalva Maglakelidze Meets With King George"
 geo.35.d: "Shalva Maglakelidze, a general of the Georgian army, has recently met with King George Bagration and his son Irakli. In the meeting, Maglakelidze has stated that with chaos ruling in Tiflis, and with Jugheli's People's Guard arming themselves, it might be time to step in and stop this. Maglakelidze spoke vaguely about his plans, talking about \"protecting Georgia\" and \"temporarily taking control\" but it was clear what he was suggesting: a coup. Maglakelidze said he had certain areas of the army on his side, and he could quickly move into Tiflis, remove the current government and secure the city. From there, Georgia would still be under external threat, and so his new administration should remain in power for the foreseeable future. Maglakelidze also states that he has civilian support from the highly nationalistic Tetri Giorgi. Maglakelidze is suggesting a strange mix of absolute monarchy, military dictatorship and nationalists autocracy, a coalition between the monarchy, the military and the Tetri Giorgi. A plan like this could end democracy in Georgia forever. It is George and Irakli's decision as to whether Maglakelidze moves forward with the plan."
 geo.35.a: "Go ahead with the plan."
 geo.35.b: "How dare he even suggest such a thing!"

 geo.36.t: "Shalva Maglakelidze Takes Tiflis"
 geo.36.d: "Early in the morning, while most of the country still slept, Shalva Maglakelidze readied his forces and moved into Tiflis. His troops moved quickly, securing the entrances and exits of the city and taking government buildings. His troops also surrounded the houses of Noe Zhordania and Evgeni Gegechkori, placing them under house arrest. By the time Prime Minister Ekvtime Takaishvili was awake, it was already too late, as the government was already under Maglakelidze's control. Takashvili quickly announced his resignation, and King George appointed Maglakelidze as the new Prime Minister of Georgia, who suspended the constitution and dissolved Parliament."
 geo.36.a: "Democracy is dead in Georgia."

 geo.37.t: "Riots Through Tiflis"
 geo.37.d: "Riots have occurred all throughout Tiflis, with armed shoot-outs with police against Jugheli's People's Guard. So far there have been 4 deaths, and much damage has been done. However, signs are beginning to show that the chaos might be coming to an end. More and more people are beginning to leave the protests and return to work, accepting the fact their country is now a monarchy. Though many radicals joined Jugheli's People's Guard, not many of them actually showed up to fight in Tiflis, most likely not willing to risk their lives to fight for a result which most of the country voted for. It seems we might have gotten past the peak of the anti-monarchist protests."
 geo.37.a: "A light at the end of the tunnel."

 geo.38.t: "Last Protestors Disperse in Tiflis"
 geo.38.d: "Following weeks of protests and riots in Tiflis due to the referendum on the monarchy, the last of the protestors have finally dispersed, and stability has returned to Tiflis. Though the monarchy decision will remain an extremely divisive topic, and there will always be controversy surrounding it, the violence and vandalism has ended."
 geo.38.a: "Thank goodness."

 geo.39.t: "Jugheli's People's Guard Revolt"
 geo.39.d: "Valiko Jugheli has announced today that, with Tiflis falling to the \"reactionary forces of the King and General Maglakelidze\", it was time for his People's Guard to revolt against the government, to try and take the country back. He has retreated from Tiflis, and has taken the city of Kutais. A detachment of his People's Guard have also taken Abkhazia, and another is trying to take Poti, though the garrison there is giving them trouble. It seems a civil war has begun."
 geo.39.a: "We fight for Georgia."

 geo.40.t: "Siege of Kutais"
 geo.40.d: "Kutais is one of the most important cities in the country, being both one of the most populous and most industrialised. Jugheli has control of the city, after defeating the small garrison there. To take back the city, we have 2 options. The Rioni River runs directly through the city, and we have control of it slightly up stream. One of our officers suggested we send a small group of our elite troops down the river in rafts into the city, as a sneak attack. However, many in the military believe that a small group of troops will not be enough, and that the best course of action is to march a large army into the city, to fight the People's Guard garrison head on, and defeat them with superior numbers and weapons. In regard to the river plan, there are also worries that if the weather deteriorates, our troops will be unable to control their rafts, and will be unorganised and easily repelled."
 geo.40.a: "Send an elite force down the river."
 geo.40.b: "March a large force into the city."

 geo.41.t: "Troops Defeated in Kutais"
 geo.41.d: "In the middle of the night, government troops were sent down the Rioni River, to surprise attack the People's Guard garrison. However, as they sailed down the river, a storm rolled in, and the river became violent. Some men's rafts were damaged or even destroyed, while others were beached. By the time they reached the city, they were unorganised, and some of their equipment and weapons were damaged by the water and harsh conditions. The People's Guard garrison in the city was easily able to pick off and defeat our troops. This is a major defeat for the government."
 geo.41.a: "Damn."

 geo.42.t: "Government Forces take Kutais"
 geo.42.d: "Marching a large amount of forces into the city seemed to be the right decision, for as the day went on, a storm rolled in, meaning the river would have been dangerous. Our mass of troops was able to quickly overrun the weak People's Guard garrison, and successfully regain control of the city."
 geo.42.a: "Excellent."

 geo.43.t: "Siege of Sukhum"
 geo.43.d: "Next comes the question of taking the city of Sukhum, the capital of the region of Abkhazia. The People's Guard has a relatively strong presence in the city, and the people are unlikely to cooperate with government forces much. Plans to take the city have been brought forward by multiple different officers. The city is a major port on the Black Sea, and there are many ships in the port currently. Some officers suggest that our forces should focus on taking the port first, then move into the city itself, to stop the People's Guard troops from retreating out of the city. However, other officers have said that this is too risky, and that cornering the People's Guard inside the city will force our troops to fight all their forces at once to their deaths. However, if we allow the People's Guard the opportunity to retreat, they will fight less vigorously and will be quick to retreat. Most of our officers agree with the plan to take the city itself first, instead of the port."
 geo.43.a: "Take the main city first, then move to the port."
 geo.43.b: "Take the port first, then move into the city."

 geo.44.t: "People's Guard Troops Retreat from Sukhum"
 geo.44.d: "Battles were fought in the streets of Sukhum as our troops entered from the north. Our troops were able to quickly push them back to the port, where they made their escape on the ships there. Though they were able to retreat, it allowed us to easily retake the city."
 geo.44.a: "Perfect."

 geo.45.t: "Government Troops Defeated in Sukhum"
 geo.45.d: "The siege of Sukhum looked like it was going perfectly, as our troops moved in from the east and quickly took control of the port. However, as our troops pushed further into the city, they faced extremely harsh resistance from the People's Guard. Our troops got around halfway through the city before they were forced back due to the sheer resistance from the People's Guard. As time went on, our troops got pushed further and further back, eventually being pushed back all the way to the port. The People's Guard pushed back harder and harder, and eventually our forces were forced to retreat in the boats in the port. Sukhum seems to be under Jugheli's control."
 geo.45.a: "That didn't go well."

 geo.46.t: "Battle of Poti"
 geo.46.d: "A small battle still rages at the port city of Poti in the west. Our forces control the city for now, but there are regular skirmishes from the People's Guard, and a large force is amassing just outside the city to take it. We must get troops to Poti as quickly as possible. We have some leftover troops from Sukhum, but it will take a while to organise them and send them down. In contrast, we have some troops further up the Caucasian Railway, which ends in Poti. Many of our officers are suggesting we send our troops down it to reach Poti in time and lift the siege."
 geo.46.a: "Send troops down the Caucasian Railway."
 geo.46.b: "No need to use the railway, send the forces from Sukhum."

 geo.47.t: "Poti is Saved"
 geo.47.d: "Our support down the Caucasian Railway arrived at Poti just mere hours before the People's Guard moved in to take the city. Thankfully, after a long fought battle, our forces were able to keep the city and push back the People's Guard troops."
 geo.47.a: "Perfect."

 geo.48.t: "Poti is Lost"
 geo.48.d: "Our support appeared to arrive too late to Poti. As our troops arrived from Sukhum, they found the city had already fallen to the forces of the People's Guard. They tried to push in, but were quickly repelled. It seems Poti is lost."
 geo.48.a: "We will return!"

 geo.49.t: "Jugheli Approaches Tiflis"
 geo.49.d: "Valiko Jugheli, leader of the People's Guard, has been seen marching towards Tiflis, leading a large force to take the capital. The government garrison left in Tiflis is quite small, and he might be able to take it if he's able to get support from other cities he's taken. It'll be a close battle for the future of the country."
 geo.49.a: "Maybe the future will be brighter..."

 geo.50.t: "People's Guard Defeated"
 geo.50.d: "The large force led by Valiko Jugheli was met outside Tiflis, by our larger, more well supplied force. In the fighting, following an artillery barrage, it is assumed Jugheli was killed, and if he escaped he would be easily hunted and captured. With this victory, our government is secure. We can now start implementing our plans, and forming an alliance with the civilian Tetri Giorgi."
 geo.50.a: "For Georgia!"

 geo.51.t: "Jugheli and the People's Guard Take Tiflis!"
 geo.51.d: "When Jugheli's force arrived outside Tiflis, it had gained strength and supplies from the other cities of the nation. Comparatively, government troops were under-supplied and lacked morale. Many of them even defected to the People's Guard before the battle began. After a few hours of battle, the government forces were defeated, and Jugheli's troops marched into Tiflis, and he took over the government. Shalva Maglakelidze, George Bagration and his son Irakli were arrested. In a speech outside parliament, Jugheli declared Georgia a republic once more, and that he would lead a coalition of the SSDP, SR and SSPSP until proper elections can be held."
 geo.51.a: "Georgia is free!"

 geo.52.t: "What to do with Maglakelidze and the Bagrations"
 geo.52.d: "With control now secure of the government, a question must be answered: what to do with the criminals who tried to end Georgian democracy. Primarily, the question focuses on Shalva Maglakelidze, George Bagration and his son Irakli. Of course they must be punished, their crimes are treason against Georgia. However, some argue that it would be best to only lightly punish them, by putting them under house arrest. This will show how our administration is willing to be forgiving, and that we are not fighting for revenge, but for the betterment of the country."
 geo.52.a: "They committed treason, they deserve life in prison."
 geo.52.b: "Be nice, give them house arrest."

 geo.53.t: "Integrate the People's Guard"
 geo.53.d: "The forces of the People's Guard served us well in overthrowing the dictatorial monarchist government. Though they were not the most well trained troops, they showed true support for key Georgian values, like democracy and republicanism. The process has now started to integrate these troops into the army itself, to help dilute Maglakelidze's supporters and end another potential dictatorship, should another arise."
 geo.53.a: "They fought well."

 geo.54.t: "Strengthen Political Institutions"
 geo.54.d: "Now, Valiko Jugheli has declared it time to reinforce the political institutions of the country, to try and avoid another monarchist dictatorship. Firstly, he passed a law that stated Georgia would always be a republic, to give the monarchy no chance of taking power once again. The Constitution of 1919, a work of constitutional art, was reviewed, but was decided it still worked and was not the reason Maglakelidze and Bagration were able to take over. Jugheli instead blames the courts made to defend the constitution. He dismissed any judges that tried to give Maglakelidze's regime legitimacy, and emphasised it is the courts that must protect the political institutions of Georgia."
 geo.54.a: "Georgia will always be a republic!"

 geo.55.t: "Jugheli Announces New Elections"
 geo.55.d: "Today, in a speech outside parliament, Valiko Jugheli announced to a large crowd of people that new elections would be held in a months time. He claimed that the EDP, by allowing the referendum, was partly responsible for the dictatorial takeover, and therefore the people deserve to vote once again on a new parliament. The announcement was met with cheering by the crowd, happy to see that democracy was once again going to take place in the country."
 geo.55.a: "Excellent."

 geo.56.t: "Georgia turns their back on Germany"
 geo.56.d: "The Democratic Republic of Georgia was born with sponsorship from the German Empire. To secure their independence in the turbulent times of the Russian Revolution, the Georgian government signed the Treaty of Poti, a treaty that gave Germany vast economic power in the country. In the wake of the Black Monday crisis and the collapse of the Georgian economy, Georgia has decided to declare the Treaty of Poti at an end, and has instead decided to take an anti-German stance, using nationalism to gather support for their government. Some of the more jingoistic in their government have even discussed retaking Batum from us."
 geo.56.a: "Something to keep an eye on."

 geo.57.t: "Georgia Mobilises for War!"
 geo.57.d: "With war breaking out in the Middle East, the Georgian government has ramped up its attacks against the Empire in speeches, proclaiming that Georgians suffering under Ottoman rule will soon be \"freed\". This, along with a sudden influx of troops on the border, can only mean one thing: Georgia will soon declare war on the Empire."
 geo.57.a: "Damn."

 geo.60.t: "The King's Cabinet"
 geo.60.d: "With the country now securely under our new regimes control, it is now time to create a cabinet for the country, made up of our allies.\n\nShalva Maglakelidze, who brought about the new government, will remain in his position as Prime Minister. King George's son, Prince Irakli, assisted in the coup, and is far more politically active and able than his father. He will become Foreign Minister. While Prince Mikheil Tsereteli is originally trained as a historian, his connections and organisational knowledge will make him a suitable candidate for the role of Economy Minister. Leo Kereselidze is another ex-general, who led the Georgian Legion in the First Weltkrieg. Leader of the Tetri Giorgi, it is decided he will become Minister of the Interior."
 geo.60.a: "An excellent government."

 geo.61.t: "Georgia Requests to Join the Reichspakt"
 geo.61.d: "During the First Weltkrieg, we helped secure Georgia as an ally in the Caucasus. Their government has remained friendly to ours since their independence, and now, with international order under threat, they have requested to join our alliance."
 geo.61.a: "Welcome to the Reichspakt."
 geo.61.b: "We decline."

 geo.62.t: "Germany Has Accepted!"
 geo.62.d: "Germany has accepted our request to join the Reichspakt"
 geo.62.a: "Excellent."

 geo.63.t: "Germany Has Declined!"
 geo.63.d: "Germany has declined our request to join the Reichspakt"
 geo.63.a: "Damn."

 geo.67.t: "Elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia"
 geo.67.d: "The People's Council of Abkhazia, the devolved body established in the early days of the republic to represent the Abkhaz people, has recently held it local elections across the Abkhazia region. The establishment of the People's Council allowed the Abkhaz people to not feel intimidated or threatened by the central government, and to give them a voice in their region. The elections took place without a hitch, with more left-wing nationalist groups gaining control of the council."
 geo.67.a: "Democracy is good."

 geo.68.t: "Autonomy Question for South Ossetia"
 geo.68.d: "With the elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia a few weeks ago, people in the region of South Ossetia have begun to ask themselves why they do not have their own devolved body. Following the South Ossetian uprisings that ended in 1920, the region of South Ossetia had been relatively peaceful, and self determination for the South Ossetian people faded to an obscure idea only held by intellectual circles. However, following the economic and subsequent political disasters in 1936, tensions once again flared up in the region, and with many remembering the violence of the early days of the republic, a military detachment was sent to the region all the way until the election. Now that the people of Abkhazia have exercised their local democracy, the question that is beginning to enter the mainstream is whether the South Ossetian people deserve the same."
 geo.68.a: "Hopefully this is settled peacefully."

 geo.69.t: "South Ossetia Autonomy March in Tskhinvali"
 geo.69.d: "The minor groups that have been fighting for South Ossetian autonomy seem to have finally broken into the mainstream, with mass support for a pro-autonomy march that has taken place in Tskhinvali, the capital of the South Ossetian region. Though there was no violence between protestors and police, there are fears that if demonstrations like this continue, more extremist elements of this movement might enter the mainstream."
 geo.69.a: "Oh dear..."

 geo.70.t: "People's Council of Abkhazia Endorses South Ossetian Autonomy"
 geo.70.d: "The left-wing controlled People's Council of Abkhazia has officially announced that they, and therefore the Abkhazian region they represent, endorse the idea of a devolved body for the people of South Ossetia. It has become clear that this is something that we cannot ignore, and many in government demand a response, lest the unrest in the South Ossetian region grow."
 geo.70.a: "Establish a People's Council of South Ossetia."
 geo.70.b: "We cannot be pressured into this."

 geo.71.t: "People's Council of South Ossetia Established"
 geo.71.d: "Final preparations have been made, and a new People's Council of South Ossetia has been established, to represent the people of South Ossetia. A provisional government has been appointed until official elections to the council can take place. Protests in the region have ceased, and though there are still some calling for all out independence, it is limited to intellectual circles, and the masses are generally content."
 geo.71.a: "Thank goodness."

 geo.72.t: "South Ossetians Begin to Arm Themselves"
 geo.72.d: "After being endorsed by the People's Council of Abkhazia, many South Ossetians assumed that autonomy was on the way. When this desire for autonomy was rejected by our government, many have instead come to the conclusion that a crackdown in the region was on the way. Therefore, many South Ossetians in the region, remembering the multiple conflicts that have occurred in the region, have begun to arm themselves with weapons smuggled in from the north. There is still a chance to end any danger of conflict if autonomy for the region is announced. Instead, it'd be a good idea to increase the military presence there."
 geo.72.a: "Increase military presence."
 geo.72.b: "No need for bloodshed, establish a People's Council of South Ossetia."

 geo.73.t: "Military Police Kill Three Protestors"
 geo.73.d: "Following further protests across the South Ossetia region, military police were forced to establish a permanent presence there. After a few hours of protests in Tskhinvali, a fire was started, which, after being blamed on the protestors, led to clashes between military police and protestors. The situation quickly deteriorated, and a riot quickly broke out. During clashes throughout the night, many people were injured, and three rioters were killed. With news of the deaths spreading across the South Ossetian region, tensions have flared, and we should expect a reaction from the people."
 geo.73.a: "Guess this can't be solved peacefully..."

 geo.74.t: "South Ossetian Rebels Attack Military Base"
 geo.74.d: "Following the deaths of protestors a few days ago, a group of disorganised South Ossetian rebels have gathered together and attacked a military base near the northern border. Though the military presence there was able to quickly pacify the attackers, it led to the deaths of 13 South Ossetians and 4 Georgian troops. It is clear that something drastic must be done to defuse the situation. We could finally give in to the South Ossetians demands for autonomy, or crack down on them hard, to finally crush any desire for autonomy by force."
 geo.74.a: "Its time to give in and establish autonomy for them."
 geo.74.b: "Crack down hard militarily."

 geo.75.t: "Military Crackdown in South Ossetia"
 geo.75.d: "Following tensions flaring in the South Ossetian region, the military has been sent in to crush any further resistance in the area. Many of the ringleaders of the protests and riots have been arrested, and the protests have been broken up by force. Though there have been clashes with rebels, they have quickly been put down by the military. South Ossetia is secure."
 geo.75.a: "Excellent."

 geo.76.t: "Georgia, Unified at Last"
 geo.76.d: "Long-lost, but never forgotten: following our recent victory in the war against the Ottoman Empire, our Lazi brethren in Rize and beyond have finally returned to the loving embrace of their true homeland. Throughout history, the region and its people were ruled by countless realms, from puny principalities to great empires, but they stayed true to the Orthodox faith and their history deeply intertwined with that of Georgia - until the Ottoman hordes came along, that is. Following the Turkish conquest of the 'Sanjak of Lazistan' in the mid-16th century, a policy of Islamisation was enforced, driving a religious wedge between the culturally fraternal Georgian and Lazi people.\n\nNonetheless, many in Tbilisi have celebrated Rize's liberation, and the Homshetsi, an Armenian minority living mostly to the east of the city, are overly joyous to have been freed from the grasp of the tyrants who had long persecuted them in the past. The Lazi, however, had over time grown rather content with Ottoman rule, and thus view the recent change in government with scepticism. Given Rize's proximity to the frontlines, many of them have not only lost their homes and loved ones in the war but have also seen their lives and hopes shattered by shells fired from our cannons, and it remains one of the major tasks of [GEO.GetLeader] and his government to heal the wounds torn open by the conflict and to restore Lazi trust in Georgia and its people.\n\nNaturally, the process of rebuilding has already begun. Workers from across the country are cleaning up debris, and relief organisations are providing food and shelter for those in need. The Ottoman administration of Rize has by now been mostly replaced, the port, which had been largely destroyed by Ottoman troops following our advance, is now once again welcoming ships from across the Black Sea, and it seems that a state of normalcy is slowly returning to our new lands. Still, it remains to be seen how long it will take for the hearts of the Lazi people to mend, and for them to embrace our rule for what it truly is: liberation."
 geo.76.a: "Georgia welcomes her lost sons!"

 geo.77.t: "A Chance to Unite"
 geo.77.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has fallen into war with its Arab neighbours, and this war risks finally destroying half a century of imperial history. Thus gives us the ideal opportunity for a long-awaited unification with our co-religionists and half-brothers living in the Batumi area. However, we cannot count on Germany's support for our actions, as it has quite close links with the Ottomans, and would prefer to support a more favourable potential ally.\nWhat will be our decision?"
 geo.77.a: "Defend what we already have."
 geo.77.b: "Long live the Great and United Georgia!"

 geo.120.t: "1936 Election"
 geo.120.d: "Following the chaos caused by Black Monday and the failures of the SSDP government, Evgeni Gegechkori was forced to call a new election, an election he knew he was likely to lose. Today, with people going out to the polls, it looks like it'll be close, with no party able to get a sole majority. It is likely the EDP-MMEP coalition will win overall, though it might be possible for the SSDP to scrape a minority victory."
 geo.120.a: "The Menshevik SSDP survive with a minority."
 geo.120.b: "The EDP-MMEP Coalition wins a majority."

 geo.121.t: "The SSDP Coalition Question"
 geo.121.d: "Though the SSDP was victorious in the election, no party has enough seats to form a majority government. Therefore, a coalition is necessary. One can either be formed with the federalist, nationalist and decentralist SSPSP, or the radically socialist SR. Both parties have made clear they are open to a coalition."
 geo.121.a: "Form a coalition government with the SSPSP."
 geo.121.b: "Form a coalition government with the SR."

 geo.122.t: "[GetYear] Election"
 geo.122.d: "After weeks of campaigning, it looks likely to be a close election, with both parties being forced into a coalition. The party with the most seats is..."
 geo.122.a: "... the SSDP."
 geo.122.b: "... the EDP-MMEP Coalition."

 geo.123.t: "The SSDP Coalition Question"
 geo.123.d: "Though the SSDP was victorious in the election, no party has enough seats to form a majority government. Therefore, a coalition is necessary. One can either be formed with the federalist, nationalist and decentralist SSPSP, or the radically socialist SR. Both parties have made clear they are open to a coalition."
 geo.123.a: "Form a coalition government with the SSPSP."
 geo.123.b: "Form a coalition government with the SR."

 GEO_giorgi_bagration_mukhraneli_regnal: "Giorgi XIII"
 GEO_giorgi_bagration_mukhraneli_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! July 16th, 1884, in Saint Petersburg, Saint Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The tale of house Bagration-Mukhrani begins with the rise of the early 16th century prince Bagrat, who was granted the fief of Mukhrani by his brother, the King of Georgia, but eventually rose to assume a great deal of autonomous power and gained de-facto sovereignty over his fiefdom. After the Russian conquest of Georgia, the lords of House Bagration and House Bagration-Mukhrani were regarded as equally powerful, but soon the Mukhrani branch began to gain more and more support in Russian politics, especially among Georgian nationalists. The elder branch of house Bagration eventually died out, leaving the Princes of Mukhrani as the next in line to the Georgian throne. The Bagration-Mukhrani's claim was officially recognised when the throne was won by George Bagration in the recent political referendum, restoring the Georgian monarchy. King George IX is considered a rather aloof man, with little political opinions of his own. He has been strongly influenced by his late father, Alexander, who died fighting the Bolsheviks, as well as his son Prince Irakli who is commonly considered a far more capable political schemer. This has left King George as a fairly easily manipulated figure, which frustrates much of the nobility. Nevertheless, the king is still a popular man among the common people. Even if he wasn't invited as a signee, he gave his endorsement to the Georgian declaration of independence in 1918, and later enlisted as a soldier in the war against the Bolsheviks. It remains to be seen if this untrained, unprepared king can become a man in his own right, or if he will be defined by the influence of his son, his advisors, generals and prime minister."

 GEO_ioachim_von_hohenzollern_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 17th, 1890, in Berlin Palace, Berlin, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Prince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia was born in Berlin, two years into the reign of his father Wilhelm II. Like his brothers, he attended elite schools and entered military service, eventually joining the 1st Foot Guards of the Royal Prussian Army, the most prestigious regiment in the German Empire. During the Weltkrieg, he served on the eastern front, but was wounded two months into the war and immediately sent home to Berlin. After returning, Joachim became engaged to the German noblewoman Marie Auguste von Anhalt, marrying her the next year. The couple had one child, Prince Karl Franz Joseph of Prussia, presently known as the Crown Prince Ioseb of Georgia. Joachim became quite a fixation among nascent states during the Weltkrieg, he was suggested as a potential monarch in Ireland, Finland and Poland but in all three cases, he was rejected, or passed up for other candidates. In 1917 the German diplomat Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg and monarchists in the Committee of Independent Georgia sought to install Joachim as king of Georgia, but the government of Noe Zhordania vigorously opposed it. Later, the idea was revived by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the staunch germanophile Georges V. Matchabelli, who pushed for a referendum on restoring the monarchy. Joachim took the crown and adopted the regnal name Ioachim, but the foreign prince has not made many public appearances, as he is known to be struggling with learning the Georgian language and personal issues related to his mental health. He has still made token efforts to endear himself to the people, and already enjoys a great deal of support among the nobility thanks to Matchabelli."

 GEO_noe_zhordania: "Noe Zhordania"
 GEO_noe_zhordania_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 14th, 1868, in Lanchkhuti, Guria, Kutais Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Like many of his peers, Noe Zhordania emerged from the muddled waters of Georgian nationalism and Marxism, having found a synthesis between the two. In the early 20th century he became well known as an opponent to the merger between the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party with its Georgian counterpart and as a staunch Menshevik, who was personal friends with Karl Kautsky. In 1917 he was elected chairman of the Tbilisi Soviet and denounced the Bolshevik Revolution, thereafter successfully advocating for the creation of a democratic Georgian Republic. He became its first popularly elected prime minister and from this position oriented Georgia's foreign policy towards the German Empire, utilising his connections to German politicians in order to gain international recognition, as well as economic and military assistance. Zhordania stopped short of fully acceding to Germany's demands that Georgia should become a monarchy under a Hohenzollern prince, which he opposed not only due to his republican beliefs, but also because he feared it would make Georgia a de-facto client state to the Kaiserreich. He supervised the creation of the Georgian constitution and forged a historic compromise between the Social Democrats and the National Democrats, to unite behind the common cause of Georgian nationalism, despite their radical ideological differences. This de-facto truce with the conservatives helped Zhordania be re-elected throughout the last 18 years, but in 1935 he announced his decision to soon step down and make room for a younger generation in the Georgian leadership. This came after a period of economic stagnation and numerous ineffectual reforms, which have cast a complicated shadow over Zhordania's legacy."

Born into a noble family, Evgeni Gegechkori began his studies in Kutaisi before attending Moscow State University. Between his studies, he became affiliated with social-democratic circles while also emerging as a leader of the Georgian student community in Moscow. Despite being arrested for his affiliation with the Mensheviks in 1904, he graduated with a degree in law in 1906. Returning home, he became a juror and a social democratic organiser in Georgia, proving to be a popular orator with international standing. His first major taste of national political power began when he was appointed as a commissioner of the provisional government in Kutaisi during the February Revolution, and when Georgia declare its independence Gegechkori was in a strong position to join the new Menshevik dominated leadership of the nation.\n\nServing for over a decade in Noe Zhordania's various governments, Gegechkori has accumulated considerable political experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice, and Minister for Internal Affairs. His numerous portfolios and his long service has made him a natural successor to Zhordania, but now that he is in the limelight, it is up to him to step out of his predecessor's shadows if he is to keep Georgia safe and independent."

 GEO_grigol_veshapeli_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1891, in Sairkhe, Shorapani District, Kutais Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born in 1891 to a family in Sairkhe, Shorapani region, Grigol Veshapeli went to school in Kutaisi. He was award a scholarship for his academic talents, allowing him to receive secondary education at Moscow State University studying literature. He contributed to \"Georgia\", commentating on current events and beginning his career as a politician. Fluent in Russian, English, French and German, the young man was a natural leader in the budding Georgian political scene. He helped co-found the National Democratic Party, and became a representative in the newly independent nation's Constituent assembly.\n\nAs the years passed however, Veshapeli distanced himself from the party he once founded, establishing a splinter group known initially as the \"Independent National Democratic Party\". It soon became known as the National Landowners Party of Georgia, and began courting landowners, industrialists, and intellectuals. While Veshapeli and his party spent most of its years as a junior partner to their old National Democratic Party colleagues, changing political winds and a new foreign hegemony has seen Veshapeli become the leader of Georgia. Finally given a chance to shine, Grigol Veshapeli and the MMEP go on to steer Georgia through its latest tumult."

 GEO_iese_baratashvili_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 4th, 1874, in Borbali, Borchaly District, Tiflis Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Iese was born to the princely Baratashvili family in the village of Borbalo. Whilst studying law at the university of Saint Petersburg he began to involve himself with radical student politics, and after graduating he took on a number of high profile cases as the defendant for various Georgian nationalists and revolutionaries. He helped found the Social-Federalist party and aligned himself with the Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionaries, supporting them in the Duma after the revolution of 1905. He mostly sought to use the Russian parliament as a platform to raise a number of progressive issues, including Agrarianism, economic relief, combating antisemitism as well as addressing the questions of Georgian autonomy and nationalism, but he failed to gain any meaningful traction among Russia's political elite. Following Georgia's independence, he has emerged onto the nation's political scene as a rather influential figure, beginning to make a career in his own right and now promoting his ideas in earnest, rather than merely petitioning powers greater than him."

 GEO_mikheil_tsereteli: "Mikheil Tsereteli"
 GEO_mikheil_tsereteli_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 23rd, 1878, in Tskhrukveti, Shorapani District, Kutais Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Prince Mikheil Tsereteli was born to a noble family in the Imereti region of Western Georgia. Like other members of his family, Mikheil pursued a career in academia, studying abroad at Heidelberg University and receiving a PhD in history in 1913. He has taught as an associate professor in several institutions and is an expert in Sumerology, Georgia and the Caucuses, Ibero-Caucasian civilisation, and Sociology, having authored dozens of academic works.\n\nBut that is not why he is known today. Mikheil Tsereteli will not go down in history as just another dusty academic, but as a fierce champion of Georgian nationalism. Even before graduating from university, in 1908 he co-founded the Committee of Independent Georgia in Constantinople, publishing the journal \"Nation\". During his time at Heidelberg, he cofounded another organisation of the same name, right as the Russian Empire began to collapse. Reaching across the political aisle, including the dominant Mensheviks, he briefly became an ambassador of the new republic to Sweden and Norway from 1918-1919.\n\nStill, as Georgian politics began to radicalise in the 1920s, Tsereteli helped cofound the nationalist Tetri Giorgi along with General Leo Kereselidze. The professor's wing of the party was never the dominant faction, however it would appear that fate (and outside benefactors) have decided that the Mikheil Tsereteli would be the one to lead Georgia through these troubling times."

 GEO_ekvtime_takaishvili_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 5th, 1862, in Likhauri, Ozurgeti District, Kutais Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Ekvtime was born to a family of minor Georgian nobility in the province of Guria, but was orphaned at a very early age and raised by his siblings, as well as his grandmother. Although initially known as a troublesome child, after Ekvtime went to Petrograd's University he became recognised as an exemplary student with a passion for history and archaeology. His first foray into politics came after he became a teacher in Tbilisi and grew sympathetic to local radical student groups, whilst his passion for Georgia's long and storied history fostered a great sense of national pride in him. After the February Revolution he signed Georgia's declaration of independence and became a key member of the conservative National Democratic Party, fearing the growing radicalism of the Social Democratic Party. He served as Deputy Chairman of the Parliament, where he sought to defend the rights of the Georgian church and the peasants, against the growing secularism and urbanisation espoused by the Social Democrats. He is also a principled defender of public education, and an irredentist for Georgia's historic borders. Despite his aristocratic background, he has been opposed to the influence of the nobility on Georgia's politics but has also expressed a degree of sympathy for the idea of an apolitical, constitutional monarch who can act as a figurehead for the country. He has also defended the government's ownership of Georgia's national treasury, preventing famous national treasures and relics from falling into the hands of private collectors."

Maglakelidze was born in 1893 in the then Russian Empire. First studying in the gymnasium in Kutaisi, he went on to study law in in Moscow. Fighting first on the Russian side in the Weltkrieg, he allied with the new Georgian nation after the socialist revolution, earning praise for his conduct in the war. Afterwards, he temporarily took time off from the Army, travelling to Berlin to earn a PhD in law. Returning to the Army in the late twenties, he has slowly worked his way up the chain of command, only sometimes hindered by his outspoken conservatism, and germanophilia. With these qualifications, the new overlords of Georgia easily found him as their man to lead the country."

 GEO_leo_shengelaia_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1887, in Obuji, Kutais Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Born in 1887 in the Zugdidi region of Georgia, at an early age Leo Shengelaia sought an education in law. During his time at university he made contact with radical student groups and became a member of the Socialist Revolutionary party, becoming particularly interested in their programmes for educational reform. In 1917 he formed a \"Free University\" with 5 other comrades, a small private school funded by the SRs, meant to educate the lower classes of Tbilisi. During his time as an administrator at the school he gained recognition for his papers on Georgia's agrarian and labour issues, which eventually merited him a seat at the National Council of Georgia and a chance to affix his signature to the nation's declaration of independence. Leo served within the Georgian parliament and steadily rose through the ranks of the SRs until a major schism appeared within the party in 1922, dividing the right leaning Socialist Revolutionaries from their left leaning counterparts. Leo joined the leftist politician Ivan Gobechia and assumed control of the party's central committee, eventually being confirmed as its official leader a few years later with the left wing of the party's and Gobechia's support. He has thereafter served as a cautious supporter of the Social Democratic government of Georgia, unprepared to assume control of the government himself, but undaunted at the prospect of one day doing so."
