In our efforts to liberalise and democratise the Republic we should reopen the Great Council."

 VNC_state_inquistors: "Create the State Inquisitor Tribunal"
 VNC_state_inquistors_desc: "In the days of yore we had the State Inquisitors to help make sure that the republic was safe from internal threats.

 VNC_new_nobility: "Invite Exiled Nobles"
 VNC_new_nobility_desc: "Many of the noble families that once made up the ruling class of Venice had their titles stripped by the Republicans or fled Italy during the civil war.

 VNC_merchant_princes: "Encourage a Mercantile Elite"

 VNC_asseses_the_economy: "A Modern Consoli dei Mercanti"

 VNC_venetian_industry: "Kickstart Venetian Industry"
 VNC_venetian_industry_desc: "Although our Republic was known for its  merchants and traders, it still had a flourishing glass and textile industry. We must begin to develop a more modern industrial base if we wish to live up to our past."

 VNC_bounty_of_the_sea: "Bounty of the Sea"
 VNC_bounty_of_the_sea_desc: "The Adriatic is the very soul of the Venetian people, and our history reflects this. By expanding our shipbuilding industries and utilising the natural resources of the Adriatic, we can once again become the trading hub of the Mediterranean."

 VNC_avaiation_industry: "Cultural Renewal"
 VNC_avaiation_industry_desc: "While overshadowed in popular memory by the greats of Florence and Milan, Venice was the birthplace of a good many men of note. Just as Tintoretto's brush illuminated the world, let us whet the people's nascent appetite for finer things."
 VNC_research_institutes: "Specialised Research Academies"
 VNC_research_institutes_desc: "While our education system is fairly modern, we shall never possess the same capacity for research as larger powers without investment. Specialised research academies, universities focused on specific subjects as directed by the state should be established to accomplish that."
 VNC_venetian_radio: "Venetian Radio"
 VNC_venetian_radio_desc: "Radio has become an important technology for both military and civilian use. We must ensure we have a strong grasp on this technology if we wish for our people to be entertained and our military to be informed."

 VNC_economic_miracle_desc: "Prosperity is slowly returning to the land. The days of great merchant ships packing the harbour will soon return, and with them the return of Venice's rightful place as one of the great powers of Europe."

 VNC_modernize_the_navy: "Modernise the Navy"
 VNC_modernize_the_navy_desc: "For centuries the Venetian Navy was the pride of our armed forces. However, times have changed and we are now struggling to even defend our coasts. We must begin a programme of naval modernisation if we wish to change this"
 VNC_expand_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 VNC_expand_dockyards_desc: "The Venetian Arsenal worked hundreds of years ago, but is no longer the peak of military engineering it once was. We must build larger, modern dockyards if we want our navy to be a powerful force once more."
 VNC_defend_the_coast: "Build Coastal Fortifications"
 VNC_defend_the_coast_desc: "Until we complete the modernisation programmes, our navy will not be able to repel enemy invasions. We must build a series of fortifications along our shores to compensate for this."

 VNC_continue_with_reforms_desc: "Naval strategies have changed in the centuries since the height of our power, and we ensure our naval commanders are trained in the latest in naval military theory."

 VNC_heavy_cruisers: "Incrociatori da Bataja"
 VNC_heavy_cruisers_desc: "In order to support our fleet, large battlecruisers are needed. Producing these will be expensive, but it will surely be worth it."
 VNC_battle_cruisers: "Corazzate"
 VNC_battle_cruisers_desc: "While we lack the ability to produce dreadnoughts in sufficient number, smaller battleships are more than sufficient to repel any foe, and can easily be produced en masse."
 VNC_life_at_sea: "Life at Sea"
 VNC_life_at_sea_desc: "The sea and Venetians go hand-in-hand. We have lived on the sea for centuries, and as such our merchant marine is both large and capable."
 VNC_venetian_marines: "Fanti da Mar"
 VNC_venetian_marines_desc: "The Fanti da Mar were perhaps the first dedicated amphibious force. Let us build a new modern marine corps under their name to honour our heritage and bolster our armed forces."
 VNC_thalassocracy: "Proclaim Thalassocracy"
 VNC_thalassocracy_desc: "Venetian power has always been projected by the sea. While times have changed, our nation's place has not. With our naval reforms complete, we can once again assert our naval dominance. Our fleets shall be feared and revered for centuries to come!"

### Air Force Focuses ###
 VNC_army_air_upgrade: "Upgrade the Army Air Arm"
 VNC_army_air_upgrade_desc: "Ensuring our army is backed by a capable air force is vital for modern warfare. We must begin to produce fighters to ensure air superiority."
 VNC_navy_air_upgrade: "Upgrade the Naval Air Arm"
 VNC_navy_air_upgrade_desc: "It is clear that carriers are the future of capital ships, and no carrier is complete without a squadron of naval bombers."

 VNC_aeronautica_militare_desc: "The new air corps must focus on quality over quantity and have the leeway to operate without express permisson from the army or navy."
 VNC_venetian_air_companies: "Venetian  Aviation Industry"

 VNC_defned_la_serenissim: "Defend La Serenissima"

 VNC_fighters: "Support the Troops"
 VNC_fighters_desc: "While some would like to forget the importance of close air support in pursuit of more independent air force command structures, we cannot afford to reject reality. Our aircraft must not work alone, but always in tandem with the men on the ground."

### Venetian Army ###
 VNC_venetian_army: "Esercito Veneto"

 VNC_superior_fire_power: "Superior Firepower"
 VNC_superior_fire_power_desc: "While we will never have the manpower to fight a prolonged conflict, our nation's industry can become the lynchpin of our national defence.

 VNC_modernize_the_guns: "Produce Modern Small Arms"
 VNC_modernize_the_guns_desc: "As part of our focus on a small but professional army, we must make sure our soldiers have the newest in small arm technology to always have the edge over their opponents."
 VNC_artilery_effort: "Canóni of the Modern Age"
 VNC_artilery_effort_desc: "Artillery was key to German victory in the Weltkrieg. We must emulate their tactics and improve our own artillery if we wish to have similar success."
 VNC_grand_battle_plan: "Grand Battleplan"
 VNC_grand_battle_plan_desc: "Although focusing on the highest-quality equipment available may be effective, it is far too costly and our fledgling economy cannot possibly support it. We must instead focus on training our officers and commanders to have the sharpest strategic minds possible, with innovative strategies ensuring a tactical advantage over any foe."
 VNC_flexiable_planning: "Experiment with Motorisation"
 VNC_flexiable_planning_desc: "Infantry must be both motorised and sufficiently protected. Our plans must not only be implemented quickly, but remain intact beyond contact with the enemy."
 VNC_support_brigades: "Expanded Support Brigades"
 VNC_support_brigades_desc: "Non-standard support equipment allows divisions to fight more effectively and stay in the fight for longer. We must begin research on support companies and equipment to reach this goal."
 VNC_infantry_tanks: "Combined Arms"
 VNC_infantry_tanks_desc: "With the greatest land, air, and sea technologies all working in tandem, the Lion of Saint Marc shall truly roar again."
 VNC_commander_initative: "Grant Officer Autonomy"
 VNC_commander_initative_desc: "Sub-divisional commanders must have increased autonomy to interpret plans and implement them as they see fit."
 VNC_planning_schools: "Planning Schools"
 VNC_planning_schools_desc: "The drawing of maps and lines of battle is itself a science. Accordingly, specialised academies should be established for our officers."

### Venetian Revolt ###
 VNC_last_stand: "The Last Stand of Liberty"
 VNC_last_stand_desc: "The rescinding of state autonomies and the suspension of elections by the ANI was a flagrant violation of justice. It falls onto us to take arms against this tyranny and to stand for all that is good in the world. War with the Ultranationalists is coming and we must prepare by using all available stockpiles to arm anybody willing to fight."
 VNC_unite_rebel: "Unite the Rebel Forces"
 VNC_unite_rebel_desc: "The impromptu nature of our rebellion and the raising of militia forces has meant that our high command is facing difficulties with organising the armed forces. Confusion over orders within the military is common and must be remedied as soon as possible."
 VNC_raise_militias: "Raise Partisan Units"
 VNC_raise_militias_desc: "After the liberation of Friuli, many eager volunteers, who were unable to join the rebellion amongst the initial confusion in the rebellion, have petitioned to fight alongside our military against the tyrants in Milan. We must act upon this opportunity and recruit these men."
 VNC_rally_defectors: "Rally Sympathetic Defectors"
 VNC_rally_defectors_desc: "With the ANI facing increasing losses against Venetian forces, they are facing growing opposition both among the civilian population and the armed forces. What was promised to be a swift war has now turned into a quagmire while the prospect of foreign intervention is becoming more of a reality. We can capitalise on this opposition by appealing to disaffected soldiers to defect and help overthrow the tyrant Ciano."
 VNC_promote_coordination: "Promote Army Coordination"
 VNC_promote_coordination_desc: "Although our efforts to unify our rag-tag forces into a proper army have been bearing some success, the military is still facing issues of cohesion. Further effort must be undertaken if we are to defeat the ANI."
 VNC_desperate_defence: "Resist the Nationalist Offensive"
 VNC_desperate_defence_desc: "We are on the edge of defeat, which will surely spell for the rest of Italy. Propaganda will have to be spread among our soldiers to remind them of why they fight. Unfortunately we will have to resort to desperate measures to ensure our survival."
 VNC_utilise_austrian_ties: "Utilise Austrian Ties"
 VNC_utilise_austrian_ties_desc: "Our rebellion has been welcomed with open arms by the Austrians, since Ciano represents a threat to their interests. They are willing to send covert aid to assist us, which we can't refuse."
 VNC_import_arms: "Import Foreign Arms"
 VNC_import_arms_desc: "Our army requires more supplies if we are to stand a chance against the National Republic. Fortunately for us, the Austrian are willing to lend their old stockpiles for a cheap price."
 VNC_final_push: "The Final Push"
 VNC_final_push_desc: "Victory after victory has been accomplished on the battlefield and the defeat of Ciano and his ilk is all but assured. Morale among the military is at an all time high while the ANI is facing mass desertions."
 VNC_propaganda: "Spread Anti-War Propaganda"
 VNC_propaganda_desc: "As this war pits brother against brother, calls for peace have grown louder. The failure of the ANI to produce a swift victory is causing major morale issues which we can exploit. With the assistance of Austria, we can smuggle propaganda calling for the overthrowal of Ciano. With many already questioning the ability of the ANI to win the war with thousands already dead and a common sentiment that Ciano has left Italy vulnerable to the socialists, this is sure to be effective."

### Events ###
 venice.1.t: "First Session of the Great Council"
 venice.1.d: "For the first time in over a hundred years, the Great Council of Venice convenes once more. Members from across the republic gather in Venice to discuss how the Venetian Republic should be structured. Already two camps have emerged between those that want Venice to be a modern republic with greatly expanded civil rights and liberties, and those that want to see the Republic of Venice restored to as it was during its golden era."
 venice.1.a: "Let us begin"

 venice.2.t: "Election and term of the Doge"
 venice.2.d: "The first question to come up is the election of the Doge. In the old republic, the Doge was elected for life by the Great Council. 30 members were chosen by random lot, who would then be reduced to 9 by random lot. Those 9 would name 40 members who had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 40 were reduced by lot to 12, who named 25 members. Those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45, and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were then reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. These 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25, and they would finally choose the Doge, who kept the position for life.\n\nNaturally, the old system is considered rather archaic. Those within the Great Council seeking to modernise the Republic instead propose that the Doge should be elected directly by the people and with a four-year term, subject to re-election."

 venice.51.d.revolt: "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: Giuseppe Volpi, hero of the revolt, and Giovanni Ponti. Volpi has widespread popular support thanks to his status as war hero, but there are many conservatives who believe his ideas of reform are too liberal. Ponti, on the other hand is favoured by the newly-reestablished nobility. The vote is sure to be a close one."
 venice.51.d.norevolt: "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: the liberal, Giuseppe Volpi, and the conservative, Giovanni Ponti. Considering Volpi and his party were not even in favour of returning to the ways of the old republic, Ponti is the heavy favourite. Even so, Volpi has numerous connections from his many stints in provincial government, and there is still a chance he could win."
 venice.51.a: "Giuseppe Volpi is our new Doge!"
 venice.51.b: "Giovanni Ponti is our new Doge!"
