 VNC_life_at_sea: "Life at Sea"
 VNC_life_at_sea_desc: "Venetians are naturally suited to life at sea, our merchant marine should likewise be as hearty."
 VNC_venetian_marines: "Fanti da Mar"

 VNC_superior_fire_power_desc: "We shall never have the manpower to fight a prolonged conflict with the great powers of the world, our nation's industry however, can become the lynchpin of our national defence.

### Venetian Revolt ###
 VNC_last_stand: "The Last Stand of Liberty"
 VNC_last_stand_desc: "The rescinding of state autonomies and the suspension of elections by the ANI was a flagrant violation of justice. It falls onto us to take arms against this tyranny and to stand for all that is good in the world. War with the Ultranationalists is coming and we must prepare by using all available stockpiles to arm anybody willing to fight."
 VNC_unite_rebel: "Unite the Rebel Forces"
 VNC_unite_rebel_desc: "The impromptu nature of our rebellion and the raising of militia forces has meant that our high command is facing difficulties with organising the armed forces. Confusion over orders within the military is common and must be remedied as soon as possible."
 VNC_raise_militias: "Raise Partisan Units"
 VNC_raise_militias_desc: "After the liberation of Friuli, many eager volunteers, who were unable to join the rebellion amongst the initial confusion in the rebellion, have petitioned to fight alongside our military against the tyrants in Milan. We must act upon this opportunity and recruit these men."
 VNC_rally_defectors: "Rally Sympathetic Defectors"
 VNC_rally_defectors_desc: "With the ANI facing increasing losses against Venetian forces, they are facing growing opposition both among the civilian population and the armed forces. What was promised to be a swift war has now turned into a quagmire while the prospect of foreign intervention is becoming more of a reality. We can capitalise on this opposition by appealing to disaffected soldiers to defect and help overthrow the tyrant Ciano."
 VNC_promote_coordination: "Promote Army Coordination"
 VNC_promote_coordination_desc: "Although our efforts to unify our rag-tag forces into a proper army have been bearing some success, the military is still facing issues of cohesion. Further effort must be undertaken if we are to defeat the ANI."
 VNC_desperate_defence: "Resist the Nationalist Offensive"
 VNC_desperate_defence_desc: "We are on the edge of defeat, which will surely spell for the rest of Italy. Propaganda will have to be spread among our soldiers to remind them of why they fight. Unfortunately we will have to resort to desperate measures to ensure our survival."
 VNC_utilise_austrian_ties: "Utilise Austrian Ties"
 VNC_utilise_austrian_ties_desc: "Our rebellion has been welcomed with open arms by the Austrians, since Ciano represents a threat to their interests. They are willing to send covert aid to assist us, which we can't refuse."
 VNC_import_arms: "Import Foreign Arms"
 VNC_import_arms_desc: "Our army requires more supplies if we are to stand a chance against the National Republic. Fortunately for us, the Austrian are willing to lend their old stockpiles for a cheap price."
 VNC_final_push: "The Final Push"
 VNC_final_push_desc: "Victory after victory has been accomplished on the battlefield and the defeat of Ciano and his ilk is all but assured. Morale among the military is at an all time high while the ANI is facing mass desertions."
 VNC_propaganda: "Spread Anti-War Propaganda"
 VNC_propaganda_desc: "As this war pits brother against brother, calls for peace have grown louder. The failure of the ANI to produce a swift victory is causing major morale issues which we can exploit. With the assistance of Austria, we can smuggle propaganda calling for the overthrowal of Ciano. With many already questioning the ability of the ANI to win the war with thousands already dead and a common sentiment that Ciano has left Italy vulnerable to the socialists, this is sure to be effective."

### Events ###
 venice.1.t: "First Session of the Great Council"
 venice.1.d: "For the first time in over a hundred years, the Great Council of Venice convenes once more. Members from across the republic gather in Venice to discuss how the Venetian Republic should be structured. Already two camps have emerged between those that want Venice to be a modern republic and those that want the Republic of Old to be re-established."
 venice.1.a: "Let us begin"

 venice.2.t: "Election and term of the Doge"
 venice.2.d: "The first question to come up is the election of the Doge. In the old republic, the Doge was elected for life by the Great Council. 30 members were chosen by random lot, who would then be reduced to 9 by random lot. Those 9 would name 40 members who had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 40 were reduced by lot to 12, who named 25 members. Those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45, and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were then reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. These 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25, and they would finally choose the Doge, who kept the position for life.\n\nNaturally, the old system is considered rather archaic. Those within the Great Council seeking to modernise the Republic instead propose that the Doge should be elected directly by the people and with a four-year term limit, subject to re-election."

 venice.51.t: "Electing the Doge"
 venice.51.d.revolt: "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: Giuseppe Volpi, hero of the revolt, and Giovanni Ponti. Volpi would perhaps be a shoo-in, thanks to his role in obtaining Venice's independence, but there are many conservatives who believe his ideas of reform are too liberal. Ponti is far more favoured for his place among the wealthy elite, and the fact he would see the role of the nobility expanded... whereas Volpi was not even in favour of returning to the ways of the Old Republic. Still, the vote will be close."
 venice.51.d.norevolt: "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: the liberal, Giuseppe Volpi, and the conservative, Giovanni Ponti. Considering Volpi and his party were not even in favour of returning to the ways of the old republic, Ponti is the heavy favourite. Even so, Volpi's connections among the elite are considerable, due to his many stints in provincial government, and there is a chance he could still win."
 venice.51.a: "Giuseppe Volpi is our new Doge!"
 venice.51.b: "Giovanni Ponti is our new Doge!"
