### Parties ###
 ACC_totalist_party: "TUEL"
 ACC_totalist_party_long: "Trade Union Educational League\n§LThe latest and longest lasting of several Syndicalist labour organisations founded by William Z. Foster, the Trade Union Educational League was founded in 1920 from the remnants of Foster’s Syndicalist League of North America and International Trade Union Educational League. Opposed to the Socialist Party’s policies of electoral participation and the IWW’s strategy of dual unionism, the TUEL instead maintains an anti-political ultra-syndicalist approach of \"boring from within\" the American Federation of Labor, a strategy which has seen some success, particularly in Chicago, where the Chicago Federation of Labor led by John Fitzpatrick has become closely aligned with Foster. Ideologically meanwhile, the TUEL has diverged somewhat from mainstream socialism in the United States, promoting a form of \"Patriotic Syndicalism\" that borrows from Sorelian ideas emerging across the Atlantic.§!\n"
 ACC_syndicalist_party: "Socialists (Ind. Unionists)"
 ACC_syndicalist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America - Industrial Unionist Faction\n§LFounded in 1901, the Socialist Party of America quickly gained traction as the premier socialist political force in the United States. First drawing support from workers, farmers, immigrants, and social reformers, among others, it was soon faced with crisis, as the revolutionary wave of the late 1910s sparked a large factional struggle within the party, between the moderate \"Regulars\" and the \"Radicals\", who supported revolutionary action.\n\nThough the Radicals eventually emerged victorious, they were compelled by the success of the British Revolution to join Farmer-Labor, a decision which enabled them to make sweeping electoral gains in the 1932 and ‘34 elections, taking control of several midwestern state governments. It was this infiltration of Farmer-Labor which allowed the SPA to grow into a formidable political force, one capable of fermenting Civil War. As such, the party is now strictly banned in Constitutional-held territory, with organisers arrested (or worse) on even remote suspicion.§!\n"
 ACC_radical_socialist_party: "Socialists (Progressives)"
 ACC_radical_socialist_party_long: "Socialist Party of America - Progressive Caucus\n§LFounded in 1901, the Socialist Party of America quickly gained traction as the premier socialist political force in the United States.

 ACC_social_democrat_party: "Farmer-Labor"
 ACC_social_democrat_party_long: "Farmer-Labor Party\n§LWith the collapse of the old Farmer-Labor Party and the abrupt exit of the SPA from legal politics, those Farmer-Labor politicians on the west coast, who had never been particularly fond of the alliance with the SPA, took the opportunity to cleanly break themselves away from the Socialists. Though they retain their commitment to most of their pre-war views and values, such as the nationalisation of utilities and support for workers and farmers, they have clearly positioned themselves against the Red government, and as such are allowed to operate generally freely in Constitutionalist territory.§!\n"
 ACC_social_liberal_party: "Democrats (Lib.)"
 ACC_social_liberal_party_long: "Democratic Party - Liberal Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democrats, usually associated with the north, follows largely in the legacy of Woodrow Wilson. It is generally supported by urban \"ethnic\" catholic voters, as well as liberals opposed to Farmer-Labor, and supports modest government intervention to support the economy, as well as greater participation on the world stage.§!\n"
 ACC_market_liberal_party: "Republicans"
 ACC_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party\n§LFounded in 1854 as a broad tent party opposed to the Slave Power, the Republican Party has generally been regarded as the United States’ \"natural governing party\" since the end of the First American Civil War. Representing the industrial interests which came to predominate in the country after the defeat of the Slave Power, as well as northeastern old stock protestants and wealthier western farmers, the Republican coalition has until recently generally maintained a long-term stranglehold on US politics.\n\nDivided between progressive, liberal, and conservative wings, the ideological divides of the \"Grand Old Party\" are generally more mild than that of the Democrats or Progressives. Conservative Republicans generally support higher tariffs and laissez-faire economics, while liberal or progressive Republicans are inclined towards tariff reform and economic interventionism, though to a less centralised degree than other liberals. They also differ on foreign policy, where liberals favour more foreign involvement, in contrast to isolationist progressives and conservatives.§!\n"
 ACC_social_conservative_party: "Democrats (Con.)"
 ACC_social_conservative_party_long: "Democratic Party - Conservative Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nThe conservative wing of the Democrats, usually associated with the south, has been dominant in that region since the end of reconstruction. It is the natural ruling party in most of the south, with nomination tantamount to election. Divided between agrarian reactionaries and more reform-minded moderate conservatives, they are generally opposed to Civil Rights reform and cartelisation of the economy, supporting smaller businesses and landowners.§!\n"
 ACC_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Union (Reactionaries)"
 ACC_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Union Party - Reactionary Faction\n§LThe newest major party in US politics, the Union Party was recently formed primarily as a vehicle for Huey Long’s bid for the Presidency, when it became clear he would not be able to attain the Democratic nomination. A broad-tent alliance comprising Democrats, reactionaries, and anti-syndicalist Progressives, they are united by little more than their shared opposition to the Smith Administration, and at least a temporary unity behind Long as their leader.\n\nThough traditionally Long’s base of support has been in the midwestern farm states, reactionary and populist southern Democratic leaders such as Eugene Talmadge and Theodore Bilbo have rallied behind Long out of their opposition to Smith. These southern Democrats are united primarily by their belief in white supremacy and disdain for Smith’s particular brand of liberalism. Their unity behind Long however is clearly conditional, and unlikely to last if push comes to shove.§!\n"

A broad-tent alliance comprising Democrats, reactionaries, and anti-syndicalist Progressives, they are united by little more than their shared opposition to the Smith Administration, and at least a temporary unity behind Long as their leader.\n\nLong’s primary personal base of support has, for most of his career in national politics, been in the western farm states, where his progressive but decentralist economic ideas hold sway. Long has aligned himself with western senators such as Burton Wheeler, who have come out to support his \"Share Our Wealth\" platform. It is this western faction of Long’s new party which is most loyal to him personally, and likely to stick with him through thick and thin.§!\n"

 ACC_deWitt_plan_idea_desc: "With the approval of the new national congress and the appointment of John L. DeWitt as Chief of Staff of the Western Defense Command, we're now preparing for a long war with the objective of securing our holdings after each advance instead of trying to achieve a quick victory."
 ACC_Marshall_plan_idea: "Marshall Plan"
 ACC_Marshall_plan_idea_desc: "With the approval of the new national congress and the appointment of John C. Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Western Defense Command, we're now preparing for a fast war with the objective of knocking out the enemy before we get bogged down on the West behind the Rockies. As Marshall puts it, he believes we will have no chances of success once any one of the enemy factions manages to seize the East Coast and the Midwest in its entirety, and failure to act fast enough will lead to our defeat."
 ACC_the_big_push_westwards: "Operation Glacier"
 ACC_the_big_push_westwards_desc: "After months of preparations and logistical planning, Operation Glacier has begun with the objective to cross the Rockies and take as much land as possible in order to prevent a possible enemy victory."
 ACC_military_industrial_production_1: "Military Industrial Production"
 ACC_military_industrial_production_1_desc: "With many of the national weapons factories being in the control of our enemies, we are forced to draft new contracts with our local enterprises in order to cope with the demand for our army. Luckily for us, plenty of factories in our territory have joined our cause and are more than capable of improving production if the right incentives are given. By redirecting funding from other sectors, we can provide said incentives to these companies and make sure our men stand ready and equipped for war."
 ACC_military_industrial_production_3: "Military Industrial Production"
 ACC_military_industrial_production_3_desc: "With our resounding victory in the civil war, we now count with a formidable military industrial complex. While normally in peace time, this would be time to start redirecting our funding back to civilian uses, storm clouds gather worldwide, and our mighty nation may yet again become embroiled in war. As such, an expansion of the contracts we signed and an increase of our funding to the military sector will help us be prepared for when the next conflict comes knocking."
 ACC_defense_logistics_agency_idea: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 ACC_failed_operation_liberty: "Aftermath of Operation Glacier"
 ACC_failed_operation_liberty_desc: "With the failure of Operation Glacier, general defeatism has taken hold of most of our Army, and the civilian populace grows unsettled at the result of such a costly operation. While the morale is low, many lessons have been learned at the front line, lessons which the High Command is sure to utilise to try and bring about a new plan that may yet save our nation from radicalism."

### Decisions ###
 ACC_Operation_Liberty_mission: "Operation Glacier"
 ACC_Operation_Liberty_mission_desc: "With the Civil War raging on the other side of the Rockies, the Western Defense Command High Staff has decided that, in order to win the war, a decisive strike to reach the Great Plains should be achieved. Commander in Chief Marshall has assured us that victory will be within reach if we manage to achieve our goals. However, failure to achieve these goals would undermine morale, and perhaps set us on the path for total defeat..."

### Army Focuses ###
 ACC_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command: "Create the Western Defense Command"
 ACC_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command_desc: "Since we claim to be the real America, and our Army is officially the United States Army, the command hierarchy remains unclear on many levels. As such, we will push for the creation of the Western Defense Command, an apparent detachment of the Army which will work independently, and will reunite with the Army in structure once the civil war is won."
 ACC_prepare_the_artillery: "Prepare the Artillery"
 ACC_prepare_the_artillery_desc: "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a suppressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks. As such, our immediate priority will be to repurpose the Navy's spare cannons to the artillery branch, as well as fund the development of new artillery models and improved artillery parts to facilitate mass production of this deadly weapon."
 ACC_joint_chiefs_of_staff: "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 ACC_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc: "The creation of a high command able to coordinate army, air, and naval efforts is needed to win this war, and keep our military up to date with modern theoretical standards."
 ACC_defense_logistics_agency: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 ACC_defense_logistics_agency_desc: "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralised logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."
 ACC_deWitt_in_Charge: "CIC: John Lesesne DeWitt"
 ACC_deWitt_in_Charge_desc: "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations. In his view, slow and steady advances paired up with a centralised high command will see our nation through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
 ACC_Marshall_in_command: "CIC: George Catlett Marshall"
 ACC_Marshall_in_command_desc: "Brigadier General George Catlett Marshall, has come to us with a damning prediction: If the West Coast fails to cross the Rockies and secure a foothold in the Midwest, then defeat will be assured. In his view, a quick advance through the Rockies with the help of motorised elements will be what see us through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
 ACC_protecting_Columbia: "Protecting Columbia"
 ACC_protecting_Columbia_desc: "The Army War College, the Field Artillery School, Fort Benning and many other major buildings, locations and training sites have been damaged by the war, and their reconstruction should be one of our top priorities to bring the Army back on its feet now that the civil war is over."
 ACC_military_research: "Military Research"
 ACC_military_research_desc: "While we have some of the finest universities and thinkers in the world, we cannot research everything at once. We need to pick a direction for our military research to focus in."
 ACC_weapon_designs: "New Weapon Designs"
 ACC_weapon_designs_desc: "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
 ACC_Army_rangers: "Army Rangers"
 ACC_Army_rangers_desc: "An elite group of specialised soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
 ACC_90_division_Army: "90-Division Army Plan"
 ACC_90_division_Army_desc: "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilised, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
 ACC_motorization: "Motorisation Program"
 ACC_motorization_desc: "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidise truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorised units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
 ACC_tank_production: "Increase Tank Production"
 ACC_tank_production_desc: "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
 ACC_Officer_instruction: "Officer Instruction"
 ACC_Officer_instruction_desc: "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
 ACC_recon_units: "Reconnaissance Units"
 ACC_recon_units_desc: "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
 ACC_start_operation_glacier: "Start Operation Glacier"
 ACC_start_operation_glacier_desc: "'The Object of Operation Glacier is to secure a lodgement area on the Midwest from which further offensive operations can be developed. The lodgement area must contain sufficient infrastructural support to maintain a force of at least fifteen divisions across the Rockies, preferably double that amount, and that also enable that force to be augmented by reinforcements from the West Coast area(...)'"
 ACC_defense_is_the_best_offense: "Defence is the Best Offence"
 ACC_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc: "The First step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defence construction. Trench digging and fortifications construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
 ACC_logistic_security: "Logistical Security"
 ACC_logistic_security_desc: "Logistics are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East. Investing into new munitions factories to keep our men fighting as well as funding our logistical corps should go a long way into helping us achieve this goal."
 ACC_Expand_the_Presidio: "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
 ACC_Expand_the_Presidio_desc: "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
 ACC_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics: "Improve 'Bite and Hold' Tactics"
 ACC_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics_desc: "The 'Bite and Hold' tactic was first adopted by the British during the Weltkrieg, and as the tactic, while costly, proved to be a resounding success, now more than ever we need to look at its success and analyse how we can improve it so that we may have the best attack and consolidation tactics America has to offer."
 ACC_engineer_corps_expansion: "Expand the Engineer Corps"
 ACC_engineer_corps_expansion_desc: "America has some of the largest rivers in the world, including the Mississippi, Rio Grande, and the Colorado. We should ensure our engineers have the proper tools required to build fording equipment and other field fortifications."
 ACC_coast_to_coast_planning: "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
 ACC_coast_to_coast_planning_desc: "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
 ACC_increase_military_spending: "Increase Military Spending"
 ACC_increase_military_spending_desc: "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
 ACC_bring_the_complex_west: "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
 ACC_bring_the_complex_west_desc: "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
 ACC_Columbia_needs_you: "Columbia Needs You!"
 ACC_Columbia_needs_you_desc: "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
 ACC_defense_contracts: "Defence Contractors"
 ACC_defense_contracts_desc: "Unlike some command-style economies in Europe, we must rely on contractors to produce our weapons. Ensuring these companies are prepared for this new Civil War should be a top priority."
 ACC_crossing_the_rockies: "Crossing the Rocky Mountains"
 ACC_crossing_the_rockies_desc: "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East. However, with our fate being to reclaim the rest of America, we will have to cross the Rocky Mountains eventually and face our enemies. As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaign through them."
 ACC_gi_bill: "The G.I. Bill"
 ACC_gi_bill_desc: "Massive numbers of demobilised servicemen will be a major issue in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should create education and job training programs to better reintegrate them into civilian life."
 ACC_war_bonds: "War Bonds"
 ACC_war_bonds_desc: "We need adequate funding to properly fight this war. Bonds are a popular way of fundraising, and we can easily promote them through cartoons, films, and other popular mediums."
 ACC_walkie_talkies: "Walkie-Talkies"
 ACC_walkie_talkies_desc: "Portable radios, or 'Walkie-Talkies' as they are commonly called, present a powerful tool for our army. With them, our troops can coordinate artillery and air strikes, among other things."

### Navy Focuses ###
 ACC_navy: "U.S. Navy"
 ACC_navy_desc: "The American navy was once the pride of the world. Yet much of it deserted to the traitors to the east. We should review what forces stayed loyal to our government, so we can best determine how they can serve in this war."
 ACC_great_white_fleet: "Great White Fleet"
 ACC_great_white_fleet_desc: "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."
 ACC_protect_american_trade: "Protect American Trade"
 ACC_protect_american_trade_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of America. We should focus our naval doctrine on making sure that it is protected from enemy raids."
 ACC_carrier_projects: "Carrier Projects"
 ACC_carrier_projects_desc: "Carriers are the wave of the future. We should invest in their research and construction to better project naval power."
 ACC_battle_ships: "Battleships Development"
 ACC_battle_ships_desc: "Battleships are the king of the high seas. We should start research into new models with bigger guns and better anti-air protection."
 ACC_battle_cruisers: "Battlecruiser Development"
 ACC_battle_cruisers_desc: "Battlecruisers present a middle balance between heavy battleships and faster cruisers. We should ensure we have some in our navy."
 ACC_coast_guard: "U.S. Coast Guard"
 ACC_coast_guard_desc: "Restoring the Coast Guard will ensure that trade moves smoothly, criminals are stopped at sea, and those in danger are rescued."
 ACC_light_cruisers: "Light Cruiser Development"
 ACC_light_cruisers_desc: "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
 ACC_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 ACC_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
 ACC_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 ACC_expand_dockyards_desc: "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
 ACC_submarines: "Submarine Development"
 ACC_submarines_desc: "Submarines allow us to wreak havoc on enemy shipping and heavy ships. We should ensure that our designs stay up to date against enemy destroyers and anti-submarine tactics."
 ACC_liberty_ships: "Liberty Ships"
 ACC_liberty_ships_desc: "Our shipyards, previously dedicated to commercial shipping, can easily be converted to produce massive numbers of convoys to supply our allies around the world."
 ACC_maratime_industry: "Maritime Industry"
 ACC_maratime_industry_desc: "While not nearly as historically significant as on the East Coast, we still have a strong legacy of commercial shipping. We should ensure that this industry supports the war effort."
 ACC_new_admirals: "New Admirals"

 #Intentionally playing up 'The Bomber Always Gets Through' here.:
 ACC_Strategic_Bomber_Development_desc: "Tactical bombers are all well and good for supporting the men on the ground, but the true potential of bombers lies in Strategic Bombers.

 #We are as dwarves seated upon the shoulders of giants.:

### Events ###
 america_constitutional_coalition_events.1.t: "The Impeachment of Huey Long"
 america_constitutional_coalition_events.1.d: "When Douglas MacArthur unilaterally activated War Plan White and took power in Washington, D.C., then-President Huey Long was left stranded in the middle of Kentucky. With MacArthur's forces hot on his tail, Long understandably fled to Louisiana, going home to safe harbour to plan his next move. Though the establishment had never supported Long, against MacArthur's putsch and Reed's revolution many moderates in Congress seriously considered voicing their support for Long, who was, in their eyes, the sole legitimate President.\n\nSoon after however, Long's declaration of the \"People's Government\" from Baton Rouge changed the equation dramatically. Not only did Long declare against Reed and MacArthur, he in equal measure denounced the legitimate Congress reassembling itself on the West Coast. With Long having split himself from the establishment constitutionalists, and created his own statelet where he now rules as a tinpot dictator, the window for reconciliation between Long and the establishment has closed.\n\nAs such, today, the Senate has voted to convict former President Long of treason and abuse of power. Though impeachment was in the air in Long's last days in Washington, only now has the process been completed. Now, Quentin Roosevelt takes office not as acting President, but as President in his own right."

The stated goal of this legislation is to ensure 'morality' in film, though many see it as a way to subvert syndicalist themes in films.

 america_constitutional_coalition_events.62.d: "The situation the Federal Government arrived at when [ACC.GetNameDef] was created did not offer us time to clarify the policy of immigration. This meant that a deal being planned by the Department of Labor to allow for Mexican labour temporary work rights in the United States was frozen for a time. Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This programme proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America. Perhaps we should allow this through?"

 america_constitutional_coalition_events.63.d: "The decision to promote true American values with a closer relationship with Hollywood seemed smart initially. However, the glitz and glamour of Hollywood shady accounting practices that confound our ability to measure returns. Patriotic productions privately financed receive royalties out of gross sales, which have been very high. However, the deal we accepted was on profits, which appear to be next to nothing. This inconsistency needs to be renegotiated, and the studios be told that such creative accounting cannot fly with the American government!"

 america_constitutional_coalition_events.64.d: "We initially thought that our intelligence service was overreactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African-American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organisation called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favour of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia. This organisation appears to target non-Chinese ethnic minorities with promises of greater social freedom. We have arrested the conspirators, but we were unable to tie them to the Japanese embassy surprisingly."
 america_constitutional_coalition_events.64.a: "What a strange group."

 america_constitutional_coalition_events.65.t: "Communalism and the Latter-Day Saints Church"
 america_constitutional_coalition_events.65.d: "The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints, better known as Mormons, have expressed sentiments in recent months to strengthen the ideals of Communalism within the church in order to counter the sway of syndicalism. Notably the Church has come out with a faith-based welfare programme, called coincidentally enough the Church Welfare Program, to help provide for support for fellow Mormons, furthermore the programme calls for more Bishop Storehouses to be created. Due to the churches influence in the western states, this has also translated into increased support for the Progressive and Farmer-Labor Parties."

 america_constitutional_coalition_events.101.d: "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorising the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court.

However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterised all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theatres, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats.

This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General's actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."

Others joined Reed and Long's respective revolts against federal authority. A plurality however have come to Sacramento: Democrats, Republicans, and Progressives alike have joined the reconvened western Congress to affirm their loyalty to democracy and the constitution.

Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence.

Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armoury and head into the city. Deploying themselves at key locations, they attempted to take control of key infrastructure in the city. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris.

At the behest of a high school girlfriend, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he would earn his law degree in 1929, and spent the next few years working in various government jobs. He first entered the world of politics by supporting Al Smith's 1928 bid for the presidency and remained active as a Democrat since then, championing opposition to prohibition and eventually entering the Washington House of Representatives in 1933 as a Seattle delegate. Magnuson was then elected to fill a vacancy in the national House, taking his seat in January 1937 - mere months before the country was torn apart by civil war. Opposing MacArthur's takeover, Magnuson defied the odds and escaped Washington, D.C. with the aid of anti-coup elements in the Navy - in return, he would volunteer for the war effort and serve in the Navy for much of the war.\n\nIn 1944, Magnuson entered the Senate on the back of his war record and progressive credentials, famously spearheading efforts to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act and quickly becoming a poster boy of the Democratic reformist wing.

After a fire destroyed most of the family's possessions in North Dakota, the family found itself moving westwards to Washington. After graduating from the University of Washington, Langlie spent the next ten years practicing law in relative obscurity, before being supported as a candidate for Seattle City Council by the New Order of Cincinnatus, a reform group frustrated by corruption and radical labour activism, key issues in a state where the Socialist Party realistically contested statewide offices. After a failed campaign for mayor in 1936, Langlie was installed as the new mayor after the Socialists briefly took control of the city and installed a \"Seattle Commune\". Langlie was praised by the city press for rooting out the socialists and restoring the city's finances after the depression, as well as for Seattle's contribution to the war effort.\n\nSoon, Langlie moved on to bigger things. In 1940, he was narrowly elected Governor of Washington over his Democratic rival, in a result contested by many Democrats. With a deadlocked legislature, Langlie was unable to pass much legislation, however his frugality and lack of scandal was praised. In a contested Republican convention, he emerged as a suitable compromise, forgoing re-election to run for the presidency.

Despite losing his mother at age 11 and developing a case of Bell's palsy that temporarily restrained his ability to speak, he overcame both and enrolled in Hill Military Academy and later The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, developing an affinity for the 18th-century Anglo-Irish conservative philosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke. His studies also drew him towards the field of journalism, which led to him taking a job offer for The New York Times after graduating in 1929.\n\nCain's life, like the rest of America's, was completely upended by the news of MacArthur's coup and the following Californian revolt. Finding MacArthur's actions to be a sick perversion of conservatism, Cain quickly joined up with the fledgling Pacific army, where his previous military schooling was a welcome asset and helped him find a talent for military government, a skill in great demand when dealing with the unprecedented humanitarian crisis brought on by the civil war. Following his service, he returned to Tacoma to run for its largely nonpartisan mayoral office, winning the election handily by virtue of his war record and public campaign style. After a largely successful term, the conservative Democrat, long falling out of love with the party, changed his registration to Republican and made a run for the Senate, creating his first brush with controversy by accusing his Democratic opponent of having ties to Socialist front organisations. It would not be his last - the senator rapidly became notorious for his inflammatory conservative stances throughout his term.\n\nCain's rails against the tripartite threat of Socialism, Longism, and MacArthurism carried him to the Republican nomination and the presidency - but now that he's privy to the inner workings of the ongoing committees dedicated to investigating \"subversive activities\", Cain has shocked everyone by coming out against many of the procedures as violations of civil liberties and due process of law.

In 1924, re-entered politics in the same way that he left it - by supporting another Progressive's bid for the presidency, this time with Robert La Follette, Sr. By 1932, he had decided to change his party registration to Democratic, and before the end of 1933 declared his intent to run for Governor of California. After his announcement, he was approached by the famous writer Upton Sinclair, who had his own plans to run for governor and was attracted to Downey's progressive past - however, Downey was unwilling to abandon the Democrats for the Socialist Party, and so Sinclair ran without him, while Downey narrowly edged out the Democratic nomination. Both candidates were defeated by the Republican incumbent, Frank Merriam.\n\nDowney's progressive tendencies left him unwilling to tolerate MacArthur's coup, and so he eagerly backed the Sacramento government - but the years went on, and he became more formally involved with the political scene, his own politics began to shift. While the once-dedicated progressive remained a supporter of pensions, old-age insurance, and racial justice, he nonetheless grew increasingly conservative and friendly with the oil, corporate agriculture, and film industries. By the time of the 1944 campaign, his transformation was complete - he sought and won the Democratic nomination and the presidency as a moderate conservative Democrat, with the mission statement of leading a return to normalcy for a still war-torn nation.§!"
