#######- Section 02: Party Names -######
########################################

 QIE_totalist_party: "CSP-Radical"
 QIE_totalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Radical Faction (Zhongguo Gongtuandang-jijon Pai)\n§gWhile largely confined to their strongholds along the Chinese coast, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, a formidable presence of the Chinese Syndicalist Party and their fellow league members within the League of Chinese Syndicalists can be found in the Chinese north - in particular Tianjin.\n\nThe radical wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party cells in the North is led by Zhang Guotao. Along with fellow socialist revolutionaries, they have furthermore turned to not just the radicalisation of unions in the northern cities but also the arousing of peasants within the countryside especially in the Dabei Mountains, where they have sought considerable refuge from political oppression from the Zhili Clique and their Manchu allies.§!\n"
 QIE_radical_socialist_party: "KMT"
 QIE_radical_socialist_party_long: "Kuomintang (Guomin Geming Jun)\n§gThe Chinese Nationalist Party, while predominately a big tent revolutionary party, has nonetheless seen itself dominated by its left-wing since its 1924 Reorganisation. While initially based in Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Nationalist Government in the South, the revolution has spread across China, amassing like-minded cells and secret bodies within hostile Chinese warlord provinces in the hopes of preparing the country for the Nationalist Revolution.\n\nWith the defeat of the Kuomintang forces in the Northern Expedition, the northern branches of the party fell under the influence of the dominant Reorganised Comrades Association, which preached a hardline reorganization of the Kuomintang under a socialist and centralized party line, bringing the revolution from the top to below. Led by Liu Kanyuan, a prominent RCA organiser during the May 30th Movement, the RCA cells in the North plot the hopeful return of the Kuomintang - and with it, the true liberation of Beijing from the warlords that have held it for so long.§!\n"
 QIE_syndicalist_party: "CSP-Orthodox"
 QIE_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Orthodox Faction (Zhongguo Gongtuandang-zhengtong Pai)\n§gThe Chinese Syndicalist Party, founded in 1922, holds a formidable presence within the League of Chinese Syndicalists, especially in the Chinese north. Split by its radical and orthodox faction, the nominal central committee executive of the northern branch lies under Li Dazhao, one of the party's original founders.\n\nDespite his sanctuary in sympathetic embassies such as that of the Union of Britain and the Commune of France, Li Dazhao finds himself effectively a political prisoner and can only hope that one day socialist forces will be strong enough to fully prepare a national and social revolution to free the Chinese north from the Zhili and their Manchu allies. As a proponent of the orthodox faction, Li has continuously stressed the necessity for cooperation with not just the other factions in the LCS but also the Kuomintang in the hopes of creating a true united front to prepare China for the proletariatian revolution that is to come.§!\n"
 QIE_social_democrat_party: "CERA"
 QIE_social_democrat_party_long: "Chinese Empire Reform Association (Bao Jiu Da Qing Huangdi Hui)\n§gThe CERA, while using the name of a pre-Xinhai reformist group, is actually an alliance of two, more modern, reform groups. The first is the Rural Reconstruction Movement, lead by Liang Shuming and the Harvard and Princeton educated J.C. 'Jimmy' Yen. Favouring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasises the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century.\n\nThe second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. Following the restoration of Puyi, his works have come back into prominence, and are popular among middle-class urban intellectuals. The CERA want to see an end to warlords and foreign influence in China, and a return to a \"traditional\" style of decentralised local rule.§!\n"
 QIE_social_liberal_party: "Endeavour Society"
 QIE_social_liberal_party_long: "Endeavour Society (Nuli she)\n§gInitially born from an association of intellectuals whom contributed to the \"Endeavour\" newspaper, the first inklings of the Endeavour Society's foray into politics amassed from the publication of their second issue in 1923, named \"Our Political Statement\". Signed by the likes of Hu Shih, Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao, Liang Shuming, Wang Chonghui and Tang Erhe, the article outlined the intellectual's proposal for a \"Government ran by Good People\", to wipe away the corrupt slate of previous Beiyang Governments.\n\nThe nature of their government was to be constitutional, open and transparent, and was to be revolved around long-term planning. Such Good Governance was entrusted with the wellbeing of the people, to protect personal liberty and to cultivate individuality. The Good People in question are those outstanding members of society, or China's educated elite, who must firmly stand against the forces of evil as they did in 1911.\n\nHaving reached their peak during the \"Good People's Cabinet\" experiment ran in coordination with Wu Peifu, Hu Shih continues to champion his Endeavour intellectual grouping, becoming a key publisher and society wherein intellectuals are free to contribute to the political maze of Beijing.§!\n"
 QIE_market_liberal_party: "Prosperity League"
 QIE_market_liberal_party_long: "Prosperity League (Fanrong Lianmeng)\n§gThe Prosperity League is mainly the party of the new industrialist and banker class, who are suspicious of the Harmony Association's corruption and inefficiency. Germany, also wary of Wu's ambition but not wanting to revoke its support for the only bulwark of an unpopular regime, has focused on turning informal social clubs frequented by the new industrial upper class into an organised political party, facilitating connections between elites across the country through Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generlverwaltung organised \"progress expositions\" that pushed a free-trade agenda as well as modern farming techniques and the newest technology.\n\nWhile not overtly hostile to Wu's ambitions, the Prosperity League mainly acts as a lobbying group, pushing for increased free trade, relaxed government regulations, and industrial stimulus - nominally for the interests of the elite - but truly for the Peking-Kommission. This is also the party favoured by German-trained officers in the fledgling Qing navy, whose inter-service rivalry with the Zhili-dominated army has been deliberately stoked by Germany.§!\n"
 QIE_social_conservative_party: "Zongshe Party"
 QIE_social_conservative_party_long: "Royalist Party (Zongshe Dang)\n§gThe “Mingguang Association”, as they've come to be known, is one of the more esoteric products of the German intervention into China. While officially remaining within the fold of the royalist Zongshe tent, the Mingguang Association in particular has endeavored to forward its vision of true imperial restoration, taking cues from the German radical right and shunning progressivism as an absolute necessity for the Qing court to survive.\n\nEmpowered by Prince Gong's backing and informed by Zheng Xiaoxu's \"Wangdao\" (Kingly Way) theory, the Mingguang seeks a return to East Asia where the essence of civilizational greatness undoubtedly flows from the Yangtze towards the barbarian lands outside of heaven. In this, the members of Mingguang seek a reassertion of what they consider core values and ideals in the face of rapid and encroaching Westernization that all of China seems all to eager to embrace. While not yet the prominent voice of all the imperial factions, the Mingguang finds its support with frustrated royalists and thinkers disappointed with the farcical nature of the Xuantong Restoration, with authority still resting squarely in the palms of the subversive republicans and the Jade Marshal.§!\n"
 QIE_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Harmony Association"
 QIE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Harmony Association (Hexie Shetuan)\n§gMore of an Assembly grouping rather than a concrete political party, the Harmony Association is a broad sweep collection of bureaucrats, gentry, intellectuals and a few token retired Zhili commanders who have taken up arms in the battlefield of political dialectics. Closely tied to the whims and desires of the true power within Beijing, the Zhili Clique, the Harmony Association serves as the civilian front assembled by Cao Kun in order to provide for his clique the suits and ties necessary to rule China in lieu of the rifle.\n\nConsidered a sham grouping of men merely rubber stamping autocrats and militarists, the Harmony Association has ruled the nation ever since the securing of Zhili power in the Third ZhiFeng war. Steering the wheel and winning successive Chinese national elections, the Harmony Association's Mass Tent has provided a stable hand, insofar as the Zhili remain.§!\n"
 QIE_paternal_autocrat_party: "Zhili Clique"
 QIE_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "The North Zhili Clique (Beijing Zhixi)\n§gOwing its origins to the titanic rise of Feng Guozhang, the Zhili Clique would coalesce around him and his Presidency wherein he advocated for Unification by Negotiation with the South, as opposed to Prime Minister Duan Qirui's Unification by Subjugation. Following Feng's death in 1919, the Zhili Clique would become split between three endeavouring warlords — Cao Kun, Wu Peifu and Wang Chengbin. Engaging in rivalries with the Fengtian and Anhui Cliques, the Zhili Clique would reign supreme in 1922.\n\nDominating the Beiyang Republic for years, the Zhili would experience a climactic fall from power after a war between Qi Xieyuan and Lu Yongxiang would evolve into the Second ZhiFeng War, where Feng Yuxiang, a Zhili member at the time, would betray the clique and launch the 1924 Beijing Coup, ejecting President Cao and Wu Peifu. Regaining their strength and power, the clique would once again secure their foothold within the Central Plains, and after forming the Anguojun with Zhang Zuolin and Sun Chuanfang, the Zhili clique would fend off the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, eject Fengtian's control from Beijing, and under the auspices of additional aid, enact the Xuantong Restoration in 1928.\n\nSplit between the North Zhili Clique and Sun Chuanfang's South Zhili Clique, the militarists are further split internally between Cao's Jinbao and Wu's Luoyang factions. However, one thing unites them: the continuation of the rule of Beiyang, with or without the Royal Family.§!\n"
 QIE_national_populist_party: "Young China Party"
 QIE_national_populist_party_long: "Young China Party (Zhongguo Qingniandang)\n§gBorn from the student \"Young China Society\", the Young China Party would be one of the society's successors, as it split into \"nationalist\", \"socialist\" and \"idealist\" factions, led by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, Li Dazhao, and Wang Guangqi respectively. Travelling to France to study, Zeng Qi and Li Huang and the other members of their nationalist faction would engage in spats with other students in France such as Zhou Enlai, Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng.\n\nSometimes becoming violent, the amassment of support for the Chinese Syndicalist Party would result in Zeng and Li forming their own party, announcing the formation of the Young China Party in 1923, outside Paris. Developing rapidly amongst Chinese student organisations, the Young China Party would stand in concrete opposition towards the Kuomintang's cooperation with the CSP, and the YCP would return to Shanghai founding a series of political societies and newspapers in 1924.\n\nBecoming ingratiated with Sun Chuanfang's forces, the Young China Party would move north to participate in the Beijing Assembly. They advocate for the elimination of China's warlords and the establishment of a strong central government, as well as a nationalist agenda which focuses on the abolition of the special privileges and extraterritoriality enjoyed by foreign powers in China.§!\n"

###- Manchu Coup Parties -###
 QIE_yiguandao_coup_party_long: "$QIE_yiguandao_coup_party_long_tt$\n§gConsidered a more \"professional\" front for the Yiguandao in order to legitimise themselves in the eyes of the Central Goverment, the cult's origins lie in 19th century Shandong, formed as an extension of an even older cult, the Xiantiandao, which in of itself is an offshoot of the Laoguan Zhaijiao, a branch of the Dacheng proliferation of Luoism. Founded by Wang Jueyi, he would be succeeded by Liu Qingxu, who would officially name the offshoot the \"Yiguandao\" in 1905, meaning \"Unity Way\".\n\nSucceeded by Lu Zhongyi, he would give way to the enigmatic Zhang Tianran in 1925. Seizing the initiative following the crisis in Confucianism, the Yiguandao would flourish in light of the people's lack of faith, spreading their beliefs in the Eternal Venerable Mother, Tao, and a mixture of Buddhist, Salvationist and Confucian philosophies.§!\n"

Unlike the Young China Party, which has long claimed to be the voice of the political intelligentsia, the DSF is more aligned with academics who dally with politics rather than explicitly scholars of politics, a notable distinction during this tense shift in China's political climate.§!\n"

 QIE_Old_PSC_party: "PSC"
 QIE_Old_PSC_party_long: "$QIE_Old_PSC_party_long_tt$\n§gOwing its origins to its first iteration founded in 1913 by Tongmenghui party members whom rejected Dr. Sun's demand for personal loyalty oaths after the failure of the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai, the Political Science Clique is an odd bunch amongst Beiyang parliamentarians. They established the European Affairs Research Society in Tokyo, which later evolved into the Political Science Society in 1916. Rejecting the need for a Northern Expedition to unite China as espoused by Dr. Sun and his Kuomintang, they instead worked with southern warlords like Cen Chunxuan, and Lu Rongting, to topple Sun Yat-sen and his Constitution Protection Government.\n\nInstead opting to participate in the Beiyang electoral system and promote peaceful negotiations with the Northern Warlords, they would find themselves in many high up positions within the senate, assembly and even cabinet. When Sun, with the aid of Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming drove out Cen and Lu from Guangdong, joined by Tang Jiyao's rejection of Gu Pinzhen from Yunnan, the Old Political Science Clique effectively collapsed. Losing the majority of their greatest influential positions, they all but submitted entirely to the Beiyang political order. With their last ascension to prominence being that of Huang Fu, leading a briefly liberal interim government after the Beijing Coup.\n\nPreying upon China's middle-class, bankers and intellectual elites, they have managed to win a revival in support following the Prosperity League's collapse.§!\n"

 QIE_all_chinese_national_salvation_congress_party_long: "$QIE_all_chinese_national_salvation_congress_party_long_tt$\n§gThe National Salvation Federation, nominally led by Liu Chongyou, is a group of left leaning Shanghai intellectuals who formed out of the anti-Imperialist wave of unrest in the city following the Shanghai conference of 1928. Soon after their formation, in 1929, they joined the Chinese Empire Reform Association coalition in order to try and create a united opposition bloc against the Harmony Association, due to a distaste of the Zhili's seeming apathy towards the concessions.\n\nAfter the failures of the Manchu Coup and the Zhili placing distance with Germany however, their priorities have realigned. With the crackdown and disbandment of the CERA, they have broke free from the coalition, soaking up the majority of leftists within the Assembly. Whilst the NSF are devout in their crusade against corruption, the cultural group, especially under the informal leadership of Liu, is willing to abide by authoritarian government, as long as it cracks down on warlordism. This means they're willing to cooperate with the Central Government on certain matters, as long as the it continues to resist the Imperialists, slowly liberalise and annihilate Warlords within China.§!\n"

 QIE_democratic_constitutionalist_party: "Constitutionalists"
 QIE_democratic_constitutionalist_party_long: "$QIE_democratic_constitutionalist_party_long_tt$\n§gThe Chinese Constitutionalist Party, is led by Xu Qin, a personal student of late Qing reformist Kang Youwei, and the heir to both his and Liang Qichao's legacy. Forming from a group of anti-Kuomintang politicians alongside late Qing and Beiyang reformists, they would become sidelined in the Beiyang government. Breaking with Yuan Shikai after he declared himself Emperor, they would come back to prominence with the Manchu Restoration in 1927, were they negotiated with other groups to form the \"Chinese Empire Reform Association\" coalition under Liang Qichao.\n\nWith Liang passing away in 1929 however, Xu Qin has continued to champion the Constitutionalist sect of the coalition ever since. With the abolishment of the Monarchy, the coalition has splintered entirely, but the core of it, the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, still marches onwards towards forming a China led by Constitutionalism. Devoutly against the rule of guns which warlords use, or the despotism of a Party-State, they have found themselves a new niche within the new assembly.\n\nThe party itself is split between its old guard wing, led by Xu Qin himself, and a young guard of progressive reformists led by Xu Xianzi, Xu Qin's de facto successor to the party. Hoping to aid in the cultivation of a true Constitutional Chinese Republic, they agitate for increasing pluralisation amongst the Assembly.§!\n"

 #愛新覺羅·溥儀
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi: "Aisin-Gioro Puyi"
 QIE_aisin_gioro_puyi_desc_body: "\"His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor\" - while Puyi holds many titles, the young Emperor has little power and has never really possessed any since his birth in 1906. Ascending to the throne at two years old, Puyi would be deposed not even 4 years later, with the Boy Emperor being relegated to ruling over the Forbidden City after abdication. Maintaining many preferential treatment conditions, Puyi would live an isolated life of luxury in the \"Small Court of the Qing Dynasty\".\n\nBeginning to become fascinated with modern culture due to the influence of Reginald Johnston, Puyi would begin to wear Western suits, and cut his braids, having a desire to leave the city to explore the world, much to the chagrin of the likes of Zheng Xiaoxu. Marrying in 1922, Puyi would continue to live a life of relative luxury until Feng Yuxiang's defection in 1924, wherein Feng would depose Cao Kun, force Wu Peifu to flee, and have Lu Zhonglin force Puyi to depart from the Forbidden City. Refusing to be ejected from his home to the very last, Puyi would be forced out by the Guominjun's soldiers, fleeing to the Japanese embassy.\n\nLiving in the Tianjin Concession, Puyi would exchange dialogue with the likes of Zhang Zuolin, Duan Qirui, Wu Peifu, even requesting that Wu restore him to the Forbidden City in 1925, to no avail. Receiving a preferential treatment within Tianjin, still regarded as the \"Emperor\" by foreigners, Puyi would eventually be restored to the throne for a third time following Cao Kun's negotiations with the German Empire in 1928."

Puyi still lacks much power, but this is of calculated design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislation and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can exemplify what it means to be a modern monarch.§!"

Rising to captain during the Russo-Japanese War, he joined the New Army, serving under Cao Kun. Wu would distinguish himself during the Xinhai Revolution.\n\nDuring the National Protection War, Wu faced Cai E, barely defeating him. In 1918, Wu's Third Division captured Changsha during the Beiyang Southern Expedition, but the province was handed over to the Anhui-aligned Zhang Jingyao. Wu and Cao conspired to overthrow Duan Qirui's Anhui Clique, leading to Wu's decisive victory in the ZhiWan War.\n\nDubbed the \"Strongest Man in China\", Wu would be the first Chinese person to appear on the cover of Time magazine. His attempt to establish a reformist \"Good People's Cabinet\" in 1922 failed following internal disagreement and opposition from Cao Kun. Betrayed by Feng Yuxiang in 1924, Wu sought refuge with Zhao Hengti, before returning to the North to defeat the Guominjun in 1926.\n\nWu and Zhang Zuolin would form the \"Anguojun\" to resist the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition, achieving remarkable success. He would eventually clash with the Fengtian Clique over control of Beijing, defeating them in the Third and Fourth ZhiFeng wars.\n\nDespite opposing the 1928 restoration of the monarchy, Wu adapted to the new governmental structure, marginalising monarchists and maintaining Beiyang dominance.\n\n§YNotes: Wu's principled Chinese patriotism and hope for a democratic republican future has led to a man with unfurled ambition.\nWu has a great respect and inclination for the feats of George Washington, styling himself as the Chinese Republic's own Founding Father.§!"

In 1917, Yang would be awarded the fourth-class Wenhu Medal, and in April, would be transferred to Captain of the \"Tongji\" ship, later being transferred to \"Ying Rui\" in 1920.\n\nIn 1921, the Fujian navy had become involved in the provincial power politics of the time, and whilst Yan Jingxiu was nominally commander of the training fleet, Yan Shuzhuang had the de-facto power within the navy. Being promoted to rear-admiral, he would seize territory in Fujian-Xiamen, and would eventually develop into a local warlord.\n\nSucceeding Du Xigui as commander-in-chief of the navy, Shuzhuang would preside over an emergency meeting of the Beiyang fleet following the declaration of the Northern Expedition. Considering defection, the Beiyang fleet ultimately remained resolute in supporting the Zhili clique.\n\nNow considered one of the chiefs of the Zhili's naval arm, Yang enjoys immense influence within the League of Eight Provinces due to directly controlling territory within Fujian, acting as the chief of the Fujian naval clique's influence within China.§!"

Serving as a deputy commander for the \"Jiang Zhen\" warship in 1911, Du would win the respect of naval commander Sa Zhenbing.\n\nAllying with the revolutionaries in Xinhai, Du Xigui would collaborate with his friend Tang Xiangming to assist them, and attempted to convert Sa Zhenbing to the revolutionary cause. Using his connection to Tang Xiangming's brother, Tang Hualong, Du would negotiate for Sa to step down voluntarily.\n\nPromoted to captain of the navy in 1912, Du would reject Yuan Shikai's restoration attempt, and defect to the anti-Yuan forces. Becoming commander of the Second Fleet in 1917, Du would assist Wu Peifu in his Southern Expedition, and again would assist Wu in 1921 with fighting Zhao Hengti's forces.\n\nFighting in the First ZhiFeng War, Du would become Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and would assist Wu in escaping the Beijing Coup, handing his own resignation to Duan Qirui's puppet government.\n\nBecoming Chief of the Navy in 1926 following the Zhili return, he would become acting President for a period of time before seeing service in the Northern Expedition.

 QIE_meet_assembly_parties_decisions_desc: "Due to our intervention in favour of the League of Eight Provinces and their German backers, the reformists, radicals and royalist parties have all left the Assembly in protest. Leaving the current standing delegation to amount to only the Harmony Association, Prosperity League, a few independents, and the Political Science Clique. With the average Chinese citizen not actually caring, or at least, acting apathetic to the occurences of the Assembly and Senate, the intellectuals are fully capable of capitalising on such delegitmising acts.\n\nAll too familiar with popular support waning, and the consequences of such, President Cao has been tasked with the rather unwieldy task of reconvincing each individual party to return to assisting in governance, otherwise the people's fury may be directed at our own front door."

 QIE_placate_manchu: "Parley with Zongshe"
 QIE_placate_manchu_desc: "The much despised Manchu Nobles have thrown down the gauntlet, opportunistically using the unrest over supporting the League to attempt to force President Cao to negotiate. Whilst we could survive without Zongshe's support, the nobles are rich, influential, and have the ear of the Emperor. All combined make a dangerous enemy. Their time will come, but not today."

 QIE_placate_YCP: "Overtures to the YCP"
 QIE_placate_YCP_desc: "Ultranationalist, Ultra-Republican and ever radical, the Young China Party are so strongly opposed to the concept of the concessions, it is a surprise they haven't resorted to violence yet. Before such measures can happen however, it is possible, albeit difficult, that President Cao and the cabinet could extend a hand towards the YCP. After all, their vigour is admirable."

 QIE_placate_CERA: "Bringing the CERA to the Table"
 QIE_placate_CERA_desc: "Reformists, moderate leftists, and intellectuals. It is of no surprise that the Chinese Empire Reform Association also left the Assembly following President Cao's announcement. However, flirting with the same business circles, and through Bai Jianwu's connections to the intellectuals, we can potentially bring Xu Qin, James Yen and Liang Shuming to the table regarding re-entering the Assembly."

With our soldiers not lacking in tenacity, grit or willpower, being capable of fighting 1-on-1 with any imperialist and winning, they lack critically in the tactis and strategy of modern warfare.

 QIE_buy_arty: "Purchase Surplus Swiss Artillery"

 QIE_future_of_the_zhili_clique_desc: "The upheaval of the last few months has shown that the Zhili Clique must reform itself if it is to survive the next few years, let alone the next few decades. The Zhili patronage system must be reformed, and at least modernised to allow for a meritocratic scene to flourish, and for the elimination of the festering rot that has seeped into our military. Lest we fade into the annals of history."

 QIE_on_national_defense: "On National Defense"
 QIE_on_national_defense_desc: "As promoted by legendary theorist Jiang Baili and his \"Baoding Clique\" of likeminded officers, Jiang hopes to inspire a general improvement of the drilling procedures of the soldiery, prioritising exceptional self-sacrifice and zealous devotion to the nation. Perhaps more sane compared to Jiang's more out there theories, he has moderated them akin to his experiences with Cai E in the National Protection War."

 QIE_highlighting_our_goals: "Highlighting our Goals"
 QIE_highlighting_our_goals_desc: "Inspired by the dedication shown by the Huguojun soldiers in the National Protection War, Jiang Baili has proposed to the Jade Marshal that the Zhili pursue a similar course of political incentives. By assuring the soldiers of the overall political goals of our wars, they shall fight with a concrete mind and purpose, sure to strike with tenacity and devotion. Awakening the true Chinese warrior spirit, is but a few steps away."

 QIE_court_hubei_generals: "Court Hubei Generals"
 QIE_court_hubei_generals_desc: "The \"Hubei Generals\" are an informal association of the leading manufacturers and industrialists in Hubei Province. Jiang Baili's close family friend, Xiao Yaonan, is governor of the province, and has graciously volunteered to use his industrial contacts for the construction of many of the fortifications required for Jiang's plan, at the benefit of his own influence extending incongruously."

 QIE_symphony_of_military_and_industry: "Symphony of Military and Industry"
 QIE_symphony_of_military_and_industry_desc: "General Tang Zaili's theory focuses on improved logistical networks to support the supplies of the Zhili army. Alongside that, he and his \"Chinese Eliteheer\" endeavours to replicate the successes of both the German Advisory Mission's 80 Division plan, alongside that of the German Imperial Army's successes in the Weltkrieg. Through the prioritisation of mobile warfare, and an elite core of units, he hopes it will bring forth unification of the nation."

 QIE_expand_baoding_arsenal: "Expand Baoding Arsenal"
 QIE_expand_baoding_arsenal_desc: "The Baoding Arsenal, attached to the military academy, is somewhat less developed than the Gongxian foundry. Yet with enough investments, we can turn it into one of China's main military manufacturers. Its proximity to the Academy is also a plus, as it allows us to test new equipment designs both practically and theoretically, serving as an exemplary depiction of the unification of the military and industry."

 QIE_a_competitive_army_and_industry: "A Competitive Army and Industry"
 QIE_a_competitive_army_and_industry_desc: "Previously, contracts for the production of weapons were handed out on an ad-hoc basis, rife with corruption. By exerting considerable political willpower, we can modernise and clean up these systems, bringing our arms industry up to western standards. Obviously, ensuring healthy competition between contractors along the way, perhaps one day Chinese arms will be world renowned."

 QIE_the_central_plains_artery: "The Central Plain's Artery"
 QIE_the_central_plains_artery_desc: "Ever the vital lifelines by which wars in Eastern China are fought, the railways control the very flow of battles. Allowing for greater divisions and greater arms to clash as opposed to the rugged interior. Of particular note is the Beijing-Hankou railway, finished in 1906, it is one of the most integral pieces of infrastructure in the Central Government's territory, and it is imperative we see to its maintenance and expansion."

 QIE_reorganise_the_kailuan_mining_bureau: "Reorganise the Kailuan Mining Bureau"
 QIE_reorganise_the_kailuan_mining_bureau_desc: "The Kailuan Mining Bureau was founded in 1878 as a joint venture between the Qing government and a variety of British business interests. Having been neglected in light of the persitent, continuous warfare of the Warlord Era, it is perhaps the right moment for us — in this sea of tranquility — to revive the institution, and place it under government control."

 QIE_expanding_our_shanxi_spoils: "Expanding Our Shanxi Spoils"
 QIE_expanding_our_shanxi_spoils_desc: "Seized from Yan Xishan at the end of the last Zhifeng war, the coal fields of eastern Shanxi are some of the most prosperous in China. Long desired by Yan Xishan ever since its seizure, we have refrained from investing in its local development. With our ties to the Model Governor however, there is no longer the existential threat to losing these lands — still this may provoke Yan, and so we must tread with caution."

 QIE_daye_hanyang_development_scheme: "Daye-Hanyang Development Scheme"
 QIE_daye_hanyang_development_scheme_desc: "The Daye-Hanyang corridor surrounding Wuhan houses the majority of China's industrial capacity outside of Beijing, yet the infrastructure and urban planning in the region leaves much to be desired. By investing into clearing new land for factories, and building additional civilian industry to support military arsenals, we can modernise the region, its economy, and provide jobs for its people."

 QIE_gongxian_arsenal_expansion_office: "Gongxian Arsenal Expansion Office"
 QIE_gongxian_arsenal_expansion_office_desc: "The Gongxian Arsenal, constructed by Yuan Shikai and Sa Zhenbing in 1915, has normally played second fiddle to the much larger and more productive Hanyang weapons foundry. By expanding its manufacturing capabilities as done so in the 1920s, we can sufficiently spread out our industrial base in case one arsenal falls into the hands of invaders."

 QIE_restore_order_in_the_middle_kingdom: "Restore Order in the Middle Kingdom"
 QIE_restore_order_in_the_middle_kingdom_desc: "For far too long, China has been bitterly divided by ambitious strongmen and rebellious regional factions. In our weakness, predators of all stripes have come to exploit our land and corrupt our people. The next step in ending the Century of Humiliations is to end the Warlord Era. We must bring the various warlords to heel, reigning those who exploited the collapse of the League for seditious ends."

 QIE_destroy_federalists: "The Second Southern Expedition"
 QIE_destroy_federalists_desc: "The Federalist movement, an outgrowth of regionalist generals and propped up by naive intellectuals is nothing more than a farce for further warlordism. Although we were forced to stomach Chen Jiongming's restoration as governor in 1927, he and his allies have since defied us. The division and corruption must end before it can consume further parts of the country and we will restore central authority."

 QIE_cross_the_dai_river: "Cross the Dai River"
 QIE_cross_the_dai_river_desc: "Many years have passed since the setback we experienced in the 4th Zhifeng War, and yet since then the threat of war from the northeast has grown only more dire. Zhang Zuolin sold both his soul and our country when he made his deal with Japan — a 5th Zhifeng is what we need to set this great wrong right. The Zhili will secure the northeast; this is the culmination of all our work and struggles up to this point, and the opportunity may not come again!"

 QIE_destroy_kuomintang: "Extinguishing the Flame of the Party-State"
 QIE_destroy_kuomintang_desc: "The Kuomintang, founded by an embittered Dr. Sun Yat-sen, is a continuous spectre of the past — an excuse for socialist bandits and warlord criminals to loot and plunder in a ceaseless cycle of revolutionary violence. Despite their defeat in the Northern Expedition, they continue to persist. Perhaps admirable, a decisive strike to the south shall drive out these hooligans, ending this rebel bastion once and for all."

 QIE_fractured_and_broken_united_yet_again: "Fractured and Broken, United Yet Again"
 QIE_fractured_and_broken_united_yet_again_desc: "Finally, after decades of great struggle, suffering, a war for national salvation and struggle, its over. The Chinese nation-state has put down its arms, united by the rightful Government of the Northern Capital. Withstanding the pressure and circumstances, the Jade Marshal has struck forth. With our final Unification, the Zhili Clique have consolidated themselves as the legitimate heirs to the Chinese civilisation."

 QIE_tying_up_loose_ends: "Tying up Loose Ends"
 QIE_tying_up_loose_ends_desc: "The core of the Middle Kingdom may be united, but that is not the true extent of the Chinese nation. The frontier, feuded over by the Tibetans, Mongolians, Uyghurs, Russians and many more has long been out of our direct control. Whilst the Mas were entrusted with stewardship of the Northwest, it is time for all of the frontier to bend the knee."

 QIE_hives_of_rabid_imperialism: "Hives of Rabid Imperialism"
 QIE_hives_of_rabid_imperialism_desc: "Such a vile state of affairs, the Concessions. Chinese citizens, second-class on their own land. Unable to act freely in these urban centres, they are an absolute affront to our national pride and integrity. Enforced in a moment of weakness, they can be withdrawn in a moment of strength. Either through our tactful negotiation, or our military might, we shall reclaim the port cities!"

 QIE_handling_the_disintegration: "Handling the Disintegration"
 QIE_handling_the_disintegration_desc: "Plagued by indecisiveness and incessant bickering, the Cabinet and Zhili High Command have utterly refused to back either side in the League Collapse. With Anti-Concessionists now conjoined by our estranged European allies continuing to campaign and protest our government, it would appear the very Chinese world order is collapsing... Marshal Wu and President Cao must do something!"

 QIE_let_the_five_banner_flag_fly: "Let the Five Banner Flag Fly!"
 QIE_let_the_five_banner_flag_fly_desc: "Finally the martyrs of Xinhai are exonerated once more! No more shall the Royals leech off of the common Chinese! With the restoration of the Beiyang Republic in its true form, the President and Marshal can rule without having to kowtow with incessant formalities to a Boy Emperor. Setting forth a true path for Chinese Republican Democracy."

 QIE_flying_too_close_to_the_sun: "Flying Too Close to the Sun"
 QIE_flying_too_close_to_the_sun_desc: "The disastrous \"Manchu Coup\" plotters nearly succeeded, if it weren't for the quick thinking of the Zhili loyalists. However it has revealed a whole worrying array of potential security breaches in our own back door! The fact that the plotters could even conspire for so long has proven that we have grown incompetent during our time at the top. Serious internal restructuring and reform is necessary to push forward."

 QIE_the_gift_of_the_dynasties: "The Gift of the Dynasties"
 QIE_the_gift_of_the_dynasties_desc: "Forever marred by the frailty and weakness of the monarchy, the old Beiyang Republic was saddled with incomprehensible foreign debts, resulting in its complete ineffectiveness in economy matters compared to unburdened countries. With the restoration of the Republic, we shall not fall into the same trap bound by international legitimacy. With the option to negotiate, or outright default, we have the full reigns to decide our own fate."

 QIE_endeavours_human_face: "Endeavour's Human Face"
 QIE_endeavours_human_face_desc: "Having long been an intellectual within Beijing circles, Hu Shih has championed the cause of liberalism and reformist democracy within China. Starting the Endeavour Society with his intellectual friends, he has been a consistently high profile \"face\" of the group. Whirring away, he has produced copious articles, not just for Endeavor but other intellectuals too, and with his selection as President, sets a great precedent for the Republic."

 QIE_government_of_good_people: "Government of Good People"
 QIE_government_of_good_people_desc: "As prescribed in Endeavour's original \"Our Political Statement\", they desire a constitutional, transparent, focused government dedicate to personal liberty and wellbeing. With Hu Shih's evolving political ideology as prescribed by his \"pragmatism\" philosophy, he has continously fought for reformist liberalism, attaining his virtues by peace. Albeit this has morphed into him being derided for supposed idealism by his more radical comrades."

 QIE_beiyangs_favourite_son: "Beiyang's Favourite Son"
 QIE_beiyangs_favourite_son_desc: "Forever the one artery of the Beiyang Government that was bereft of corruption and cronyism, the Diplomatic Corps has been hope to some of China's most arduous patriots fighting on the frontlines in country relations to ensure recognition and legitimacy of the seat in Beijing. Due to this nature, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has become the bedrock by which the government's reputation relies upon."

 QIE_flourish_of_the_diplomatic_corps: "Flourish of the Diplomatic Corps"
 QIE_flourish_of_the_diplomatic_corps_desc: "Home to some of our greatest civil servants, such as Gu Weijun or Yan Huiqing, the Diplomatic Corps is but the most paramount grey eminence at our disposal. With their capability and skills, we can ensure positive relations with all foreign powers, despite any stance on the concessions. Having long been forced into the limelight when the Republic necessitated them most, this is merely a victory lap of the ministry."

 QIE_the_fragrant_one_lacks_judgement_still: "\"The Fragrant One Lacks Judgement Still\""
 QIE_the_fragrant_one_lacks_judgement_still_desc: "The dastardly Zongshe Party intended to decapitate the Zhili Clique in the \"Manchu Coup\". With their Manchu support utterly crippled, the few remaining disorganised delegates are sure to defect given incentive. The CERA on the other hand, is a broad sweep coalition. As such, it is inherently fragile. By courting minor parties, we can institute a complete fracture of the association."

 QIE_government_by_friends: "Government By Friends"
 QIE_government_by_friends_desc: "Despite transistioning into the gloves and suits of Beiyang civil servants, delegates and gentry, the Zhili Guanxi system continues to thrive. Everywhere you look, the tendrils of the Jinbao and Luoyang factions persists. Whilst most would decry this as nepotism, we are merely transitioning fully to legitimate statesmen, the only clique capable of leading the Republic."

 QIE_coopting_nationalist_rhetoric: "Co-Opting Nationalist Rhetoric"
 QIE_coopting_nationalist_rhetoric_desc: "The Republicanism, Nationalism and efficiency of the Young China Party is truly something to be admired. With their rapid growth in the nation following the vacant gap left by the Kuomintang has resulted in a meteoric rise, possessing a respectable amount of delegates in the assembly. By utilising their methods, and extending an open hand, we can build a new, united Republic together."

 QIE_nationalising_noble_estates: "Nationalising Noble Estates"
 QIE_nationalising_noble_estates_desc: "With the restoration of the monarchy, various Manchu and Royalists utilised their immense wealth to extend their influence within critical industries core to the Chinese Nation. With their protective sheathe of the Monarchy now finally done and dusted, we can work toward seizing their wealth too. Through confiscation and coercion, we will reclaim not just our nation but our factories too."

 QIE_shoring_up_financial_centres: "Shoring Up Financial Centres"
 QIE_shoring_up_financial_centres_desc: "With the upheaval and chaos following both the League Collapse and the attempted \"Manchu Coup\", the government has managed to pay very little attention to the rather dire industrial situation. Considering all options, Minister Wang Kemin has advised that our government grant additional support to our banking centres, revitalising the Bank of China."

 QIE_reaching_out_to_endeavour: "Reaching Out to Endeavour"
 QIE_reaching_out_to_endeavour_desc: "Despite having tried once before in 1922, the fruits of Zhili-Beiyang-Endeavour cooperation bore a failed cabinet that almost nearly cast reformism to the wayside. However if one thing is for certain, Wu Peifu and Hu Shih are principled men, and whilst they may be at odds on the Federalist matter, both are men desiring a mutual Chinese Democratic Republic."

 QIE_xinhais_legacy: "Xinhai's Legacy"
 QIE_xinhais_legacy_desc: "Temporarily halted but not forgotten, the dreams and desires of the Xinhai Revolutionaries ever flourish in the new China. Merely utilising the Xuantong Restoration in 1928 as a tool for increased assistance, it was never a situation bound to last. Under the Auspicious Cloud, may the Five Races Under One Union have their liberty, and their responsible good governance."

 QIE_domain_of_the_jade_marshal_desc: "The damnable Germans have withdrawn their military assistance in light of our righteous crusade against their tyrannical oppression of the Chinese people. No matter! For the true domain of the Zhili Clique is in that of the art of war. Through our militaristic and patriotic spirit, we can mobilise the very soul of the Chinese people. The imperialists can only watch."

 QIE_local_logistics: "Local Logistics"
 QIE_local_logistics_desc: "Germany had promised to supply us with trucks and other logistical equipment for our future conflict with Japan. With their military mission's withdrawal, however, we need to turn to developing native logistical methods to supply our army. Through the development of local motorised vehicles, we can extend our supply lines to reach further and further from their depos."

 QIE_king_of_the_battlefield: "King of the Battlefield"
 QIE_king_of_the_battlefield_desc: "Perhaps derided by those in Europe or America as a rather foolish notion, the true dominant force in Chinese weaponry is that of the artillery. Considered the most heavily prioritised piece of equipment of the native battlefield, the most succesful campaigns have always been based around its prominence. The Anguojun, the Huguojun, the Jingguojun, they all knew it, and so do we."

 QIE_understanding_our_backyard: "Understanding Our Backyard"
 QIE_understanding_our_backyard_desc: "China's rugged terrain necessitates any military force having a strong engineering corps to support it. Unfortunately, the ad-hoc and amateur quality of many of our current Military Engineers prevents their support from being truly effective. We must reconstitute our existing support detachments, and revitalise Baoding's Engineering Branch."

 QIE_placing_faith_in_the_underdogs: "Placing Faith in the Underdogs"
 QIE_placing_faith_in_the_underdogs_desc: "Perhaps most striking in the Zhili dominance of the Chinese Central Army, is that of the overwhelming reliance on Wu Peifu and his direct staff. The Jade Marshal will not live forever, as posited by the likes of Minister of the Army, Marshal Wang. If we are to truly forment an army worthy of the Chinese state and its people, we must diversify our command staff."

 QIE_emulating_the_jade_marshal: "Emulating the Jade Marshal"
 QIE_emulating_the_jade_marshal_desc: "Time and time again, we have witnessed the sheer tenacity of the Chinese soldier, striking against the rising tide and overwhelming odds. Perhaps the most premier example of this is that of Marshal Wu Peifu. The undisputed military champion and Confucian Warrior Hero of the Chinese nation-state. If every soldier can emulate his martial spirit, we would be undefeatable."

 QIE_rolling_the_dice_on_the_markets: "Rolling the Dice on the Markets"
 QIE_rolling_the_dice_on_the_markets_desc: "Our anti-concession stance prevents us from dealing with the imperialists that have carved out pieces of our nation, but there are many countries in the world that have either suffered similar fates, remained respectful, or otherwise share our common enemies. Russia, Scandinavia, the international arms market is large, varied and expansive. We must merely make the plunge."

 QIE_the_baoding_clique_and_the_third_avenue_desc: "We lack designs for domestic aircraft production, and promises of German designs never came to fruition for obvious reasons. Formed around Jiang Baili's \"On National Defense\", the \"Baoding Clique\" attributes itself to upholding the qualities and strategic theories of the famous Warrior-Scholar. Utilising this cohort, we can develop our own native airplane designs, for the third avenue of warfare."

 QIE_expat_air_training_scheme: "Expat Air Training Scheme"
 QIE_expat_air_training_scheme_desc: "While a fledgling domestic air training industry exists, it is split apart by various warlords of various capacities. With every regionalist fascinated by the sheer potential of the third avenue of warfare, an interesting prospect has arrived to maintain the edge. By both sending native pilots to foreign countries, and hiring foreigners to advise our cadets, we can sustain a novel, new, and deadly Chinese Air Force."

 QIE_utilising_european_dockyards: "Utilising European Dockyards"
 QIE_utilising_european_dockyards_desc: "Although the Kingdom of Italy participated in the suppression of the Boxer movement, it too has suffered under its own folly. Split and torn apart between multiple states, they still continue to retain some of the largest and most productive dockyards in the world. By levying our ties as oppressed, neutral parties, and approaching each faction separately, we can license a modest starting fleet to reinforce our current capabilities."

 QIE_reviving_the_beiyang_fleet: "Reviving the Beiyang Fleet"
 QIE_reviving_the_beiyang_fleet_desc: "Far and wide, the Beiyang Fleet has become dwarfed in its on shadow. With Chinese navies having sailed the seas as far as the coasts of America in times past, we are now reduced to not even being able to directly control our own waters. This absolutely cannot stand. Admiral Sa Zhenbing has done it once before, and he shall do it again. By following his advice in engaging in a rapid navy expansion project, we shall once again rejuvenate China's naval spirit."

 QIE_science_and_modernity_hand_in_hand: "Science and Modernity, Hand in Hand"
 QIE_science_and_modernity_hand_in_hand_desc: "Baoding Military Academy is one of China's proudest military institutions. Counting itself the most premier compared to the likes of Kunming, or the late Whampoa, its walls have contained all manners of men. Revolutionaries, Warlords, Beiyang Statesmen, and even the likes of Wu Peifu and Cao Kun. To truly cherish this institution, and in line with Jiang Baili's continued insistence, let us modernise and increase funding for such a proud academy."

 QIE_the_destitute_and_the_stragglers: "The Destitute and the Stragglers"
 QIE_the_destitute_and_the_stragglers_desc: "Our anti-concession stance quite obviously keeps us from taking military aid from most European governments, but individual, independent advisors are fair game. The turmoil and conflict of the last twenty years has generated no shortage of men willing to sell their talents and advice to the highest bidder. Whilst vetting is necessary to see to it that only modern advisors are recruited, we can continue to modernise our military in spite of the imperialists."

 QIE_reorganise_warlord_divisions: "Re-Organise Warlord Divisions"
 QIE_reorganise_warlord_divisions_desc: "Any warlord worth anything has his own personal militia to control the territory he rules. Unfortunately, these troops vary wildly in quality from semi-professional troops to mobs more used to robbing and burning the villages they theoretically protect. By devoting considerable resources to standardising and modernising these divisions, we can turn them into valuable assets on the battlefield. The ultimate step from Warlord to Statesmen."

 QIE_defend_the_yellow_river: "Defend the Yellow River!"
 QIE_defend_the_yellow_river_desc: "Imperative to our long term strategies is that of the Yellow River. If the invaders cross the Yellow River, there is no greater geographic barrier that can withstand their advance. To defend the nation, to defend our culture and our civilsation, military strategists under the auspices of Jiang Baili have proposed a radical defense plan to be used in emergency. In exchange for breaching the dams on the Yellow River, we can strategically halt an enemy advance."

 QIE_chinese_auftragstaktik: "Chinese Auftragstaktik"
 QIE_chinese_auftragstaktik_desc: "Unsurprisingly, the German Heer reigns supreme in its military efficacy. Critical to their victories in the Weltkrieg however was that of their autonomous units capable of coordinating mass action in order to achieve a singular, united strategic objective. Already adopted all across Mitteleuropa, modern radios are imperative for the innovations of modern mobile warfare."

 QIE_leaning_upon_the_juggernaut: "Leaning Upon the Juggernaut"

Knockoff Mauser pistols, various European rifles and other designs find themselves reappropriated within arsenals such as that of Taiyuan. By utilising our special contacts within Germany's military high command, we can access the designs of their modern weapons, and produce them locally."

 QIE_chinese_soldiers_german_weapons: "Chinese Soldiers, German Weapons"
 QIE_chinese_soldiers_german_weapons_desc: "Our domestic armaments industry is but a paltry assortment of independent arsenals split across multiple provinces, abused for their merits by local warlords attempting to shore up their forces.

Without any connections in the advisory mission or in our officers to utilise, we must pull on perhaps the true reason they even back us in the first place. Japan.

Encircling divisions faster than on foot, and with far more punch than that of trucks, truly the tank is the modern spearhead by which mobile warfare is waged. Most Chinese commanders could only dream of commanding brigades of tanks, and yet in there lies an opportunity for our Special Relationship to be of use. Importing German armour, we can fight toe-to-toe with Japan."

 QIE_coup_backer_desc: "The coup that destroyed the Zhili Clique was not accomplished alone.

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_desc: "Governor Yan Xishan was an unexpected ally in our coup. Previously an anti-monarchist, his shrewd political mind realised that the Emperor is now a powerful political tool. He primarily desires to work with the existing establishment parties in modernising China and spreading his personalised ideology - a nebulous political philosophy that encompasses traditionalism, liberalism, nationalism, and syndicalism."

 QIE_yiguandao: "Invite Yiguandao Influences"
 QIE_yiguandao_desc: "With his new position in our government, Zhang Tianran has begun to expand the Yiguandao's power and influence within our country.

He plans to push the Emperor to act more like a Western-style constitutional monarch, serving as an apolitical uniting figure and potential mediator in case of severe conflict."

 QIE_reinforce_confucianism: "The Emperor and People in One Body"
 QIE_reinforce_confucianism_desc: "Before the Wuchang Uprising, our predecessors had sought to elevate Confucius from a preacher of ancient wisdom to a new symbol of the Chinese nation-state. This new state cult was to help weave Confucius into a national narrative, where the venerated sage would epitomise the nation's cultural essence and Chineseness in general. Reinstitutionalising the state cult of Confucius in education, as well as cultural rites will aid us in creating a harmonious and enlightened Empire."

 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka: "Revise The Chinese Tripitaka"
 QIE_revise_the_chinese_tripitaka_desc: "The Chinese Buddhist canon has long been subject to debate but under Master Qu's leadership we will create a revised “Tripitaka”, or collection of texts, that emphasises the conservative and esoteric elements of the “Red Hat Sects”, especially the Kagyu School, as a political cornerstone of our new government. We will then promote these ideals both to our government officials, as well as to the Emperor himself, who has proven amenable to Red Hat teachings."

 QIE_move_industry: "Move Industry to the Interior"
 QIE_move_industry_desc: "With the threat of foreign invasion looming, our new benefactor has offered to use some of their soldiers to help move industry near the coasts inland. In the event of foreign naval invasion, this will ensure we are still able to supply our troops."

 QIE_train_civil_servants: "Train Civil Servants"
 QIE_train_civil_servants_desc: "The Zhili bureaucracy relied on nepotism, cronyism and endemic, widespread corruption. This left the civil administration of China sorely lacking, with most positions filled by unqualified individuals. Governor Qu has proposed implementing a modernised version of the old civil service exams, to ensure that these positions are filled with qualified men."

 QIE_imperial_academy: "Found the Academy of Cultural Research"
 QIE_imperial_academy_desc: "Following decades of decline and devastation our very culture has started to wane from the constant erosion of state authority and western values. Our benefactor has finally seen fit to reverse these trends and unite the intellectual class behind the throne with the founding of a new cultural centre of research purpose-built to transform foreign ideas into more amenable and familiar ones for the future of the empire."

 QIE_lessons_of_model_province: "Lessons from the Model Province"
 QIE_lessons_of_model_province_desc: "The lessons learned by Yan Xishan and his men during his decades long tenure as Governor of Shanxi will be a crucial guide for the years to come in China. Shanxi's crowning achievements in Education, Agriculture, and Industrial development have achieved international renown despite Shanxi's material poverty. With the full resources of the Empire behind him, Yan intends to transform China for the better."

 QIE_chinese_bismarck: "The Chinese Bismarck"
 QIE_chinese_bismarck_desc: "\"The three great duties of the people are to serve in the army, to pay taxes, and to receive education\".\n\nA great admirer of the Prussian system, the German victory in the Weltkrieg has entrenched Yan's desire to introduce a military spirit to the land, urging parents to give their children toy weapons and forming a \"Blood and Iron Society\". China will be unified, by force if necessary."

 QIE_replace_corrupt_govs: "Replace Corrupt Governors"
 QIE_replace_corrupt_govs_desc: "Following the success of the coup many in the Assembly have begun expressing disgust with many of the former mid-level Zhili administrators we left in positions of authority in the wake of the civil war. Outspoken members of the [QIE.GetRulingParty] have proposed firing all of these men, and replacing them with more qualified and loyal candidates."

 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot: "Nationalising the Words of Yan Xishan"
 QIE_nationalize_yan_thot_desc: "Since his ascension to the Shanxi governorship, Yan has devoted enormous amounts of time to developing his personal ideology, an eclectic mix of federalism, Confucianism, Christianity, and even syndicalism. With his new position of national power, Yan has started to spread his ideas throughout China."

 QIE_vigor_modernization: "Vigorous Modernisation"
 QIE_vigor_modernization_desc: "Yan Xishan has long been a proponent of industrial modernisation, turning the backwater province of Shanxi into a small yet vibrant hub of mining and industry. Now with a position of national prominence, he has begun to urge those lessons of modernisation and industrialisation be applied at a national level."

 QIE_prepare_for_storm: "Prepare for the Storm"
 QIE_prepare_for_storm_desc: "Though we were initially sceptical of their influence, our benefactor has brought us an enormous number of benefits over the last few months. With his help, we are now more than ready to stand up to whatever threatens us."

 QIE_form_emergency_govt: "Form an Emergency Government"
 QIE_form_emergency_govt_desc: "Now that we have destroyed the remnants of the Zhili Clique, it is time for the Emperor to pick which of the three parties that formed the coalition will rule China."

 QIE_pick_CERA: "Utilise the CERA"
 QIE_pick_CERA_desc: "The Chinese Empire Reform Association, or CERA for short, is a powerful party that controls the loyalty of both rural peasants and some urban intellectuals. Though less focused on industrial modernisation, their emphasis on helping the great mass of the population make them extremely popular."

 QIE_pick_YCP: "Utilise the YCP"
 QIE_pick_YCP_desc: "The Young China Party, or YCP, is made up of young Baoding Academy cadets, with some urban intellectuals providing the funding and organisation. Focused on centralising the country and urbanisation, they lack the broad popular appeal of the CERA - though their modernising focus makes them a good choice for quick development."

 QIE_pick_MP: "Utilise the Zongshe"
 QIE_pick_MP_desc: "The Zongshe Party is, obviously, dominated by the Manchu nobility in Beijing. While this may appear an odd choice for a ruling party, over the last ten years the nobles used the relative freedom afforded to them by the Zhili to build up large industrial fortunes, investing in the few factories in Beijing not owned by German firms, giving them significant clout."

 QIE_rural_reform: "Institutionalise the Rural Reform Movement"
 QIE_rural_reform_desc: "The chaos and destruction of the Warlord Era left large swaths of rural China devastated and destroyed. The Rural Reconstruction Movement, half of the CERA, has attempted to fix these problems independent of government support for the last few years. With proper funding, however, they can make a real difference in rebuilding China."

 QIE_CERA_industry: "Invest in Rural Industry"
 QIE_CERA_industry_desc: "While the little industry China has is currently concentrated in its cities, they are vulnerable to military attack and unrest. Instead, the CERA has proposed spreading out industry to rural villages. This will encourage their growth and make our industry less vulnerable to foreign attack or incursion."

 QIE_kang_youwei: "The Legacy of Kang Youwei"
 QIE_kang_youwei_desc: "Kang Youwei was one of the founders of the CERA, though he passed away soon after its inception in 1927. A brilliant scholar and legal reformer, Kang spent half a century arguing for a constitutional monarchy with an Emperor who truly looked out for his people. With the Zhili overthrown and the CERA empowered, this dream is close to being a reality."

 QIE_rural_infrastructure: "Modernise Rural Infrastructure"
 QIE_rural_infrastructure_desc: "China's rural infrastructure is shockingly lacking, with some calling it the worst in the world after Africa. Concerted government investment must be made into improving rural transportation networks if we are ever going to lift China's peasantry out of poverty."

 QIE_benevolent_emperor: "A Benevolent Emperor"
 QIE_benevolent_emperor_desc: "While most in the West think the Emperor of China is some sort of despotic warlord straight out of the Middle Ages, we know that the Emperor is a benevolent and kind soul who wants the best for his subjects. Concerted propaganda efforts must be made to ensure that everyone sees our vision as the truth."

 QIE_rural_loyalty: "Rural Loyalty Ensured"
 QIE_rural_loyalty_desc: "The CERA has completed its major rural reform plan and secured its hold on government. Even in areas of China we do not directly control, the people clamour out for our benevolent leadership! When our enemies enter our land they will not find the population easy to overcome as well - the peasantry are ready to lay down their lives to defend China!"

 QIE_reform_criminal_justice: "Legal Revision Office"
 QIE_reform_criminal_justice_desc: "When it was established in 1902, the Legal Revision Office and its patrons pursued sweeping judicial and constitutional reforms. Although the Office did successfully promulgate the Da Qing Xinglu (Qing Criminal Code) and the Da Qing minlu (Qing Civil Code), these successes were cut short by republican anarchy. As we rebuild, the office's judicial services are once again required."

 QIE_military_state: "Militarise the State"
 QIE_military_state_desc: "The Zhili Clique, while a military organisation, left large parts of the Qing military completely inefficient and underfunded. In order to rectify this problem, we have begun a whole-sale militarisation of the nation. Youth training leagues, a modernised conscription system, and other reforms will ensure we are ready to stand up to what ever enemy we face."

 QIE_centralize_state: "Centralise the State"
 QIE_centralize_state_desc: "The last two decades of internecine warlord conflict left China divided and decentralised. From our new position of power in Beijing we must now begin the long, arduous task of centralising this divided nation, for only then can its people enjoy true peace and prosperity."

 QIE_YCP_arsenals: "Modernise Arsenals"
 QIE_YCP_arsenals_desc: "The arsenals that are to supply our war machine are sorely out of date and underfunded. Concerted investment must be made into weapons and ammunition production if we are to stand any chance of victory over our foes."

 QIE_destroy_leftists: "Destroy Leftists"
 QIE_destroy_leftists_desc: "While there are few actual leftists within the territory we directly control, the recent KMT uprising to the south has sparked something of a 'Red Scare' within the elite. We can use this to our advantage, drumming up claims of 'socialist infiltration' to bolster our regime and encourage the people to support us."

 QIE_emperor_unifier: "A Unifying Emperor"
 QIE_emperor_unifier_desc: "While some may see the Emperor as anachronistic to our modernising, centralising vision, he can serve as a useful tool - a rallying point around which the formally disparate, decentralised country can unify. Propaganda can be employed to make sure every Chinese - from a farmer on the Yellow River to a goat herder in the steppes of Xinjiang knows they are part of the same nation."

 QIE_YCP_modernization: "Modernise Civilian Industry"
 QIE_YCP_modernization_desc: "The few civilian industries not formerly run by the Germans are laughable by Western standards. With the German industrial withdrawal, we can take their designs and apply them to our own factories, modernising them and significantly increasing our industrial output."

 QIE_cult_of_progress: "The Bureau of Progress"
 QIE_cult_of_progress_desc: "Unsatisfied with the meandering debates of the Assembly the YCP have taken it upon themselves to create a new 'Bureau of Progress' to oversee much needed reform to the armed forces and state industries. Under the auspices of Yan Xishan, the Young China Party hopes to overshadow the Assembly with organisations of its own design, completely bypassing legislative oversight."

 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare: "The Needs of Modern Warfare"
 QIE_YCP_modern_warfare_desc: "The tumult of the last decade has taught all officers the importance of fine artillery. None more so than the clique making up the core of the Young China Party. Many having been educated in Germany, have seen first-hand the power of modern armaments. The state cannot let up for even the briefest of moments our drive towards modernity."

 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state: "Trappings of a Party State"
 QIE_YCP_trappings_of_a_party_state_desc: "Hand in hand, the Young China Party and Yan Xishan have worked towards a new China bereft of the chronic illnesses the old nobility and warlords birthed so many years ago. The world has moved quickly these last few years, it is the duty of the party to take these lessons to heart and mould the future of China accordingly."

 QIE_chinese_century: "The Chinese Century"
 QIE_chinese_century_desc: "With our sweeping reforms complete we enter the world as a rising power, ready to take on our foes and prove to the world once and for all that China is the true master of the East."

 QIE_appoint_viceroys: "General Administration of Communications"
 QIE_appoint_viceroys_desc: "Telecommunications development in China started with Governor Li Hongzhang's open letter in 1879. While he wanted to prioritise the imperial military's communication needs in tandem with the Empire's development of the imperial military-industrial complex, other reformers also recognised the vast civilian and economic benefits of the system. We've still yet to realise their ambitions, but restructuring the Telegraph Office would help kickstart the process."

 QIE_new_coronation: "A New Coronation"
 QIE_new_coronation_desc: "A controversial idea has floated around the Qing nobility ever since the anti-Zhili coup - a second coronation for Puyi. While expensive, this could signal to China and the world we have formally cast off the shackles of warlordism and have entered a new stage of growth and renewal."

 QIE_imperial_arsenals: "Construct New Imperial Arsenals"
 QIE_imperial_arsenals_desc: "Industrialisation in China started with military production. It was the need for security and self-strengthening that drove earlier reformers to ramp up heavy industries for manufacturing ships and ordinances. However, wracked by social and economic constraints, our predecessors failed to catch up with the other imperial powers. Closing this gap now is a must for the survival of our empire."

 QIE_noble_factories: "Bureau of Industrial Affairs"
 QIE_noble_factories_desc: "With the seizing of all German-owned enterprises in the wake of the coup, many German-owned factories now lie vacant. While some short-sighted individuals bemoan the drop in economic production, we see this as an opportunity to further our home-grown industries. With the Hanyang Arsenal and Kaiping Mining Bureau as our models, we will indigenise and improve upon these German holdings."

 QIE_raise_banners: "Raise the Banners"
 QIE_raise_banners_desc: "While the Eight Banners were mostly dissolved in the wake of the Taiping Rebellion, some Qing generals are now suggesting we create a modern version of the system. While largely adhering to Western divisional organisational structures, we will apply Qing history and legacy to make them truly our own."

 QIE_imperial_roads: "The Dragon and the Iron Horse"
 QIE_imperial_roads_desc: "In times before Republican anarchy, Governors Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong were pioneers of infrastructure development in the Great Qing. Their overland projects helped to tie the empire together, improving security and economic interconnectedness. We will honour their legacy and bind together the vast expanses of our empire with new road and railway networks"

 QIE_mandate_heaven: "The Mandate of Heaven"
 QIE_mandate_heaven_desc: "Some might claim it an outdated term, but what is the Mandate of Heaven but not a popular expression of the legitimate will of the government? Our scholars will need to update some texts, but with some work we can distribute propaganda that shows that Puyi is the true and legitimate Emperor of China."

 QIE_manchu_default_debt: "Default on Debt"
 QIE_manchu_default_debt_desc: "While we have created a new government, international creditors do not see things the same way. Our overwhelming international debt will continue to hinder our economic growth unless we default on it, harming us in the short term but allowing us to develop in the long run."

 QIE_more_equal_treaties: "Debt Negotiations"
 QIE_more_equal_treaties_desc: "While it may be tempting to default on our debt entirely, influential Zongshe members have come up with an alternative for the betterment of the empire's fiscal longevity. Germany has seen its influence dramatically hindered by the many anti-concessionists gaining prominence in our new government, but should we offer a chance to renegotiate our economic ties they may consider this a chance to salvage some influence in Beijing."

 QIE_county_reorganization: "County Reorganisation Act"
 QIE_county_reorganization_desc: "The County Reorganisation Act is perhaps one of the most risky pieces of legislation since the Hundred Days' Reforms. Its promulgation will would irrevocably change rural relations by imposing the Emperor's will into rural society. Although risky, it is hope that with the act, county governments will no longer be corrupt, self-serving institutions but genuine tools of the Emperor to better the lives of his subjects."

 QIE_county_assemblies: "Reinstitute the County Assemblies"
 QIE_county_assemblies_desc: "In 1910, Zhili province experimented with self-rule through the establishment of County Assemblies. The Assemblies became institutions with which local gentries and elites project power and negotiate their relations with the centre. Although the Zhili forcefully dissolved them the early 30s, we can revive these assemblies to gain the favour of rural elites, who would then cement our control over the countryside."

 QIE_imperial_consolidation: "Pacify the Nation"
 QIE_imperial_consolidation_desc: "The majority of China is ruled by warlord cliques, leftists, and even worse - republicans. These traitors must be destroyed! Soon, our armies will march out to destroy these rats and unify China behind the banner of the Emperor!"

 QIE_demand_fealty: "Demand Warlords Bend the Knee"
 QIE_demand_fealty_desc: "While we must seek out and destroy the leftists and republicans that infest large parts of our country, the more ideologically nebulous warlords may be brought to heel by the threat of our supreme army. If not, then we will simply destroy them."

 QIE_destroy_concessions: "Eradicate the Concessions"
 QIE_destroy_concessions_desc: "The Legation Cities are a stain on China's sovereignty and independence. While trade with the West is permissible, the cities are relics of the Century of Humiliation and have no place in our modern government. With the rest of the world embroiled in chaos now is the perfect moment to strike and reclaim our lost cities!"

 QIE_false_republic: "Dealing with the Northern Traitors"
 QIE_false_republic_desc: "The fools to the north claim to be the 'last bastion' of China's legitimate government. In reality they are little more than Japanese lapdogs. While they slavishly serve their masters we should strike and reclaim our homeland!"

 QIE_we_win: "The Dragon Rises from the Ashes"
 QIE_we_win_desc: "Few thought it possible, but we have triumphed over all of our foes! We now stand undisputed as the true masters of China, with the Emperor ready to lead the nation into this brave new world."

 QIE_rebuild_command_structure: "Restructure the Imperial General Staff"
 QIE_rebuild_command_structure_desc: "Officially, the Great Qing had never established a General Staff Office. While some proposals for instituting one were passed around in 1901, nothing ever materialised from those discussions. Our current Staff Office is a Zhili inheritance, wrought by nepotism and corruption. Nothing less than a clean sweep of the rotten structure will do to ensure maximum efficacy, as well as the loyalty of our commanders."

 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner: "The Shanghai Connection"
 QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc: "Within the foreign legations, there are many European military officials and career soldiers currently out of work. Whether French, British or Russian, the collapse of their Empires left them without suitable employment, and more than a few of these military men bear a grudge against Germany for sweeping up their former colonies. Gaining their service would not only benefit us militarily, but also give us valuable insider connections within the Legations."

 QIE_look_to_our_past: "Legacy of the New Armies"
 QIE_look_to_our_past_desc: "First established in 1895 to act as our shield against foreign encroachment and internal enemies, the New Armies had instead turned against the Emperor and gave way to republican anarchy. Our follies with managing them were many, most dire of all, allocating too much personal authority to local commanders. We've learned from our shortcomings since then, and will build a greater and more powerful force than our first attempt."

 QIE_assess_doctrines: "Commission for Army Reorganisation"
 QIE_assess_doctrines_desc: "The Commission for Army Organisation was first established to help promulgate key reforms to the imperial military in 1903, and it would not be overstating to say those reforms laid the foundations for our current force. However, the warlords have squandered the progress we've made with their endless bickering. We should reassemble the Commission to review, and perhaps help reorganise the imperial force once more."

 QIE_uneasy_coalition: "The Uneasy Coalition"
 QIE_uneasy_coalition_desc: "Each of the political groups that helped overthrow the Zhili Clique have much to offer the military. The CERA brings the loyalty of the peasantry, the YCP is made up of Baoding cadets, and the Qing nobility control some of the finest cavalrymen in the nation. While we must all work together to defeat the Japanese, each group may want concessions if they are not in power."

 QIE_rural_defense_force: "Found the Rural Defence Forces"
 QIE_rural_defense_force_desc: "For too long the peasantry of China have been terrorised by roving warbands of looters and bandits. The CERA has proposed enacting a system whereby each village will have its own defence force equipped with obsolete rifles. While of dubious military use, they will be useful at harassing enemies and making our territory costly to occupy."

 QIE_prepare_dikes: "Prepare the Dykes"
 QIE_prepare_dikes_desc: "The dykes along the Yellow River present a possibility for a drastic strike against the Japanese. Should we open them while enemy forces are advancing, the floodwaters will slow their progress immensely and may give our forces a better chance at defending the area."

 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts: "Exploit Baoding Contacts"
 QIE_exploit_baoding_contacts_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy has contracts with military academies and arsenals all around China, even in areas controlled by ostensible enemies. With enough funding, these contractors could be persuaded to join our side, bringing with them their experience and technical expertise."

 QIE_reinstate_baojia: "Reinstate the Baojia System"
 QIE_reinstate_baojia_desc: "Founded during the Song Dynasty, the Baojia system was created maintain local order, collect taxes, and organise civil projects. By recreating a modern version of this system we can more effectively recruit and train soldiers."

 QIE_best_money_can_buy: "Military Preparatory Schools"
 QIE_best_money_can_buy_desc: "The Military Preparatory Schools were first established as a quick-fix for our critical shortage of trained officers and cadets for the New Army. While the provincial nature of the academies meant the quality of the graduates varied, they nonetheless helped to offset at least some of the training costs. We should look into reinitiating at least some of these military halls."

 QIE_imperial_propaganda: "Venerate the Citizen-Soldier Model"
 QIE_imperial_propaganda_desc: "For too long, the warlords have defiled what it meant to be a soldier through their petty material desires and power struggles. The ideal Chinese citizen-soldier, since times ancient, has been morally upright, honed in his physical strength yet equally sharp in his mind. We must enforce this model of upstanding military masculinity across the army, so that all soldiers of the Great Qing can stand toe to toe with the likes of Japan and Germany."

 QIE_manchu_naval_academy: "Found the Imperial Naval Academy"
 QIE_manchu_naval_academy_desc: "The Qing Navy was largely trained by European schools. While it is a secondary or tertiary concern at the moment, we should still devote some funding to training our naval cadets here rather than overseas."

 QIE_manchu_air_warfare: "Study European Air Tactics"
 QIE_manchu_air_warfare_desc: "While we would like to take as little as possible from the foreign devils, there is no debate that their mastery over aerial warfare is undisputed. We should study their doctrine and tactics, so that we may apply them to our own air force."

 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd: "Found Baoding Military Research Department"
 QIE_expand_baoding_rnd_desc: "With our military fully reformed along modern lines, we should set out to create an institution that allows our forces to keep abreast of the latest technological innovations. By creating a fully independent Baoding Military Research Department, our forces will have the technical backing to go toe-to-toe with any army in the world."

 QIE_big_debt: "Overwhelming National Debt"
 QIE_big_debt_desc: "China's struggle to develop its national economy has resulted in an enormous trade debt fronted by the Beijing government. Industrial machinery is imported at a staggering cost, and what little domestic manufacturing does exist lacks the quality and quantity to compete on the world market. China's main exports are thus mostly agricultural, and even cash crops fetch low prices compared to widely imported foreign luxuries like cigarettes and radios. This problem is only exacerbated by widespread institutionalised corruption and a thriving opium trade.\n\nIf the nation is to lessen the debts and free ourselves from the shackles of the foreigners, either radical action will have to be pursued, or the President will have to corral the Germans to the negotiating table to shore up their side of our \"Special Relationship\"."

 QIE_court_of_the_jade_marshal: "Court of the Jade Marshal"
 QIE_court_of_the_jade_marshal_desc: "Considered the most premier strategic and tactical mind in all of China, Wu Peifu has overseen a decade of relative stability and unity. However, within the \"Court of the Jade Marshal\" lies chaos and dysfunction. Never having adopted a general staff or functional high command system, Wu has historically preferred to delegate to senior generals, granting them vague objectives without precise strategy. This has led to a serious nightmare of bureaucracy for the Central Army."

 QIE_stalled_80_division_reform_plan: "Stalled 80 Division Reform Plan"
 QIE_stalled_80_division_reform_plan_desc: "Through our cooperation with our German benefactors and allies, an advisory team composed of officers from Berlin have attempted to reform the Zhili army into an image of that representing the German Imperial Army in the East. However, corruption, malaise and lack of funding has led to a programme with ambitious dreams, yet stalled progress."

 QIE_legitimacy_of_the_monarchy: "Legitimacy of the Monarchy: §oDetested§!"
 QIE_legitimacy_of_the_monarchy_desc: "Ostensibly representing the continuation of over three centuries of continued rule, the Qing Monarchy has been utterly tarnished beyond repair. For the citizens of China, be it bureaucrat, worker or peasant, a myriad of rulers and despots have come and gone with promises of reform, all for it to end back where it started. Under the auspices of the Mandate of Heaven, the Qing Dynasty claims nominal leadership over the entirety of China's de-jure territory, yet it has led it to nothing but consistent ruin. If the Monarchy truly wishes to win over the hearts of the people, they must first save the hard-pressed commoners from their eternal strife, and reassure the people of China that this iteration of the Qing is reformed.\n\nUndoubtedly since 1928, the Royal Court has focused on carefully cultivating an image of modernism amongst its members. With Emperor Puyi but merely being a servant of the people's will, despite their continued objections. Taking more than extravagant parades, gratuitous declarations, the real architects of the nation-state building programs are that of the Zhili Clique. With their own issues in reputation, they are at least praised for their continuous heeding of popular sentiment. However with a history marred by controversy, many do not share optimism."

Under the wing of President Cao and Marshal Wu, the Qing Dynasty has welcomed a new era of prosperity and modernity, establishing itself as a friend to all business interests within Asia. Whilst the pluralisation of the political scene may be neglected, the economic situation has rapidly improved. A fledgling middle class develops rapidly, urban centres transform into a line of pearls dotting the East, and the peasantry welcome the increasing prospects of their livelihoods. Vindicating the Happy Old Man and his championing of China's special diplomatic relationship with the West, truly this century will be a Chinese one."

 QIE_legitimacy_of_the_republic_1: "Legitimacy of the Republic: §8Questionable§!"
 QIE_legitimacy_of_the_republic_1_desc: "Oh the irony of it all. Having originally been enunciated through the acquiescence of Empress Dowager Longyu, on behalf of Boy Emperor Puyi, the Beiyang Republic was formed in 1912 after the bloody struggle and sacrifices of legions of martyrs for the eradication of the monarchy. Bounding with hope and optimism, the people marched forward under the banners of reformers and revolutionaries alike, experiencing the great equalisation and pluralisation of the new, young and malleable republic. Yet it would all be snuffed out following the machinations of a despot.

 QIE_Sie_Contracts_desc: "A world renowned electrical engineering company, the Cabinet has offered a series of lucrative production contracts towards Siemens-Shuckert to aid in the manufacturing of radio equipment, alongside other forms of economic assistance. Furthering our modernisation efforts, it is hoped that the factories they build, the workers they hire and the equipment they produce ultimately aid in the strengthening of the Chinese economy."

 QIE_german_railroad_engineers_ideas_desc: "Having negotiated a deal with various endeavouring European railway magnates, tycoons and experts, they have embarked in mass to assist our native engineers and workers with devising a large modernisation project of our pre-existing railways. Whilst of course useful for civilian matters, and in extending our influence into the hinterlands, it is also primarily planned and enacted with the military in mind."

 QIE_zhili_war_production_idea: "German War Production Assistance"
 QIE_zhili_war_production_idea_desc: "Utilising connections within the Prosperity League, Peking-Kommission and German Consul, the Jinbao faction of the Zhili clique has leveraged such ties to welcome a cornucopia of investment, modernisation and manufacturing assistance in regards to China's nascent military production lines. Swiftly aiding in the modernisation of the nation and its army, it has resulted in the rapid upgrade of equipment and the drafting of potential Chinese armoured brigades. With this weaponry, the Zhili High Command places hope that it will be the shield that blunts Japan's impending spearhead, and that of any uppity warlord."

 QIE_flurry_of_investment_desc: "Following the official announcement of lessening trade restrictions and investment laws, the Chinese market has seen an influx of of entrepreneurial ventures by local, albeit mostly foreign, capitalists. With their assistance the Government has managed to stabilise the rather dire economic situation, alas however the lack of vetting and the popular reputation of foreign imperialists has resulted in friction for the Cabinet."

 QIE_big_protests_desc: "With our comparitive official radio silence on matters revolving around the League Collapse, various parties from both Concessionist and Anti-Concessionist camps harass the Cabinet for some sort of immediate action. With the Prosperity League and Peking-Kommission vocally declaring their disapproval of the Government's inability to reassure the commitments of German investments within the League, they have begun to finance anti-Zhili media campaigns.\n\nSimilarly, the popular support of the Anti-Concessionist movement has been harnessed by the likes of Beijing's intellectual circles to direct popular fury once more against the Zhili. With our grave misstep, it would appear that powers behind the curtain loom. Already there are murmurs, whisphers of dissent amongst the Royalists, perhaps aiming to finally depose the Republicans that hold their beloved Emperor hostage in the Forbidden City..."

 QIE_centralized_exec_constitution_desc: "After numerous hours of deliberation by the Constitutional Drafting Committee, the new Beiyang Constitution has finally been drafted. With the communion of experts counting the likes of Wang Chonghui, Hu Shih, Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, the new, revitalised constitution of the Beiyang Republic represents a renewed commitment to democratic governance and national rejuvenation. Utilising the 1923 Cao Kun Constitution as a sturdy base to be built upon, it has focused on updating the framework and shortcomings of its predecessor. Ensuring greater checks and balances, enhanced civil liberties, and a fostered form of inclusive political participation. Enshrining the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, it also fortifies protections for individual rights.\n\nWith the promulgation of a constitution that favours a strong executive and centralised bureaucracy, it would appear that the Confucian, Conservative, and moral democratic republic that the Jade Marshal desired is on the horizon. However with the unification of the nation, and the forces of the gentry alongside the conservatives of the Assembly posing themselves as possible obstacles, the road to true democracy along the hopes and dreams of Xinhai's martyrs is not a straight one. The history of the Beiyang Republican movement is evidence enough of such a fact."

Whilst not truly Federalist, it is a fantastic victory for those endeavouring few that champion the movement in the North, having made even the unflinching Jade Marshal acquiesce to the desires of the Committee. With the future ever bright, the perils that could potentially sink the government yet again are ever pressing. With local warlords, and the unification most pressing, the road to true democracy along the hopes and dreams of Xinhai's martyrs is not a straight one.

Already many within the South are championing Hu Shih as the great saviour of Northern Federalism, and many are welcoming the increasing pluralisation of the Beiyang political scene. Make no mistake however, the Beiyang Republic is still at the mercy of militarists, be it provincial or the Jade Marshal's Roundtable itself. The road to true democracy along the hopes and dreams of Xinhai's martyrs is not a straight one. The history of the Beiyang Republican movement is evidence enough of such a fact."

 QIE_cao_kun_constitution: "The 1923 Cao Kun Constitution"
 QIE_cao_kun_constitution_desc: "A remarkable piece of progressive legislature, the 1923 Cao Kun Constitution perhaps represents the peak of Beiyang idealism and hope in the merits of the Zhili Clique. Ultimately receiving a pluralist support from the majority of the Northern Assemblymen at the time, the Cao Kun constitution marked a significant attempt to formalise proper governance in the Beiyang Republic following a tumultuous era of blatant abuses by Duan Qirui and his Anfu Club. Seeking to establish a structured, organised and centralised government, it places significant executive power within that of the President.\n\nHowever it features remarkable components such as a clear separation of powers and an outline of clear civil rights of the Chinese people. Rather unfortunately, its implementation a decade ago was marred by allegations of corruption and autocracy, having been conducted around the similar timeframe in which Cao's bribery scandal concluded. And yet again, its re-implementation in this new era of chaotic times signals another attempt to rapidly stabilise the political situation. Rife with potential loopholes for executive abuse, one must merely place faith in the President at this current time to truly exert the will of the people."

 QIE_public_safety_bureau: "Beijing Public Safety Bureau"
 QIE_public_safety_bureau_desc: "The Beijing Public Safety Bureau, or BPSB, is the name of the Intelligence Agency moonlighting as the Zhili's secret police, nominally led by Liu Menggeng and Wang Yujia. Utilising both their contacts within the Central Plains and elsewhere alongside their admirable experience in running Cao Kun's spy and intelligence rings, the entity was established to ensure that the possibility of a Manchu Coup could never happen again. Espionage, suppression of internal dissent and counter-intelligence are just some of the many objectives the institution has been authorised to deal with."

 QIE_dealing_with_dishonesty: "Dealing with Dishonesty"
 QIE_dealing_with_dishonesty_desc: "Political corruption is, rather unfortunately, an all too common reality within Beijing politics. Either through the Zhili Clique's Jinbao faction, or other political groupings, various politicians have fallen to the urge of expedient wealth in exchange for their vote. Intent on providing a new future for a new Chinese Republic, the President has drafted a series of anti-corruption agencies with which he intends to combat these flagrant abuses. Whilst not doing much to unshift the Gentru's dominance or corruption in politics outside the national level, the President and Jade Marshal hope that such an initiative will serve as an example for the Governors and County Magistrates to implement of their own volition. However such actions are rife with unpopularity and pushback from the establishment, as they fear being the next target of triumphant arrest and denouncement."

 QIE_burgeoning_pluralism: "Burgeoning Pluralism"
 QIE_burgeoning_pluralism_desc: "Championing his ever righteous cause for the liberalisation and eradication of the entrenched bureaucratic elite, President Hu has adventured on a crusade against those far from transparent politicians. Desiring a government only of \"Good People\", this has led to an increase in support for the minor political parties in the assembly, resulting in a series of small defections from the Harmony Association. Whilst not enough to challenge their rule, as most kowtow to the President and Zhili, it has resulted in a steadily growing healthy opposition."

 QIE_revival_of_new_nationalism_desc: "Following the integration of the Young China Party into the mass Republican coalition, their righteousness and actions in light of the previous Qing Monarchy have seen much vindication within the eyes of not just the people but the Assembly too. Following on from this, our increase in nationalist rhetoric has led to enlistment into the army, navy and air force increasing in droves. Motivated by patriotism, these brave heroes are willing to sacrifice their souls for the benefit of the Chinese nation-state. A true militaristic state-people."

 QIE_mass_nationalisation_of_noble_estates_desc: "Eradicating the influence of the Royalists and Court can not be merely conducted through the removal of their Emperor and the annihilation of their political parties. To achieve true republicanism, we must deprive them of their estates, their businesses, and all other forms of control by which they can exert themselves upon the populace. Whilst potentially cruel, they shall be reimbursed through the maintenance of their already quite large amounts of wealth. With that, surely they can survive quite comfortably, even whilst the Chinese peasant suffers."

Continuously championed by Hu Shih in some form, they represent one of the many Federalist blocs within the North's political scene. Now that our ties were formally re-established in the light of the Constitutional Committee, let us integrate this think tank further into our government, however they expect much of our government. Most importantly, immediate reform of its kleptocratic institutions."

 QIE_yan_xishan_backer_idea_desc: "A republican warlord, few thought Yan Xishan would want to have anything to do with the new Qing state. Yet with Fengtian currently under the Japanese heel and the south engulfed in chaos, the Model Governor has decided to throw in his hat with the new constitutional system.

 QIE_nationalized_yan_xishan_thought_desc: "Governor Yan Xishan has begun to spread his personal political philosophy throughout the Qing Empire, adopting a nationalised, homegrown, and defensive characteristic. At first only a small circle of political thinkers, now there are political clubs discussing and handing out pamphlets for Xishan's favoured 'Heart Washing Society'. Yan Xishan has personally written many of the pamphlets that are now spreading throughout the heartland of the Qing Empire."

His once peculiar philosophy has now aggregated into a defining element of our new regime. Throughout the land, people have begun to see the effects of our uncompromising stance on looking forward.

 QIE_cult_of_progress_idea: "Bureau of Progress"
 QIE_cult_of_progress_idea_desc: "Tired of the slow processes of democratic debate the YCP has decided to engage in their own gambit for more immediate political action. Yan Xishan has given the go-ahead to the YCP's scheming allowing for the creation of small executive committees to accelerate political reforms. Time will tell if the YCP has the gumption to consolidate their control or slink back to working with the anachronistic Zongshe and naive CERA."

 QIE_banner_idea: "Modern Banner System"
 QIE_banner_idea_desc: "In an effort to modernise the ad-hoc military left over from the Zhili Clique, the Zongshe party has attempted to bring back the banner system of the old Qing emperors.

 QIE_country_intro_header: "§cThe Great Qing§!"
 QIE_country_intro_content: "The internationally mediated end of the last Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928 brought an end to nearly four years of chaos and instability and began the longest period of peace enjoyed by some parts of China since the §lXinhai Revolution§! of 1911. Though §cWu Peifu§! and his §PNorthern Zhili Clique§! accepted the return of the §cQing dynasty§!, further §mGerman concessions§! were refused, leading to a cooling of relations. §mGermany§! continues to maintain support for the §cQing Government§!, but mainly with the aim of ensuring consistent competition with the also-supported §PSouthern Zhili§! as part of a larger divide and conquer strategy in China as a whole, as well as in the hopes of gradually building a Chinese bulwark against §jJapan§!.\n\nThough the spectre of §jJapanese§! domination looms across much of Northern and Eastern China, the country is nonetheless far more divided than most in Beijing would prefer, and the §cQing§! finds its authority contested on all sides, from the defiant §gFengtian Government§! in the Northeast, to the various ostensible allies across the remainder of China; nominal components of the Empire granted near-total autonomy by grace of geography and regionalist sentiment. As a result, the §cQing§! enters 1936 largely contained to the North China Plain, and at the head of a faltering national order."

 QIE_country_intro_header_1: "The Political Situation"
 QIE_country_intro_content_1: "1936 finds the powerless Assembly on the brink. Numerous groups dominate the body, and although they have no power in the chamber, the groups that support them are not to be trifled with. The most powerful of these is the §gHarmony Association§!, nominally led by §gPresident Cao Kun§!. An ever present and conniving statesmen, he and his §gJinbao§! faction of the Zhili Clique collaborate with §cWu Peifu§!'s §cLuoyang§! faction. Both men ostensibly founded the Association as a legitimising movement to ensure §PZhili§! representation in the Assembly. While nominally an independent political party, the §gHarmony Association's§! deputies are all former §PZhili officers§!, civil servants or otherwise, and following §gCao Kun's§! re-election few believe the group is anything more than a front for the §PZhili§! to control the country.\n\nThe §mProsperity League§! occupies a similar position, and while it claims to be a political party few see it as any more than a lobbying group for §mGerman§! interests in Beijing.\n\nThis leaves three major parties in the opposition: The §cZongshe Party§!, comprised of §cQing§! princes and former royal hangers-on, the §nYoung China Party§!, a clique of young ultranationalists and idealogues, styling themselves on the party-state of the §RKuomintang§!, and the §SChinese Empire Reformation Association§!, a coalition of two reform groups that, while ostensibly loyal to the Emperor, favour a structural reorganisation of China back to the traditional model of the rural village, and the end to warlord cliques.\n\nJoining them is the intellectuals of the §SEndeavour Society§! under §SHu Shih§!, championing his cause of Pragmatist Liberalism. Similarly there are the §SDemocracy and Science Forum§!, §mPolitical Science Clique§!, and other §LIndependents§!.\n\nWhile these groups are in opposition to §gCao Kun§! and the §gCabinet§!, he has delicately balanced their election to provide a counterweight to his Harmony Association. One that is ultimately powerless, but they don't know that."

 QIE_country_intro_header_2: "Restructuring Our Debt"
 QIE_country_intro_content_2: "For the last few years §cWu§! and §gCao§! have spent most of their political capital attempting to restructure and reduce the enormous debt of the §cQing Empire§!. While theoretically possible, this plan has run into numerous challenges, the chief being a lack of support from the provincial governors, who have not managed to pay their genuinely owed taxes since §PDuan Qirui's§! deposition in 1920. Rumours of instability in the south due to §PSun Chuanfang's§! kleptocratic mania have further complicated these plans, and President §gCao Kun§! is expected to deliver a speech on reducing the national debt to the Assembly after the New Year Celebrations later this month."

 qiedom.4.t: "Report from the Interior Ministry"
 qiedom.4.d: "Following President Cao's initiative to finally collect the due provincial tax obligations that have long been snuffed by regions not under direct Zhili Control, the Ministry of the Interior under Gao Lingwei was placed in charge of such a scheme. Following through with the Finance Ministry under Wang Kemin, it was believed that such a simple task would pose no issue. After all, the Provincial Governors all swear fealty to Beijing, and all have to pay their long overdue tributes. And with the state of the Beiyang Republic's financial situation, it is the moral thing to do.\n\nNonetheless, Minister Gao has informed the Cabinet after a scheduled weekly meeting that the various provincial governors have, mostly, returned with positive affirmation of our tax collectors entering their lands. Notably however, was the blanket refusal by Governor Yang in Xinjiang, League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang and his subordinate Governors, Governor [SHD.GetLeader] and most peculiarly that of Governors Lu Rongting, Chen Jiongming, Tang Jiyao and Zhao Hengti. Whilst the other cases are regretfully understandable, given Yang's paranoia, [SHD.GetLeader]'s ambivalence and Sun Chuanfang's power scheming, the Southern Bloc was reminiscent of movements such as the Constitutional Protection Movement.\n\nConfusion and damnations seizing the cabinet, such an atmosphere was only broken after Bai Jianwu, the Jade Marshal's spokesperson, reported that Governor Zhao had revealed to Wu Peifu the Southernor's intentions. Forming a bloc of \"Official Non-Compliance\", the Southerners desire a true return to Chinese Democracy, free of what they view as the stranglehold of militarists."
 qiedom.4.a: "What are they planning?!"

 qiedom.5.t: "Ripples of Black Monday"
 qiedom.5.d: "Having become intertwined with the global German economic powerhouse since the end of the Weltkrieg, and further since the German Intervention in 1927, the Chinese economy is an enwrapped, yet distant partner in the affairs of Mitteleuropa. With extensive German investment, especially in the League of Eight Provinces, the Chinese markets are flooded with German businesses, businessmen and extensive joint ventures.\n\nWith the global economic downturn sweeping far across the world, East Asia is far from spared the waves of collapse. Hitting even as far as Tokyo, and acting as the match for the deterioration of order within Sun Chuanfang's League, it is of no surprise that even the Central Government is suffering from blowback. With the increasing fleeing of German investors and business, alongside the increase in governmental expenses, it would appear that hard times for the Government are just beginning.\n\nDespite assurances from Cao Kun's Jinbao faction and the Prosperity League parliamentary grouping, it would appear that Wu's Luoyang faction has launched a diplomatic offensive, vindicated in their anti-concessionist stance."
 qiedom.5.a: "A sign of things to come?"

 qiefocus.1.t: "Chinese New Year: Rat"
 qiefocus.1.d: "As is the usual foray to mark celebrations of the Chinese New Year, President Cao Kun gathered the Assembly to enunciate his annual New Year Celebration speech. Following standard procedure of his previous overtures to the gathered politicians, he would, in a long, somewhat rambling speech, demarcate his planned national policies that he intended to pursue in this Year of the Rat.\n\nAvoiding any direct mention of the court, or the monarchy, as is the usual performance to avoid addressing one of his most unpopular political moves, the President addressed the need to restore the glory of the Chinese nation, further rein in the provincial governors, continue to work on attaining a true equal status with the foreigners, vanquish the illegal regimes occupying Dongbei, Tibet and Outer Mongolia, and continuing to sort out the financial sector, in order to grant stability and repay debts.\n\nLaying out a three point plan, Cao and his Harmony Association intended to grant government subsidies and tax cuts to light manufacturing industries, further tax exemptions to farmers who grew agricultural foodstuffs instead of cash crops such as opium, and an increased centralisation effort on provincial governors. As advised by his Finance Ministry, the President hopes that this will bring a new era of prosperity to the damaged nation!"
 qiefocus.1.a: "The speech is met with polite applause."

 qiefocus.2.t: "Emergency Meeting of the Zhili"
 qiefocus.2.d: "With the chaotic breakdown of any and all authority within the League of Eight Provinces, otherwise known as Southern Zhili, the Jade Marshal has assembled an emergency meeting of his command staff inside his headquarters within Luoyang. Inviting not just his direct staff, but those of the Jinbao faction under Wang Chengbin's authority, representing Cao Kun. Eyeing up the prospects of potential military intervention as desired by the likes of Cai Chengxun, Wu and Zhang Qihuang urged hesitancy at such an extreme reaction, with Qihuang in particular suggesting that limited support should be the desired course of action.\n\nWith the general agreement across the spectrum that it would be far more prudent to focus on maintaining order within the Central Provinces, two camps have developed within the Zhili command staff. The Jinbao faction, as urged by telegrams from Cao himself, support moving to preserve the pre-existing League structure, backing the continuity of its concessionist regime.\n\nRunning counter to this is Wu's Luoyang faction, backing the Jade Marshal's anti-concessionist stance, and instead privy to supporting Chen Tiaoyuan's revolt, even if there's convictions that he is nothing more than \"rolling his dice\" as a wildcard. Hoping for it to be the start of a campaign to buck off the foreign imperialists, they are willing to bite the bullet of potential instability Chen would pose."
 qiefocus.2.a: "We need to be careful..."

 qiedom.18.t: "German Mining Companies Increase Their Operations in Eastern Shanxi"
 qiedom.18.d: "The Shanxi region has always been a good source of coal and useful metals for the Empire. Following the 4th Zhili-Fengtian War, we gained direct control of Eastern Shanxi, a slim area of land that used to belong to Yan Xishan's Shanxi Clique. Our ownership of Eastern Shanxi has been the cause of tensions between us and the Shanxi Clique, but for now they are unable to compete with our military strength. Much like the rest of Shanxi, this area is rich with coal and iron. Multiple German companies took an interest in Eastern Shanxi, and so purchased the coal and iron mines there. These mines sit very close to the border with the Shanxi Clique, but this has not yet been a problem.\n\nHowever, news just came in that these Eastern Shanxi companies are going to increase their mining operations, and have presented plans that show some of their mines falling into Shanxi controlled territory. We personally do not need to worry about this, but it is likely to cause some problems in the Shanxi Clique, with many peasants feeling robbed that these German companies are taking their mines."
 qiedom.18.a: "We wish them good luck with their business ventures."

 qielepcollapse.1.t: "The Sale of the ZheGan Railroad"
 qielepcollapse.1.d: "The past few weeks have seen a great deal of economic activity in the League of Eight Provinces, the southern conglomerate of provinces ruled by our nominal subordinate, Sun Chuanfang. Even more heavily influenced by German economic support than we are, the League just finished construction on a major railroad, the ZheGan line. Though funded by the Germans, it was largely built by Chinese labour, leading many to hope for a more equitable relationship between German and Chinese in the League, at least in economic affairs.\n\nA few days ago, in a surprising move, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of their subsidiary group, the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft - including this new ZheGan route.\n\nThis move angered many native Chinese residents of the League, who saw the ZheGan line as a potential building block in an equal relationship between Europeans and Asians. Widespread protests have broken out, inflamed by conspiracies of fraud and embezzlement on the part of Sun's cronies."
 qielepcollapse.1.a: "We need to keep an eye on this."

 qielepcollapse.2.t: "Widespread Attacks on Foreigners"
 qielepcollapse.2.d: "Following the unrest surrounding the ZheGan railroad, a number of German investors and businessmen have been savagely attacked by rabid anti-foreign mobs. To make matters worse, widespread boycotts of German goods have began in the South, and this morning reports reached Beijing of bombings of railway stations in Hangzhou and other cities on the Central China Railway. Transportation has ground to a halt in many regions of the League, and Kuomintang guerrillas within MinGan have used this opportunity to stage increasingly daring attacks on isolated League garrisons.\n\nThe German ambassador in Beijing has demanded accountability, and while the League is largely autonomous from our control, it is still under our auspices officially. Wang Chengbin and other Zhili officials have long pushed to exert greater control over the League, and are urging Wu to use this crisis to leverage greater influence over the south. Wu, having long sought an excuse to contain Sun is currently drafting a telegram to demand accountability from Sun and offer our help should he need it. Unsaid, of course, is the demand for increased control over League affairs should he accept our help."
 qielepcollapse.2.a: "Let's see what Sun has to say..."

 qielepcollapse.3.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
 qielepcollapse.3.d: "Troubling information reached Luoyang and Beijing this morning. While reports are somewhat contradictory, it appears there was some sort of a massacre of peaceful protestors by League and German troops in the city of Wuhu. Some claim German troops simply mowed down the protestors, while others claim a group of Kuomintang radicals attacked the Germans and League troops first. Whatever the cause, the city has fallen into anarchy and protests have sprung up all over the League.\n\nIronically, at the same time as we received this information we received a report from Sun Chuanfang claiming he has the situation under control. Some Zhili generals such as Cai Chengxun are pushing for a major intervention in the south should the situation deteriorate further, but Wu has yet to take a clear position on the issue, fearful of intervention from Zhang Zuolin.\n\nFurther exasperating our problems, Bai Jianwu has informed the Jade Marshal that the Chinese Empire Reform Association have somehow received information on the situation, perhaps from contacts within progressives dotting the legations. It would seem they are planning to hold a scathing speech later in the assembly today, criticising the Zhili's lack of action. Cao Kun's Harmony Association assemblymen are swift at work collaborating with the president on preparing a response, but it would appear we have been caught off guard."
 qielepcollapse.3.a: "\"Under control\" my ass..."

 qielepcollapse.4.t: "Anhui Breaks Free"
 qielepcollapse.4.d: "The province of Anhui, long chafing under Sun Chuanfang's autocratic rule, has essentially declared independence from the League this week. In a widely-distributed pamphlet, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan claimed that the Wuhu incident \"shows that Sun cannot manage this crisis, and essentially abrogates him from any responsibility in Anhui.\"\n\nXiao Yaonan, Wang Chengbin and Li Jichen, governors of Hubei, Zhili and Henan, have unilaterally begun to mobilise their troops against prospective \"Kuomintang incursions\", though Zhang Qihuang has advised Wu that their true intention is likely to prevent the chaos from flooding into the Central Plains, potentially escalating things with Chen, Sun or even [SHD.GetLeader]. Seeking to undercut their opportunity to invade and create another calamitious war in a similar vein to the conflict that pre-empted the Second ZhiFeng War, Wu declared a \"national state of readiness\" this morning to all assembled Beiyang Army Staff, he urging them to ready their troops for \"any possible armed conflict\", and placed the garrisons on the Shaanxi and Fengtian borders on high alert. Confused Zhili troops have largely fallen into line with Wu and any premature attack south was effectively ended before it began."
 qielepcollapse.4.a: "Let's hope this keeps them in line"

 qielepcollapse.5.t: "A Telegram from Nanjing"
 qielepcollapse.5.d: "Rushing to his home in the middle of the night, Wu Peifu was awoken by his secretary, Bai Jianwu, and his Chief of Staff, Zhang Qihuang, rousing the Jade Marshal from a restless slumber. Ushering Wu towards his desk, the duo slid an emergency telegram report infront of the Marshal, for his eyes only. Enquiring as to if President Cao has seen the same telegram, he learned that Wang Yujia and Liu Menggeng are already explaining the situation to the President. Glancing his eyes over the confidential telegram sheet, awe washing over his face, it read:\n\n'Sun Chuanfang shot 8:55 AM STOP\nPerpetrator unknown STOP\nIn coma STOP\nUnlikely to wake STOP\nRiots widespread STOP\nFleeing with gold and documents STOP'\n\nTwo hours later, Luoyang became a frenzied hub of activity. Documents concerning Sun's more salacious dealings with Beijing burnt in furnaces, while groups of Jinbao and Luoyang Zhili members argue over the Smiling Tiger's connections. In an unprecedented move, Cao Kun has invited several Manchu nobles, notably the Emperor's brother Pujie, to be present for the drafting of some form of unified statement in response to the assassination, perhaps desiring a united front in these troubling times.\n\nBeyond it all, the Jade Marshal can't help but feel sorrow for the fate that has befallen Sun Chuanfang. His protégé, his original successor, for all they shared in ideology and memory, to be sullied like this?"
 qielepcollapse.5.a: "\"Farewell, Sun...\""

 qielepcollapse.6.t: "Imperial Navy Flees North!"
 qielepcollapse.6.d: "With the securing of Shandong by hostile forces rampaging and ruining the port of Yantai, alongside Qingdao and Weihaiwei being under the official de-facto control of Germany's colonial project, the land directly controlled by the Central Government concretely lacks any properly suitable ports to maintain the Beiyang Fleet. In such a sorry situation, the Beiyang Fleet was moved to Nantong, ostensibly within the League, since the end of the ZhiFeng Wars.\n\nWith rioting, civil unrest, and general chaos enveloping the city due to the League Collapse, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Sa Zhenbing, has been ordered to mobilise the fleet to flee the city, heading north for the small ports surrounding the urban city of Tianjin. The fall of the Nanjing docks has resulted in a navy without a home, lacking the shipbuilding capacity to do anything more than maintain the current fleet.\n\nAddressing the Jade Marshal, Sa Zhenbing and Yang Shuzhuang both insisted that the admiralty necessitates the ports of Shandong, or otherwise that of Zhejiang or Fujian, if it is to protect China's coastal waters."
 qielepcollapse.6.a: "\"That will have to wait, gentlemen.\""

 qielepcollapse.7.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Sends a Telegram"
 qielepcollapse.7.d: "\"To the eminent President Cao Kun, and Imperial Minister Wu Peifu,\n\nI, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, humbly ask for extrajudicial funding for my troops. As outlined in the constitution of our great nation, it is the responsibility of the national government to provide funds to provincial governors to suppress unrest. With the situation of League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing unclear, I have taken the responsibility of protecting the province of Anhui against bandits and leftist agitators.\"\n\nDelivered in the form of a telegram to Cao Kun and forwarded to Wu peifu this morning, the tone surprised both men in its boldness, appearing to proposition the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding by holding them to the merits of the constituion. Appearing to have restored order to his province, Chen is clearly gambling for support from the Central Government in order to expand beyond Anhui.\n\nFaced with a rather difficult choice, Chen could potentially remove a chess piece from the board, wipping it clean with a man beholden to his support, as opposed to the rather unyieldy League. However with the baggage of a firm anti-concessionist following, Wu and Cao's support could see the long-term alienation of Germany, something Cao has delicately cultivated for years. At the same time, standing with the anti-concessionists would allow Wu and Cao to once again bend to the opinion of the popular masses, riding the wave of support akin to 1922."
 qielepcollapse.7.a: "Send the funds, it'll secure our interests."
 qielepcollapse.7.b: "Refuse. No funds for rebels!"

 qielepcollapse.8.t: "An Offer from Marshal Qi"
 qielepcollapse.8.d: "With the refusal of Governor Chen's telegram, it would appear that the amibitous, opportunistic Qi Xieyuan has caught wind of the rebuttal. All but usurping Sun Chuanfang's role within the League, Qi has proclaimed himself to be the new \"League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces\", despite Sun having not officially been declared dead to the public.\n\nAddressing a flowery letter to both Cao and Wu, he has directly requested aid in suppressing what he has deemed to be \"a minor rebellion in Anhui province\", despite our intelligence and Chen's telegram clearly indicating otherwise. Insisting that since we are the rightful authority in the Central Government, it is \"only proper conduct that we support the rightful Marshal of the League\".\n\nThe pompous tone has left Wu and Cao suspicious of Qi's request, considering that some sort of upstart warlord who has already caused trouble in 1924 would make demands of them. Even worse Qi could theoretically easily crush Anhui and the Kuomintang Uprising with German Aid alone. However Cao and his advisors, Gao Lingwei among them, still suggests that a strong League and a strong relationship with Germany is the way forward for progress."
 qielepcollapse.8.a: "Let's hear him out - we could gain some leverage here."
 qielepcollapse.8.b: "He can handle this on his own."

 qielepcollapse.9.t: "Wu Accepts!"
 qielepcollapse.9.d: "It would appear that our plea to the Central Government has been answered with good news! Accepting our, quite frankly, humble request for aid Wu Peifu and Cao Kun have indirectly recognised our authority over Nanjing and the rest of the League Provinces. With their finances and armaments, we can finally venture to secure even greater territory, and vanquish the rambunctious glorified bandits occupying Anhui. However, this does rather mean that we must kowtow, on paper, to their auspices, albeit our rule in the League Provinces now has legitimate backing."
 qielepcollapse.9.a: "Excellent!"

 qielepcollapse.10.t: "Wu Refuses!"
 qielepcollapse.10.d: "Utterly damnable, that glory-hogging \"Jade Marshal\" and his perfidious \"Bribing President\" have utterly rejected our request for aid. Refusing to address our need for aid, they have thrown our backs against the wall, and once more we must turn to our German benefactors. Turning their back on the true Southern Zhili, the Central Government clearly has designs on instituting a more \"loyal\" government within the League territory."
 qielepcollapse.10.a: "Damn!"

 qielepcollapse.11.t: "Another Offer to Chen?"
 qielepcollapse.11.d: "Following our refusal of aid to Anhui Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique, worrying reports have begun to emerge that he has reached out to Zhang Zuolin, leader of the rogue Fengtian government in the Northeast. Even more worrying is his use of a Japanese interlocutor to facilitate the conversation. Several of Wu's advisors are suggesting the Marshal reach out again to Chen with an offer of direct support in his rebellion, lest we end up with a Japanese lapdog right on our doorstep.\n\nBeyond just Japanese support for Chen, however, it also seems that non-intervention could lead to widespread domestic unrest. Many in both the opposition parties and the Zhili Clique itself are itching for an opportunity to extend our control in the chaos of the collapse, and already small protests in favour of Governor Chen's anti-concessions stance have broken out across urban areas. Staying silent could result in these protests escalating, further destabilising our increasingly unstable regime."
 qielepcollapse.11.a: "Let's see what he has to say."
 qielepcollapse.11.b: "This is too risky."

 qielepcollapse.12.t: "Marshal Qi's Offer"
 qielepcollapse.12.d: "With the acceptance of Governor Chen's telegram, it would appear that the amibitous, opportunistic Qi Xieyuan failed to catch wind of the alliance. All but usurping Sun Chuanfang's role within the League, Qi has proclaimed himself to be the new \"League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces\", despite Sun having not officially been declared dead to the public.\n\nAddressing a flowery letter to both Cao and Wu, he has directly requested aid in suppressing what he has deemed to be \"a minor rebellion in Anhui province\", despite our intelligence and Chen's telegram clearly indicating otherwise. Insisting that since we are the rightful authority in the Central Government, it is \"only proper conduct that we support the rightful Marshal of the League\".\n\nThe pompous tone has left Wu and Cao suspicious of Qi's request, considering that some sort of upstart warlord who has already caused trouble in 1924 would make demands of them. Even worse Qi could theoretically easily crush Anhui and the Kuomintang Uprising with German Aid alone. However Cao and his advisors, Gao Lingwei among them, still suggests that a strong League and a strong relationship with Germany is the way forward for progress."
 qielepcollapse.12.a: "The die is already cast"

 qielepcollapse.13.t: "The Moment of Truth"
 qielepcollapse.13.d: "With the tensions escalating to a breaking point between Governor Chen Tiaoyuan and Marshal Qi Xieyuan, a series of regular skirmishes has bloated into open battle along the Yangtze on the outskirts of Nanjing. With the initial battle resulting in a League Army victory, Governor Chen has launched a full scale offensive, timed with Uprisings in the MinGan insurrection zone, and the prospect of intervention from Shandong province.\n\nWith the League War in full swing, the time has come for the Jade Marshal and President Cao to honour the commitments made to Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, and support a limited intervention for the anti-concessionist movement."
 qielepcollapse.13.a: "Our troops march south to defend China!"

 qielepcollapse.14.t: "The Moment of Truth"
 qielepcollapse.14.d: "With the tensions escalating to a breaking point between Governor Chen Tiaoyuan and Marshal Qi Xieyuan, a series of regular skirmishes has bloated into open battle along the Yangtze on the outskirts of Nanjing. With the initial battle resulting in a League Army victory, Governor Chen has launched a full scale offensive, timed with Uprisings in the MinGan insurrection zone, and the prospect of intervention from Shandong province.\n\nWith the League War in full swing, the time has come for the Jade Marshal and President Cao to honour the commitments made to League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan, and support the restoration of order and authority within the League Provinces."
 qielepcollapse.14.a: "We march to restore order!"

 qielepcollapse.17.t: "Popular Support for the President and the Marshal"
 qielepcollapse.17.d: "Following President Cao and Marshal Wu's decision to attack the League of Eight Provinces, Cao himself has chosen to make a public appearance and statement on the Government's conduct and intention behind the decision. Whilst Cao himself holds reservations about burning the bridges to Germany so resolutely, he nonetheless is staunch in carrying his Presidential duty.\n\nBroadcast from a balcony in the Forbidden City to a crowd gathering below, Cao was adjourned by the Emperor, the Emperor's brother, Pujie, and Wu Peifu himself. Notable amongst many other speeches held in the same location, this particular one was transmitted over the radio — a first in China.\n\nCarrying himself with a steeled vigour, President Cao called for the citizens of China to rally together. \"For a whole century of humiliation have we suffered and lamented under foreign oppression! For too long have we been lapdogs to the whims of the British, Japanese, French and Germans! But no more! Today we stand defiant, casting off the shackles of imperialists with our first step into true independence! No more shall we be in the iron grasp of the Kaiser! No more shall we suffer indignity, and no more shall the Chinese be second-class in their own homes! Saying this once and for all, China is free once again!\"\n\nMet with resounding applause, cheers and the sound of bugles, sections of the speech with Cao and Wu's face were plastered over newspapers, pamphlets and magazines all over the nation. Similarly, the intellectual societies and book clubs have raised their token support for our regime."
 qielepcollapse.17.a: "A free China free of Imperialism!"

 qielepcollapse.18.t: "The Peking-Kommission Withdraws from Beijing!"
 qielepcollapse.18.d: "Immediately following President Cao's incendiary speech, plumes of smoke began to emerge from the streets outside the German embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission. A vast mob had formed outside the gates, chanting anti-concession slogans and burning German-made clothes, furniture, and even a hastily-constructed effigy of the Kaiser.\n\nWith the military police swiftly arriving to prevent the scene from turning into a massive diplomatic dispute, the German bureaucrats in the Peking-Kommission have, through their voices in the Prosperity League, announced to the Assembly the immediate withdrawal of the Commission, and the rather unfortunate disbandment of the majority of their support programs for the Government.\n\nWhilst a serious blow for our relationship with Germany, and of great concern for President Cao and Minister Gao Lingwei, it has dealt an even more significant attack on the Prosperity League within the Assembly. With the political grouping all but losing their primary backer and source of funding, a large chunk of their assemblymen have defected to the Political Science Clique, experiencing a resurgence in independent, middle-class liberal members and support."
 qielepcollapse.18.a: "A small price to pay for National Salvation."

 qielepcollapse.19.t: "Drama in the Assembly"
 qielepcollapse.19.d: "Listening to Cao Kun's request and intervening in the League War on behalf of the League itself, many within the assembly and inner Zhili circles were all the more aware that such a choice was bound to be an unpopular one. With the broad populace roused up by the anti-concessionist intellectuals, Chen Tiaoyuan's defiance, and the anti-imperialist sentiments that have remained a continuous undercurrent for years, it was nonetheless decided that the storm can be weathered to preserve the special relationship with Germany.\n\nGranted the entirely unenviable job of delivering the news of their inervention to the Assembly, Cao rather reluctantly called forth an Assembly meeting to officialise the intervention on behalf of the League. With Minister Gao Lingwei and Minister Wang Kemin standing with him, Cao began: \"My dear cherished friends, I gathered all of you here today to convey to you rather important new concerning the Government's decision in regards to the unrest in the South\". The assembly perking up with bated breath, he continued. \"Marshal Wu, his command staff and the cabinet have all elected to support League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan in his struggles against the rebellious province of Anhui and its traitorous Governor Chen Tiaoyuan. With our limited intervention marching south as we speak, it is expected that a quick, decisive and total vict-\".\n\nCao would cease his speech as members of the Young China Party stood up and silently started to march out of the hall. Soon after, they were followed by members of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, the Independents and even some members of the Zongshe Party. Appearing somber, Cao would glance at the few remaining Harmony Association and Prosperity League members remaining within the Assembly. Stunned, Cao put down his papers."
 qielepcollapse.19.a: "A deafening weight on his conscious."

 qielepcollapse.20.t: "Gifts of the Prosperity League"
 qielepcollapse.20.d: "Exiting the Assembly Hall carrying himself in a mixture of fury and consternation, the President would bark orders at his assistants and Minister Gao, clearly aiming to find methods in which he can reprimand the protesting politicians of the Assembly. Nonetheless, as he exited the hall he would be swarmed by reporters, and members of the Prosperity League.\n\nQuick to congratulate the President, they produced various luxuries from the German Ecomic World. Rhenish Wine, Cuban Cigars, and other foreign delicacies were offerred to Cao and his assemblymen. Yet met with distant glances and even scorn, few participate in their \"Prosperous\" goodwill.\n\nIn light of the usual dour-faced Manchu nobles who would normally greet the President oustide of the building, German bureaucrats and representatives from the Southern Zhili kleptocracy welcomed the President with open arms, dressed in the latest Berlin finery and offering even more exorbitant gifts to Harmony Association lawmakers, the likes of Wang Chengbin and Cao's faction within the military would quickly whisk the President away, allowing him to escape the embarassment."
 qielepcollapse.20.a: "Contempt from the nation, contempt from the people."

 qielepcollapse.21.t: "Indecisiveness and Inaction"
 qielepcollapse.21.d: "With the Central Governments decision to back neither the League nor the Anti-Concessionist Revolt in the League War, the Chaos that has gripped the nation's popular masses for the past weeks has developed into near anarchy. With initial silence from both the Marshal and President, small protests began to emerge in the urban centres, spurned on by journalists and intellectuals alike. Clamouring for anti-concessionist intervention, the deafening silence would continue. As a result, the few gatherings would develop into blazing street protests, infernos of popular anger directed at the blood being spilt on the Yangtze.\n\nConvening behind closed doors for numerous days, it was decided that some sort of response was necessary. Sitting at his desk with a microphone pointed at his face, and hundreds of thousands tuning in all across the nation, President Cao Kun would, evidently reluctantly, announce that the Government will not deign to grant any support to either Qi Xieyuan or Chen Tiaoyuan, citing dissatisfaction with both men and their conduct.\n\nWith the protests turning into an inferno of dissent, Beijing and other major cities have become seized by the unrest, utterly paralysed. With both the Germans and people against the government, a sense of dismay has overtaken the Assembly. Near total denunciation of our government lead to our downfall once before, and it is possible it will do so again. With the military police under Wang Yujia having been sent to ensure order, it is perhaps only a moment of time before the situation deteriorates further."
 qielepcollapse.21.a: "And to think we thought we had learnt our lesson..."

 qielepcollapse.22.t: "Anqing Is Victorious!"
 qielepcollapse.22.d: "Great news has been telegrammed to President Cao and Marshal Wu! With the guns in Nanjing having mostly fallen silent, it would appear that Governor, now the newly inducted League-Marshal, Chen Tiaoyuan has successfully ousted Qi Xieyuan's corrupt kleptocratic government, with the German investors, businessmen and Southern Zhili demagogues having either fled to the Legations, German East Asia, or folded into governments more accepting.\n\nSecuring control over territories that are on the periphery of Anhui province, our support in the war no doubt served utterly crucial in Chen's swift victory over the League. Whilst unrest and fighting still continues on in other parts of the former League's territories, the Central Government has earned itself a steadfast ally within China, firmly integrated into our sphere of influence."
 qielepcollapse.22.a: "Fantastic work Chen!"

 qielepcollapse.23.t: "Nanjing Is Victorious!"
 qielepcollapse.23.d: "Great news has been telegrammed to President Cao and Marshal Wu! With the guns in Nanjing having mostly fallen silent, it would appear that League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan has successfully ousted Chen Tiaoyuan's unstable, illegitimate and chaotic regime, with the firebrand anti-concessionists, radicals and intellectuals of Chen's government having fled to neighbouring provinces, or even the Kuomintang.\n\nSecuring control over territories that are on the periphery of Nanjing province, our support in the war no doubt served utterly crucial in Qi's swift victory over the rebellious upstarts. Whilst unrest and fighting still continues on in other parts of the former League's territories, the Central Government has earned itself a steadfast, if ideologically corrupted, ally within China, firmly integrated into our sphere of influence."
 qielepcollapse.23.a: "Stability ensured under the League-Marshal!"

 qielepcollapse.24.t: "Refugees Flee League Chaos"
 qielepcollapse.24.d: "With widespread unrest sweeping the League of Eight Provinces, Governor Li Jichen of Henan and Xiao Yaonan of Hubei have telegrammed to President Cao and Marshal Wu, informing them both of increasing numbers of refugees flooding into their provinces, requesting any possible governmental response or assistance. Although it initially started as a trickled, over the course of the last few days the flow has dramatically increased, with whole families fleeing the explosive tornado of violence and banditry.\n\nSending further followup telegrams thereafterwards, the Governors have indicated to the Cabinet that after sending their men to organise and interview the refugees, it would turn out that the authority within the League provinces has collapsed far more than what was previously believed. Furthermore, they have requested from Beijing additional food and supplies to handle all of the refugees. Marred by inefficiences in bureaucracy, provincial government and insufficient finances, any support that the Cabinet deigns to provide would be of great cost, even if it is the humane course of action."
 qielepcollapse.24.a: "Terrible news. Send the supplies."
 qielepcollapse.24.b: "With a heavy heart, we must refuse."

 qielepcollapse.25.t: "Bloodbath on the Yangtze!"
 qielepcollapse.25.d: "In spite of their best efforts, the influx of refugees to the southern provinces has prove ntoo much to handle. The Governors themselves have sent numerous telegrams to the Cabinet and President requesting additional assistance to alleviate their overwhelmed governments. Following a province-wide declaration of martial law made in Hubei, Governor Xiao Yaonan has ordered his troops to shut down all bridges and roads leading into the province from the League's former territory, denying all entry to all refugees, A large number of them, dessicated, homeless and angry, began to mass at a bridge over the Yangtze River on the outskirts of Wuhan.\n\nInsisting on entry into the province, it initially began as a peaceful protest, rallying for proper responsible government action. However it quickly escalated into a borderline full-scale riot, as refugees began to react violently against Xiao's troops, chucking rocks at the border guards. Eventually a group of men who had somehow armed themselves with stolen weapons — perhaps due to the carelessness of Xiao's troops — began to shoot at the border guards, who responded by opening fire, first warning shots, and then at the opposing gunmen. Those not actively participating in the fighting fled, stampeding other refugees and leaving their friends or family for dead on the bridge. Such grisly events have been repeated up and down our border with the League, Sichuan and Shandong, as mobs of refugees fleeing civil war and suffering find their way into even more bloodshed."
 qielepcollapse.25.a: "A calamity! The horror!"

 qielepcollapse.26.t: "Southern Governors Cut Contact"
 qielepcollapse.26.d: "With the violence within the League escalating daily, the governors of Yunnan and Guangdong, [YUN.GetLeader] and [GXC.GetLeader] have all but stopped responding to official government requests for information and status reports on the events unfolding within their territories. They have long despised our government, with both being similarly opposed to what they view as petty Warlords stretching their authority too far and corrupt bureaucrats too foolish to see the light — even to the point that Governor [YUN.GetLeader] waged a war in conjunction with Fengtian not too long ago. Whilst not unexpected, and in-fact quite foreseeable given the circumstances, this represents perhaps the final nail in the coffin regarding their official demeanour in regards to our government.\n\nMany in the Zhili's inner circle fear that this heralds a complete collapse of our authority, and news from out of Shanxi Province further confirmed these fears. The traitorous Feng Yuxiang, having once been an integral member of the Zhili Clique himself, was ousted from his control in Beijing in 1926. Exiled to Shaanxi once the Ma Governors of the Northwest came to their senses, he has formally denounced the actions of our government in what is now being internationally termed the \"Yangtze Incident\" earlier in the week. Referring to the recent events unfolding between the provinces of Hubei, Henan and our de-facto land of Shandong and Shaanxi.\n\nDeclaring our government completely unfit, with \"no capacity to rule China\", his nominal ally in Taiyuan, our estranged Governor Yan Xishan, has decried the violence as nothing more than barbarity but has stopped short of condemning the Cabinet, Wu or Cao personally. Clearly not willing to compromise his neutrality. Nonetheless, it is clear that the national order so hard fought for is heavily breaking down."
 qielepcollapse.26.a: "The vast inferno of rage devours us."

 qielepcollapse.27.t: "A Letter Of Thanks From Governor Chen"
 qielepcollapse.27.d: "Writing in his most eloquent calligraphy and finest ink, Governor Chen has addressed a letter writing his sincere thanks to Marshal Wu Peifu and President Cao, complimenting the Cabinet and Ministries in their dedication and consolidation of Chinese Solidarity. Assuring Beijing of his intentions to truly prioritise the defence of Chinese sovereignty, he has declared the end of Western interference in the Yangtze Valley, lavishly affirming the government's belief in Chinese unification and the ejection of foreign imperialists forces with which they face.\n\nReacting rather reserved in private circles, Wu and Cao conferred a mutual appreciation of relief at the stabilisation of the situation. With the securing of a popular Governor within the League provinces, perhaps a new era of prosperity free of imperialist influence is but on the horizon."
 qielepcollapse.27.a: "Quite the charmer, isn't he."

 qielepcollapse.28.t: "Betrayed by the \"Fool\""
 qielepcollapse.28.d: "In light of the Central Government's attempts to coax and welcome Governor Chen into the Zhili fold, through diplomatic manoeuvering on Cao's front, financial aid from Wang Kemin's banks and military aid from the Jade Marshal, it would appear that Governor Chen has rebuffed our attempts to parley. Growing increasingly distant and out of our reach in our recent contacts.\n\nOne of our own border guards discovered refugees arriving in our lands, carrying pamphlets from the infamous Japanese paramilitary Black Dragon Society. Now in the vacuum of silence from Anqing's leaders, it would appear further disturbing impressions are upon us. Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang Province, infamous for his association with the Black Dragons, has been spotted in Anqing by other refugees. Our intelligence operatives highly suspect that the Governor is attempting to not only betray President Cao, Marshal Wu and the Emperor, but also that of the Chinese nation itself by establishing contacts with Japan's intelligence ring."
 qielepcollapse.28.a: "Damnable Japanese!"

 qielepcollapse.29.t: "Anqing Is Defeated!"
 qielepcollapse.29.d: "Despite their convictions to anti-concessionism, despite their patriotism, despite their valour, it would appear that the noble forces of Governor Chen Tiaoyuan have been utterly crushed and repelled from their home province. With his provincial government all but destroyed, the \"Fool\" General reportedly is rumoured to have died in the fighting, or otherwise fled into the shadows of the urban underworld, or even that of any regime that will accept him.\n\nAs for his lieutenants and intellectuals that backed him, they too have followed a similar fate, fleeing to Hunan or otherwise. Whatever the fate of these men may be, it is a grave, disastrous day for our government, as the victory of the anti-concessionist movement is something many of our leading officers, politicians and intellectuals had placed stakes upon.\n\nWithout Chen, we are left with only potentially hostile regimes to control some of China's most profitable and well developed provinces, leaving a serious security threat on our direct periphery."
 qielepcollapse.29.a: "You were a brave man Chen, defeated by ambition."

 qielepcollapse.30.t: "Nanjing Is Defeated!"
 qielepcollapse.30.d: "Having all but staked our government's finances, national credibility and legitimacy under the pretenses of supporting the continuation and stability of reliable government within the League, it would appear that it has all been for naught. Despite Qi's extensive support from both our erstwhile German allies and our own capabilities, he has managed to fumble it all into the pit of despair.\n\nWith his machinations behind his rise to power coming to light, it would appear that Qi's ambition was his ultimate downfall. Desiring the League for himself, he would inadvertently doom not just himself but his men alongside him. With his kleptocrats fleeing to the League or into our borders, the League-Marshal himself is reportedly missing, fleeing the capital with as much wealth he and his direct entourage could carry.\n\nWithout League-Marshal Qi to guard our flank and revive the South Zhili, Nanjing and the League provinces are beholden to only nefarious and hostile regimes, all with machinations on Beijing."
 qielepcollapse.30.a: "You were a crook, but you were our damned crook!"

###- Manchu Coup Event Chain -###
 qiecoup.1.t: "Whispers of Discontent"
 qiecoup.1.d: "With the Zhili's rather delirious decision to stage no official intervention on either side in the League of Eight Provinces collapse, amongst the mass rioting and discontent small groups from across the whole political spectrum have begun to gather in secret. Behind closed doors, the intellectual circles of Beijing forment a strain of anti-Zhili sentiment, and in particular displeasure at the conduct of Wu Peifu and Cao Kun in the crisis.\n\nThe resurgent Chinese Syndicalist Party under Li Dazhao conjures an undercurrent of worker and union strikes, the Endeavour Intellectuals have begun a public campaign of discrediting what they perceive as a government not prioritising the people. The Young China Party and Chinese Empire Reform Association, initially merely criticising government inaction, has contributed to the worsening violence in the streets, with many considering open revolt.\n\nWith the frequent intermingling of leadership, theorists, intellectuals and other socialites, a broad shaky coalition has developed. Comprised of Manchu nobles from the Zongshe Party, ultranationalists from the Young China Party, reformists within the CERA, and an assortment of some Zhili commanders, notably Xing Shilian, who have become distasteful of lack of promotion within Zhili circles. This loose group has begun to speak clandestinely with one another, plotting to overthrow the Republic, and in-some form restore the Emperor to official power. Albeit that latter point remains contested amongst the likes of the YCP."
 qiecoup.1.a: "Keep an eye on this..."

 qiecoup.2.t: "A Clandestine Meeting"
 qiecoup.2.d: "Following through the urban sprawl of Beijing, through the nooks, crannies and alleyways, in the basement of a shady Beijing bar lies an unusual scene. Usually a cover for revolutionary activities, the usual gathering would be radicals, intellectuals and young firebrands plotting against not just the Zhili and monarchy, but for a revolution. Instead a rather strange, unusual assortment of individuals dedicated to overthrowing the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding have assembled.\n\nFirst and perhaps most pivotal, is that of Aisin-Gioro Pujie, the Emperor's own brother, and noted face of the Zongshe Party. Adjourned with him is that of Aisin-Gioro Xiqia, one of the few Manchu commanders allowed to command any significant margin of troops. Next to them lies influential businessman and Rural Reconstruction aficionado Y. C. \"Jimmy\" James Yen, a leading theorist and pioneer behind local rural education efforts. Accompanying him is that of Wu Xianzi, one of the more young guard members of the CERA. Across from him sits Xing Shilian, an army officer who has defected to the Zhili side in the 3rd ZhiFeng war, but has since become disgruntled at his lack of advancement under Wu Peifu.\n\nRealising they are dwarfed by military resources, bureaucratic control and with broad national disposition against the monarchy, the plotters have concluded that if their coup is to succeed, it is absolutely necessary to parley with a neighbouring warlord clique for assistance.\n\nTheir options before them are limited, with only prospective allies lying in Shandong, or Shanxi. Yet after much deliberation, they all decide upon..."

 qiecoup.2.c: "There is no one to turn to..."

 qiecoup.3.t: "A Request to Governor Yan"
 qiecoup.3.d: "An unusual letter has arrived from a courier wearing Imperial robes this morning. Claiming to be a minor noble, this young man brings astonishing news. A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to Governor Yan Xishan for help. Their plan is audacious and the messenger could hardly conceal his excitement.\n\nNonetheless, Governor Yan is no stranger to bold moves, and across the three and a half decades of his rule he has seen plenty of such schemes fall flat. Several times in Beijing no less. With Feng Yuxiang already causing trouble in Yan'an and this plot only in its infancy, there is considerable risk in placing his weight behind this endeavour. At the very least, it will upend the fragile peace that has been struck between the Shanxi clique and the central government. But sometimes being bold is the only way to survive, and with the situation in Northern China in flux, perhaps there is no harm at least hearing them out."
 qiecoup.3.a: "We need more proof this plot will work."
 qiecoup.3.b: "Refuse outright. This is too risky."

 qiecoup.4.t: "A Request to Governor Qu"
 qiecoup.4.d: "An unusual letter has arrived from a courier wearing Imperial robes this morning. Claiming to be a minor noble, this young man brings astonishing news. A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to Governor Qu for help. With absolutel astonishment, their audacious plan practically gleamed from the messenger's excitement.\n\nOstensibly a man that desires stability and good, moral governance to the utmost, Qu Yingguang's recent establishment of his rule over his beloved home province of Shandong has enabled such opportunities for a power play. Aiding such a plot could see a full confirmation of Qu's Governorship of Shandong, and similarly set the stage for his desired, strong Central Government, with Qu at its side. Yet the reasons to refuse are many, and pressing. Never one to kowtow to another Clique, and with continuing sympathies to his old Anhui brethren, Qu is a veteran republican and bled on the frontlines of Xinhai.\n\nBut there remains an opportunity here nonetheless, and with the situation in Northern China in flux, this could be the necessary power play to be propelled to national leadership."

A group of Manchu princes, reformers, and disgruntled military officials are secretly plotting to overthrow Marshal Wu Peifu and restore Emperor Puyi! They are apparently seeking external aid and have come to Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran for help. How do we respond?"
 qiecoup.5.a: "Of course! For the glory of the Qing!"
 qiecoup.5.b: "Refuse. This is too risky."

 qiecoup.6.t: "Governor Yan's Response"
 qiecoup.6.d: "Governor Yan has replied to our request, in his usual charismatic but wily manner - showering gifts and charm upon the young messenger we sent to the extent observers would think him as another friendly old grandpa. But beneath that mask, the man asserted his dominance and cunning. Treating the noble like the many others who have come before him asking for a favour, his jovial demeanour thinly veiled his calculating nature as the decades-reigning \"Model Governor\" read his mark.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, as our representative quickly relayed a message home to his fellow conspirators in Beijing, the terms were unambiguous. Yan Xishan already holds a distinguished (if distrusted) position as a Governor within Wu Peifu's system, and he has little to gain backing our risky proposal unless we offer him something greater. Far greater. Although he took pains to never outright say it, it is clear that he expects full and autocratic powers if our plot does succeed.\n\nFurthermore, he expects proof that our plot can succeed, that it is something more than a pipe dream of spoiled aristocrats out of touch with political reality. Our messenger, despite playing the role of a naive appeaser, was quite percipient: he warns that although Yan is extremely ambitious, his ambition is tempered by his pragmatism. Still, it would be hard for a man like him to resist the tantalising prospect of national control. As we craft our response, it is critical that we reel in our target. The Governor can be mercurial as he is calculating, and what we say will likely determine his response."
 qiecoup.6.a: "Play on his ambition, emphasise his future role as \"Master of China\"."
 qiecoup.6.b: "Play on his fears of instability, emphasise the danger the Zhili pose."

 qiecoup.7.t: "The Plotters Promise Power"
 qiecoup.7.d: "We received a response from our contacts in Beijing, outlining their case for our support. In a secretive meeting attended by only Yan's select advisors, the message was read to the Governor. In it, the Manchu plotters, apparently backed by the Emperor himself, have bestowed upon us flowery praise and adulation as the heroic leader China needs to vanquish the treacherous Wu Peifu. They stress all the good that we could do for the Chinese nation, driving out the foreign imperialists and bringing the ideas we have developed in our \"Model Province\" nationwide. All of this, we would accept the role as Imperial Commissioner and Commander in Chief of the Imperial Army.\n\nThe letter continued on with extensive details of the preparations being made in Beijing, but by then the Governor had clearly made up his mind. A faint smile was on his face, which would have been unnoticeable if those present had not known him for years. More noticeable was the glean in his eyes, one clearly rapt with soaring ambitions. His advisors were quick to match his mood as the Governor took the time to think in silence, stressing the opportunities this coup will bring to at the very least cut the Zhili down to size, the need for stability across the Central Plains, the likelihood for the plot to succeed. At last, Yan put his hand up to silence them and made his opinion known:"
 qiecoup.7.a: "It was a happy day-dream, but no more than that."
 qiecoup.7.b: "When the nation calls, we shall rally to its banner!"

 qiecoup.8.t: "The Plotters Promise Stability"
 qiecoup.8.d: "We received a response from our contacts in Beijing, outlining their case for our support. In a secretive meeting attended by only Yan's select advisors, the message was read to the Governor. In it, the Manchu plotters, apparently backed by the Emperor himself, has painted a picture of a nation in peril - destabilised by the foolish leadership of the drunken Cao Kun and the scheming Wu Peifu. Without order, the nation will soon fall in anarchy, and the letter was very heavy in Confucian themes. In these times, a strong, wise hand must step up to the role of Imperial Commissioner to lead the armies of the Empire against those that would destroy it. That man, is the \"Model Governor\" of Shanxi, Yan Xishan.\n\nBefore any of his advisors could get a word in, all paid close attention to Yan's mood. The Governor had a dour expression as the room sat in silence, the cogs in his mind turning. All of his old retainers were quick to pick up upon what he wanted to hear as they began denouncing the letter - its lack of practicality, the instability it would cause, the risks it poses for our power, the hypocrisy of a foreign-imposed Emperor condemning Wu Peifu's collaboration with the Germans. Still with a contemplative expression, the Governor at least makes his opinion known:"
 qiecoup.8.a: "This plan is the idle talk of spoiled princes."
 qiecoup.8.b: "These princes need a wise hand to guide them."

 qiecoup.9.t: "Our Request was Refused!"
 qiecoup.9.d_yan: "Although our message was clear about the pressing national need for Governor Yan's intervention, his reply was nothing but a curt refusal and the prompt cutting of all contact between us and Taiyuan. Shanxi will not be coming to our aid, and they did not even have the decency to explain why. We can only guess however, in retrospect. It seems that the Governor has little faith in the ability of our coup to succeed, and he has quickly dismissed us as a group of spoiled aristocrats and dreamers. Instead, it appears that Shanxi will be retreating back into isolation, daring the Zhili to retaliate.\n\nWorse yet, it appears Wu Peifu has caught wind of these attempts through a disheartened plotter, who tipped off the Marshal following Yan's refusal. In his final message to us, the Governor made it clear that he will not be harbouring any of us in his province as fugitives, leaving us to our fate. Some speculate that we were betrayed to Wu Peifu by Yan himself, now washing himself of this situation. Not that it matters anyway, as our conspiracy collapses before our very eyes!"
 qiecoup.9.d_qu: "Our desperate plea appeared to have outright failed! Despite preying upon Governor Qu's desire to have his rule officialised within Shandong, he has outright refused any assistance! Even worse, Qu has arrested the messenger we sent to Jining, clearly showcasing their hostility to our attempt. With the ceasing of all contact between Qu and the plotters, it is clear that Shandong will not be coming to our aid. Our belief, in retrospect, is that Qu valued his Republican beliefs far more than any presumptive power in Beijing politics. Dismissing us as a group of jumped up aristocrats and monarchist sympathisers.\n\nWith Governor Qu focusing on his rule within Shandong, it would appear that Marshal Wu, Wang and Cao have all managed to track down our coup following the turnover of the arrested messenger to Beijing. In his final message to us, the Governor made it clear that he will not be harbouring any of us in his province as fugitives, leaving us to our fate. Some speculate that we were betrayed to Wu Peifu by Qu himself, now washing himself of this situation. Not that it matters anyway, as our conspiracy collapses before our very eyes!"
 qiecoup.9.d_zhang: "Honoured Teacher Zhang has refused our request! You should never see this unless you're playing MP and your friend is being a dick. Tough break buddy."
 qiecoup.9.a: "Damn it! We blew our one shot! Our one opportunity!"

 qiecoup.10.t: "Yan Accepts Our Offer"
 qiecoup.10.d: "After some deliberations, Governor Yan Xishan has announced his support for our cause in a humble message dedicating the resources of himself, his army and his province to the common Chinese national unification. Beneath this outwardly humble demeanor, however, it is clear that Yan is preparing to leverage his status as the muscle of our planned coup to ensure his own leadership of the nation - swapping out Wu Peifu for himself. Whether or not he will be any better than the previous tyrants we have served under and whether he will share his new found power will have to wait for another day as the preparations begin.\n\nIn northern Shaanxi and the neighbouring Shanxi province, Yan has assured us that he will enlist the support of Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun. Nonetheless, he also emphasised that these radical traitors are nothing more than a means to an end. His own provincial army is amassing to our west, preparing to strike north of the Yellow River to quickly connect with our own forces. Already scouts are being sent out into eastern Shanxi and southern Shaanxi to destabilise Zhili control over the areas.\n\nWith the coup underway, the die has been cast. Either we will rid Beijing of these Zhili traitors once and for all, or we will meet our doom in their hands."
 qiecoup.10.a: "Let us hope this works!"

 qiecoup.11.t: "Qu Accepts"
 qiecoup.11.d: "Reflecting on his options, Governor Qu Yingguang has announced his support for our cause in a concerted telegram dictating the dedication of his province's resources, army and of himself to ensure Northern Chinese on the Central Plains. Hidden beneath this veil however, it is increasingly transparent that Qu is planning to utilise his new premier status within our planned coup to ensure his position both in Shandong, and in the leadership of the nation, taking on the reigns that President Cao currently fulfills. Whether or not he will be any better than the previous tyrants we have served under and whether he will share his new found power will have to wait for another day as the preparations begin.\n\nWith ostensible ties to the Zhili and Anhui cliques, Qu's confidence in our plot is a watershed moment in political intrigue. With the enlistment of the support of the rural masses in Shandong through the Yiguandao and Guiyidao, Qu has emphasised that he will be the kingmaker in the Chinese political order. WIth his provincial army amassing to our east, preparing to bridge the Yellow River to connect with our own forces lying in wait.\n\nWith the coup underway, the die has been cast. Either we will rid Beijing of these Zhili traitors once and for all, or we will meet a greet bloodletting in their hands."

 qiecoup.12.d: "Honoured Teacher Zhang has accepted the coup plotters request for aid. He agrees to deploy his troops should the Zhili Clique not be fully destroyed in the coup. At the same time, however, he will probably demand concessions once Puyi has been restored to his proper position."
 qiecoup.12.a: "Excellent!"

 qiecoup.13.t: "A Plot is Uncovered!"
 qiecoup.13.d: "A rather bizarre conspiracy has been revealed to Marshal Wu and President Cao! With Liu Menggeng and Wang Yujia debriefing the heads of the Zhili, it would appear that a group of disgruntled Manchu princes, notably the Emperor's brother, amongst others, an assortment of New China Empire Reform Association intellectuals and various Zhili generals such as Xing Shilian have been clandestinely plotting to overthrow the Zhili Clique, and presumably restore Puyi to a position of true power. With our intelligence staff keeping tabs on the various plotters ever since catching wind through a disgruntled member, it would appear that one of their foreign backers has reneged on his support, instead turning to the Cabinet in Beijing, betraying his erstwhile allies.\n\nMarshal Wu has dispatched military police to raid the various safehouse in which the plotters have been meeting, and arrested a rather bewildered Puyi, who was apparently unaware of any plot in the first place! Roaring into action, President Cao Kun went before a stunned assembly, where he announced the charges being brought forth against the plotters.\n\nAllowing time for the information to sink in, and for all Zongshe alongside convicted CERA members to be detained, Cao would follow up with announcing the implementation of a new constitution, intended to be enacted as soon as it is determined as to what its contents pertain. Reportedly overwhelmed with stress, following another attempt on his life, Cao nonetheless received a standing ovation from all remaining Assembly members. With the return of the Beiyang Republic and annihilation of the Qing dynasty, Marshal Wu Peifu has enunciated a period of Martial Law, until a new cabinet can be assembled."

 qiecoup.14.t: "Fate of the Traitors"
 qiecoup.14.d: "Whilst the rounding up of coup plotters continues, and with the Manchu aristocracy all but removed as an existant political force, there now remains the question of how the military establishment should proceed with the punishment of those officers that assisted the coup, or otherwise had ties to the conspiracy. Numbering amongst them most Manchu generals restored to command following the Xuantong Restoration, and some of our less savoury commanders with flexible loyalties, it is undeniable that the Manchu nobles must be detained and exiled.\n\nHowever the curious fate of those Zhili commanders and officers that worked with them remains to be seen. Whilst their actions were utterly reprehensible, the Zhili Guanxi patronage system is not an easy network to buck, and to imprison those who were once our friends, those who fought and bled with us? Losing their skills and knowledge would become quite a detriment to our officer staff."
 qiecoup.14.a: "Like it or not, they are still our comrades."
 qiecoup.14.b: "Even some bonds can be broken."

 qiecoup.15.t: "The Aftermath"
 qiecoup.15.d: "Now that the plotters of the so called \"Manchu Coup\" have been all but dealt with, it is imperative that Marshal Wu, Wang and the Cabinet work towards the reconstruction of good, stable government. Dividing the spoils and delicately maintaining both a civilian, military and internal Zhili balance, the existing cabinet has met behind closed doors with Marshal Wu and his assistant Bai Jianwu to see to the new acting cabinet's formation.\n\nWith Secretary of the Interior Gao Lingwei and Minister of Finance Wang Kemin believed to retain their posts under Cao's request, Yan Huiqing has been recalled to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Alongside him, Marshal Wang Chengbin has continued as Minister of the Army, with Bai Jianwu becoming Prime Minister. Minister of the Navy has remained under Admiral Sa Zhenbing, whilst Wang Chonghui has become Attorney General once again, joined by the rather controversial Peng Yunyi as Minister of Education. Filling in as Minister of Transport is Admiral Wu Yulin, rounding off with Director of Agriculture and Commerce as Yuan Naikuan.\n\nWith a new cabinet comprised of strong, experienced political heavyweights, it is hoped that this cabinet will survive longer than most Beiyang cabinets. Setting their eyes to the future, it is reported that Cao and Wu intend to host a Constitution Drafting Committee, inviting only the most premier minds of the Chinese Republic."
 qiecoup.15.a: "We need to create a legitimate government!"

 qiecoup.16.t: "Ominous Troop Movements"
 qiecoup.16.d_yan: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shanxi Province over the last few days. It appears the troops are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of Shanxi. Further west, in the adjacent Shaanxi, Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun have also been reported as active - once more the \"Traitor General\" dares to threaten us along with his coterie of socialist agitators. Like ghosts of our past, the two warlords once more come back to haunt us, having been bested by Wu Peifu's genius a few years ago during the Fourth Zhifeng War and Kuomintang Northern Expedition respectively.\n\nAn attack from them in these turbulent times to try and regain their lost lands in the north and west would not be out of character for the two, perhaps emboldened by the collapse of our allies to the south. Still, this is brazen, even for them. Both had seemed content to lick their wounds behind the natural fortress the Taihang and Luliang Mountains provide, festering in their pathetic squalor for decades in relative peace. Something definitely triggered this response, Cao Kun insists, it has to be. Although his poor treatment during his imprisonment by Feng Yuxiang no doubt contributes to his paranoia, perhaps he is on to something here."
 qiecoup.16.d_qu: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shandong Province over the last few days. It appears that large formations of troops are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the river crossings out of the peninsula. Within the East, it would appear that the Yiguandao and Guiyidao are rallying their followers for some sort of great conflict.\n\nWhilst Qu is the Civil Governor of Shandong province, and has assured the Assembly of his sincere dedication, we are not fools. The Anhui clique never truly died, what with Liang Shiyi's Communications fleeing to the welcoming arms of Zuolin, Qu himself is evidence of its survival. Whilst we declared victory over a swift 5 day operation in the ZhiWan war, they would come back to prominence briefly in the 1924 Beijing Coup, as a compromise between Zuolin and Feng Yuxiang.\n\nOnce again do they threaten our position within Beijing, and an attack from the peninsula during these turbulent times to attempt and recover the entirety of Shandong province, and even take Beijing, would be entirely within their repertoire. Still, Shandong province cannot stand alone, they'd be folding their cards. A nominal ally such as Qu has been situated within Shandong for years, and hasn't budged yet. However Marshal Wang insists that these movements are highly irregular. Reasoning to trust Wang just this once, Wu believes him, due to Wang's experience in plotting the Beijing Coup."
 qiecoup.16.d_zhang: "Unusual troop movements have been reported from Shandong Province over the last few days. It appears that large mobs of Yiguandao militiamen are preparing for some sort of military action on our border, with our informants reporting that supplies and equipment are being stockpiled near the mountain passes out of the peninsula. Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran of the Yiguandao certainly is no ally of the Zhili Clique, and an attack on our territory would not be out of the question for him."

It appears Yan Xishan and several Manchu princes, reformers, and traitorous generals are attempting to overthrow the Zhili Clique and install an imperial dictatorship (ostensibly) under Puyi! With the combined forces of the Shanxi Provincial Army and the Guominjun amassing along our border, it is essential that we dispatch of any fifth columnists within our government before outside forces strike. Any show of weakness will invite further challengers from the northeast and the south, dooming the efforts we have made for decades to stabilise our nation. A quick decisive strike against the treachery in Shanxi is the only way we can assert our authority in face of Sun Chuanfang's disaster. We march on Taiyuan!"

 qiecoup.18.t: "Mysterious Occurrences"
 qiecoup.18.d: "A series of dashing papers and telegrams have reached the desks of President Cao and Marshal Wu. Detailing reports of a series of thoroughly anti-Zhili pamphlets and news articles that have been discovered to be distributed and circulating not just amongst our troops, but the populace too! Encquiring to Wang Yujia as to how the soldiery found themselves in the possesion of such vile material, he could only reply with \"inconclusive\".\n\nTallying his reports, accusations are varied from secret dead drops, to merely fabricating themselves in the middle of the night. Even more worrying is that Commander Xing Shilian has dropped out of contact with Luoyang over the last few hours, alongside a variety of our less ideologically convicted officers. With widespread communication efforts being hampered in far-flung parts of the nation due to radio and telephone outages, Cao and Wu are all too familiar of the embers of a potential coup attempt.\n\nOne question remains. But from who?"
 qiecoup.18.a: "What's going on here?"

 qiecoup.19.t: "A Summons to Beijing"
 qiecoup.19.d: "With Wu and Cao conferring with their advisors on how to process the alarming developments that have occurred over the last few days, an urgent telegram arrived to the President's Office, with a similar one addressed to Wu's headquarters in Luoyang. Signed by the Emperor himself, it would appear that President Cao and Marshal Wu have been summoned to a meeting with the Emperor in the Forbidden City, ostensibly to discuss the matter of the deteriorating state of the country.\n\nWith widespread riots still a daily occurrence, and the urban centres' press in full swing against the incumbent government, there is legitimate reasoning for the Emperor to be concerned, if news has finally reached his court. And while the Emperor technically has the constitutional prerogative to summon his President, this has never occurred before.\n\nWith Wu and Cao suspicious and skeptical, the two are compelled by constitutional duty to appear before the Boy Emperor. Experienced politicians, the most likely case is that Puyi is merely anxious about the state of the country, a separate issue from the massing of soldiers from the Republican Governors threatening us. In resolute agreement, and after Wu calmed Cao over his fears and paranoia of another coup, the two men informed the Emperor of their intentions to present themselves to \"His Imperial Majesty\" later this week."
 qiecoup.19.a: "We've dealt with worse, haven't we Cao?"

 qiecoup.20.t: "The President, the Marshal and the Emperor"
 qiecoup.20.d: "Preparing themselves for all scenarios, Wu and Cao met with eachother outside the Forbidden City, laying out a contingency situation in case Cao's fears are true. Their respective bodyguards, loyal, devout and more than enough to protect the two men, will remain close behind them as they walk to the hall. Afterwards, before entering, they will split, situated opposite the Imperial Guards.\n\nWith an unease resting in the air, the two men bravely marched into, for all terms and circumstances, what was believed to be a trap. Suffering from the sheer weight of the situation, Cao tensely ordered his men to remain outside, with Wu doing the same. Carrying their trump card up their sleeves, and once again with the prospects of losing it all, the Marshal and the President exchanged a glance..."
 qiecoup.20.a: "And they enter the hall..."

 qiecoup.21.t: "The Hammer and the Anvil"
 qiecoup.21.d: "Opening the doors and being welcomed by the Imperial Court, the Marshal and the President stepped gracefully into the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Situated before them, on the Dragon Throne of the Qing Dynasty, \"His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor\". Remaining silent as the men approached, Zheng Xiaoxu, Aisin Gioro-Zaitao and Aisin Gioro-Pujie adjourned the Emperor, insisting that the two men postrate before his majesty. A rather distasteful act for a republican like Wu, he relented, with Cao following afterwards.\n\nAfter a period of blaring stillness, doors elsewhere within the hall burst open, with around a dozen of heavily armed Royal Guards rushing into the room! Surrounding the Emperor, his relatives and his Imperial Minister, they attempted to move forward to detain and arrest Cao and Wu. With Puyi, clearly traumatised and unaware of the situation, rapidly fleeing the room, the Zhili bodyguards placed outside swiftly dispatched the other ceremonial guards, rushing in.\n\nProgressing into an open firefight, Wu and Cao would duck behind pillars, being supplied firearms beforehand, attempting to kill their would be captors. Bullets whizzed back and forth amongst the ancient pillars of the hall, smashing arefacts, wounding bodyguard and imperial soldier alike. However with the guns falling silent, only one side has emerged victorious."

 qiecoup.22.t: "The Emperor Asserts Himself"
 qiecoup.22.d: "Puyi nervously re-enters the room, gazing down at the bullet-riddled bodies of the former Jade Marshal and his mentor, President Cao Kun. Pujie and another small group of Manchu loyalist guardsmen enter as well, all carrying submachine guns. \"Dearest brother - I believe it's time for you to make a speech.\" Puyi turns from the corpses and looks at Pujie. \"I-\" he begins, his voice uncertain. \"I am not sure if I can do that.\" Pujie is about to say something when General Xiqia bursts into the room.\n\n\"My lord! The city is secure!\" He says, kowtowing almost to the ground facing Puyi. \"But Marshal Wang Chengbin and several other Zhili generals have retreated to Luoyang! They are planning to launch a campaign to destroy us and liberate Beijing!\" Pujie moves over to Puyi, placing a stern hand on his shoulder, and whispers in his ear. \"You are the Emperor now - you must act like one!\" Puyi nervously attempts to gather himself. \"I - the Xuantong Emperor, Son of Heaven, formally proclaim any members of the Zhili Clique who do not swear fealty to me by tomorrow no-\" His voice cracks, and he is forced to steady himself. \"Who do not do so by tomorrow noon to be traitors to the Great Qing!\"\n\nPujie, turning to Xiqia, would nod as the Imperial Guardsmen flood out of the hall. Leaving the trembling Emperor alone. With the two corpses of the men he had unwittingly killed."

 qiecoup.23.d: "Exciting news has reached the ears of [ROOT.GetLeader]! Receiving word from Beijing that the planned coup attempt has gone off without a hitch, the once indomitable Jade Marshal and King of Baoding both lay dead! Reportedly killed in a foolish attempt at defiance by engaging in a shootout in the Forbidden City, the Zhili have been sent into disarray! Reportedly Marshal Wang Chengbin is attempting to muster an attempt at defiance within Wu's headquarters within Luoyang, having evacuated all cabinet members and military staff he could from north of the Yellow River.\n\nIt would appear that the Manchu commanders and co-plotters such as Xing Shilian have begun mobilising their forces to destroy the last vestiges of the Zhili Clique! With the old regime one foot in the grave, it is time for us to honour our obligation to the Emperor and the coup, finally eradicating the nation from the perfidious Zhili once and for all."
 qiecoup.23.a: "Destroy the traitors!"

 qiecoup.24.t: "The Countercoup"
 qiecoup.24.d: "Following Cao and Wu's narrow escape from death in the Throne Room, Wu's bodyguards dispersed throughout the palace, gunshots echoing throughout the halls as they encounter sporadic Manchu loyalist resistance. A few minutes later, they burst back into the throne room, dragging a terrified Puyi with them. Wu, standing above the prostrated Puyi, gestures to a bodyguard. Drawing a pistol, he grabs Puyi behind him and leads him to the door. Cao following closely behind. Outside, a small group of courtiers and hangers on have gathered, along with the Emperor's brother, Pujie, and several other Qing nobles. Opening the door to the audience chamber, Wu steps forward, flanked by the Emperor and the President.\n\n\"Your plot has failed, traitors.\" He twists his mouth into a smirk, before gesturing the bodyguard to pull the emperor back into the room. \"One step forward - and the Son of Heaven dies.\"\n\nSecretly, Wu is terrified. But this will not be the first time he has cheated death. \"You will all enter the throne room, where my guards will ensure you are watched over well. President Cao!\" he turns to the head of the Assembly, who at this point is clearly holding back furiosity. \"Take some guards and get over to the Assembly chamber as fast as you can!\" He glances back at Puyi. \"The time has come to end the Empire. China shall be a Republic once more.\"\n\nWith Cao announcing the second deposition of the Qing Empire, and the second ejection of the Manchu from the Forbidden City to the Assembly, his spymasters have begun raiding the plotting rooms and warehouses. A few hours later, once a total inventory of the documents was gathered, it would appear that neighbouring warlords were complicit in the coup! Swift to immediately denounce them as traitors, Cao and Wu have worked to mobilise their forces for total war."

 qiefocus.3.t: "A Fresh Start"
 qiefocus.3.d: "Riding off the wave of patriotism with our resounding support of Chen Tiaoyuan's Anti-Concessionist movement, we have taken the first brave step in ridding the Chinese nation of incessant foreign imperialists and their vile colonial bureaucrats. A cross-national movement experiencing bounds of support from the populace in Guangdong, Shandong, Yunnan, and rather obviously the League territories, various Beiyang politicans close to the Cabinet and President such as Yuan Naikuan, Yuan Shikai's Steward and assistant in Cao Kun's ascension to the President, and that of Bian Shoujing, Speaker of the Assembly have suggested that the President should call forth a variety of new elections to capture this popular sentiment.\n\nConferring with Marshal Wu, exceedingly supportive of the movement, the President declared a new national election to be held across all territories under presumptious control of the Central Government. Theoretically, all literate men in China are eligible to participate but due to local interference, gentry control, warlords and revolutionary movements abound, it is likely expected that the only results to be received will be from the Central Plains. An unfortunate circumstance but nonetheless beneficial for maintenance of our rule.\n\nWith previous elections having seen razor-thin margins, boycotts and other upheaval, and with the body unlikely to shift the dominance of the Harmony Association due to the sheer number of seats under our control, it will nonetheless improve our legitimacy in the long run. Many decry the Beiyang Republic and Assembly as a mere powerless body ruled by autocrats and strongmen, but we can display a true, thriving, Chinese democracy!"

 qiedom.13.t: "The Coup de Grâce"
 qiedom.13.d: "Whilst rather impromptu, the Chinese people still came out in droves during the election campaign held recently. With members of the Prosperity League, Political Science Clique, Independents, Chinese Empire Reform Association, Young China Party and Zongshe all vigorously fighting for the expansion of their power within the assembly, they waged campaigns of political warfare against the vast swathe of Harmony Association candidates. Pulling the strings behind the scenes, Cao Kun's secretaries, assistants and intelligence officers delicately calculated and balanced the success and loss of a variety of candidates.\n\nEither through campaign mishaps, bribes, under the desk support or otherwise, members from Zongshe and the CERA were all tacitly secured victory. With the remnants of the Prosperity League struggling to put up a front in light of the government's anti-concessionist stance, and the YCP, Independents and Political Science buffing our inroads, it would appear that they chose to rather engage in a free-for-all instead. Naturally the Harmony Association campaign was relaxed, and stoic, as our actions still burned vividly in the minds of the populace.\n\nWhilst turnout was (as expected) comparitively low in regards to the overall population, urban centres like Beijing granted us a record number of votes from intellectuals, reformers and others previously more inclined to vote for the opposition. It appears that Marshal Wu's gambit has provided dividends. Robbing us of German support, it has instead granted us the adoration of the Chinese people, and a large deal of political legitimacy and local support.\n\nWith the CERA seizing the majority of rural areas, the YCP performing amicably in the urban centres, Zongshe cornering the Confucian traditionalists and gentry, Political Science scooped up the fledgling middle class, with Independents winning here and there, however none could beat the new majority granted to the Harmony Association. In the aftermath of the victory, Marshal Wu has requested that Cao recall diplomatic genius Yan Huiqing to serve in the new government, with the aim of negotiating China's new precarious situation within the nation. A new popular government, and a new government agenda, the sun shines on the Middle Kingdom once more!"

Outright cutting diplomatic connections and isolating themselves within their perfidious concessions and embassies, they have practically entered a state of absolute siege within our territory. With Cao's inroads bearing no fruit, and fear of the populace reacting violently causing an absolute spiral of the situation, Marshal Wu and his Luoyang faction have pushed for the complete and total resignation from our observer position within the Legation Council.\n\nIntending to call their bluff and signal that the Chinese people are no longer the slaves to the West, the Cabinet drafted a proposal to resign from the council to the assembly, receiving a plurality of support from the politicians all across the spectrum.\n\nWith support of the people, the assembly, and the Marshals, the Diplomatic Corps has officially handed in our resignation to the Legation Council in Shanghai.

 qiefor.86.d: "With the chaos within League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang's decaying empire resulting in the delicate Chinese world order collapsing nationally, it was the initial impression of the Kaiser and his government that our estranged allies within the Chinese Central Government would have maintained course nonetheless. With our minions within the Assembly in the form of the Prosperity League lobbying group, alongside President Cao Kun's distant yet friendly nature with German Officials, there was feasibly no reason for Beijing to tear up the special relationship between our countries for the sake of a few illiterate masses and their discontent.\n\nYet nonetheless the \"Jade Marshal\" and \"King of Baoding\" have pursued a publicly anti-concessionist stance, jeopardising the delicate order we aided in installing in China. Bolstering support for their regime, it has resulted in untenable demands being levied towards the Peking-Kommission, our lobbying arm in Beijing alongside the Prosperity League, insisting that they leave the city.\n\nFacing massive riots outside the gates of their offices, most members have fled to the German concession within neighbouring Tianjin! Our ambassador, on his own initiative, has sent all non-essential staff to Tianjin as well, leaving a skeleton group of consular officials to duel against Beijing's Diplomatic Corps."

While he admitted initially finding the idea of restoring the Boy Emperor, Puyi, anachronistic, he followed that up by enthusiastically endorsing our new anti-concession stance, and Puyi's devotion to the cause. He concluded his speech with admiration for the Zhili leadership. \"An apolitical figurehead can be useful in a modern state. And with Wu Peifu and Cao Kun at the helm of our great nation, we can drive out the foreign scum who have polluted our country, and restore it to greatness!\"\n\nThe speech was well received by intellectuals in Beijing and other urban areas, with many once antagonistic publication outlets now turning in our favour. Behind the veil of the public however, Governor Chen has reminded the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding of the deals they negotiated.

Cleaning shop, ejecting Nanjing Clique bureaucrats and Kuomintang radical sympathisers, he has enjoyed a large degree of autonomy from the Central Government.\n\nAfter the League War concluded, some Zhili generals such as Cai Chengxun insisted on direct integration of Governor Chen's territories into our Central Government, but this has largely been rejected as too rash due to the fragility and instabiliy of our own regime.\n\nIt would appear now hoever that maintaining Chen's autonomy played directly into our hand. He has just recently announced a gigantic reform project for his provinces within the new League, promising major industrial, legal and political reforms. Far sweeping and thoroughly planned, the new was greeted with enthusiasm not just from the many business leaders within his territory, but the people, intellectuals and civil servants amongst both of our lands.

On the surface it is nothing but petty squabbles between warlords, but it has been a long developing strain in relations, primarily pushed on by Sun Chuanfang's belligerent conduct in regards to his superiors. Once he was Wu Peifu's very own protégé, then one of his greatest rivals.\n\nIn regards to the new League-Marshal however, Chen Tiaoyuan, he has begun a concerted effort to mend the divide between the North and South. Whilst eyed with suspicion by our more conservative members such as President Cao, it nonetheless is a breath of fresh air; no longer having to watch out South Eastern flank for the machinations of a kleptocrat.\n\nWith the Luoyang faction most open to the merging of the cliques, a series of junior officers and Jinbao members are resistant, harbouring grudges against Chen's bureaucracy and clique. With potential competition both for government jobs as well as promotion, the governments may become merged on a map, but its clear that the patronage networks will remain estranged.

With his troops having recently developed and learned quite a significant amount in their struggles against the Nanjing Clique, and with our soldiers posessing superior experience with modern equipment, decisive strategy and exemplary tactics, we both have much to gain from this endeavour.\n\nTelegramming a joint response to Chen and his lieutenant, Ma Dengying, Marshals Wu and Wang are expected to meet with League-Marshal Chen and General Ma soon, with their respective divisions in toe."

Yet with Black Monday absorbing most of their attention, we were able to conclude our nationalisation program with nary a peep from the foreigners.\n\nDrawing up plans to distribute factory ownership to a variety of loyal contractors, the industrial contracts have been feuded over by vicious Beijing businessmen, the likes of the Political Science Clique and their contacts, the Harmony Association's businessmen and the Zongshe Party's nobles are engaged in bidding wars for the lucrative German, American and British factories.\n\nAll that remains is to decide upon whom to levy such contracts for. Naturally, there exists our own Harmony businessmen, yet that raises concerns of nepotism, harming our image.

Writing expositive papers, pamphlets and articles in support of our government, of the assembly, and of the Zhili.\n\nA particular favourite of the Jade Marshal, published in a journal originating in the fiercely anti-warlord May Thirtieth Movement, is \"The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence\". A concise tract, it holds up Wu, Cao and Wang's clique as bastions of China's fight against foreign domination, with the Emperor as a powerful symbol of China's modernisation. Zhang Zuolin and his Fengtian government are denounced as foreign parasites, leeching Manchuria's mineral wealth and sending it back to Japan whilst leaving the population impoverished.\n\nGrinning his teeth, the Marshal cannot help but chuckle at the public perception of he and Cao's government. If only they knew. If only they knew the real circumstances, the backroom deals, the daring gambles of political power and military might. Beiyang is a world of cutthroat politics, and whilst he still hopes and longs for a modern, Confucian and Republican China, he must only wait. With unification growing ever closer under the Zhili's auspices, perhaps his chance, someday at least, to oust the Manchu once and for all will dawn.\n\nUntil then, he complies with the Imperial rituals, as does Cao, subtly positioning pieces on the board of the future."

 qieflavor.22.t: "Mending the Military's Generational Divide"
 qieflavor.22.d: "Contrasting with the South, and its revolutionary, radical and youthful military staff and commanders, the Zhili and the North as a whole are of a different generation. Having long maintained a generational gap in the Central Government's officer corps, many of our generals are of an older breed. Born before the upheavals of 1911, and the ensuing Warlord Era, some have even seen the conflict with Japan in 1895, fighting on its battlefields.\n\nParamount to their military conduct is the aura of tradition, superstition and Confucian patronage dynamics. Scarred by the horros of mass violence and unrest that have dominated most of their lives, they are politically flexible and pragmatic, but lean conservative, hoping to restore the stable, supreme China of centuries past. Younger officers, on the other hand, were born in or just before the Warlord Era, embroiled in the revolutionary activities of the Tongmenghui and other movements, they tend to favour more radical political positions.\n\nCounted amongst them are the likes of the Young China Party's strong hold on the radical officers of Baoding, the Political Science Clique's affiliation with those young officers more privy to moderate negotiations with the South, or otherwise are split between allegiances with Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun for example. With the slow reform and erosure of the Zhili Guanxi patronage networks, and the welcoming of fresh blood into the military, many of the younger, more radical officers have begun to support our government, even if angling for their own respective party's influence.\n\nSome of the older generals, skeptical of Wu and Cao's positions regarding the monarchy and German support have also become more supportive of the regime, owing to conversations with their younger subordinates."

 qieflavor.23.t: "The King of Baoding and Jade Marshal, ennobled"
 qieflavor.23.d: "A series of letters have been written, directed towards Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, detailing the Emperor's most humblest gratitude and sincere appreciation for the role the two titans of China's political scene have carried in steering the nation through the series of intense upheaval and struggle in the past few years. Granting them a day of notice, the Emperor appears to desire to announce a new set of noble titles and awards for only the most important members of Chinese society.\n\nRather than the arcane and opaque system used in the pre-restoration Qing, these new ranks follow a model similar to most Western noble titles, most strikingly taking inspiration from the German Empire. The highest rank of these is \"Duke\" (Gong), only granted to those who have \"Given the Utmost Service or Sacrifice for the Emperor and China\". With the first and second recipients of this rather bewildering honour announced, it is none other than that of Marshal Wu Peifu and President Cao Kun — now the Dukes of Qi and Wei respectively.\n\nNot a stranger to the handing out of benign and often inconsequential royal titles, as Yuan Shikai did in 1916 with the declaration of his Hongxian monarchy, making Cao Kun a Count, the duo gracefully accepted the appointments. In a lavish ceremony, Wu and Cao prostrated before the Emperor, solemnly accepting their honorifics, and vowing to continue to protect him and the nation for \"for as long as they drew breath\".\n\nNonetheless practically lying, at least in Wu's part, the Court nonetheless applauded the gentlemen with booming praise and congratulations. Alongside the Marshal and President, various other honorifics have been granted to Cabinet ministers and military staff alike, Marquis Wang Chengbin, Viscount Gao Lingwei, Count Yuan Naikuan, amongst numerous others."

 qieflavor.24.t: "The President and the Emperor"
 qieflavor.24.d: "Following onwards from the intensified, at least in public, relationship between the President, Marshal and Emperor, Cao and Wu's closest aides suggested, in collaboration with some of the Forbidden City's clerks and staff, to conduct a highly publicised event, further cementing the relationship bewteen the Zhili and Emperor. Initially swatting away the idea as nonsensical, Cao managed to persuade Wu to at least acquiesce to the idea, insisting that it is but a harmless display of goodwill and genuine sincerity.\n\nEntering into a highly orchestrated ceremony, passed in advance to a series of Beijing and Wuhan tabloids, Emperor Puyi invited Marshal Wu Peifu and President Cao, as representatives of the Government, to an \"informal\" luncheon within the Forbidden City. Carefully choreographed to look as \"relaxed\" as possible, the trio sat together eating and discussing various matters of importance, including modernising the military, reforming the bureaucracy, scheduling elections and other topics. After the rather brief lunch, the men were joined by the Emperor's brother, Pujie, outside the city for a brief ride on horseback.\n\nCameras recorded the entire spectacle, even when President Cao was nearly bucked from his horse, only being saved by Wu. With the newsreel footage of the event having already been shown in cinemas in the major cities of China, as well as distributed to international agencies, it is sure to display to the world the close, on the surface, relationship between the President, Marshal and the Emperor. Modernised far beyond the Qing forebears."

 qiedom.100.d: "Having circulated the intellectual and Assembly circles of Beijing ever since the League War intervention, rumours have abounded that the aging President Cao Kun has been in preparation to retire for a long time now. Only recently were the murmurs justified with facts when the President made a formal announcement to the Assembly, flanked by the Jade Marshal and Bai Jianwu, of his intention to resign, hanging up the hat for the nation he has steered on and off for two decades.\n\nWhilst unsurprising to many, the assembly still reacted with cross-partisan appreciative applause for the President who had managed to navigate the tumultuous period of recent times. After the conclusion of his audacious speech, delivered with a sort of bittersweet vigour, thoughts and whisphers would dash through the Assembly Hall, considering the potential candidates for a successor. Having followed the patriotic policy of anti-concessionism, many believed that Cao's successor would be a member of Wu's internal Luoyang Zhili faction. Perhaps Zhang Qihuang with his Federalist credidentials as a continuitation of military men casting away the field uniform for the suit and tie, or a prestigious diplomat such as Yan Huiqing, or Gu Weijun, or even Gao Lingwei.\n\nHowever clearly unsurprising within those close to the Jade Marshal, it was decided that in desiring to send a message of a reformed, modern government, it would be Wu's personal assistant, vigorous intellectual and noted progressive amongst Zhili circles Bai Jianwu that would succeed Cao as President. A personal friend of the likes of Li Dazhao, with connections to Hu Shih, Wang Chonghui and other Beijing intellectuals, Bai promulgates a new era of reformed civilian leadership for the government. Receiving genuine support from the intellectuals within the CERA, YCP and independents, it is expected for preparations to inaugarate the President to resume shortly, receiving the backing of the majority of the assembly.\n\nRetiring with grace, it is expected that the jovial old man will entertain his last few years with calligraphy, painting, and overseeing charitable infrastructure efforts. Whilst Cao's faction may have been usurped by his younger protégé's, and Marshal Wang continues to harry Cao to force Wu's resignation too, the Zhili Clique continues to remain dominant.

An ever foxy politician, President Cao has now been tasked with resuscitating strength, hope and belief within his cabinet.\n\nConferring with his cabinet minister Gao Lingwei and \"Cao's Mouthpiece\" Bian Shoujing, Cao has arranged a series of touch-and-go meetings with various senior personnel of the Zongshe Party, in order to ensure their continued faith and loyalty following his speech.\n\nEngaging in tense and tactful debate for what seemed like days, Cao leaned upon the wedge issue of Japanese invasion and intervention, winning the minds of many Manchu nobles, fearful of Fengtian repurcussion and repriesals to their properties and homes. Insisting that German support is required to ensure national integrity, and to maintain the edge against their rivals, a series of younger, hotshot Zongshe members deflected his attempts at diplomacy.\n\nReacting poorly to his overtures, they would prolong the negotiations for hours until finally agreeing upon what basically surmounted to a brazen bribe. Clearly thinking of their wallets rather than of the nation, the younger Manchu nobles were to receive a \"noble pension\" paid out with the express purpose of preserving \"imperial culture\". Lamenting even having to bend the knee to such aristocrats in the first place, Cao nonetheless acquiesced as Minister Gao finished the agreement. Alas, the cutthroat world of Beijing politics survives on the strength of your gold.."

 qiedom.15.d: "The Young China Party, a radical ultranationalist group of modernist reformers and intellectuals joined in vast opposition to syndicalism and socialism of all kinds, reacted with the most prudent hostility towards President Cao's intervention speech. Lambasting the Cabinet, President, Marshals and Ministers alike, Zeng Qi and Li Huang issued a scathing joint statement through their media outlets and Central Executive Committee. Claiming and insisting that the intervention was \"absolute capitulation to foreign imperialist interests, betraying the nation and its people\", they were the first to storm out of the Assembly Chamber in clear protest.\n\nArranging a series of meetings utilising his contacts within Northern Chinese intellectual circles, the President was able to organise a meeting with the rather belligerent party. Having always rather detested Cao, in-part due to his adherence to the old Beiyang political order, and for his role in restoring the monarchy in 1928, the Young China idealogues were initially rather standoffish in their approach.\n\nStubbornly resisting all attempts at negotiation, through Cao's elegant wit and cunning intrigue, he was able to force the ultranationalists to the table, hammering out a deal. They will maintain their loyalty and participation in the assembly in exchange for increased spending for Baoding Military Academy, and the lessening of the government's stranglehold on the media. With a cold sweat now swiftly passing over the President's mind, perhaps the hardest hurdle has been surpassed."

 qiedom.16.d: "Being the last political body to leave the assembly in protest, having been beat by the Young China Party, a few independents, and Zongshe, the Chinese Empire Reform Association is likely to be one of the more difficult parties to convince of our goodwill. Split on the precipice between Xu Qin's more (relatively) conservative Constitutionalist Party, the mantle of Liang Qichao's efforts to modernise Beiyang, and Liang Shuming's Rural Reconstruction Movement, both members of the coalition are bound to necessitate different measures of negotiation.\n\nUsing his wit and opting to tackle the Constitutionalists first, Cao leveraged their capacity to aid in the modernising of the nation through German financing. \"Turning their marks against them\", he was quoted with saying. Convinced of the President's sincerity, as noted by Cao attending these meetings without Minister Yuan Naikuan, Wang Kemin or Gao Lingwei, Xu Qin relented, with the young guard under Wu Xianzi similarly folding.\n\nWith the assistance of the Constitutionalist sect of the coalition, Cao was able to arrange for a meeting with Liang and Y. C. James Yen, one of their leading theorists and financiers. Circulating similar business circles, Yen and the President struck immediate chemistry, with \"Jimmy\", as his friends call him, detailing his theories about Rural Reconstruction in large towards the President. Eventually reaching a compromise, it was decided upon that the Government will begin the gradual nationalisation of various industries within the nation, and the slow erosure of Gentry land dominance within the interior."

With all relevant parties, minus a few Independents who absolutely refused negotiation or contact with Cao or his ministers, affirming their support, the President decided to put that to the test.\n\nCalling forth a meeting within the Assembly, all parties that had taken part in the negotiations of recent times naturally made their appearance, showcasing in earnest their belief and support in what occurred behind closed doors. With Beijing's dysfunctional democracy having its heart restarted once more, the delegates, Cabinet and President can finally resume the delicate art of politicking and mastermind that is the day and night of Beijing.\n\nConferring with Marshal Wu and Marshal Wang over a confidential congregration within the Presidential Palace, the trio shared in alcohol and laughs (if begrudging on Wang's part) in the securing once more of their stable hand at the wheel.

Having fought for the nation since the turn of the century, they have constantly prioritised national integrity, legitimacy and stability. Fighting for Yuan Shikai against the machinations of Cai E's Huguojun, seeking to upend the established order, Cao and Wu would eternally fight for what was the best outcome for the Chinese people.\n\nFighting in Hunan against the Constitutionalists, fighting against the despotism of \"The Tiger of Beiyang\", Duan Qirui, and against Feng Yuxiang's peasant rabble, against the Old Marshal Zhang Zuolin, and finally against the Japanese imperialists that have harried us for so long. With the unification of the nation however, a more pressing matter has become apparent to the Cabinet.\n\nWith our choice in the heat of the moment to maintain course and support our special relationship with Germany, our Diplomatic Corps are now considering the best course of action in regards to continuing said relationship with [GER.GetName]. Whilst we are far from their most important asset within Asia, considering their direct colonies in the region, we may still be able to negotiate a treaty of cooperation and protection. with the potential of dispatching our diplomats under the auspices of V.K.

Exchanging charitable and esteemed greetings with the our government officials who greeted them, [GER.GetSecondInCommand] cabinet and Mr. Koo's diplomatic delegation met behind closed doors, to hash out the specifics of their appearance.\n\nRecently victorious in uniting their nation, the [QIE.GetName] delegations has procured a rather tantalising deal aimed towards our country. Formally requesting a continuation of our \"Special Relationship\" with them, having existed ever since the intervention in 1927, they have also requested a guarantee of their national integrity and independence. This presents to us an interesting opportunity, a pliable, friendly ally in the East, instrumental in defeating Japan, with the additional benefit that we need not interfere in any of their aggressive wars.

With our continued desire to modernise and revolutionise our industries to become truly equal with the West, it is imperative that we utilise any and all possible levers that we can leverage to increase the speed of our efforts.\n\nAlbeit, modernity does not come quickly enough for China to successfully resist roving warlords nor overt imperialism from the west and Japan. Whilst the public decries our work with German companies and capital, it is clear that these industrial tools that we can gain from our special relationship will pave the way for a more solid industrial foundation for the Chinese nation,\n\nAs we look forward to further expanding our iron, steel and cool arteries across the countryside, German engineering continues to collaborate with native Chinese experts to guide the way, however members of the assembly, notably the Young China Party, have raised concerns that this relationship could prove to be China's undoing, resulting in a dependence on Germany, not co-existence. Therefore, a constantly present question on the minds of the Cabinet is the role in which German Industrial advisors are to play within the nation.\n\nSome within the cabinet, notably Gao Lingwei and Wang Kemin have suggested to the President that they should lease contracts for far reaching and expansive infrastructure projects. Others, notably Cao's Yuan Naikuan and Speaker Bian Shoujing have suggested only maintaining contracts for railway lines, nothing more.

Soft music could be heard from within, and wisps of smoke rose from the windows.\n\n\"What do you reckon - drugs or girls?\" Zhang's second-in-command asked. \"Both, and I'll buy your next lunch if I'm wrong.\" Zhang stamped out his cigarette as he whistled loudly. Half a dozen men burst open the front door and streamed into a dimly lit hall.\n\n\"Police! - don't move!\" Zhang shouted, as men and women in various states of undress lurched into the hall, yelling and crying. The second-in-command frowned as Zhang held up a sack of opium. \"Guess you're buying your own lunch tomorrow.\"\n\nThe policemen fanned out through the building, arresting the prostitutes and drug dealers. This was a good haul. Opium, hemp, and even cocaine, a German luxury, were found in droves. Just as Zhang was about to order his men to drag the prostitutes and their clients back to the station, one of his junior officers called out. \"Sir! You're going to want to see this!\" Zhang could barely believe his eyes - amongst the line-up of clients, a tall, foreign, white man stood out like a sore thumb. \"The German Legation will hear about this!\" he said in poorly accented Chinese. \"I have friends in high places!\"\n\nArresting the disgusting man would give the central government some much-needed leverage in curbing German influence, but at the same time be politically costly for the President and Marshal. On the other hand, letting a man that so flagrantly abused his position within a foreign delegation to take part in the vile underworld of China's urban sprawls go, well it would be of great personal shame.\n\nWith clear discontent washing over his face, Zhang was left with a choice of great consequences.

Hans Schröder, a promising young diplomat in the Peking-Kommission was caught with a series of prostitutes in an underworld Beijing brothel.\n\nArrested in a highly publicised manner, the Chinese masses are already rallying once more against foreign abuses upon their soil, and are begging for some sort of retribution. Exchanging phone calls with our men in the offices and legations, it would appear that the Chinese Government is refusing to recognise Hans' diplomatic immunity, claiming that he was not on official duties at the time.\n\nUsing this further as a pretext to push back against several of the German-supported reforms proposed by our mouthpiece in the assembly, the Prosperity League, they have experienced a dent in membership as a few of the more nationally minded ministers defect to the Political Science Clique. Whilst comparitively a minor scandal in the scheme of things, this has still hit us harder than we'd ever like to admit."

But now it appears one of the men on his team was enraged by the lapse in punishment, and reported the news to one of Beijing's underground printing presses. Existing in a legal grey zone, these pamphleteers often publish scathing critiques of the Harmony Association's government through thinly-veiled allegorical poems, historical analogies, and other \"respectable\" topics to skirt by government censorship laws.\n\nThis time, however, they published a full-blown attack on the \"corruption\" of the Beijing police department and compared the situation to the murder of Lin Weixi by British sailors in 1839, the spark that set off the First Opium War. Attempting to redirect the anger somewhat, Cao has delegated to his staff to try and channel the popular dissent towards the Germans, attempting to wash the Government of any responsibility.\n\nAnd yet, this has still damaged the reputation of our precariously managed governance.

Furthermore, it appears that the chief of police decided to let Schröder off without as much as a warning, probably fearing political controversy. The city is currently gridlocked by anti-German riots, with many SPD and Zentrum members questioning the continued value of our involvement in China.\n\nCarlo Mierendorff and Kurt Schumacher, two SPD leaders in conjunction with Konrad Adenaur have delivered a scathing speech in the Reichstag in response to the scandal. Lambasting not just [GER.GetSecondInCommand]'s government and its continued involvement within the Chinese political scene, but also the merit upon which Germany's presence harms the Chinese people.\n\nInsisting that it is but a mere colonial venture framed around profits, rather than truly benefitting and modernising Chinese society, the politicians rallying has attracted a formidable block within the Reichstag, intent on forcing the government to withdraw as soon as possible."

And yet, it would appear that our extreme efforts have beared considerable fruit.\n\nNarrowly avoiding a rather untenable incident with our German allies, the decision to release the nearly apprehended young German appears to have gone without a hitch. The boy has transferred to Tianjin, and Zhang Beijiao, the police officer who let him go, was granted a raise to reward his \"quick political thinking\".

Engaging in somewhat dubious business practices, a number of them have no doubt begun to flagrantly abuse China's abundant labour and manpower pools, contrasting with those in Mitteleuropa.\n\nEarlier this morning, the Cabinet assembled to deal with a minor scandal that had erupted, regarding the discovery that one German factory was forcing its employees to work 20-hour shifts for next to no pay.

Ignoring the obvious military benefits of a modern rail network, sure to please Marshals Wang and Wu, the German's reform of our rail system is earning overwhelming civilian sentiment as well.\n\nOf particularly appreciative note is the work down on our side of the Guangzhou-Beijing railway network, a North-South spanning behemoth of a track that travels from the capital to Zhengzhou, then onto Wuhan, connecting through Changsha in Hunan province and finally through Shaoguan to Guangzhou.

In parallel, the advances in civilian technologies that Germany's greatest minds have helped develop results in quite the lucrative jackpot for any ally of the Kaiser hoping to meet those same advances.\n\nAlthough some in the Finance Ministry balked at the idea of paying exorbitant costs and rates just to import a few hundred of cutting-edge Siemens radios from Germany, Marshal Wang and Marshal Wu have reported back, after gathering a general consensus from the high command staff, of the raw effectiveness and popularity that they have with the officer corps. In a recent bandit-suppression mission in the far north of our territory, groups of Central Government soldiers were able to effectively split up and coordinate a decisive hunt of the bandits using radios to maintain contact.

No more shall we be ruled by tyrants who have spent centuries oppressing us! In a similar vein to the celebrations held upon the conclusion of Xinhai, and the rejection of Zhang Xun's 1917 Manchu Restoration attempt, the people have erupted into the streets, rallying themselves around the great Jade Marshal and the King of Baoding. True heroes of China's Republican history!\n\nFollowing the attempt on Wu and Cao's life, the duo have once again been tasked with steering the nation through a period of turmoil. Comprising only the most senior and important Zhili members alongside Cao's incumbent cabinet, a varied group has been assembled.\n\nSitting adjacent to President Cao, there lies Gao Lingwei, Yuan Naikuan, Bian Shoujing, Wang Kemin and finally Marshal Wang Chengbin. All representing Cao's eminent Jinbao faction, their connections within the bureaucracy and North China as a whole are numerous. Opposite, flanking the Jade Marshal, situates the likes of Bai Jianwu, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Qihuang, Jiang Baili, Wang Chonghui, and most surprisingly that of Hu Shih.\n\nHaving roped in the leading liberal Endeavour Intellectual alongside the head of the Good People's Cabinet, Wu is sending a clear message of his intentions to reform the Republic upon the same lines that he attempted in the 1920s.\n\nDeciding not just the fate of the Republic but the nation itself, the various individuals were fierce in arguing their respective sides of the coin, with Wang Chengbin frequently throwing personal insults at the Jade Marshal. With Cao and Wu acting as mediators for their respective sides, two plans were reached. Prioritising stability and integrity, Cao's faction proposed the re-adoption of the 1923 Cao Kun constitution, without any of the Imperial bells and whistles.\n\nOn the other hand however, the legal, intellectual minds of Bai, Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, Hu Shih and Jiang Baili have pushed for the drafting of a new constitution. Based off of Jiang and Wang Zhengting's experience with drafting Hunan's Provincial Constitution, Wang Chonghui's legal knowledge and Hu Shih's political knowhow, it is believed they can produce a constitution that remedies all failures of the previous Chinese Republics."

 qiefocus.5.d: "Imperative to the Constitution of the last Chinese Republic was the all domineering pre-eminent power of the President. With previous governments allowing any conniving President to control all facets of Governance, this was in essence an attempt to prevent the disastrous bouts of the previous decades, were Presidents would either engage in a feuding diarchy with their Prime Ministers, as exemplary in the case of Duan Qirui, and Li Yuanhong, similarly with Duan and Feng Guozhang as well. Yet the all encompassing power of the executive does not sit well with the likes of Wang Chonghui or Hu Shih, desiring a strong parliament and prime minister, they endeavour for a constitution with which the President, whilst still retaining a form of passive power, is not an all autocratic tyrant, as it currently stands.\n\nAlbeit admittedly the overwhelming power and sidelining of the Assembly that currently happens is in part due to Cao Kun and the Zhili's connections, with Cao and Gao insisting that a strong executive is necessary to maintain a government that isn't reduced to heavy, petty squabbling in the Assembly and Senate. Guaranteeing stability, it would see at least some continous progress, as long as the President is the right candidate with the nation's interests at heart."

 qiefocus.6.d: "In hindsight a question that should have been expected in all feasible realities, what with the invitation of Jiang Baili and Hu Shih, the duo have caused the Constitution drafting committee to come to a screeching halt following their standoffish character in regards to the most important question on their minds. That of Federalism, or Centralism. With clear regret flooding Wu and Bai Jianwu's faces, Jiang and Hu have championed that this is the chance for the Beiyang Republic to heed the popular will of the people, and restructure the Chinese Republic upon truly democratic lines.\n\nOwing to their extensive ties with the likes of Zhao Hengti, Tang Jiyao and Chen Jiongming the democratic duo have refused to budge on the issue. Rehashing issues long discussed a decade ago, Bai Jianwu began to take over for the Jade Marshal as the latter reportedly left the room. Nonetheless hearing them out, ever the foxy, pragmatic politician that he is, Cao allowed Jiang and Hu to speak their mind.\n\nFar more malleable on the Federalism issue, he heard their pleas, retorting merely that the autonomy of local Provincial Governments led to the exact situation that China finds itself in now. Warlords abound, intense suffering, and a weak Central Government necessitating even further bloodletting to unite the country. About to be interrupted by General Zhang Qihuang, Cao intervened, continuing on insisting that a centralised government based around Beijing will ensure stability and unity, preventing another Warlord Era.\n\nJiang and Wang Zhengting however retorted, insisting that through careful cultivation of provincial constitutions akin to Hunan, they can prevent the rise of malicious military strongmen from rending Central Government authority obsolete. Nonetheless, the Committee is divided. Remaining silent for the majority of the dispute, and ultimately being the tiebreaker, Bai Jianwu composed himself, and began..."

 qiefocus.7.d: "With the Constitutional Drafting Committee having squabbled and argued over insignifcant details and legal minutia, they have finally come to a conclusive, final constitution to represent the new era of the Chinese Republic. With the combined efforts of many legal scholars, invited upon Wang Chonghui's expertise and request, alongside intellectuals brought forth by Bai Jianwu, Hu Shih and Jiang Baili, the core committee can breathe a breath of fresh air, as the civil servants apply the finishing touches to the new document.\n\nNumbering over 150 articles in total, it is a titanic work of only the brightest minds that the Central Government has to offer. In private quite chuffed with themselves, Marshal Wu and Wang, alongside General Zhang Qihuang and President Cao touched champagne glasses, with Bai notably exempt due to staying behind to assist in the final draft measures, the core Zhili clique gathered to celebrate their success. Marking a monumental occasion, Cao even joked that they had surpassed what Duan Qirui's Anfu Club had hoped to achieve.\n\nYet all was not well for the King of Baoding, as evident to all those that have been with him in recent times following the Manchu Coup attempt, he has become a rather spent force. Still a jovial old man with an inexplicable mind, he nonetheless is evidently on his way out from governance. A feeling that was confirmed, near the end of the celebrations, where he made a final speech to all members gathered at the celebration. Senior Zhili, Cabinet Members, and even an assortment of North China businessmen, all bear witness as one of China's greatest statesmen announces his formal resignation and retirement. Hoping to pass the torch of a new constitution to a fresher face, the ensemble granted Cao a resounding array of cheers and celebrations.\n\nWith the new acting president to be determined by election through the Assembly, the King of Baoding intends to spend his last few years with calligraphy, painting, and any charitable endeavours he can support. And yet, the wiser men in the audience, especially that of Wu Peifu, know all too well that whilst Cao may not control the presidency, he will continue to reign in a more discrete manner, through his stacked Jinbao Cabinet.\n\nNonetheless, with the flag of the Republic hoisted high to replace that of the Qing dragon, one cannot be proud of the fresh start of Chinese democracy."

 qiefocus.8.t: "Selecting a President"
 qiefocus.8.d: "With the resignation of long-time President Cao Kun having gone underway, the Constitutional Drafting Committee has met one last time to decide on what candidates to present towards the Assembly, for their presumptive election. After the exchange of greetings, both cordial, and regrettable in the case of Marshal Wu and Marshal Wang, the gentlemen assembled for a final time. Filling the shoes of President Cao, a truly larger than life politician, was not going to resolve itself quickly. With Cao still the head of the internal Jinbao faction, and Marshal Wang speaking on his behalf, he opened the meeting through the rather blunt statement of their preferred candidate, that of (briefly) acting Prime Minister, President and at one point both acting and permanent Foreign Minister V.K. Wellington Koo, otherwise known as Gu Weijun in China.\n\nWith a reputation of being a great nationalist hero following his various diplomatic endeavours in the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919, Koo is a genius in the Foreign affairs department. Most evidently though, Koo was chosen by Cao's faction as he is a member of the esteemed, and apolitical, diplomatic corps. Malleable to the interests of whomever is in Government, it would be expected that Koo would be a more conservative continuation candidate, lacking any true ambition of his own.\n\nWith little disagreement to their selection, the Luoyang faction, alongside the reformers, proposed their own candidate for the Presidency. Once a \"man of letters\", oh so dedicated to never sullying his pristine, intellectual record, Hu Shih has matured greatly since his naivety in his youth. Considered one of the most pre-eminent intellectual minds to have emerged from China, Hu is a known force to all within the Beiyang government. Espousing his form of \"pragmatism\" (shíyànzhuyì), inherited from the likes of John Dewey in the Americas, Hu presents himself as a force of Northern Federalism, intent on tackling what he perceives as the five great national enemies of China: poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption and disorder.\n\nWith both men carrying a vast repertoire of history and experience, and the sides evenly split, it is up to the Jade Marshal to have the deciding vote."

However riding off of the wave of popular support for the regime, there is no doubt that some of the more moderate members of the opposition parties are to support our endeavour.\n\nIn an elaborate ceremony held in the Assembly Hall, with Marshal Wu and Marshal Wang in attendance, acting Prime Minister Bai Jianwu begins by announcing that the selection process for the new constitution for the Republic of China has been a success. With the news of President Cao's resignation not being public information, Bai would also follow through with the announcement that the King of Baoding has entered dutiful retirement, citing stress over the attempt on his life. Marshal Wang, having no time for the assembly to theorise and collude as to whom will be Cao's successor, yelled for order, as Bai continued.\n\n\"No longer having to contend with the decadent Qing aristocracy as a potential opponent, we can now truly focus on pursuing policies most imperative to the people of China!

Following much deliberation, the Cabinet has raised two candidates for your consideration.\"\n\nWith the formalities settled, the candidacies of Hu Shih and Wellington Koo were announced, and over the next hour the squabbling politicians broadly split into two camps.

 qiefocus.10.d: "Having garnered a titanic amount of debts in the last ailing decades of the Qing dynasty, the Beiyang Republic, and of consequence our Government, has continued to inherit and carry it's bonds to international financiers. With the Beiyang Republics of the past infamously terrible in regards to financial management following Duan Qirui's deposition, the debts have only amounted, nigh sinking numerous cabinets in the past.\n\nContinuing to interfere with our economic and political efforts, impeding our ability to reinforce the legitimacy of our new fledgling government, two courses of action have been proposed to [QIE.GetLeader]. The first, is that of the rather shrewd plan of taking an anti-concessionist stance, outright declaring a debt default. Whilst it would no doubt hamper our credit, it would absolutely endear the government to the population.\n\nAnother plan, proposed by ministers Wang Kemin and Gao Lingwei, is that of requesting assistance from Germany. Remaining neutral in the League War, the Beiyang Government managed to circumvent the rather untenable decision of choosing our people over our special relationship with the Kaiser. No doubt wary due to the radical changes in governance, and deposition of the monarch they helped institute, we could nonetheless present an olive branch to the German delegation, in exchange for assistance in paying our immense debt.\n\nWith the Jade Marshal making it evidently clear to [QIE.GetLeader] that he would much prefer casting the Germans to the dogs, there could potentially be rather... unsavoury repurcussions should the President go against the Marshal, lacking the connection Cao Kun had to act absolutely independently."

Bolstering support for their regime, it has resulted in untenable demands being levied towards the Peking-Kommission, our lobbying arm in Beijing alongside the Prosperity League, insisting that they leave the city.\n\nFacing massive riots outside the gates of their offices, most members have fled to the German concession within neighbouring Tianjin! Our ambassador, on his own initiative, has sent all non-essential staff to Tianjin as well, leaving a skeleton group of consular officials to duel against Beijing's Diplomatic Corps."

Arriving in a variety of automobiles, [QIE.GetLeader] opened his doors first to Minister of the Navy Sa Zhenbing, accompanied by fellow admiral Wu Yulin, Minister of Transport. Close behind was that of Wang Chonghui, Attorney General, with Minister of Foreign Affairs Yan Huiqing close behind. Arriving after that was the Jade Marshal and his most important allies: Zhang Qihuang and Bai Jianwu, with Jiang Baili also in toe. Finally, last to appear, was ex-President Cao Kun, clearly waiting outside his old abode to be the first to welcome Secretary of Interior Affairs Gao Lingwei, Minister of Finance Wang Kemin, Speaker Bian Shoujing, Minister of Education Peng Yunyi, Director of Agriculture Yuan Naikuan, and of course Minister of the Army Marshal Wang Chengbin."

Discussing politics, current events, and the current state of the world, the three men rejoiced over a friendly game of cards.\n\nEnquired as to if he really believes he can uproot the Zhili Clique by Wang, Hu reflected for but a moment. Playing a great hand, and winning the pot from both men, he but merely gazed longingly outside the window. \"A titanic task, but something entirely within our limits, no?\". With general agreement across all parties, the men continued their game, long into the night. Undisturbed by the machinations of the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding.\n\nHaving also sequestered themselves from the rest of the party goers, the master and the protégé merely discussed all that they could not whilst in their respective roles. Considering the circumstances, Wu and Cao mused over the independent nature of Hu Shih and his reformists, the Jade Marshal all too aware that he has to keep the \"Lone Idealist\" in-check."
 qieflavor.13.d_koo: "$qieflavor.13.intro$\n\nIn his element, having frequently went to expensive and lavish dinners during his time as a diplomat to multiple countries, Wellington Koo and his wife entertained their guests with stories of his missions to foreign countries, and of gossip from within Beijing's inner circles, much to the dismay of the Jade Marshal and Cao Kun, frequent subjects of these stories.\n\nWith Madame Wellington Koo far outshining her husband, she recalled a story relating to the Old Marshal, Zhang Zuolin. \"Zhang Zuolin adhered strictly to old-fashioned Chinese customs. He never invited women to his own entertainments, nor would he allow them at any private parties he attended. In public, he merely bowed to women, then ignored them. One evening during a benefit theatrical performance at which the diplomatic corps was present, Madame Zhang and I sat together. I was introduced to General Sun Chuanfang, who was seated near by. Seeing I had no program he rose and courteously handed me his. The Old Marshal was quite piqued by the general's politeness. \"I never knew you to curry favour with ladies,\" he remarked tartly.\"\n\nGarnering much laughter from the company at the party, it was evidently clear that Madame Koo was the life of the party, not her husband. Instead opting to play cards on his own with the Jade Marshal, the duo discussed their future, with Koo expected to be the likable face for what was really Wu Peifu's government."

The Marshal, with extensive ties to Chen Jiongming and his allies in the past, has granted a certain level of leniency to the defeated warlord, disarming his forces and allowing him to dwell in house arrest.\n\nHowever such action has infuriated the president and General Jiang Baili, a noted proponent of Federalism. Hu has enacted an executive order granting an official presidential pardon towards Chen, Ye Ju, and many other members of the Public Interest Party and Yue Army. Garnering the attention of the media, it has brewed into a highly publicised spat between the President and his benefactor, yet behind closed doors it is reported that Wu Peifu relented, reluctantly agreeing to the sign of goodwill."

In the lengthy document Zhao has pleaded the Federalist case to Marshal Wu, speaking of how they should be working together. Trying to invoke their past friendship, bringing up Wu aiding him in 1923 and 1927, and how when Feng had betrayed Wu it was Zhao alone who offered him a place to flee too and move out from.\n\nGoing on, Zhao recounts the decade of peace they both enjoyed after the Northern Expedition collapsed, the work they did together, both improving his home province of Hunan, and China as a whole. Asking once again why another bloody conflict should rage across their homes, burn their fields and make their cities run red. Using his own home as an example, Zhao spoke on how often Hunan saw itself caught in the fires of war, the first place a southern army would march north, or a northern army would march south.\n\nAsking to avoid such a conflict, Zhao offered to mediate some sort of peace, reunification even, in order to find a compromise where no one else has to die, no army has to march through people's homes, and everyone can look forward to better things than killing their brothers-in-arms.\n\nRegret vividly splashing the Marshal's face, he could only dignifiedly respond with..."

 qieflavor.102.t: "Regrets From an Old Correspondence"
 qieflavor.102.d: "To many in China, Bai Jianwu represents the rising authority of the Jade Marshal. Whenever Wu rises, Bai follows. However, Bai's political career was once no different from any other intellectual from Northern China. Born in Zhili province, Bai passed the Imperial Exam and attended the Tianjin Beiyang Academy of Law and Politics. While studying there, Bai met and became close friends with a fellow student, Li Dazhao who was also from Zhili. The two founded the legal and political magazine Yanzhi to promote their progressive ideological agenda.\n\nEven after graduation, the two men carried on their friendship through letters and telegrams on a monthly basis. After the Zhili Anhui War, Bai became increasingly convinced that Wu Peifu was the only Beiyang warlord who was worthy of his loyalty. In his monthly letter to Li in August 1920, Li introduced Wu to the former in the hopes that he would join Bai in supporting the Jade Marshal. Li agreed to meet with another one of Wu's allies in Sun Danlin. Two years later in the immediate aftermath of the 1st Zhifeng War, Bai petitioned Wu to hire Li as a strategist.\n\nWhile Li did not join Wu, he arrived in Luoyang several times to help the Jade Marshal outline plans to restore the Beiyang Parliament and devise a plan for peaceful unification, which kickstarted the Good Government Movement. Bai in turn went to meet Li's friends in the Endeavour Society, a group of intellectuals in Beijing who were willing to collaborate with Wu for the purpose of forming a Democratic government of China. Bai met up with Hu Shih, who had already been introduced to the former by Li several years ago.\n\nBai found himself impressed by the idealistic intellectual and was greatly hopeful for continued cooperation. Sadly, Wu and the Endeavour Society would not be able to come to an agreement; Wu was unable to compromise with the Endeavour Intellectuals on the matter of federalism and lost his credentials as a revolutionary general in their eyes when he cracked down on a Syndicalist strike along the Beijing-Hankou Railway. With Wu no longer favoured by the Internationale, Li Dazhao also broke ties with his longtime friend Bai Jianwu.\n\nAny hope for the continuation of the Good Government Movement was shattered when Wu's superior Cao Kun bribed the Beijing Assembly to elect him President and oust Li Yuanhong. Hu Shih declared the retirement of the Endeavour Society from warlord politics and ended the Good Government Movement. Bai continued to stay with Wu since the fallout, while Li drifted far closer to the revolutionary politics of the Kuomintang."

 qieflavor.103.d: "\"If we fight and are defeated, although our own deaths are not worth grieving over, I am afraid North China will also be subjugated after the fall of Beijing and Tianjin. Nor would we know when this lost territory could be recovered. This would be as if our party died and Beijing, Tianjin, and North China became our burial sacrifices. We should deeply consider this issue. If Beijing, Tianjin, and North China can at least be preserved, I will do whatever I can, regardless of the consequences.\"\n\nHu Shih folded the crumpled telegram and looked over at the today's latest. \"Communist bandits subjugated at last - Kuomintang leadership scattered\". The Shanghai papers did indeed extract all the words of slaughter and destruction they could find across all the tongues spoken in that international settlement to spin out stories of the great vanquishing of the Reds. He, in turn, will have to address the matter before the Assembly, and he will savor no more than having to read the endless \"triumphs\" against the so-called communist bandits.\n\nWang Zhaoming, as he had known him, had never been an optimistic man. For all their rhetoric, the Fujian rebellion is reminiscent of the final battle of the Chu-Han War, and Xiang Yu's great sacrifice. In Fujian, the Kuomintang made their stand as the Chu did. But for all their foolhardiness, Hu had never stopped thinking of the \"red scion\" of the Nationalists as his friend. Their friendship and exchanges continued even as Wang lodged at the heartland of syndicalism, much to the Jade Marshal's chagrin. Only Wang's appearance at the Fujian-Jiangxi warzone did then their exchanges came to an end, as the security bureau vultures closed in on Hu.\n\nNow, the dust has settled. Wang Zhaoming and his followers are to be known as pariahs decades or centuries from now by school students across China, but they will find no place in the halls of power. Hu, however, has a speech to prepare for, as the Assembly demands a final spectacle of violent triumph against the Kuomintang."

Yet one can find in Oei Hui-lan, more well-known as Madame Wellington Koo, a dashing socialite transcending the boundaries between Chinese tradition and Western modernity. The capable mistress of the Wellington household often is host to feasts of hearty wine and extravagant cuisines, yet has also shown her gift in backroom talks and building connections with people across China's high society spectrum.\n\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, to learn that Wellington Koo's ascension to high office once more has unleashed another wave of celebrations and feasts by his dutiful consort. Hard at work as usual gathering support from the elites and powerful for her husband, the Madame has also taken the occasion to share colourful stories about her encounters with the Imperial Household and other peculiar rumours that one can find circulating in the teashops and corners of the capital. The festivities came to a mostly jovial end, save perhaps certain remarks from some of the guests that perhaps it is the Madame, not her husband who appears to be the centre of power of the duo."

 qieflavor.105.t: "A Refined Confucian Warrior-Scholar"
 qieflavor.105.d: "Many outsiders of the Beiyang Republic would view the Jade Marshal as nothing more than a petty autocrat, strangling democracy with a velvet glove. Yet behind the veneer of the \"Jade Marshal\" lies a man of genuine philosophical convictions. Having originally intended to become a traditional Confucian Scholar, upheaval in Wu's life would lead him down the road of the military warrior. A man of guns and sabres rather than that of words. Nonetheless his inclinations towards the art of literature, reflection and Confucianism continued to adhere by the Jade Marshal's side, even now. Positing himself as perhaps an enlightened general, he has consistently been one of the few legendary figures of the despotic warlord era to be revered in some sense, having even been referred to as a \"Revolutionary General\" in his early days by the Internationale.\n\nStriking an independent flare against the stereotypical image of a warlord, there has begun a reappraisal within intellectual circles of the role the Jade Marshal plays in the Beiyang Government, his ideological and political relationships, and what it means to be a \"traditional\" warlord. Is he traditional in ideological terms because he cherishes Confucian values and customs, envisioning an ideal government based on a moral and humanistic foundation? Is he traditional in social and political terms, operating within his clan-structured Guanxi patronage network and administrative system; maintaining intimate, hierarchical social relationships with his advisors and subordinates. Or is he a mere warlord, because his ideologies and diplomacies are dictated by his politico-military needs, therefore superficial, contingent.\n\nHowever there remains a permanent flare with regards to the Marshal of Jade. With his patriotic stance on the November Riots Movement, his tactical management of the political scene through the circulation of public telegrams promoting his own policies. Echoing the intellectual-led movement for Good Government, expressing his commitments to constitutional governance, he would help in establishing the watershed \"Good People's Cabinet\". The deeds of Marshal Wu in his service to the Chinese nation have been nothing short of remarkable, and even now the Republic once again needs the Jade Marshal's sword and shield."

 qieflavor.106.t: "Scourge of National Unification"
 qieflavor.106.d: "Split upon the precipice of Federalism and Centralism, the Chinese Republic has been marred by such a conflict for decades. Disregarding Revolutionaries, as their time has undoubtedly passed, the traditional North-South split can also be viewed in the lense of that of a Centralist-Federalist split. Of course, notable Federalists and Centralists exist on both sides, however with the likes of Zhang Zuolin, Wu Peifu and Cao Kun in the North contrasting with Tang Jiyao, Zhao Hengti and Chen Jiongming in the South, their numbers are dwarfed by the titans of their respective movements. Yet there was always an essence of reconciliation, an attempt to bridge the divide. In specific regards to the Jade Marshal, he has been approached by the Federalists numerous times to unite the nation.\n\nOriginally spurned on by the likes of Hu Shih, Wu Peifu originally envisioned the role of \"China's Hamilton and Franklin\", the Parliamentarians, to ensure that the state centralise power to iself, and distribute it amongst the people. Disagreements would arrive as Hu Shih's Federalist ideas, the ideal of provincial autonomy and self-governance, clashed with Wu's primacy of the Beijing Government, questioning the capacity to delegate power amongst the people if the provinces and local councils cannot retain power themselves. Fearing, misunderstanding, that Wu was merely delaying self-governance to preserve his rule and prevent democracy, he would be unaware that Wu's insistence on building a centralised unitary state was not due to a warlord's desire to maintain the power of his guns, nor as a repudiation of democratic principles.\n\nAs a persistent champion of the people's will to exert themselves in discussing and deciding national affairs, Wu passionately advocates for popular political participation. Not concered about granting political rights, Wu merely draws fears from delegating political autonomy to the provinces. In-fact such a stance was perhaps the largest obstacle to unification in the 1920s, and even now remains a severe obstacle."

 qieflavor.107.t: "The Flaws of Provincial Self-Governance"
 qieflavor.107.d: "In the nation's attempts to win over the Jade Marshal to the side of Federalism, he would resiliently prove an unmovable force. Attempting to detente with Chen Jiongming in the South all those years ago, Wu would invest in illustrating his issue with Federal Self-Governance: \"What has been the achievement of provincial self-governance in Hunan? In terms of demobilisation, troops are still as many as the forests; in terms of finance, nothing is left in the exchequer; and in terms of people's wellbeing, refugees and migrants have crowded the entire province. While current experiments of provincial self-governance are far from satisfactory, the consequences of having a federal government would be even more alarming. The United States adopted a federal system to unite previously separate and independent states, but our \"making of a Chinese federation\" is to divide up a country into separate regional units. The only thing we can achieve is to transform our twenty two provinces into twenty two disunited states.\"\n\nEspoused by the Marshal a decade ago, it holds the convictions by which he still stands to today. Decried by Hu Shih at the time as immature, and by that of Wang Chonghui as dismissing a movement in its infancy, the most vocal response would come from Governor Zhao Himself. Circulating a five thousand word telegram, Zhao would make an assiduous, if not desperate, attempt to convince Wu that federal self-governance would never contradict national unification, that it would suit China's current conditions, and that the parliament in Beijing and the provincial assemblies would compliment eachother. Explaining that a federation and a unitary state shared the same principles, he drew allusions to the Commonwealth countries, attempting to unite Wu's political plan and Chen Jiongming's federalist blueprint.\n\nResonating with the likes of Li Jiannong and the Endeavour Society, Zhao's efforts to bring the Marshal on side would ultimately be in vain. With Chen Jiongming uncompromising on his Federalism, and Wu Peifu firmly rejecting the movement, the Jade Marshal would hold an increasingly derogatory attitude towards Federalism, and would hesitate to follow through with his demobilisation plan due to the South's consistent opposition. Initially close to peaceful unification, China would once again be torn asunder by ideological clashes between men of guns and men of words."

 qieflavor.108.t: "Confucianism in the Modern Era"
 qieflavor.108.d: "Nonetheless, it would be particularly easy for the Federalists to decry Wu as Hu Shih did, to insinuate that he was merely intending to retain power, centralise it under his domain. Yet similarly to the Federalists, Wu's unflinching stance on Provincial Self-Governance was not born out of greed, but out of conviction. Out of his own ideals for the perfect \"Good Government\" that was so desperately needed by the Chinese nation.\n\nUtilising his Confucian credidentials, Wu has transformed into a sort of \"intellectual general\" in his career. Opposing opium smoking, gambling, prostitution, he is an avid lover of poetry, calligraphy and Chinese Philosophy, a devotee to traditional Chinese culture. Zhang Qihuang, for example, shares many of the similar convictions that Wu does, holding great shared interest in Confucian and Daoist classics. Even similarly sharing excellent relationships with the eminent classic scholars such as Kang Youwei and Zhang Taiyan.\n\nPutting his political ideology into words, Wu repeatedly emphasises Confucian ethics as the foundation of the Chinese civilisation and state-building project, and illustrates the compatibility between Western Political Principles and indigenous ideals. In Wu's eyes, the Three Principles of the People, for example, precisely reflected rather than contradicted the teachings of Confucius. In Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals, he raised the idea of \"respect the kingship of the Zhou and expel the barbarians\", similar to Nationalism. In The Book of Rites, he would divulge elements similar to that of People's Welfare, and in The Book of Documents it is written that \"He who wins the people prospers; he who ignores the people perishes.\"\n\nEver appreciative of the modern era however, Wu's ideology is not merely a nostalgic yearning for Confucian ideals, as the Jade Marshall all too well understands the primacy of democracy as the new dynamic of world civilisations, entailing new institutions and methods of governance, ones China sorely lacked due to its intrinsic despotism littered within her political tradition."
 qieflavor.108.a: "A moderniser, and a traditionalist?"

 qieflavor.109.t: "Principles of Democracy"
 qieflavor.109.d: "\"Separation of powers is the principle of democracy, and democracy is the foundation of modern politics. Our country is a republic; the essence of republicanism lies in the return of the power to the people. The rise and fall of the nation should be the concern of every citizen\".\n\nInstead of opposing socio-political changes, the Jade Marshal rather seeks to bridge Western democracy and the Confucian model of benevolent rule, striking a balance between the applications of Western institutions and the Confucian practice of self-cultivation and self-restraint: \"Science and the rule of law are of course beneficial to our state-building, but if we can in the meantime preserve Confucian moral decorum, the Chinese state will be unparalleled in the world.\"\n\nArguing that the Chinese civilisation adhered to a moral order instead of the material order that underpinned contemporary Western decadent society, Wu champions the belief that such a moral order makes Chinese civilisation transcendant: \"Despite the vicissitudes of fortune that have inflicted chaos, divisions and occupations on some dynasties, the Chinese civilisation remained intact, and the moral integrity of the Chinese people never withered.\" Intent on bringing forth national unification along the moral and cultural lines of Confucianism, provincial self-governance and federalism are, in his eyes, not only an obstacle to achieving national unification but also an impediment to the Chinese civilisation.\n\nTherefore it was unthinkable of him to betray the nation to the federalists so long as the movement associated itself with national separatism and cultural fragmentation. Decried by the intellectual circles of Beijing as the thoughts of backwardness, the Endeavour Society infamously, and still continue, to harangue the Jade Marshal on his Confucianism, insisting that \"loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness\" are not to the taste of the Society.\n\nYet it would be too simple to merely decry Wu Peifu Thought as a simple parody of Confucianism, as his engagement with the schools of thought of constitutionalism, federalism, pragmatism and Confucianism all formed an integral part of the ideological environment of Good Government. Highlighting the complex ideological interactions between centralism and federalism, the conservative and the radical, in the making of a Chinese nation-state."
 qieflavor.109.a: "Wu Peifu Thought? Interesting..."

 qieflavor.110.t: "The Lack of \"Endeavour\" from Endeavour"
 qieflavor.110.d: "Having long been one of the more prominent intellectual groups within Beijing's literature circles, the Endeavour Society was initially organised by Hu Shih in 1921, joined by his likeminded friends, Cai Yuanpei, Ding Wenjiang and Zhu Jingnong, as a venue for their increasing interest and engagement in political affairs during their afternoon-teas, dinner parties and mahjong games. Although initially agreeing that the Society would remain an organisation amongst intellectual friends, they were serious about the promotion of gradual political reform, therefore introducing explicit organisational rules that laid out detailed reform goals.\n\nWith their prominence after the publication of \"Our Political Statement\" skyrocketing their popularity, it demonstrated not only their willingness to expand their network and seek wider political impact, but displayed that Hu Shih was determined to engage in politics in a more organised and vocal manner. However Hu remained apprehensive of sullying himself by entering the murky swamp of politics, insisting that he would not suffer the indignity Liang Qichao did. Alas, drawn further and further into the battlefield by his engagement in stunts such as the \"Good People's Government\", Hu would see himself increasingly taking a more prominent role in Chinese politics.\n\nYet for much of their successes the Endeavour Society is marred by a history of stubborn intellectualism. With the majority unwilling to become politicians within the Beiyang Government, they merely criticised the plans implemented by current cabinets, without providing any alternative plan for action. Similarly, when Wu resoundedly rejected Federalism, the Society cut all ties and referred to him as \"just a warlord\". Continuing, Endeavour would lose faith in the Beiyang Government, but refuse to collaborate with the Federalists of the South, viewing that China's salvation still lay in the Central Government."
 qieflavor.110.a: "The Young, Indomnitable Hu Shih, his own undoing."

 qieflavor.111.t: "Maturing is Realising"
 qieflavor.111.d: "Interestingly, the collaboration between Wu Peifu and that of Endeavour a decade ago still bore numerous fruit. The Men of Guns and Men of Letters had committed themselves to a six-month period of intensive intellectual exchange and political engagement. Maintaining consistent communication through letters, telegrams and visists, synchronising their actions in initiaiting Good Government. Sharing with Wu the principles of constitutionalism, democracy, reform, military demobilisation and national unification. Only under unique circumstances could such collaboration even come to fruition, hinging on the very personal connection between Li Dazhao and Bai Jianwu.\n\nA mutual adoration for the Chinese Republic, the nation and its institutions is what brought the Society and the Jade Marshal together. With token intellectuals such as Liang Shuming similarly sharing their emphasis on the essence of Confucianism as a compliment to Western principles and institutions, the collaboration amongst intellectuals and Wu Peifu would continue, even to the present. With the Endeavour Society, briefing ceasing its existence in 1923, and coming back under fruition through the reigns of a matured Hu Shih, he has transformed from a stubborn, arrogant and unruly ivory tower intellectual into a pragmatist.\n\nRetaining influence within the Assembly, and with the restoration of their long sought after Republic, Hu Shih collaborated along with other intellectuals in the formal drafting of the Constitution and selection of a new President. Having lessened his intense firebrand reputation, the Lone Idealist continues an independent streak, but one intent on reformism and liberalism within the Beiyang system. With the New Republic, Endeavour has flung it's full backing towards realising a new era of Good People's Governance."
 qieflavor.111.a: "Quite pleasant, when he's not so dismissive."

 qieflavor.112.t: "Unhappy Returns"
 qieflavor.112.d: "It truly has been quite some while since the last time the Wellington residence has played host to one of these tea parties, not least since the fall of the 1922 Cabinet and the “Good People's Government”. Back then, they had played host to the luminaries of China's political and intellectual scene, and the discussions that sounded in the halls of their manor seemed to echo in them a brighter future for China.\n\nHow Wellington Koo longed for such days, instead of the deafening silence of the current attendees. Their gestures were awkward and hardened by years of cynicism and confusion, the spark once there in their eyes seemingly clouded by the dark smog of realpolitik and the harsh decades that had befallen China. The newly-appointed President had invited them here in hopes of rallying his former comrades and friends to the Good Government banner once more, but he realizes now the enormous crevice that had formed between them. The lively discussions were there no more, instead forced words of congratulations and superficial appraisals of trivial political issues were given out just to keep the mood from going down the drain completely. The Good People were tired, and in him, they placed no faith.\n\nHu Shih alone took to him once the party had dispersed. But aside from scant warnings, he offered no well-wishes or advice. So returned the Wellington residence into silence once more, and the President in turn to the methodical routine of his official paperwork duties."
 qieflavor.112.a: "Loss of faith is hard to bear."

 qiecoup.25.t: "Breaching the Yellow River"
 qiecoup.25.d: "Reports have returned to the Imperial Palace that our troops have reached the Yellow River. The scattered Zhili garrisons around Beijing proved to be little match for the Baoding-led armies, and General Zaitao's Manchu loyalists assisted in harrying retreating Zhili troops as they attempted to flee to Luoyang. Many troops simply deserted to our forces, as the thought of serving a leaderless army with little concentrated political backing was unappealing.\n\nOur forces are now ready to begin an assault on Luoyang, Wu Peifu's old stronghold, currently being defended by forces under Marshal Wang Chengbin and General Zhang Qihuang, Cao and Wu's second in commands respectively. Securing this fortress will be the beginning of the end for the Zhili Clique."
 qiecoup.25.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

 qiecoup.26.t: "Victory in Luoyang!"
 qiecoup.26.d: "A telegram arrived this morning from Luoyang, confirming that our troops were victorious in storming the walls of the fortified city. Following hours of concentrated artillery bombardment, loyal troops crossed the river in impromptu barges, sustaining heavy fire. Once ashore, however, they quickly secured control over a beachhead, allowing more and more of our troops to land and begin attacking Zhili units garrisoned in the city.\n\nFighting among the ancient grotto and temples that dot the city, our troops eventually stormed the Zhili headquarters. Most of the generals staff managed to escape, but several key leadership figures such as Wang Chengbin have vanished, presumably dead among the throngs of thousands of other soldiers trapped in the burning city. Remaining Zhili troops have scattered throughout the surrounding countryside in complete disarray even as they flee our forces."
 qiecoup.26.a: "With Wu's headquarters captured, their time is numbered!"

 qiecoup.27.t: "Victory in the South!"
 qiecoup.27.d: "The last few weeks have seen intense fighting across the southern reaches of our territory, spanning Hubei and Shaanxi, as the die-hard supporters of Marshal Wu, President Cao and Marshal Wang, with the rest of the Zhili Clique are hunted down and destroyed. Like the dogs they are. The civilian intellectuals within Beijing have reportedly acted with dismay at our conduct, but its either us or the Zhili.\n\nEspecially vicious was the fighting on all routes leading in to Wuhan, as the last remnants of the Zhili Command prepare to organise a desperate last-stand in the ancient city. With the isolated garrisons destroyed, we can turn our eyes on securing this city and destroying the Zhili once and for all."
 qiecoup.27.a: "Last stand of the Republic. In Wuhan? Ironic."

 qiecoup.28.t: "Victory in Wuchang!"
 qiecoup.28.d: "In a final all-out assault our forces, bolstered by ranks of Zhili deserters, finally stormed Wuhan. Engaging in brutal hand-to-hand fighting with the Zhili forces led under Governor Xiao, whole sections of the city suffered damage as our forces utilised all force available to crush the traitors. Destroying the remaining Zhili forces and capturing or killing many senior Zhili generals, the rest have reportedly fled to neighbouring provinces.\n\nWith victory finally secured, we can now start to focus on rebuilding our country, and rearing it from both the ravages of the conflict we just endured and the decades of rampant corruption we were subjected to under the failed Republic."
 qiecoup.28.a: "Victory at last!"

 qiecoup.29.t: "Prosperity League Dissolves!"
 qiecoup.29.d: "As a result of upheaval and recent demands made by Assembly bureaucrats on behalf of [ROOT.GetLeader], it would appear that the Germans have finally tugged the strings of their voice in the Assembly, the Prosperity League. The ostensibly independent group of bankers, lobbyists and businessmen, they have abruptly dissolved their parliamentary grouping, citing a \"hostile atmosphere\", with many of their most prominent members leaving for the Legations.\n\nWhilst the German legation remains in Beijing, they have refused to answer government telegrams, practically isolating themselves from government contact. Whilst usually of no issue, it would appear that they have robbed us of any future German military and industrial support that they could provide. And yet the people, as beloved as they are, remain overwhelmingly in favour of this move, praising the new government for ridding itself of foreign influences.\n\nSoaking up a lot of their support is that of the Political Science Clique. Representing influential, middle class and liberal ideals, they have found many friends within the disintegrating Prosperity League. Already their leader Huang Fu has rallied another one of his malicious attacks against the Zhili Clique's relations with the Prosperity League."
 qiecoup.29.a: "We don't need them!"

 qiecoup.30.t: "Blood in the Water"
 qiecoup.30.d: "With the capital set ablaze in anti-Zhili and anti-foreigner violence it's become clear that even the very heart of the Qing Empire is faltering. The vulturs on the borders, prune their feathers, and watch intently, aiming to eradicate a rival, nay the Central Government, in no disorderly amount of time. If we are caught absolutely unaware, the Fengtian Government and its Old Marshal will undoubtedly order a strike from Shenyang, aiming at taking the Shanhaiguan Pass as he did in the Second, Third and Fourth ZhiFeng Wars.\n\nUnder no circumstances must our men on the border flinch in the face of Fengtian forays or encroachment into our land, lest the whole of Zhili province collapse to the ensuing Fengtian assault."
 qiecoup.30.a: "Man the borders, Zuolin must not be allowed in."

 qiecoup.32.d: "The time has come for the long-promised elections, since the turmoil of the provisional government following the Manchu Coup has finally eased into political stability. While there are of course multiple political parties running, the only real contender is the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], in light of their clear successes in reforming Chinese politics and restoring our nation's greatness. While there might be a few accusations of corruption, that'd hardly be a novelty for China, and can anyone deny that the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] deserve another victory?"

 qiecoup.33.t: "The Last Qing Elections?"
 qiecoup.33.d: "Clearly, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has proved triumphant over all obstacles in its path to reunite, reform and re-assert China's greatness. They only needed one more election to consolidate their power over the renewed Qing Empire!"
 qiecoup.33.a: "China requires a firmer hand before democracy can truly blossom."

 qiecoup.34.d: "With the regime solidified we find ourselves not a party to be compromised and haggled with, but obeyed and grovelled to. This has not gone unnoticed in the Assembly either; already, party officials outside the [QIE.GetRulingParty] have either been cowed into silence or brought on board into the new ruling order of the day."

 qieelection.1.d: "After years of preparations due to the diligent efforts of Qu Yingguang and James Yen the Assembly swells with newly elected members after nearly 4 years of being a rump political body and decades without a true popular mandate. As the newly elected Assemblymen take their seats in Beijing a new governing coalition may need to take shape to more accurately reflect the will of the people. While the CERA has a clear electoral victory compared to their competitors a broader coalition could still be in the cards in hopes to secure a stable transition for this newborn democracy.\n\nAmong the victorious members of the CERA there is a consensus forming that they may in fact be the only force keeping democratic values alive in the empire and wish to close ranks to keep out any authoritarian tendencies in the ruling government.\n\nThe Zongshe, meanwhile, contend that they would make for a steady right hand as the country is brought into the broader world. Emphasising both their private and foreign connections as well as the burgeoning growth of a homegrown industrial class under their auspices; the Zongshe promise that a level of cooperation with industrialists and the old guard will ensure a smooth transition into orderliness and prosperity across the empire.\n\nSurprisingly the Young China Party had a surge in the polls as the election drew near, clearly showing their message of a stronger more centralised China focused on more radical modernisation and centralisation has a growing appeal in the war-torn provinces weary of warlords and division."

As China embraces modernity the nobility find themselves increasingly stripped of influence in a true democracy.\n\nSurprisingly the Young China Party had a surge in the polls as the election drew near, clearly showing their message of a stronger more centralised China focused on more radical modernisation and centralisation has a growing appeal in the war-torn provinces weary of warlords and division. They seek to legitimise their gains by formally joining a ruling coalition if it means the Chinese state can more closely align with their beliefs."

 qieelection.2.b: "A deal is struck with the YCP promising greater centralisation for the vast empire."

 qieelection.3.t: "The Qing Elections of [GetYear] A New Era in Politics"
 qieelection.3.d: "Constitutional reform has been met with approval by many progressives lauding the expansion of rights and improving the efficiency of the government while also satisfying the Manchu nobility for preserving the institutional authority of the Emperor. In the countryside, Yan Yangchu and Liang Shuming have launched successful literacy campaigns among the peasantry that has improved access to education and rebuild village connections across the Empire. Reforms in the countryside have also significantly reduced the strain on Imperial bureaucracy by promoting local autonomy. Somewhat ironically, this strategy of political decentralisation has seemingly improved the cohesion of the Empire.\n\nThis democratic renaissance has caused the influence of the Zongshe to dwindle to the point of political irrelevance. As calls for reform grow louder the old guard conservatives find themselves increasingly out of touch and incapable of providing meaningful policy. Constantly undermined and quieted in any political discourse; their light clearly no longer illuminates the halls of power.\n\nThe last four years have also given rise to different voices in politics. One of the loudest is the Chinese Youth Party. The YCP are politically conservative with an emphasis on Chinese tradition, but stress the need for mass mobilisation and class collaboration, with the citizen as the foundation of a new Chinese society. Their literature and party branches have started cropping up in nearly every corner of the Empire, with particular focus in major cities and universities. Since the restoration of Imperial authority they have made significant inroads among many urban intellectuals, student organisations, and even high profile military officers. They are now poised to make their way into the Government. Allowing them into our Coalition can certainly prove useful in expanding our appeal to the urban masses and military. Though we might consider as well maintaining our focus in the countryside as the basis of our national reconstruction efforts."
 qieelection.3.a: "The Empire is committed to our present strategy in the countryside"
 qieelection.3.b: "The Youths will help inspire and reforge the Empire with their bold vision!"

 qieelection.4.t: "[GetYear] Elections - Choosing a vision for a New China"
 qieelection.4.d: "The last four years have proven to be quite productive for all members of the ruling coalition. Together in the Assembly a series of reforms have been passed with the term 'New China' characterising these efforts - a vision of rebirth, prosperity, and healing in contrast to the devastation of the last century. Meanwhile, the governing parties began to fissure in pursuit of their own agendas throughout Chinese society.\n\nIn the countryside, Liang Shuming's rural reconstruction efforts have begun to pay dividends; the new schools are producing many graduates who take what they've learned back to their villages and greatly heightening the quality of peasant life in the process. Schools and economic cooperatives are proving much more successful than previous state-run efforts. Furthermore, rural militia training and reorganisation has led to successful defences against ever-decreasing numbers of bandit attacks. Vast improvements to the welfare of the peasantry are expected if these programmes continue.\n\nThe China Youth Party has also taken the initiative to spread their platform of mass mobilisation to the towns and cities. Rallies and student organisations promote the YCP's 'Plebiscitarian Politics' nationwide; drawing in intellectuals, university students, and even the urban working class. Party Membership has also soared among National Army officers ever since the YCP put together new patriotic curricula at the Dongbei military academy. Altogether this has greatly enhanced the YCP's efforts in creating a new socially and politically mobilised Chinese citizen.\n\nWith a New China being born and the coalition drifting apart, the electorate must now decide between these two visions of the future. Will the CERA prevail, rebirthing China anew from the traditional villages and country towns? Or will the YCP's methods of political and ideological mobilisation in the cities, universities, and army provide new lifeblood for the Chinese nation in the form of the citizen?"

 qieelection.5.d: "In any democratic state the importance of representation cannot be understated. Where exactly these representatives come from and what blocs of people end up electing them into office is a very important detail though. We will have to direct the Assembly to meticulously revise the voting districts if we want to move forward with our reforms."

Across the land people have to be informed of their rights, the election parameters, the candidates running, the actual election locations themselves, and of course, we will have to collect the votes to be counted. Such a massive undertaking will require the government to invest a substantial amount of time and money to turn these lofty ideals into something that can actually be useful to the state."

Both Republican and Imperial attempts at implementing such reforms have descended into palpable corruption, bloody insurrection, or toothless rubber-stamps for their lords on high. After more than a year of concerted government attention on reforming the process of electoral politics, Qu Yingguang oversees the last touches to his revision of democracy in the heartland. Now he can only look on to see if his own efforts for Chinese democracy will prove to be the beginning of something greater or just another folly attempt in service of a corrupt authoritarian regime."

 qiefocus.13.d: "As we begin to reorganise the state following the fall of the vile Zhili clique, the rump Assembly is calling for the monarchy's role to be enshrined more directly in the legal framework. There is general consensus among many in court that the Emperor's position can only be maintained with a strict adherence to non-intervention in matters of state policy. However, there is also a small but vocal minority, particularly among ideologues of the late Kang Youwei, calling for the safeguarding of Imperial prerogative if the Assembly finds itself deadlocked in a state of crisis."
 qiefocus.13.a: "We need a ruler above the fray of politics."
 qiefocus.13.b: "The Assembly should have a guiding hand if the need arises."

 qiefocus.14.t: "Rebuilding our Command Structure"
 qiefocus.14.d: "Following the purge of many senior members of the Zhili Clique, our army has been left without much of a command structure. It has fallen on the two Aisin-Gioro princes, the Emperor's uncle Zaitao and his distant cousin Jixing, to reform the Imperial command structure. This will not be an easy task, as Wu and his command staff essentially did away with a modern divisional structure based on meritocratic promotion in favour of the Zhili patronage network.\n\nWhile their reforms will take time to implement, in the meantime they have called to request the aid of Zhang Yinwu, giving him a commission. Yinwu, a former general of Yan Xishan's Jin army who returned to his home province of Zhili following the defeat of Shanxi's forces against the Zhili clique in the fourth Zhifeng War, since then he has worked in positions such as officer training, and it has also been said he was involved with organising guerrilla activities to weaken the back of Zhili lines. He is also rumoured to be involved in some capacity with the Young China Party, though where his true loyalties lie is currently uncertain.\n\nAlongside him is that of the commission of Tong Jixu. Head of the Imperial Guard and friend of Yinwu, he is a reliable figure within the court with connections to Zheng Xiaoxu. With little to no actual combat experience, his commission is based off of dissuading claims of nepotism, and on the recommendation of Yinwu."
 qiefocus.14.a: "Excellent!"

 qiefocus.15.t: "Imperial City Shuffle"
 qiefocus.15.d: "Political machinations are brewing within the imperial capital, on levels unseen since the dissolution of the rump Anfu Parliament in 1920. Alongside the military and bureaucratic vacuums left behind by the fall of the Zhili military-political apparatus, new contenders are emerging from the political voids to try their hands at a power grab, long since monopolised by the Zhili and their underlings. By now, several political organisations have consolidated their programmes and standings with the public and legislature, which we can now also identify.\n\nThe Zongshe, or Royalist Party is the newest to the scene, but by no means are they underprepared against their opponents. Composed mainly of Manchu aristocrats and even members of the Aisin-Gioro family. In theory, the Zongshe is made up of the sternest loyalists to the Emperor and his cause, with some observers pointing out parallels between them and the Imperial faction behind the Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe Young China Party is considered by some to be the greatest wildcard in the race for power. As opposed to imperial veneration or rural reconstruction, the Young China Party, like their namesake, wants to fundamentally reshape the concept of a Chinese nation-state. Thus, their programme is perhaps the most far-reaching of the three groups, calling for a fundamental restructuring of society and redefining the role of the imperial state as a guiding hand in the development of the nation.\n\nThe Chinese Empire Reform Association represents the last, but not least of the main contenders for power. Unlike the YCP or Zongshe, the CERA is not a single party but a larger alliance of two political blocs, the Constitutionalist Party led by Xu Qin and Liang Shuming's Rural Reconstruction Movement. The former has emerged as the dominant partner, thanks to its deep-rooted lineage tracing back to reformist elements before the Wuchang Uprising. To bolster their cause, Xu Qin is also widely considered a direct heir of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. For now, the two groups are united in their advocacy for continuation and furthering of pre-Republican reforms initiated under Cixi and Zaifeng."
 qiefocus.15.a: "But who will come out on top?"

 qiefocus.16.t: "The Uneasy Coalition"
 qiefocus.16.d: "While all of the reformist parties were formally united in their desire to overthrow the Zhili, now that the dust has settled following the coup they find themselves in an uneasy position. Japan and the Fengtian loom large, and they must work together in order to avoid annihilation. Yet at the same time the different reform groups have differing goals and objectives, and varying things they can contribute to the military. Puyi and his advisors need the support of each of the parties and their military wings to win the eventual war with Japan, but doing so will come at a cost..."
 qiefocus.16.a: "This is still better than the Zhili."

 qiefocus.17.t: "The Yellow Sand Society"
 qiefocus.17.d: "In addition to the Rural Defence Forces employed by the CERA, the Yellow Sands Society, an esoteric sect with connections to the Yiguandao, have offered to join our army. They are fierce fighters, and relatively loyal given our new anti-concession stance, but some fear accepting their offer to join our army will allow the Yiguandao yet another opportunity to infiltrate as well."
 qiefocus.17.a: "Offer them a place in the army."
 qiefocus.17.b: "No, this is too risky."

 qiefocus.18.t: "The Emergency Government"
 qiefocus.18.d.zhang: "Active fighting in Beijing has finally subsided, with the last Zhili holdouts finally laying down their weapons after fending off assault after assault by the Imperial Guard. The Second Manchu Restoration stands victorious where Zhang Xun and his loyalists had faltered. The struggle, however, is far from over. While a superficial peace returns to Beijing, across the Empire, violence and chaos continues to be the order of the day.\n\nTaking down Cao Kun and Wu Peifu was the most important part of the Restoration Plot. So important, in fact that we only spared afterthought for what to do once the Zhili crumbled. This neglect is now coming to haunt us, as administrative paralysis and military breakdown grapples the nation. We broke the military-bureaucratic backbone that the two masters of the Zhili Clique had built, yet now find ourselves floundering to fill in the void left behind.\n\nFortunately, we are not alone. The Xuantong Emperor and his officials are convening a closed assembly of plotters and activists who were directly involved with, or supported the Manchu Coup through other means. This assembly is mandated to form a government of national salvation or an emergency cabinet in order to assist in stabilising our current domains. The three largest groups to participate in the assembly would be the Youths of the Young China Party, the Chinese Empire Reform Association and the Zongshe, or the Royalist Party. Although each provided crucial assistance in toppling the Zhili, these three are fundamentally at odds when it comes to their post-Restoration plans.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, the Assembly must answer to the man who holds the gun. In this case, Honoured Master Zhang Tianran has professed his outright scorn of the Youths, much to their despair and consternation. Therefore, the other two contenders are fighting not just for a majority in this closed assembly, but also the approval of the Honoured Master with honeyed promises of rural reform or traditionalist revival."

Time and again we have been overruled and outmanoeuvred in administrative policy to the point that our positions are held in name-only. With this embarrassing demise just about complete, it's clear a new party will need to take over stewardship of the empire- if only to save it from the folly of aristocratic machinations."

With the regime still being in it's infancy many among the YCP and Zongshe have openly called for a crackdown on suspected leftists in the empire. Thousands of miles away from any Kuomintang heartland it's clear the real target of this vitriol is the CERA, more specifically, the Rural Reconstruction Movement which makes up half of the CERA coalition. Certainly it is true the organisation existed before the restoration of the Qing and there were ties between it and many republicans, but it's clear that this move towards punitive action is a dagger pointed towards domestic opponents."

Recently Zhang Tianran has become further emboldened in his attempts to bind the court to the Yiguandao ever closer.

 qiefocus.22.t: "A New Coronation"
 qiefocus.22.d: "An unusual idea has been circulating among the Qing nobility over the last few weeks - organising a second coronation for Puyi. They claim that since the Restoration of 1927 was carried out under the supervision of the Zhili Clique it was not really 'proper' and that a new reinstating ceremony must be carried out in order to appease the traditions of the empire. The cost for this would be staggeringly high, but it may give us some legitimacy, and will earn us further support from the nobles."

One by one they file past the Emperor, silently bowing to pay their respects. In a novel first, a court photographer has been tasked with capturing each of these submissions, and they will be distributed as propaganda to both prove the legitimacy of the Emperor, and erode any support for a non-Aisin Gioro ruling family."

The Khanate, last descendant of the Mongol Empire, has long been a loyal subject of the Qing since the 17th century. With the few allies available to us following the successful Manchu coup, it would be in our best interests to support them. By helping them pacify Xinjiang, we can likely guarantee their support and allow them to keep their autonomy. Loyal vassals should get rewarded after all. The Khan awaits us on the battlefield!"

 qieflavor.12.t: "The Clique of Strategies of the Warring States"
 qieflavor.12.d: "Following the ascension of the YCP, an organisation made up of intellectuals who studied in Germany called the 'Clique of Zhan Guo Ce' has emerged. They believe in statism, authoritarianism and Nietzsche's superhuman philosophy, but adapted to Chinese circumstances, promoting an esoteric blend of Confucianism with Nietzscheian philosophical thought. In particular, they see China's recent history, and near future, as repeat of China's historical \"cyclical\" warring states periods; brutal, uncompromising times, in which the weak are, one by one, consumed by the strong. Thus, they believe that forming a strong nation is paramount, but hold a pluralistic outlook on Chinese nationalism.\n\nGroups affiliated with this school of thought have started to crop up in major Chinese universities, and are lending much credence to our new government."
 qieflavor.12.a: "Interesting."

 qieflavor.20.t: "Kang Tongbi Rises to Prominence"
 qieflavor.20.d: "While Kang Youwei, the reformer whose works the CERA are primarily based around, has been dead since 1927, his daughter Kang Tongbi inherited her father's genius and political talent. A graduate of Barnard College in New York City, she returned to China in 1911 to help agitate for women's rights and feminism. As the CERA gained prominence in the tumultuous years after the German intervention and the Restoration, Kang's ideas of women's empowerment became increasingly popular within some intellectual circles, while alienating some of the more conservative members of the party.\n\nWith our recent efforts to honour her father, some have suggested elevating her to a full minister position within our government, both as a symbol of our direct inheritance of the legacy of Kang Youwei and as a symbol of our modernity. Others counter that this would be too controversial, and instead argue that she should continue to promote her work at the local level."

 qiefocus.11.t: "New Blood in Old Water"
 qiefocus.11.d: "Similar to most warlord cliques throughout China, at least since the end of the National Protection War, the Zhili Clique whilst ostensibly united on the outside, is inherently fractured. Split between the North Zhili Clique, led by Wu Peifu, Cao Kun and Wang Chengbin. And the South Zhili Clique, led by Sun Chuanfang, Qi Xieyuan and Chen Yi. Even internally within that divide lies factions.\n\nWithin the North, there exists the Luoyang faction with its nucleus of Wu Peifu, and the Jinbao faction — a unification of Cao's Baoding and Wang's Tianjin. And of course, Sun Chuanfang's League, a series of inter-allied provinces strung on by the sheer capacity of Sun Chuanfang to maintain his rotting structure.\n\nYet such factions are built on the traditional Chinese Guanxi patronage system, wherein officers, civil servants and other staff are chosen purely on personal relations, shaping the nature of China's government structures. Whilst many within these Guanxi insist that it brings numerous benefits, there are those cast away. Those on the outer rung, with no benefactors or direct superios to aid their ascension in society.\n\nAs a result, those on the outer verge of the Zhili patronage network are treated as outsiders, no matter what actions they take. One must merely look at Governors Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou in Sichuan, or Tang Xiangming in Hunan, to find evidence of such treatment. Intent on undoing such malaise, especially within the command staff, and in preparation for the tide to come, military theorist Jiang Baili has written eloquently to Marshal Wang and Marshal Wu, requesting most humbly the promotion of a new series of younger, fresher commanders who have distinguished themselves on the battlefield. Seeing no real reason to refuse, both Marshals have conferred their consent."

 qiefocus.12.d_republic: "Having long been an existential threat to the existence of the Chinese nation since the First Sino-Japanese War, the Rising Sun in the East has become a bolder, and bolder beast. First seizing Taiwan, and putting down rebellions on the island with extreme prejudice. Next it was Dalian, squabbled over with by the Russians. Next, Korea, brutally annexed and forced into compliance. Unsatisfied, they attempted to seize Shandong from the weak and ailing Yuan Shikai. Undeterred they would try their hand again with their erstwhile ally Duan Qirui, which was only fought against by our brave diplomatic corps.\n\nWith the brutes again setting their eyes upon another piece of our nation, that of Dongbei, \"backing\" Marshal Zhang Zuolin's government, it would appear that the Japanese will not back down until a full bloodletting is achieved. To prepare for such an event, and to reform our army so that it can withstand such a situation, Marshal Wu Peifu has convened a meeting of his highest military theorists and tacticians. Gathered around the table are the likes of the esteemed theorist Jiang Baili, military diplomat Tang Zaili, Marshal Wang Chengbin (on behalf of President Cao), Zhang Qihuang and Yu Xuezhong amongst offers.\n\nOf pressing concern is picking a centralised defence strategy for the inevitable war with Japan and Fengtian. Having long been a military theorist, with the reputation of being Cai E's chief of staff and Liang Qichao's apprentice, Jiang Baili has present a plan focusing on constructing an army of exceptional officers, inclined to wage a war of national salvation in totality. Alongside this, it focuses on improving the general drill and capabilities of our soldiers.\n\nRunning tagentially but not in opposition, Tang Zaili presents a plan focused on the resumption of the German Military's 80 Division Plan that was unfortunately cut short following deterioration of relations. With it, he would see the Zhili army transformed into a \"Heer of the East\", focused on an elite core of mobile divisions that are able to encircle and annihilate the enemy with daring tenacity.\n\nWith Zhang Qihuang throwing his backing behind Jiang, and Yu Xuezhong doing the same, Wang Chengbin has — perhaps to scorn Wu personally — backed Tang Zaili. Whilst usually insignifcant, Wang is acting on behalf of President Cao, Wu's mentor and superior. Nonetheless, Marshal Wu has the ultimate prerogative to decide."

Through courage, know-how, and access to modern technologies, it is believed that China can pull herself up by her own bootstraps until she is ready to compete in the international arena, held down no longer by foreign imperialists. Aviation, and in particular military aviation, could be the key to literal strength in international confrontations, but the ability to take and use aerial photos also meant that aviation could also provide the key to a scientific, objective — and therefore modern and advanced — view of the world.\n\nOne of China's most famed aviation celebrities, Sun Tonggang, \"The Lindbergh of the East\", adjourned by the likes of Zhang Huichang, the \"Lindbergh of China\" are two exemplary figures of the advance of Chinese aviation. With Sun born in 1895, and Zhang in 1899, they are exceedingly young men serving as daredevil pioneers, and renowned celebrities.\n\nWith Zhang a Chinese-American prodigy at a young age, he would initially find himself as Dr. Sun's aide-de-camp in 1918. Organising an airforce and fighting in the Yue-Gui wars, he would have a daring career, being injured in the Northern Expedition. Yet his ideological convictions could not trump his love for flying, and so here he is, a celebrity due to his cross-nation flight, arousing public interest and becoming a national hero.\n\nSoaring into the spotlight, Sun Tonggang descends not from America's flight academies but that of Germany's, a sign of China's special relationship in action. Flying his personal plane, \"National Salvation\", Sun is the epitome of calculated aeronautical razzle-dazzle, having set off from Germany himself, all the way to China, arriving in Najing a month later. Met warmly by President Cao, Sun spread his message of daredevil aviation through media and through action, becoming a favourite of Chinese magazines."

Despite this, we must still manoeuvre with caution when making deals with the Reich, so as to not be seen as their stooges again and taking only what we absolutely need instead of outright re-embracing our erstwhile masters.\n\nRight now, there are two offers coming from the German side, one for the return of Luftstreitkräfte advisors to continue their work with the Chinese Air Force, or a lucrative contract with Siemens to manufacture machinery and other electrical equipment in cooperation with our Beiyang Production Bureaus, which we're sorely in need of at the moment."

Claiming matters of \"internal security\" take precedent over assisting the Central Government, all within the Cabinet, alongside Marshals Wu, Wang and President Cao believe it is utter hogwash.\n\nWith Marshal Wang almost demanding a two-front war to subjugate the Southern Zhili too, his tempers have been calmed as the Prosperity League delegation reassures the President and Marshals that the German delegation in the Peking-Kommission is hard at work, putting pressure on the League-Marshal to \"encourage\" him to intervene."

They have denounced our rightful government as illegitimate, calling us \"little more than a German puppet, slave to the whims of Berlin!\" We can only hope that the remnants of Sun's forces can put these traitors down.\n\nHowever if not, then the seizure of the incredibly profitable League territories by the radical revolutionary party-state is sure to pose a future obstacle for our governance.

Alongside Tang Xiangming, the defection of Old Guizhou Clique ringleader Yuan Zuming during the Northern Expedition has granted the Marshal another lever to tug in his favour.\n\nWith the ensuing collapse of the League, Zhao has taken an outwardly neutral stance towards political alignments, however, should that be his folly, Tang Xiangming might be inclined to act. His neutrality cannot last long, for with the announcement of Hunan's Provincial Governor elections, clouds are beginning to circle around his rule of the province."

While initially concern ran high that this sect would create chaos in our lands, level heads prevailed, pointing out that the Yiguandao are but a mere millenial death cult, nothing capable of capsizing the Central Government.\n\nThe cult is isolated, and once the chaos to the south has stabilised we may able to attack them, ejecting a blight from the lands of China once and for all. Marshal Wang has already, rather reluctantly, requested audience with Wu Peifu, to discuss battleplans."

Frequently fought between the likes of the Anhui, Zhili and Fengtian Cliques, it has experienced numerous Governors in previous times, but none have been as detrimental and horrific as that of Zhang Zongchang. An erratic, violent and depraved man, Zhang maintains close ties to Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian Clique, being a member himself.\n\nHaving reclaimed full authority in Shandong in the wake of the League Collapse, he has utilised the chaos enveloping the south to cast off all authority of the Zhili within the province. This morning, a number of our tax-collectors were shot at by Zongchang's border guards at the provincial border, and Wang Yujia's spies within the province report that Zongchang has already set forth turning the province into a debauchery filled hellhole, carrying out mass purges of Zhili officials.\n\nEven worse, he has reportedly received the full backing of Zhang Zuolin and the Japanese.

A moderate reformer prioritising good, moral governance, Qu Yingguang is not a full-blooded member of the Zhili's inner circle, having ex-Anhui ties, but he is nonetheless not openly hostile to Cao, Wu or the Zhili.\n\nWith Governor Qu promising to uphold the Central Government's authority within his province, it would appear that the people of Shandong can rejoice once again, not fearing abduction or muder by the Dogmeat General's goons. Reportedly Old Marshal Zhang Zuolin in Shenyang is furious, having lost not just the chance at a whole province, but one of his most trusted comrades too."

Yang Sen, a longtime power player in the Red Basin and ally of Wu Peifu had ruled the province on the back of a shaky alliance with other provincial cliques like the Baoding Department.\n\nThis tenuous balance, however, has not proven to be enough to contain each defence zone leader's ambitions, as other factions loyal to Kuomintang remnants, the ideals of Federalism as well as mere opportunism make their move following the mobilisation of Liu Xiang's Industrial Corps against Yang's administration. Yang himself has yet to request support from Beijing, claiming in telegrams that there is nothing more than banditry and that provincial affairs are under control.\n\nMany in the Zhili high command, including Marshals Wu and Wang, remain on high alert, counting down the days until \"General Senwei\" calls for assistance once more."

A testament to the fact that democracy can work in China, this leaves the Central Government with a rather difficult situation. Not overtly in opposition to our governance, Zhao is still no clear cut ally. Despite the assurances of the Governor that he seeks to maintain his neutral stance, should a Federalist ally of his proclaim a national government, there is no doubt that he would quickly align with them.\n\nHowever, with the Kuomintang's foolish bid to contest the election ending in defeat, the ringleaders may have departed, but their influence has not. Not comparable to the intense fighting within MinGan, there still remains a low level insurgency within Hunan, having been left behind by the Kuomintang's mobilisation of the lower classes within the province.\n\nShould Zhao fail to keep things under control, our staunch ally Tang Xiangming might be inclined to act. Likewise, if Zhao cannot find any fellow Federalist allies in time, he very well might return to the fold."

A fierce anti-monarchy revolutionary since before Xinhai, Zhao is absolutely no friend of us or our allies. Even worse, he is bound to end up in the hands of the Federalists should they proclaim a national government to rival the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nEverything is not all sunshine and rainbows for the Governor either though, for following the Kuomintang's departure after their failed bid for the Governorship, they left behind an intensely mobilised radical worker and peasant insurgency, aiming to overthrow Zhao in their stead. No doubt able to weaken his rule, Zhao most certainly cannot challenge the Court on his own.\n\nMore concerning, is the continued Zhili presence within Hunan's borders, for Yueyang Garrison commander Tang Xiangming has received and welcomed numerous Zhili refugees into his camp, no doubt strengthening his forces as he eyes the border with concern."

A fool by any standard of the imagination, previously incumbent governor of Hunan province, Zhao Hengti, thought he could institute a genuinely free and fair election, and has payed the price.\n\nLosing his tenureship to a joint Left-Right Kuomintang United Front, he has reportedly retired from politics, accepting defeat willfully. This will not do, for the Kuomintang are staunchly anti-Zhili, and will no doubt desire stringent revenge for our conflicts in the past.\n\nNot all is lost however, as we still maintain numerous assets within Hunan, Yuan Zuming and his Old Guizhou Clique, and more importantly, commander of the Yueyang Garrison, Tang Xiangming. Having recently received a telegram from the latter, it would seem that Tang is similarly incensed to act over the Kuomintang's electoral victory, requesting material assistance to assure his victory. Whilst no doubt costly, he has promised us sincerely that the guns would guarantee Hunan's alignment to the Zhili, it is certainly a costly price to pay.\n\nHowever, whether we accede to his request or not, it is evidently clear that Tang Xiangming will march on the provincial capital of Changsha one way or another, and so we might not even have to pay the cost at all."
 qiefor.111.d.manchu: "Despite the tumultuous time occuring in the Court and Central Government, issues continue to arise elsewhere within the nation. Following the collapse of the League, the insurgents within MinGan seized the opportunity and rose up against the rotting Zhili corpse of the Smiling Tiger, however that was not the only exclusive area of Kuomintang operations within China.\n\nAfter declaring Provincial Elections for Governor, Zhao Hengti presumed he would be running against the other democratic parties comprising his assembly, and yet upon their announcement, Kuomintang generals Tang Shengzhi and Cheng Qian simultaneously invaded from MinGan and Guizhou respectively. Having formed a United Front to contest the election against the incumbent Zhao, it would appear that Zhao's principles were his folly, as the Kuomintang recently secured the Governor position.\n\nEven worse, despite our beheading of the snake in the Manchu Coup, Zhili holdouts still remain dotted across the nation. Close to our heart of Wuhan, and with extensive ties to the Central Government and Zhili, General Tang Xiangming appears to be preparing for his own coup attempt, aimed at eradicating the Kuomintang presence within the province.

Depriving it from the Zhili's enemies, he has reportedly brought forth his own brother, Tang Hualong, to serve as the civilian arm of his government. Having previously served as Mayor of Yueyang, some hold out hopes that Tang Hualong, notorious for his ties to democratic reformer Liang Qichao and James Yen, will act as a moderating force for the military rule of Governor Tang Xiangming.\n\nIntent on securing Hunan for the Zhili, and maintaining its stability, Tang has reportedly drafted plans for a \"Defence Commission\", intent on eradicating Kuomintang insurgents, annihilating Chinese Syndicalist Party infiltrators within Changsha, and reinforcing the province's protection. Whatever the case is, our gambit has payed off, for Hunan is firmly within the hands of the Zhili."

Of course, the Central Government has provided a front of acceptable deniability to reporters, insisting that the commander acted on his own initiative. Behind closed walls however, our leading commanders are openly furious that the gambit failed, directing blame at the general staff, Zhili soldiers, and of course, Tang Xiangming himself.\n\nHowever, perhaps most fortunately, Tang Xiangming has managed to survive his failure, having escaped by the skin of his teeth in the aftermath. Always valuing the Zhili and his career above all else, Tang has once again pledged his devout loyalties towards the Zhili, insisting that he shall pay for his failures with servitude. Of course, Tang himself is a capable general and skilled admiral, with no doubts about his loyalties. Yet, can we muster the courage to recruit such an abject failure?"

Regardless, the rise of the Officer Department has come with the downfall of a loyal Zhili ally in Sichuan and left our flank unguarded. As such, many firebrands in the Zhili high command have expressed the need to depose them as soon as possible, seeing them as a potential threat to the security of our administration.

Tang Xiangming however, decided to keep the state of martial law, citing threats abound still lurking in the shadows, and outside the Provinces borders.\n\nThe negative reaction to this news wasn't contained to Hunan.

Vindicated, treasured and well-regarded, one can only wonder about the pride Cao Kun must feel, seeing his nation-building plan come to fruition."
 qiefor.151.a: "It all comes together..."

 qiefor.152.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 qiefor.152.d: "Practically laughing us our diplomats out of the discussion chamber, the German Eagle has continued to spit in our face! Refusing any and all agreement between the Central Government, the German's have resoundly torn up any prospective Sino-German economic endeavours. With outrage being directed at the Peking-Kommission, Prosperity League and other fronts for German influence, the various parties have attempted their best efforts to calm tempers. Yet with a final refusal of an equal economic agreement, many believe that the Germans merely see us as pliable pawns for their world order."
 qiefor.152.a: "The aid? What was it all for?"

 qiefor.153.t: "Southern Fleet flees Northwards!"
 qiefor.153.d: "The once prideful Chinese fleet, oh how sad its state is in the modern era. With China's ships having once dominated the whole of Asia's waterways, having even reached as far as America, it now can hardly protect its own coastline. Even in the Modern Era, the Beiyang fleet was formidable, having been the largest fleet in Asia in the 1880s, and the 8th largest in the whole world. Ultimately, the sheer tonnage stood no chance against the rapidly modernised and extensively drilled Japanese navy, resulting in its absolute annihilation alongside the likes of the Nanyang Fleet, and later the Guangdong and Fujian fleets.\n\nYet it was not over, resuscitated twice by the likes of Minister of the Navy Sa Zhenbing (in his youth), the apolitical admiralty and its admirable quantity of ships has desperately tried its best to defend China's expansive coastline. As it stands now however, the Beiyang Fleet is rather hopelessly torn apart. Split between the fleet in the North under the auspices of Admiral Sa, the fleet in the South under command of Admiral Wu Zhennan, and the fleets in Fengtian, or Guangdong, commanded by rival admiralty.\n\nAmusingly however, following the chaos of the League Collapse, the fate of the Southern Beiyang Fleet was particularly up in the air, with many of its younger officers defecting to the Kuomintang or Anti-Concessionists. Weathering the storm as always, it would appear that Admiral Wu's loyalties to the fleet trump any ideological tenets. Reportedly, a signifcant portion of the fleet under Admiral Wu's command has arrived in our hastily put together ports in Tianjin. Adjourning our present fleet, Admirals Sa, Yang and Wu have met officially to enunciate the integration of the Southern fleet into the Northern fleet's command structure."
 qiefor.153.a: "First step to bridging the divide."

 qiefor.154.t: "The Smiling Tiger's Aficionados"
 qiefor.154.d: "Disaster runs amok in the decaying inferno of flame and fury that is the League of Eight Province's corpse. With those previously allied to the former League Marshal Sun either fleeing to the Legations, the underworld, or folding into the arms of the Anti-Concessionists. The Jade Marshal, in his smug benevolence as ever, has chastised the likes of the Jinbao faction for backing the wrong horse. Although the grin cannot hide the serious contemplation in the maze of Wu's mind. With the League now destroyed, the Southeastern flank of the Zhili is once again a sorespot of defense, and could potentially be exploited by the Old Marshal.\n\nWith Governor Xiao now mandating all of his soldiers to be positioned on Hubei's border with Anhui, and Governor Li Jichen acting similarly, it deprives our borders with \"Marshal Wait-and-See\", Governor Yan, within Shanxi alongside the unruly traitor Feng Yuxiang within Shaanxi of any reliable defense against incursion. It is evident even to our worse strategists that the Zhili are on the backfoot. Yet miraculously a light manifests in this period of intrepid, all consuming darkness.\n\nHaving long thought many of the Smiling Tiger's men to have dissipated, such is the fate of most unruly warlord coalitions, many believed our equipment and own manpower had been sunk with them. Nonetheless whilst enamoured in heated discussion within the Jade Marshal's headquarters in Luoyang, Commander Yu Xuezhong burst into the meeting chamber, carrying with him a telegram transcript, and notably flanked by the likes of Liu Zongji, Meng Zhaoyue and Xie Hongxun. Notorious heavyweights within the Smiling Tiger's inner-circle, they have offered their services, men and guns to the North Zhili. All too delighted, Marshal Wang Chengbin accepted their offer, but the Zhili High Command is a two-gun show, and he Jade Marshal has the deciding vote."

###- Shanxi Mining Chain -###
 qiefor.24.t: "Rich Vein Discovered!"
 qiefor.24.d: "Following our recent focus on mining in the Shanxi region we have uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth. Having seized this disputed area from Governor Yan during the last Zhifeng war, managing it has brought us considerable profit. Our engineers have just discovered a new vein full of coal and iron ore. The only problem, however, is that it extends underground into the remaining territory occupied by [SHX.GetName]. While we could mine this, [SHX.GetAdjective] engineers will no doubt notice the incursion.\n\nEver since the League Collapse, Shanxi has undergone a tremendous economic overhaul which has been largely hostile to outside investment thus far. This includes our own official government of the nation, which they have pointedly treated as an external entity. Although we have made some headway in earning influence within the province, our military occupation of Eastern Shanxi has always been a sore spot in our relationship with them. He has been known to play [FNG.GetLeader] against us, attempting to act as a counterbalancing to both sides in northern China's power games.\n\nStill, we are the legitimate government of the nation, and we ought to use China's resources as we see fit. Especially when it comes to strategic resources integral to defending our nation. It would save us a lot of red tape to simply press the issue, though some worry the escalation in tensions might be far more than its worth."
 qiefor.24.a: "Dig deeply and greedily!"
 qiefor.24.b: "Surely we can come to an arrangement."

 qiefor.24001.t: "The [QIE.GetName] Propose a Joint-Mining Project"
 qiefor.24001.d: "In their quest towards national self sufficiency in terms of strategic natural resources, the [QIE.GetName] has uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth, a vein of which has extended deep into our own territories. They have proposed a cooperation between their engineers and mining interests, possibly backed by foreign investments, to help with extraction of coal and iron ore in Shanxi province. We would of course receive what they see as a \"fair share\" and the net profits are expected to be considerable for both sides.\n\nWe are reminded however that the military of [QIE.GetName] continues to occupy our rightful territory in eastern Shanxi despite having remained loyal to them for nearly a decade. They have either refused to pay or have paid a pittance for their usage of the wealth in that region, money that ought to be in the provincial treasury. On principle, some have argued, we should reject agreement with Beijing until the occupation ends."
 qiefor.24001.a: "We accept this proposition."
 qiefor.24001.b: "We can handle mining ourselves."

 qiefor.24002.t: "Rich Vein Discovered!"
 qiefor.24002.d: "Following our recent focus on mining in the Shanxi region we have uncovered vast deposits of mineral wealth. This has coincided positively with the recent turn Shanxi has taken, liberalising some commerce and reducing the financial isolation Shanxi has undergone since its bitter defeat in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war. Their ambitious economic overhaul, known as the \"Ten Year Plan\", has not gone unnoticed, though the extent to which it is being genuinely used to foster local prosperity versus serving as a mechanism for challenging our rule is unknown for now.\n\nWhat has been discovered, however, is a very valuable and rich vein of ore extending deep into Shanxi territory. Their outward facing economic policy leaves open the possibility that they may be open to engaging in a mutually beneficial mineral extraction project, greatly expanding the amount of coal and iron produced for the security of the whole Chinese nation. It would also expand our influence, but all of this is contingent on the acceptance of the fickle [SHX.GetLeader]."
 qiefor.24002.a: "Surely we can come to an arrangement."
 qiefor.24002.b: "We should leave things be."

 qiefor.25.t: "[QIE.GetAdjectiveCap] Miners Approach Territory!"
 qiefor.25.d: "Grave news has arrived from our disputed border with the [QIE.GetName]. Our engineers have discovered [QIE.GetAdjective] tunnels extending into our territory, with streams of foreign miners and machines intruding into our rightful domain. They are protected by troops from the central army, a grave insult that ever reminds us of the land stolen from us after the disastrous Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War. Now, not only are they collecting unjustly the royalties from the occupied lands in eastern Shanxi, they are also working to take what deposits we own in the western mountains for their own nefarious ends.\n\nThis grave insult and arrogance on the part of the [QIE.GetAdjective] will never end unless we stand up for ourselves, though doing so in face of a much stronger force is always risky. Still, if we say nothing, who knows what will the next escalation be? The ace card in our hand might be to invoke the threat other interested powers in the region..."
 qiefor.25.a: "Lodge a formal complaint."
 qiefor.25.b: "We bide our time, for now."

 qiefor.26.t: "[SHX.GetNameDefCap] Protests Our Mining Operations!"
 qiefor.26.intro: "[SHX.GetLeader] has lodged a formal protest with the Bureau of Mines, claiming that our miners have violated his provincial boundaries. His message brings up a litany of complaints, mostly grievances from our dealings related to Eastern Shanxi from the last few years. To back up his words, he has ordered his provincial army to amass along the border to carry out military exercises. This has sharply escalated tensions, and word has spread that he will soon be ejecting our miners by force."
 qiefor.26.d.fengtian: "$qiefor.26.intro$\n\nNormally, we would simply dismiss this as posturing or [SHX.GetLeader] implying trying to secure another payout, but he has also noted that should Beijing fail to act accordingly, he will seek out \"responsible government to address the problem\". This is almost definitely a pointed threat to ally with [FNG.GetLeader] in Fengtian, a challenge to our rule in the northern part of the nation and risking the reigniting of conflict. Sandwiched between both factions, while we are still favoured to defeat both in a conflict like we did in the 1920s, it would likely leave our southern flank exposed to developments in the south."
 qiefor.26.d.nofengtian: "$qiefor.26.intro$\n\nThe demise of Zhang Zuolin has lessened this threat considerably, however we ought to be at least somewhat cautious nonetheless. Shanxi has many mountains and few easily navigable passages. Not to mention multiple rivers bisecting the area. An invasion of the province should things escalate further will likely eventually end in our victory, but not without significant opportunity cost."
 qiefor.26.a: "Who cares? Keep mining!"
 qiefor.26.b: "Back down, this is getting risky."

 qiefor.27.t: "[QIE.GetNameDefCap] Ignored Us!"
 qiefor.27.d.nofengtian: "Unsurprisingly, the [QIE.GetName] ignored our request. Their perfidious miners continue to extend their grasp into our vast mineral wealth, ignoring our complaints and violating various decrees issued by our Governor. With our intentions clearly stated and since ignored, it is up to us now to decide whether or not it is worth enforcing. Sending troops into the disputed border areas eject those operating without a permit issued from Taiyuan is a risky option, but to fail to do so would make us appear weak."
 qiefor.27.d.fengtian: "$qiefor.27.d.nofengtian$\n\nAnother option available to us would be to enlist the support of the [FNG.GetName]. Ruled by the ambitious warlord [FNG.GetLeader], the Yan clique has previously worked with them to disastrous results in 1928 hoping to topple the Zhili clique in their moment of weakness. This is how we lost control of Eastern Shanxi in the first place, and many are not eager to cast their lots with them again. However, alone we are unlikely to be much of a match for the central army. Still, siding with them will mean depending on them for a successful outcome, and should they not come through we will be forced to back down."
 qiefor.27.a: "We place our full faith in [FNG.GetLeader]."
 qiefor.27.b: "Escalate and block further mining operations!"
 qiefor.27.c: "Back down, this has gone too far.."

 qiefor.27001.t: "Shanxi Blocks Our Engineers!"
 qiefor.27001.d: "In a brazen move of defiance against our authority, [SHX.GetLeader] has deployed troops in an armed attempt to prevent further mining operations along the disputed Eastern Shanxi area. They have confiscated many valuable machines after refusing to acknowledge the permits we have issued, arresting many of our miners and forced others to flee to the safety of our own lines. As our own garrisons in the area scramble to meet the challenge, Shanxi is looking increasingly like a warzone.\n\nWith tensions skyrocketing, many investors have already been spooked and withdrawn their funding for further projects. The roads and rails are filled with those fleeing the border area, and many of our own mining staff are no longer willing to work in what appears to be a dangerous environment. It seems that our economic investment in the area has already been spoiled, but that does not mean this has to be for nothing.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we can clearly charge [SHX.GetLeader] and his cronies for sedition, rebellion and a host of other crimes against our state. An arrest warrant can be quickly assembled, even if it would mean losing out on most of our remaining investments. If he would like to enforce his \"decrees\", then we can surely enforce ours."
 qiefor.27001.a: "They will pay for their insolence."
 qiefor.27001.b: "They have made their point, we will retreat."

 qiefor.28.t: "[QIE.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Backs Down!"
 qiefor.28.d: "In face of our assertive stance and fearing the possibility of escalation, [QIE.GetNameDef] have quietly backed down. Their miners and engineers have left our territory, leaving us victorious in this dispute. Sympathetic voices in Taiyuan have fallen silent as those hoping to profit off [QIE.GetAdjective] encroachment now dread our retaliation as we move to assert our authority over the entire province. This is a double edged sword of course, as investments by those loyal to Beijing as well as international conglomerates have grown more hesitant to invest in what they see as an upstart province.\n\nThis should not detract from our celebration of what happened here however. We have scored a major victory against an overzealous central government, without firing a shot and avoiding any violent conflict. Moreover, thanks to the existing work those miners have done, we can now reap the benefits of Shanxi's richness for ourselves, the rightful owners."
 qiefor.28.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.29.t: "Shanxi Back Down!"
 qiefor.29.d: "In wake of our show of strength, [SHX.GetLeader] has ordered his men to stand down and the entire [SHX.GetName] to back away from the simmering dispute over mineral rights in Eastern Shanxi. This has allowed our miners access the valuable mineral veins in the area undisturbed, with nearly completely unfettered access to not only Eastern Shanxi but indeed almost all of the province. This is a great victory, allowing us to supply critical strategic resources for our war machine as we work towards national unification. [SHX.GetLeader]'s own status as a national figure has been cut down to size, humiliated over this outcome and forced to acknowledge our superiority, at least for the time being. He will have to be brought to heel eventually, but our victory today will probably be the first step in bringing Shanxi back into the fold."
 qiefor.29.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.30.t: "Mining Crisis in Shanxi!"
 qiefor.30.d: "What began as a minor spat over resource rights in Shanxi province has rapidly escalated over the last few months along the Shanxi-[QIE.GetName] border, presenting both risk and opportunity as we are potentially drawn into a simmering conflict in northern China. At the end of the failed Northern Expedition, Zhang Zuolin successfully brokered a secret pact between the Fengtian clique and a coalition of allies including Yan Xishan of Shanxi, Zhang Zongchang of Shandong, and Tang Jiyao of Yunnan.\n\nAn attempt to quickly defeat the Zhili clique failed with Shandong's defection and allied failure to make much progress, with Shanxi suffering the worst of the consequences. The eastern half of their province was occupied by [QIE.GetAdjective] forces since 1928, including their precious coal and iron reserves. The [QIE.GetAdjective] leadership apparently grew too greedy as of late, resulting in forces being amassed once more and threatening the balance of power in north China.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] is asking us to step in and guarantee his provincial borders. Although on the best of terms, the presence of his armies to the west threatens Zhili hold over crucial cities such as Baoding, Luoyang and Xi'an. His province's geography is quite favourable to defence, but he lacks the industrial base to hold out forever. If we let him become trampled under foot, defeating the [QIE.GetName] becomes considerably harder. On the other hand, getting involved puts our reputation on the line, and perhaps is not the best course of action."
 qiefor.30.a: "Time to step in!"
 qiefor.30.b: "We are not ready."

 qiefor.31.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Steps In"
 qiefor.31.d: "In our team of desperate need, [FNG.GetLeader] has come to our rescue. In a pointed message to [QIE.Capital.GetName], he has promised to guarantee our provincial borders against encroachment by [QIE.GetAdjective] agents, asserting that any legitimate government in China ought to respect provincial boundaries in authority. Zhang Zuolin's actual commitment to such federalist rhetoric is highly transient, but his military strength is not. Should the [QIE.GetName] continue to 'violate the boundaries of our province', he claims he will come to our aid, threatening a war on two fronts for the already overstretched [QIE.GetAdjective] army."
 qiefor.31.a: "Great!"

 qiefor.32.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Protect Shanxi!"
 qiefor.32.d: "It appears that [SHX.GetLeader] was serious in his threat to reach out to the Fengtian - [FNG.GetLeader] has just announced he will protect the 'provincial integrity' of Shanxi against any 'rebel incursions'. This is a betrayal of the highest order and another sign that our national order has crumbled.\n\nHis actual ability to follow up with his threat however, remains in question. The Fengtian clique has numerous pressing issues, and is not necessarily eager for an actual large-scale war. The degree to which Japanese aid has improved his situation compared to our own military development over the last decade or so is questionable, and indeed we have defeated the combined might of both Fengtian and Shanxi in the past.\n\nHowever, we would be wise as to not underestimate the challenges of fighting a two fronted war, especially as we monitor the southern situation. Calling Fengtian's bluff is a risky play, no matter the scenario. But backing down now would make us look weak and embolden further action. The nation awaits us to make a final decision."
 qiefor.32.a: "Call their bluff - move troops into the area!"
 qiefor.32.b: "This is too risky. Stand down."

 qiefor.33.t: "Skirmishes on the Border!"
 qiefor.33.d: "It appears the fools in Beijing did not listen to reason! They have begun to move troops of their into the disputed mining areas, firing at the provincial units we have stationed there. Already we are hearing reports of isolated skirmishes between border guards and [QIE.GetAdjective] troops as war looms. As our men quickly rush into position across the front line, we must reach out to [FNG.GetLeader] for help at once! Combined, we will have the strength not only to hold off the advances of the so-called central army, but with any luck end the [QIE.GetName] once and for all!"
 qiefor.33.a: "Call [FNG.GetLeader] for aid!"

 qiefor.34.t: "Skirmishes on Shanxi-[QIE.GetNonIdeologyName] Border!"
 qiefor.34.d: "It appears that the [QIE.GetAdjective] have ignored our threats! Reports from [SHX.Capital.GetName] indicate that [QIE.GetAdjective] advance forces moved into the disputed territories over the last week, and have begun to attack border garrisons. Contrary to some expectations, it seems like the [SHX.GetAdjective] army has stood their ground - at least for now. Supplied with quality rifles and artillery from Taiyuan and relying on their knowledge of local terrain, the fact that they did not crumple immediately into a rout gives hope that they may prevail.\n\nThis could be the opportunity we have waited for - a chance to reverse the humiliation of 1928! With many [QIE.GetAdjective] divisions distracted attempting to quickly seize Taiyuan, we may finally be afforded the chance to storm Beijing and hopefully link up with [SHX.GetAdjective] forces. With the eyes of the nation fixed upon us, we must decide on our next move."
 qiefor.34.a: "Honour our commitment. To war!"
 qiefor.34.b: "Back down. We can't beat them yet..."

 qiefor.35.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Attacks!"
 qiefor.35.d: "Our attempts to call Zhang Zuolin's bluff failed - he has begun mobilise his troops and formally declared war on us! Surrounded on two sides, we must rely on our defences along the Dai River, superior training and better resources to grind down the [FNG.GetAdjective] offensive. In the meantime, the [SHX.GetAdjective] army is unlikely to pose a considerable threat, though the long front line we share with them will unfortunately tie up many divisions. If we are to recreate our victory in 1928, we will have to work intelligently and bravely - the superior discipline of our army will carry the day. At this point, we are fighting for far more than just a few extra mines or taxation rights, we are now locked into a battle for the fate of the nation."
 qiefor.35.a: "Ready the troops!"

 qiefor.36.t: "[FNG.GetNonIdeologyNameDefCap] Back Down!"
 qiefor.36.d: "Our plan to call [FNG.GetLeader]'s bluff has succeeded! We have heard nothing from his government after we sent our troops into the disputed areas and we can now safely assume that we have free rein to do whatever we want with the Shanxi province! Already [SHX.GetName]'s armies have been thrown into disarray as they are forced to fend for themselves. Still, with the mountains and rivers behind them, they are expected to put up a considerable fight.\n\nWe have undoubtedly won the battle for eastern Shanxi, but whether or not to pursue the routing [SHX.GetAdjective] army west is another question. [SHX.GetLeader] has offered an array of primarily economic but some political concessions in hopes of staving off invasion. The more hawkish elements of our government have proposed that we destroy the traitorous [SHX.GetLeader], eliminating the threat permanently. The more cautions ministers however, warn that getting bogged down fighting in Shanxi may leave us vulnerable in the future."
 qiefor.36.a: "Easy pickings!"
 qiefor.36.b: "We have taught [SHX.GetNameDef] a less they won't forget."

 qiefor.37.t: "The [FNG.GetName] Back Down!"
 qiefor.37.d: "The traitorous [FNG.GetLeader] has let us down! Despite our request for assistance he has ignored us in the face of [QIE.GetAdjective] aggression, leaving us to manage our own fate. Seeing little choice and running short on options, [SHX.GetLeader] has quickly assembled a series of frantic proposals that will trade some of autonomy in the form of concessions in exchange for peace along the central plains. With few other options after our recent treachery in aligning with Fengtian, we have little choice but to hope they accept."
 qiefor.37.a: "Damnation!"

###- Eyes on the Border Event Chain -###
 qiefor.90.t: "Beijing looks weak."
 qiefor.90.d: "As the regime in Beijing continues to focus more and more forces to their south and west they have become far too deaf to our forces poised just across the border in Manchuria. As the days have passed certain enterprising units have pushed across what was a once tightly held frontier. Finding little opposition to their advance by the disorganised and demoralised [QIE.GetAdjective] forces, having suffered recent purges thanks to political instability in the capital, the vanguard became quickly emboldened. Field officers, eager for glory and a chance to prove themselves, pressed forward without further consultations with their superiors and within days our flag waved triumphant over Shanhaiguan,a critical pass in the Great Wall.\n\nAs news spread of our advance, the [QIE.GetAdjective] retreat quickly became a rout. Trenches and defences along the previously well fortified border were abandoned without a fight and we gave chase up to the Dai River before regionalist protests erupted in Shenyang and rail strikes broke out in the recently captured Qinhuangdao. From there, our senior officers retook command, deciding to stabilise our position along a natural front rather than press the advantage in risk a turnaround."
 qiefor.90.a: "We are one step closer to Beijing!"

 qiefor.91.t: "We Flinched in Shanhaiguan"
 qiefor.91.d: "As the war to the west and south fail to materialise a victory for the new government our great rival to the north has finally made a move. Fengtian soldiers strode forward with little resistance as we were too weak to contest them, humiliating losing the Shanhai pass (Shanhaiguan) and thus the symbolically important Great Wall. The garrison manning the border, undermanned and under-motivated, evidently lost heart and routed in face of the enemy advance, yielding valuable forward defences without firing a shot.\n\nWe were very lucky that the Dai River proved too great an obstacle for the Northeast Army to continue and add to our humiliations, and our generals were successful in re-establishing order on the other side. Still, the incident has badly shaken morale and commanders there have begged for further reinforcements to prevent a repeat of the incident. They warn that the Dai River can only hold off [FNG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s ambitions for so long, and whatever threat we may face in the Central Plains, it cannot compare to the danger losing Beijing poses."
 qiefor.91.a: "The irony has not been lost among the Manchu."

 qiefor.92.t: "The Bridge on the River Dai"
 qiefor.92.d: "Despite our victorious entry through the Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in the Great Wall and their utter rout to the Dai River, the [QIE.GetAdjective] high command has been slow to to acknowledge their defeat. Either because of poor communication or general incompetence or because of a stubborn desire to see the Guominjun destroyed in the Central Plains, their response has been lumbering and ineffectual - leaving major gaps across the river which had become a natural boundary of sorts.\n\nThough our own high command was satisfied with the outcome and reluctant to press forward, scouting parties probing the area were more ambitious. Soon enough, they came across multiple lightly (or in some cases unguarded even) access points and soon enough bridgeheads were made. It quickly became a mad dash by overeager officers trying to claim they were first in reaching Beijing. As men finally reached the outskirts of the city local police belatedly started firing back from fortified positions, forcing a halt. Fearing overextension orders from on high cut back any further advances. As Beijing is within eyeshot of the new Fengtian border it remains to be seen how long until the Grand Marshal orders it's capture."
 qiefor.92.a: "This defeat is the gateway to many victories."

 qiefor.93.t: "Beijing in Peril!"
 qiefor.93.d: "Despite our disastrous loss of the Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in the Great Wall and our forces' utter rout to the Dai River, it seems our high command has been slow to acknowledge their defeat. Either because of poor communication or general incompetence or because of a stubborn desire to see the Guominjun destroyed in the Central Plains, their response has been lumbering and ineffectual - leaving major gaps across the river which had become a natural boundary of sorts.\n\nEvidently unsatisfied with the natural demarcation of territory the Dai River provided, Fengtian scouting parties probed the area and came across multiple lightly guarded access points. Facing only minimum resistance, they made several bridgeheads which allowed for fighting to resume. A mad dash to Beijing ensured as once more our troops were put to flight. Thankfully outside of Beijing itself local police units were able to mount a last minute defence of the city and artillery fire from behind Fengtian lines seem to have hit their own advancing troops. This allowed our men to rally, and while we've lost much ground in this sudden offensive, the capital still holds. For now at least."

 qieflavor.10.t: "A Refugee from New York"
 qieflavor.10.d: "Edith Clifford Williams, an American artist, author, and librarian, has maintained a long-running correspondence with Hu Shih after the two met in New York while Hu was studying at Columbia University in New York City. She had an immense influence in developing Hu's political thought, and it is suspected (though unconfirmed) that the two were briefly lovers.\n\nHaving exchanged more than 150 letters as of the present moment, Hu Shih's championing of the adoption of the vernacular as the language for literacy expression in China is considered in-part to be due to the influence Williams and the avant-garde art movement had on Hu.\n\nBeing perhaps one of the few people in Hu's younger years to be able to disagree with Hu's rigidity in political and social thought, she no doubt holds a special place in Hu's heart. With Hu having drafted many love poems in his youth, albeit insisting that they are merely literary exercises, one can draw comparisons between the subjects of the poems and that of Edith.\n\nWith calamity having struck America, with the Civil War absolutely ravaging the country, Williams has once again written to Shih, requesting asylum and refugee status to escape the suffering. Hu, naturally, has accepted. Despite their estrangement over the years, Hu's feelings for Edith remain, and with the increasing exchange of letters, perhaps it has rekindled in both of them?"

 qieflavor.11.d: "Archaeological excavations around Anyang, Henan Province, have unearthed a massive bronze burial vessel from the Shang Dynasty. Thought to be the largest ancient bronze in the world, its discovery has been celebrated around the world as a massive victory for Chinese culture and history.\n\nFeaturing inscriptions reading as \"Queen Wu\", scholar Zhang Feng has interpreted the inscription to mean \"Simu Wu\". Rectangular in shape, it is wider and its walls are thicker compared to earlier \"Ding\". Each side has a blank space in the middle, surrounded by a band of decoration featuring a series of depictions of animal faced creatures alongside one legged dragons.\n\nIt is believed to be the ding of Fu Jing, primary wife of Wu Ding from the Shang, presumably made by her son, Zu Geng of Shang. However with the threat of war with Japan still looming large, archaeologists have reburied the sarcophagus, hoping that once threats to China's national integrity have been dealt with, they can exhibit it safely in a museum for further study."

The city served as Wu Peifu's headquarters for many years, and only a matter of hours earlier its last government officials, still loyal to the Jade Marshal, evacuated with all manner of secret papers and war plans in their armoured cars. Much of the city's population fled too, well aware of the impending attack, while the rest hunkered down to ride out the storm.\n\nNow the city lies practically deserted and burning, a shell of its former self, and a symbol of our desperate struggle for survival."
 qieflavor.28.a: "Luoyang will be avenged!"

 qieflavor.50.t: "Diary of the Think Tank"
 qieflavor.50.d: "An intellectual viewed with estrangement by his fellow thinkers, one would not be disavowed to assume that Bai Jianwu is but a mere orbiter of the Jade Marshal. That he is a traitor to the men of words, the men of literature. Surprisingly however, if one were to read Bai's very own diary, written with his own hand, one would picture that of a conflicted man, torn between his belief in Wu Peifu, his lacking self-respect, and his friendship with the likes of Li Dazhao, Hu Shih or Cai Yuanpei. Seeing consecutive input from 1915 to [GetYear], with a three-year gap in the 1920s, it provides a wonderful insight into\"Wu's Little Think Tank\".\n\nTraining to be a scholar, joining the Tongmenghui, witnessing the rapid decline of central authority and the disintegration of the new republic, all of these events happening in his youth, colouring his philosophy of the now. Diverging from his contemporaries, Bai would fold into Wu Peifu's employ as the Jade Marshal rose to power. Brokering an alliance between Wu and the Endeavour Theorists, between Wu and the Syndicalist Activists led by Li Dazhao in the Beijing-Hankou Railway Union Strike, Bai would document his efforts with unrelenting self-criticism.\n\nNoting his continuous flagging self-discipline and personal hardship, his diary paints a story of difficulty — loneliness, inadequate teaching, frustrations of dependence. He would reflect on how he so adored sunsets, birdsong, but lament that his work keeps him at his desk; regrets over his declining energy. When Wu Peifu was ejected, briefly, in 1924, Bai would stop writing for a time, only returning to the ink in time for the death of his parents, and two of his children.\n\nMusing, Bai notes in private that whilst he possesses intellectual maturity, waning ambition and rising competence, he also suggests that these only equipped him to deal philosophically with continuous failure. Ever diligent, ever critical of himself, the servant of Wu Peifu must carry on, for the whole of China requires the skills of Bai Jianwu. After all, the most detested quantity within Bai's mind is not himself. No, it is talk without immediate action."
 qieflavor.50.a: "His own harshest critic."

 qieflavor.51.t: "An Insight Into a Theorist"
 qieflavor.51.d: "That Jiang Baili is an eclectic thinker is perhaps no surprise to most people within his circle and those who set out to study him. Traces of the renowned general's intellectual engagement can be found anywhere from his study tour with Liang Qichao in Europe, or his musings about another one of his mentors, Cai E's ideas about the formation of a National People's State and the mobilisation of every able-bodied citizen of China into military service. None, however, draws the ire of the Jade Marshal more than Jiang's later engagement in the drafting of the Hunan Provincial Constitution. Presented with all of these fronts of the former Baoding principal's intellectual life, one may indeed find it difficult to force down a systematic framework on the renowned general, much less pigeonhole him into any sort of ideological school.\n\nYet even with that in mind, one might find his latest philosophical musings puzzling in character and questionable in validity. Titled \"The Japanese: Insights of a Foreigner\", Jiang's latest intellectual masterstroke seeks to hypothesize its way into a blueprint for the coming into existence of an all-encompassing character of the Japanese race. After introducing readers to the geographical conditions and customs that influenced the supposed universal temperament of the Japanese personality, Jiang then proceeds to divide the world into “northern” and southern” cultural spheres, where the former is dominated by sobriety and religion and the latter passion and energy, before ending on a seemingly ominous message of civilisational struggle.\n\nThe book, expectedly, has become the subject of ridicule across many intellectual circles, but it has also found its supporters in certain groups enthused by Jiang's call for total mobilisation and all-out struggle, perhaps seeing in said writings a sort of continuity from the mentors of Jiang's earliest years."
 qieflavor.51.a: "Perhaps he is right?"

 qieflavor.52.t: "Loyalty Matters"
 qieflavor.52.d: "It is perhaps quite surprising for Marshal Wang Chengbin to be in the position he is in. With one of his most pivotal acts being his betrayal of the Zhili Clique by becoming one of the secret Anti-Wu plotters that enacted the Beijing Coup of 1924. Even so, here he is, the third most powerful man within the Zhili Clique, and the military champion of the Jinbao faction. With closer analysis however, one can realise that his betrayal a decade ago was not out of greed, or hatred, but of loyalty. Loyalty to Cao Kun to the utmost.\n\nInitially meeting Cao as a subordinate to a commander, the duo would strike a swift companionship. Joined by Wu Peifu soon after, the trio would become the dominant trifecta of China in decades to come. And yet, with Wang briefly flirting with the Royalist Party in 1912, the devout Republican Wu would grow disgusted by his continued presence. Serving dutifully under Cao, Wang would fight and bleed for the Zhili wherever they went. Against the Huguojun, against Zhang Xun, in Hunan, and in the ZhiWan alongside ZhiFeng wars.\n\nCommanding and serving in all of these battles, Wang would fight in spite of Wu. In the aftermath of the ZhiWan war, Wu withdrew funds from Wang's troops. Before the ZhiFeng war, Wang would attempt to negotiate peace between Fengtian and Zhili, with his actions being used as evidence by Wu to eject him from high-level military meetings. Accusing him of being a spy. Even during the war, despite outstanding achievements, Wu would still dispatch intelligence officers to monitor Wang and his movements.\n\nEven when he aided Cao in becoming president, personally stealing the Seal of the President from Li Yuanhong and coordinating the bribery attempt, placing his reputation on the line and utilising all connections he could, Wu would merely opt to have Cao sideline him further, threatening him and seizing his division from his control."
 qieflavor.52.a: "The one man Wu Peifu feared."

 qieflavor.53.t: "Scion of Tianjin"
 qieflavor.53.d: "Even worse, Marshal Wang would endure hatred from the rest of Cao's subordinates. Ostensibly Governor of Zhili province, real power lied in the hands of Cao Rui. Losing his military power, Wang would become more and more bitter with Wu Peifu's continued harassment. From then onwards, Wang would work with similarly minded members of the Tianjin and Baoding cliques, alongside Feng Yuxiang, to attempt to eject Wu from power. So much so that Wang would form an anti-Wu Alliance with Qi Xieyuan and Feng Yuxiang, later joining the latter's anti-Wu alliance with the likes of Hu Jingyi and Sun Yue.\n\nRequesting that Cao let him resign several times, Wang would eventually be persuaded to carry on by Cao's earnest consolation. Aiming to fight the second ZhiFeng War, Wang would request necessary funds from Wu in order to finance his fight against Fengtian, which Wu would deny, using it as an excuse to scold Wang.\n\nAnd so, the resentful collaboration between Wang and Feng Yuxiang bore fruit, bonding over their mutual enemy. Launching the Beijing Coup, Feng and Wang's soldiers would seize strategic locations within the city, resulting in Wu Peifu having to flee, and the loss of the Second ZhiFeng War. Imprisoning Cao Kun, Wang would, tears in his eyes, plead with his superior to resign from the presidency. A move which Cao followed through with, moved by Wang's display.\n\nBriefly restored as commander of his prized division, Wang would be betrayed by the likes of Li Jinglin, who forcefully disarmed Wang's troops, and stole Wang's position as Governor of Zhili. Fleeing to exile in Tianjin, Wang would be resolute in living a life of failure. Yet after the restoration of the Zhili Clique to prominence in 1928, Cao would, perhaps to rekindle their friendship, request that Wang return to the fold. Sceptically accepting, Cao would be offered the title of Marshal and position of Minister of the Army, to shore up his own position against Wu."
 qieflavor.53.a: "\"Rather die, than be a pig or a dog.\""

 qieflavor.54.t: "Dinner of the Marshals"
 qieflavor.54.d: "With forces from the Kuomintang and Anqing Clique defeated, Marshal Qi Xieyuan emerged victorious in the wake of League-Marshal Sun's assassination and subsequent war. Qi quickly sent a telegram to Beijing and Luoyang reaffirming his allegiance. While Wu Peifu had had a troublesome relationship with his protege-turned-rival Sun which had only grown more and more bitter as time passed, Wu and Qi lacked such a contentious relationship. Qi too had had a somewhat uneasy relationship with Sun, and was thankful of Wu's patronage of him during the Northern Expedition. Relieved that the League situation had resolved itself seemingly well, Wu accepted Qi's allegiance, Cao recognised his authority over the League, and called him to Beijing for a formal meeting. Qi accepted and made haste to the Chinese capital, and Wu made his way from Luoyang.\n\nUpon arrival, the League-Marshal presented himself to Wu and Cao. After initial discussions between the three, the Jade Marshal asked the League-Marshal to join him in a private dinner event so that they could discuss matters of the state. As they talked, Qi spoke of his professed loyalty to the Jade Marshal, and declared that every one of his victories against the traitor Chen Tiaoyuan and the socialist bandits of the Kuomintang to be in Wu's name. As Wu and Qi discussed the future of Eastern China, the Jade Marshal, much to his worry, noticed that the League Marshal's plans for Reconstruction was to be a joint collaboration with the German Empire. Qi spoke at length of his plans to invite the Germans in building jointly owned railroads for the sake of resource extraction, and the opportunities for state revenue that came along with it.\n\nWhile Cao and Sun were willing to tolerate German Imperialism for the sake of economic and military aid, the nationalist minded Wu was always far more opposed to an overreliance on Berlin. Thus, as Qi spoke more and more of German collaboration in building a new League, Wu grew more and more annoyed and worried. While Sun had worked closely with Berlin while he ruled the League, what Qi was suggesting went beyond what even the Smiling Tiger could stomach. Such annoyed thoughts of collaboration with the Germans momentarily distracted Wu, and he bit down too hard on the food in his mouth. Noticing this, Qi smiled and asked, \"Perhaps a toothache, Marshal-President?\""
 qieflavor.54.a: "The new League-Marshal may prove a greater liability than the Smiling Tiger..."

 qieflavor.55.t: "Denouncement by Political Science"
 qieflavor.55.d: "A small grouping of amazed onlookers and curious travelers amassed outside the National Assembly, gazing at the emboldened firebrand of a man patriotically and vividly delivering a speech. His words, echoing throughout the streets, carrying with himself a nationalist fervour that has become his trademark. Fortuitously, he is a man of a deceased group. One of the lucky few allowed to exist in the Beiyang political order. Famed for his loyalty and comradery with the likes of the \"Red General\" Chiang Kai-shek, and his ties to the ever elusive Central Club Brothers, Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu, he is perhaps one of the few fervent opposition leaders within the Assembly. A man so notorious, he is considered a traitor by the establishment for his actions in the Beijing Coup of 1924.\n\n\"Once again the Harmony Association and their Zhili caretakers have proven themselves brutally incapable of managing the nation! A decade ago they had lost power after losing faith with the people, and yet they continue to persist! Beholden not to the interests of you, the common citizen, but to that of their benefactors in Berlin! The people cry for anti-concessionism, to expel the foreign imperialists! And the traitors in the cabinet, what do they do? They side with the Inter-Allied rotten structure of the League! The brutal murderer and dictator Sun Chuanfang! Vindicated by the actions of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu! They continue on their course of denying the people's will! They did so in 1927, squashing the Revolutionaries in Guangdong! And yet those brave individuals had truly understood the dream of the nation! Dr. Sun Yat-sen! The true Founding Father of the Republic! They denied him his just victory, and continue to deny the people their freedom!\"\n\nCatching himself in his own whirlpool of rage, Huang Fu, the leader of the \"Political Science Clique\" has continued to champion the cause of the nascent Kuomintang in the north. Remaining elusive with regards to the MinGan insurgents, \"The Hero of Chinese Liberalism\" finds himself more attached to the remnants of the Kuomintang within Guizhou. Allowed back into politics following a period of brief liberalisation, even winning a considerable portion of seats within the Assembly, Huang has dedicated his career to harassing the Zhili. Forming a true opposition bloc with the likes of Hu Shih, he undoubtedly will make Cao's pursuit of maintaining German ties an arduous hell."
 qieflavor.55.a: "Damnable two-faced Kuomintang rat!"

 qieflavor.56.t: "The Kuomintang in Beiyang"
 qieflavor.56.d: "With the disastrous Manchu Coup ending in the nigh destruction of the Beiyang Republic and its institutions, many feared that the Zhili's reprisal would be that of martial law, of repression, a rule by secret police. And yet, they pursued a policy of reform, of reflection and recollection. Collaborating openly with the likes of Hu Shih and other intellectual circles, the broad Assembly, ignoring the monarchists who were so dutifully removed, were all in joint collaboration. All except for one particular grouping of prickly figures.\n\nThe dubious Political Science Clique has a storied history. Originally dubbed the \"European Affairs Research Association\", the Political Science Clique was born out of moderate Kuomintang members who resolutely refused to swear an oath of personal allegiance to Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Formed in 1914, there were more than 100 founding members, with the key figures being that of Li Liejun, Li Genyuan, Xiong Kewu, Chen Jiongming, Cheng Qian, Zou Lu, Chen Duxiu, Yang Yongtai, and even that of Huang Xing. Whilst these notables would eventually split, Political Science would carry forth their ideals of moderate revolutionary thought.\n\nLater adorned by the likes of Huang Fu, the Political Science Clique acted as the Kuomintang's influence within the Beiyang Assembly, with its peak being that of Zhang Shaozeng, and later Huang Fu's political cabinets in the 1920s. Proponents of Revolutionary Liberalism, they would coalesce around Huang following his return to politics in the post Northern Expedition political order.\n\nA traitor, a hero, a friend, a leader, Huang Fu has found himself to be one of the last true opposition members within the Assembly. Only barely tolerated by the authorities, he has been at the center of numerous hurricanes of political outrage directed at the Zhili, spurning on fierce rhetoric appealing to the downtrodden and to the middle class.\n\nAnd yet curously, as of recent his tune has mellowed, if only slightly. Rather than the scathing speeches bashing any and all actions of the government, Huang and Political Science have come into a lull of, if restrained, support for the Government in light of recent events. Many within the Cabinet are unsure what to make of it, and for how long they will let up, but it nonetheless proves that our course of action is appreciated by the radicals."
 qieflavor.56.a: "You are a strange one, Huang Fu."

 qieflavor.57.t: "Epitaph of the Third Brother"
 qieflavor.57.d: "Fire and steel consume the former domains of the Smiling Tiger, its thin seams of progress and modernity ripping now that the men and money needed had gone up in smoke. Then came the all too familiar plights of war, driving refugees across the former territories of the League. Many within our own domains are rushing to respond with poor relief societies and charities to support the arriving plighted, and found themselves in awe of a surprising patron.\n\nThe front-and-centre charge of Marshal Cao Kun at these efforts was indeed an unusual sight. Despite his now frail stature and age, the old marshal has, to the best of his ability, rallied and called out for more donations and funds to support the displaced refugees. He himself has contributed a sizeable portion of his annual salary to these efforts, earning some praise from the Beijing and foreign press. These papers harken back to the work of Cao Rui, younger brother and one-time provincial governor of Zhili province, in earlier disaster and poor relief campaigns. Speculations on Cao Kun's motivation range from a public relations coup against Wu Peifu to a personal tribute to his brother, whose passing had weighed heavy on the old marshal and caused him to extract himself from official duties for some time.\n\nWhat truly drove Cao Kun, who once lavished his money on buying votes from assemblymen to fuel his ascendance to the republican presidency, to now call for donations in solidarity with the downtrodden can only be known by the old marshal himself."
 qieflavor.57.a: "\"If only he could see me now...\""

 qieflavor.58.t: "King of the Crooks"
 qieflavor.58.d: "It is true that the halls of the Beiyang Establishment are those hollowed by unscrupulous, unprincipled individuals. The Anhui and Fengtian Cliques, with their innumerable Japanese connections, willing to sell out the country and themselves for profits. Even the Northern Zhili, at least within the mass of the Baoding and Tianjin factions, are not immune. With the likes of Cao Rui, Cao Kun's brother, being infamously corrupt and embezzling funds to the point that he had twenty times the amassed wealth of his own brother. Or that of Bian Shoujing, an exemplary revolutionary turned to corruption due to exposure to the Assembly for a prolonged period.\n\nHowever they all pale absolutely in the magnifent splendor, as he claims himself, of Minister of Finance Wang Kemin. One of the older members of the cabinet, Wang has become a favourite of the international, and local, banking worlds. Not proficient in the actual managing of finance, Wang's excellent memory allows him to recite the numbers in bookkeeping nonetheless, and has amassed quite a serious fortune.\n\nIndispensible to the government due to his capacity to obtain large amounts of funding from his foreign bank friends, Wang is otherwise a prickly, aging, and lackadaisical politician whom interrupts most cabinet meetings by lording himself over younger members of the clique present at the meetings, such as Bai Jianwu, or Peng Yunyi. Even in spite of his seniority being dwarfed by that of Gao Lingwei. Aside from that, Wang's Ministry of Finance has overseen a remarkable improvement both in the debt and economic sectors, winning him continued praise within the Assembly."
 qieflavor.58.a: "Every government has its Lucifer."

 qieflavor.59.t: "Beiyang's Money Devil"
 qieflavor.59.d: "However Minister Wang's damnable attitude, pro-concessionist stance, and blatant unscrupulousness attracts much ire from the likes of the Luoyang Faction. Of particular note is an incident between Wang and that of Bai Jianwu, the Jade Marshal's Right-Hand. Reportedly, one time Bai had invited Wang to dinner whilst he was in Beijing.\n\nDuring the meal, Wang took advantage of his seniority, indicating to Bai Jianwu reminiscent of a tone akin to a teacher: \"Mr. Bai, even though you are a veteran of the Zhili, you still have to learn from me to deal with the Germans. The Germans are... very difficult to deal with. Sometimes they will turn their faces and refuse to admit what has been agreed upon behind closed doors. They are very dishonest, and you desperately have to pay attention.\"\n\nAfter the meal, Wang pulled Bai aside, whispering to him: \"I am almost seventy years old, and will soon be buried. I don't care whether I'm viewed as a traitor or not. I will not be a traitor for many years. After all, when I finally close my eyes, I will die. However look at Wu Peifu. It's fine if he gets involved with the Germans, but why drag some young people into the water and have them follow him to be similarly scolded as traitors? What he did is immoral.\"\n\nAfterwards, Minister Wang lambasted Wu Peifu as a traitor not only to the nation but his own principles for abiding by the concessions. The rather confused and stunned Bai could only merely stutter. All Wang offered in response was a raise of the eyebrows, a devilish grin, and the tipping of a hat. Hobbling out of Bai's property, the \"Money Devil's\" nonsensical antics only deprived Wu's \"Think Tank\" of any picture of Wang's refined statesman front."
 qieflavor.59.a: "\"Too old to give a damn.\""

 qieflavor.60.t: "\"A day as a teacher, a lifetime as a father.\""
 qieflavor.60.d: "There was none more eminently suited to become Imperial Tutor to the Son of Heaven as Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston was. The Boy Emperor without an Empire and the representative of the Empire on which the sun never sets, or at least did, back in those times. Johnston's tutorship planted in Puyi a certain insatiable curiosity and desire for the cosmopolitan that made the walls of the Forbidden City seem ever the more insufferable. Teacher and pupil together beared through some of the worst tumults of the cursed republican warlords, and their correspondence was kept even up until Johnston's death.\n\nMuch has happened since Feng Yuxiang's defilement of the Forbidden City. The now Xuantong Emperor regained his empire, while red banners now flutter over the homeland of the teacher. Johnston had handled his exile in Hong Kong gracefully, but even the former boy emperor could not notice the growing wear and cynicism in the man who had once planted in him a desire to see the world beyond. That Puyi could not help, given the involvement of the Germans in his own 1927 Restoration.\n\nThe teacher has now passed to another world, while the pupil remains. Johnston had entrusted to his former pupil that his ashes be safekept and eventually spread over a small Scottish loch, once the monarchist exiles in Canada wrangle back control from the syndicalist London government."
 qieflavor.60.a: "Farewell, Mr Johnston."

 qieflavor.61.t: "Old Trickery in an Auspicious Night."
 qieflavor.61.d: "The echo of telephone bells ring across the halls of Hu Shih's residence, late that night. The good master of the household was still engrossed in his writings. Even if to his annoyance and distraction, Hu had rushed to answer his correspondent. There was something about this incoming call, however. The phone bells struck high and echo heavy, the metal handler cold to the touch.\n\n\"Good evening, who's calling?\"\nThe caller snickered for a short moment but then answered. Hu was taken aback.\n\"Let's try guessing one more time, my good doctor\"\n\nHu found himself slow to answer his esteemed caller. He and the Xuantong Emperor were certainly not strangers, but the last decade has proved challenging to the upkeep of their companionship. Wu Peifu allowed New Year greetings and some formal exchanges, but on the whole, they had not talked properly since Puyi's restoration to the imperial throne. And Wu would not budge, unless.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I, take it you've sought Marshal Wu out on this exchange?\"\n\"In a way. Can you make yourself available at the Forbidden City within tomorrow?\"\n\nHu was stunned. He had seen one too many governments fall to believe that Wu Peifu would have a change of heart in a manner such as this. But his esteemed correspondent continued.\n\"Security might have to be strengthened, but I assure you, we can meet and discuss as freely as we please. After all…\""

 QIE_anq_visit_nanjing_desc: "With Chen Tiaoyuan safely installed in Nanjing and us having significant influence in his government, it is time to remind him of the strings behind his throne, let us send the Emperor and Marshal Wang Chengbin, for a diplomatic visit. This should help improve Puyi's popularity amongst the Southern population, with Marshal Wang acting as insurance."

 QIE_anq_wu_and_chen_decision: "Bridging the North-South Divide"
 QIE_anq_wu_and_chen_decision_desc: "Ever since the ascendance of the South Zhili Clique following Sun Chuanfang's gambits in the 1920s, the North and South Clique have had a rather tense relationship. Perhaps a microcosm of the greater North-South Divide. Nonetheless, Sun proved himself in the Northern Expedition, with our backs against the wall we held valiantly against the Southerners. With League-Marshal Chen installed in part by our hand, an opportunity to mend our split further has reared its head. Dispatching President Cao, Marshal Wu and their top advisors to Nanjing, we can reassure the South Zhili of our overtures and sincerity."

 QIE_anq_organise_intellectual_meeting: "Organise Intellectual Meeting"
 QIE_anq_organise_intellectual_meeting_desc: "The Beijing Liaison Council has telegrammed the government with a desire to organise a large gathering of nationalist intellectuals in Nanjing. While this will require some effort to organise, it will hopefully help show the Chinese people that unification is not far away, and that we are a true friend to the intellectuals. Furthermore, it should create a sense of urgency among the other warlords who are unwilling to take the leap of faith towards a united China. Chen Tiaoyuan, Leader of the League, should be especially sensitive to this."

 QIE_anq_counter_message: "Spread a Counter Message"
 QIE_anq_counter_message_desc: "That devious Chen Tiaoyuan seeks to undermine our authority by spreading absolute lies and fabrications! Absolutely just a desperate grasp for power, he has begun to construct an elaborate ruse that local warlord autonomy is integral, superceding National Unification. The fool doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation. Already President Cao has ordered the cabinet to prepare a counter-message, and to shut down Chen's publishers."

 QIE_anq_send_delegation: "Formal Talks with Anqing"
 QIE_anq_send_delegation_desc: "All too familiar with the importance of popular support and public opinion, the Zhili Clique rose to power on the wave of that sentiment, and with hope in the regime in the south waning, perhaps it is time to foment gratitude for League-Marshal Chen. The Beijing Liaison Council and Minister Gao Lingwei have suggested that a large public conference should be held in Nanjing, to discuss relations between the North and South Zhili."

 QIE_reach_out_to_anqing_before_desc: "Our support for Anqing during their war against the Nanjing clique has not been forgotten. They have maintained friendly relationships with us, and with war looming with Japan, many of Marshal Wu's advisors and Cao's diplomats are suggesting he reach out and formally invite them to join our military alliance. Binding them not only with handshakes and spoken word, but with files and paper, their fate will be permanently tied to our own. And they will be absolutely aware of such a fact."

 QIE_reach_out_to_anqing_during_desc: "With the rifles pointed and the artillery firing, our government descends into the battlefields and trenches once more! Our brave men fight and die on the frontlines to maintain our government, all the while League-Marshal Chen twiddles his thumbs in Nanjing. He can no longer play diplomatic games, as our battle concerns the absolute future of China. Dispatching our officers, we must reach out to them immediately and secure their assistance in our fight."

 QIE_reach_out_to_anqing_after: "Reach out to [ANQ.GetNameWithFlag]"
 QIE_reach_out_to_anqing_after_desc: "Surprise, surprise! The Jade Marshal and President Cao managed to wage a victorious war without the interference or even assistance of League-Marshal Chen. Nonetheless, the rat must fold to our ambitions. As we are the unmistakable Central Authoriy in the nation, Chen's fiefdom presents itself as a critical part of the Chinese Borders. We will dispatch a team of generals and civil servants, very \"advising\" that Chen take the final step into our sphere."

 QIE_reach_out_to_anqing_after_again_desc: "Again that foolish League-Marshal rebuffed us, little does he know we were not asking. This time, refusing won't be on the table. Already our soldiers are amassing on their borders, and perhaps that will sweeten the pot with Chen? He knows what'll happen if he doesn't accede."

 QIE_war_goal_anqing_for_refusal_faction_desc: "You'd think that warlords and uppity generals would eventually understand the situation after being harangued persistently by telegrams and diplomats for the past months now. And yet \"League-Marshal\" Chen has refused all of our advances, all capacities in which President Cao was \"playing nice\". With Marshal Wu having been granted full authority and permission over the matter, it is time to extinguish Chen's flame."

 QIE_anqing_attempt_training_again: "Reopen Anqing Training Talks"
 QIE_anqing_attempt_training_again_desc: "Nominally rebuffing our advances for further troop training, increasing the integration and camraderie of our armies beyond a level he is clearly comfortable with, the Army Cooperation Commission that was setup to advise the government on handling allied warlord armies has suggested to the President to reopen talks with Chen. Hopefully, he will have reconsidered his options."

 QIE_anq_contact_anticoncessions_leaders: "Contact Anti-Concessionist Leaders"
 QIE_anq_contact_anticoncessions_leaders_desc: "Anti-Concessionists hold great sway within the new League, and in Chen's Anqing Clique directly. If we wish to gain public support and shore up our ties, perhaps President Cao should meet with the leaders of the Anti-Concessions League, the largest organised group within the Anti-Concessionist Movement. Expressing sincere overtures in only a way he can, a new, far more free China is on the horizon."

 qiefor.57.t: "Wuchang-Anqing Development"
 qiefor.57.d: "With the increasingly developing relationship between the Central Government and League-Marshal Chen's Eastern provinces, a suggestion from a contact with a direct line to Wang Kemin, whom is also an official on the National Council in the Anqing Clique, has led to the Ministry of Finance backing a development project in the Wuchang-Anqing Region.\n\nServing as the interior of both of our polities within the land we nominally control, and with both having extensive potential for future economi and industrial development, this was a natural choice for a cooperative development plan. With previous North-South Zhili development and cooperation projects usually revolving around the Beijing-Nanjing axis, there is at last progress on developing more impoverished areas.\n\nMuch to the personal support of Governor Xiao Yaonan, and that of League-Marshal Chen, bound to receive the most lucrative kickbacks from this endeavour."
 qiefor.57.a: "Have Wang pull some strings, make Chen invest the larger share."
 qiefor.57.b: "Invest ourselves"

 qiefor.58.t: "New Offices for the Beijing Liaison Council"
 qiefor.58.d: "The Anqing Clique has emerged victorious with our support. We have recently installed the Beijing Liaison Council as our official representative organisation in the new Anqing capital of Nanjing. Staffed by Cao Kun's Jinbao clique bureaucrats, they will be working towards achieving eventual unification of Chen Tiaoyuan's League within our Central Government.\n\nFurthermore, they serve as an ever watchful eye in the political battlefield of the new League, not having to rely on secret contacts through Sa Zhenbing or Cai Chengxun. However, naturally for a bunch of loathed Southern Zhili Jinbao civil servants, they have lamented to the Cabinet their lack of an extra lavish office, harping on about \"showcasing the glories of the King of Baoding and his Jade Marshal\" to the people of the League."
 qiefor.58.a: "You must be joking."
 qiefor.58.b: "You know what, fine, provide the funds."

 qiefor.59.t: "Resource Development with Anqing"
 qiefor.59.d: "We have recently struck a deal with the Anqing Clique to stimulate Northern entrepreneurs to aid in the prospecting and development of resources in their provinces. A noble effort, we of course indirectly benefit from these resources as trade with Anqing, are their nominal overlord, and will eventually have their territory subsumed under Central Authority.\n\nBut some more finance oriented members of the Assembly and Cabinet, notably Wang Kemin, have suggested that maybe Beijing should receive some direct benefits as well? President Cao could ask for control over one of their iron mines in Wuhu as a negotiation tactic, perhaps even staking greater influence within their Government."
 qiefor.59.a: "Patience leads to victory, my friend."
 qiefor.59.b: "You raise a good point Minister Wang."

 qiefor.60.t: "Anqing Refuses Special Treatment"
 qiefor.60.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has been hard at work to improve the ability of Zhili enterprises to do business in the new League. Yet the scars wrought by Sun Chuanfang's nightmare run deep, and are everlasting. Resulting in a backwards, bureaucratic hellhole despite Chen's reforms. With this, our attempts to flood League markets with Northern goods and businessmen are proving quite difficult.\n\n.However, when the Liaison Council recently requested League-Marshal Chen to enable the Central Government to have authority in the management of the League's internal bureaucry, they rebuffed our request, stating that such measures are rather untenable at the present moment. The gall of this petty warlord to refuse the likes of the President and his Marshals? Let President Cao inform League-Marshal Chen that he was not merely asking, he is demanding."
 qiefor.60.a: "An insolent man, dispatch the telegram."

 qiefor.61.t: "Anqing Still Refuses"
 qiefor.61.d: "Amazingly, the gall and sheer ineptitude of Chen Tiaoyuan knows no bounds. It would appear the \"Fool\" General has once again gambled his hand, refusing our stringent demands for further Government oversight within the League territories. With Marshal Wang Chengbin and General Cai Chengxun recommending immediate offensive action, casting away all chains and ties the Southern Zhili have towards the north, President Cao and the Jade Marshal have prevailed in the internal dispute over the right course of action for our rebuke.\n\nThrough coordination with the Beijing Liaison Council, and our various businessmen ties within North China, we have temporarily initiated an effective blockade on companies with their origins in the League territories from conducting business and operating within our Central Authority borders. Whilst we have delicately managed things to ensure minimal damage to our own economy, we have successfully tightened the noose around Chen Tiaoyuan's neck. Surely to upset and cripple his Governance further, it will serve as a permanent reminder of the true capacity of the King of Baoding."
 qiefor.61.a: "Behind the Happy Old Man, is a conniving genius."

 qiefor.62.t: "Emperor Puyi Receives Warm Welcome in Nanjing"
 qiefor.62.d: "Ostensibly only useful for figurehead meetings where President Cao is too busy conducting governance to appear, the Boy Emperor received a request from the President to travel to the Southern Capital of Nanjing, with the intentions of meeting League-Marshal Chen Tiaoyuan in a highly publicised and orchestrated media stunt to showcase the support of good governance between the Central Government and its allies. Joined by his Court and Imperial Guards, Puyi is expected to do little but smile and wave, whilst Marshal Wang, selected due to Marshal Wu busy planning national unification in Luoyang, is the true brain of the diplomatic endeavour.\n\nMeeting with Chen Tiaoyuan, the Marshal and Emperor received an exceptionally warm welcome on behalf of the League-Marshal, showered in gifts, praise and cheers from the populace of Anhui, Nanjing and Zhejiang province. Reportedly Puyi was so utterly delighted that he asked Chen Tiaoyuan if an extensive renovation and rebuilding project for the city's ruined Ming Palace would be possible. Not on the script, it nonetheless legitimises the whole event even further, with Chen's assurances that he will see to its restoration at once."
 qiefor.62.a: "Perhaps he isn't so bad after all."

 qiefor.63.t: "Puyi Shocked by Protests in Nanjing"
 qiefor.63.d: "Ostensibly only useful for figurehead meetings where President Cao is too busy conducting governance to appear, the Boy Emperor received a request from the President to travel to the Southern Capital of Nanjing, with the intentions of meeting League-Marshal Chen Tiaoyuan in a highly publicised and orchestrated media stunt to showcase the support of good governance between the Central Government and its allies. Joined by his Court and Imperial Guards, Puyi is expected to do little but smile and wave, whilst Marshal Wang Chengbin, selected due to Marshal Wu busy planning national unification in Luoyang, is the true brain of the diplomatic endeavour.\n\nBeing received by Chen Tiaoyuan, the Marshal and the Emperor were subject to a particularly cruel scene as they exited their transports. Gathered around them, the adjacent streets and paths were crowded with protestors. Fury on their faces. Clearly obvious to Marshal Wang, as he intended to calm down the trembling Emperor, was that either Chen did not have things under control in his own capital, or he simply didn't care to provide proper amenities for the event. Both scenarios are scandalous, and require thorough correction. The Beijing Liaison Council has received orders from President Cao to ensure that in any and all manners within their jurisdiction, Chen will pay the price."
 qiefor.63.a: "Terrible display from that brute!"

 qiefor.64.t: "Chen Agrees with Intellectuals"
 qiefor.64.d: "The intellectual gathering organised by the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing has been a great success! With intellectuals from both Beijing and Nanjing meeting under Zhili auspices, they discussed a series of matters related to both the mundane, such as their lives, and to that of their Anti-Concessionist movement. With the event being such a success, League-Marshal Chen Tiaoyuan himself has announced that he thoroughly agrees with their sentiment and beliefs, stating that he will do all that is within his power to accelerate their timeline. Hopefully he isn't lying."
 qiefor.64.a: "A true Scholar-Marshal!"

 qiefor.65.t: "Chen Stresses His Autonomy"
 qiefor.65.d: "Recently, the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing organised a meeting of various famous Chinese intellectuals. Discussing matters as intellectuals do, a fierce debate raged for what seemed like hours, until it died down resolutely. Evidentlly all came to the same conclusion: China must unite immediately. However, Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the new League, has spoken out against the urgency of their call. Instead, he insists that local autonomy is more important than unification. What his words indicate is practically a renunciation of his recognition of the Zhili as the sole national government! Already President Cao's aides are drafting a response, and reportedly Marshal Wu is furious at the betrayal."
 qiefor.65.a: "\"Bai, prepare a message for me, would you?\""

 qiefor.66.t: "The Zhili Reach Out"
 qiefor.66.d: "Tensions are mounting in the north, with reports of skirmishes unfolding in the Shanhaiguan Pass, it would appear that the Fengtian Clique's War for National Reclamation is about to exhibit itself. With the Jade Marshal concerned about being flanked from the South during a time of such imperative struggle, we have received a series of telegrams from President Cao and Ministers in the Cabinet, insisting that fight by their side.\n\nThey no doubt were one of the most pivotal factors in ensuring our victory in the League War, however is it really worth dying for Cao Kun and Wu Peifu? Certain members of the command staff disagree on flinging the League into a total war scenario, perhaps if we sit on the sidelines we can ensure our rule remains, be it Fengtian or Zhili."
 qiefor.66.a: "Draft a message to Marshal Wu! We fight by your side!"
 qiefor.66.b: "This doesn't deign a response."

 qiefor.67.t: "The Zhili in trouble?"
 qiefor.67.d: "With the Central Government under assault from aggressive, outside forces, the Zhili command staff are concerned about being flanked from another front in a time of such imperative struggle. Receiving word of a series of telegrams from President Cao and Marshal Wang Chengbin, as it would appear Marshal Wu is on the frontlines commanding his forces, they stress the urgency of the war, insisting, nay demanding that League-Marshal Chen intervene on our side.\n\nThey no doubt were one of the most pivotal factors in ensuring our victory in the League War, however is it really worth dying for Cao Kun and Wu Peifu? Certain members of the command staff disagree on flinging the League into a total war scenario, perhaps if we sit on the sidelines we can ensure our rule remains, whomever controls the Central Government."
 qiefor.67.a: "Draft a message to Marshal Wu! We fight by your side!"
 qiefor.67.b: "This doesn't deign a response."

 qiefor.68.t: "The Zhili Make Demands"
 qiefor.68.d: "It would appear that our actions are slowly catching up with us. Having continously dodged telegrams, waved away Beijing Liaison clerks and civil servants alike, and refused meetings with Marshal Wu, President Cao or any official from the Central Government, they have grown tired of our uncertainty. Emerging victorious in another major conflict, the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding undoubtedly reign supreme over the Chinese Nation yet again.\n\nA strongly worded message has travelled down from Beijing, clearly dictated personally by Marshal Wu. He has demanded that our government parley with the Central Authority in Beijing, and subsume ourself to their authority. Riding off of a high of their victorious war, it is likely that they have no reservations about annihilating us if we refuse yet again. Our border guards already make reports of soldiers under the command of Marshal Wang assembling on our shared border. The clock is ticking..."
 qiefor.68.a: "Nowhere to run, is there?"
 qiefor.68.b: "Now this? This doesn't deign a response."

 qiefor.69.t: "Chen Refuses Alliance"
 qiefor.69.d1: "That damnable fool Chen Tiaoyuan, the supposed League-Marshal, has refused our formal request for an alliance between the North-South Zhili Cliques. Yet again, the South trumps us, manoeuvring their way out of having to provide us any form of assistance despite the amount we have done for them. Reportedly Marshal Wu and Wang are jointly furious, but President Cao has preached patience. Perhaps the moment will appear soon, where Chen changes his ways. Otherwise, he fully admits that military action will become necessary."
 qiefor.69.d2: "That damnable fool Chen Tiaoyuan, the supposed League-Marshal, has refused our formal request for an alliance between the North-South Zhili Cliques. Yet again, the South trumps us, manoeuvring their way out of having to provide us any form of assistance despite the amount we have done for them. Reportedly Marshal Wu and Wang are jointly furious, but with the war waging they cannot do anything but spit venom. Once we emerge victorious however, all bets are off. And Chen Tiaoyuan better put his money where his mouth is, if he wants to continue ruling Nanjing."
 qiefor.69.d3: "What a fool that Chen Tiaoyuan is. Refusing us once? Shame on me. Refusing us twice? At the zenith of our military might, the undisputed Central Government? He is but a mere stepping stone on the way towards national re-unification. With our soldiers amassing, and the Beijing Liaison Office reportedly fleeing to Wuhan, it is evidently clear to both sides that war is on the horizon. A war we cannot feasibly lose."
 qiefor.69.a: "He will pay for this"

 qiefor.70.t: "Anqing Canal Cooperation"
 qiefor.70.d: "Once again proving the benefit in their installation, the Beijing Liaison Council has once again provided us with a great boon. Noticing that the new League government has embarked on a series of signifcant infrastructure efforts in relation to significant dyke and canal work, it would appear that the ambitious Chen has completed the massive monstrosity that is the Subei Canal. It has now secured League expertise in cooperation with our own workers and engineers to begin similar construction projects within Zhili province and Kaifeng. Work can begin whenever the President deigns it so."
 qiefor.70.a: "A fantastic opportunity!"

 qiefor.71.t: "Army Cooperation with Anqing"
 qiefor.71.d: "With Anqing formally entering into our sphere not too long ago, our Cabinet and Staff Officers have devised a series of, on the surface, events wherein the North and South Zhili armies further integrate themselves with eachother, allowing soldiers to mingle, and joint drills to be conducted. Having already taken the first step, drafting our proposal to the Beijing Liaison Council, they have endured to set up an Amry Cooperation Commission to further delegate such matters.\n\nWith the ball once again in our court, all that is left is to decide if it is truly worth expending valuable resources to improve the South Zhili armies, as they continue to fight using outdated weaponry, tactics and strategies. The benefits are clear for them, as it would improve their fighting capabilities in war, vastly strengthening their capacity to hold onto their territory. Similarly on our end, we gain uncountable influence over both their army, and their administration."
 qiefor.71.a: "Of course we'll assist!"
 qiefor.71.b: "They'll have to manage on their own."

 qiefor.72.t: "Anqing Refuses Further Army Cooperation"
 qiefor.72.d: "Rather puzzlingly, League-Marshal Chen's government has refused our gracious offer of Army Cooperation. Perhaps to play us as fools, or for other machinations that whizz in the maze of his mind, we are left to deliberate as to what reason he could possibly refuse. Having left very little context in regards to his message to the Liaison Office. However, some optimists within the government still hold out on hope that Chen will eventually realise that this cooperation is critical if a strong defence is to be mounted against our common enemies. Already some of our staff are drafting another proposal, to be sent at another date."
 qiefor.72.a: "Alright then, keep your secrets."

 qiefor.73.t: "Army Cooperation Concluded"
 qiefor.73.d: "With our Marshals, Generals and staff officers collaborating with the League's equivalents, the Army Cooperation Commissions has become a marked success! Seeking to intensify coordination and communication between North-South Zhili forces, our soldiers served as a model army upon which the whole country should emulate. Already the League army is experiencing a massive improvement in their morale, organisation and structure. With Marshal Wu taking it upon himself to revolutionise their military hierachy.\n\nWhilst formally concluded, and with more efforts always being preferable, Marshals Wang and Wu have reported to President Cao that they are thoroughly satisfied with the results, and the improvement to the League Army will no doubt be of great use in future conflicts."
 qiefor.73.a: "Sorry, they used swords? Swords? Swords."

 qiefor.74.t: "Anqing Refuses the National Unification Conference"
 qiefor.74.d: "Rather curiously, League-Marshal Chen has informed Beijing's Assembly that he will not be holding a National Conference with the Cabinet and military to discuss our country's future. Quite an egregious course of action, for in almost all circumstances this alludes or precedes outright treason against the country, its people, and most importantly our government. Albeit, this is not entirely unexpected due to the nature of Chen as a \"Fool\", gambling his future on decisions with which he best believes to be in his personal interest. Marking a permanent downturn in our opinion of the League-Marshal, all we can hope for is to scramble to maintain his League within our sphere."
 qiefor.74.a: "What is he planning?"

 qiefor.75.t: "End of the National Unification Conference"
 qiefor.75.d1: "Our conference that we intended to hold with the Southern Zhili League, ostensibly in order to further national unification, has been a resounding success on multiple fronts! With League-Marshal Chen having been very courteous and humble, he has acquiesced to our authority almost completely. Welcoming further integration, and the formal reintroduction of elections into his territory, this conference will no doubt be carved into the annals of history as a watershed moment in the story of the Chinese nation; marking the beginning of accelerated integration between the Northern and Southern Zhili, forever bridging the gap."
 qiefor.75.d2: "Our conference that we intended to hold with the Southern Zhili League, ostensibly in order to further national unification, has been a moderate success on multiple fronts. With League-Marshal Chen having been very courteous and humble, he has acquiesced to most of our demands almost completely. Welcoming further integration, and the formal reintroduction of elections into his territory, he has stopped short of fully allowing Central Authority into his lands. Whilst disappointing to some, it's perhaps the best we could hope for from such a testy, unreadable man. Still, significant progress towards national reunification was undoubtedly made."
 qiefor.75.d3: "Our conference that we intended to hold with the Southern Zhili League, ostensibly in order to further national unification, has turned out to be an absolute political catastrophe! Either through machinations beyond our control, or perhaps the tone of our delegates, the League delegation has absolutely refused any further talks in regards to integration. The Cabinet is left stunned and puzzled, seeing as how we were so crucially close to winning Chen's Zhili to our side."
 qiefor.75.a: "Long live the Chinese Nation!"
 qiefor.75.b: "What did we even do?"

 qiefor.76.t: "Dalu Yinhang and the League"
 qiefor.76.d: "Dalu Yinhang, the Continental Bank, is one of the North's major commercial banks. With close ties to the political establishment thanks to the connections of President Cao and Minister of Finance Wang Kemin, they have recently become ingratiated with the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing. Through Minister Wang's fine politicking and negotiation, they have made significant investments into the League Provinces, funding new ventures, construction projects and other exploits. As suggested by Wang, we can potentially utilise this opportunity to leverage an increase in our influence within the League, staffing these projects with Northern clerks.\n\nA first consideration however, is that we could offer additional loans through other banks, straining our own resources but winning great appreciation. Another options is to allow the League to repay the loans on far more favourable terms, with Dalu Yinhang willing to accmodate this even if with a level of disdain. Of course the option always exists to instead focus our efforts elsewhere, rather than playing cat and mouse with the unreliable League-Marshal."
 qiefor.76.a: "Ring up Minister Wang, get the other banks on the line."
 qiefor.76.b: "Let us grease the wheels of Dalu Yinhang"
 qiefor.76.c: "What has he done to gain our love?"

 qiefor.77.t: "The League Responds to Our Offer"
 qiefor.77.d1: "Having sweetened the pot just the right amount, Chen Tiaoyuan has fallen right into our hands. Gleefully accepting the Dalu Yinhang loan offer, they have also committed themselves to taking additional steps concerning further integration, something far beyond our own expectations of the League-Marshal! Through backroom deals and clever politicking, perhaps a United North-South Zhili is but a close reality."
 qiefor.77.d2: "Clearly playing us for fools, the quite frankly exceedingly benovelent offer that we offered the League has been thoroughly rejected. Citing the refusal of further predatory loans on the already ailing League economy, League-Marshal Chen has decided again to frustrate our efforts. Whatever game he is playing with us, it no doubt concerns his own personal power far more than that which most benefits the nation!"
 qiefor.77.a: "Even better than anyone hoped for!"
 qiefor.77.b: "Burning bridges here, Marshal Chen."

 qiefor.78.t: "Marshal Wu Meets the League Anti-Concessionists"
 qiefor.78.d: "In order to increase support in the League for unification with the Zhili without having to go through Chen Tiaoyuan, Marshal Wu and President Cao have decided to conduct a meeting with a number of leaders of the Anti-Concessions League, the largest organisation representing the usually disorganised Anti-Concessionist Movement. The League itself is split up into two factions, one of which is pro-republican and in bed with the Vermillion Society within the urban sprawl of the Legations. The other faction is reportedly far more approachable in regards to monarchical matters, believing that national unification is imperative before the squabbles of Republic or Monarchy are brought up again.\n\nThe pro-Vermillion group has been somewhat an obstacle to unification, levying baseless accusations against the Jade Marshal and President that they are monarchists, and so Cao has insisted that they also be part of the meeting. Arranged in Nanjing under Chen's nose, those in attendance were representatives of both factions of the Anti-Concessionist Movement, with the Zhili delegation comprising Marshal Wu, Marshal Wang on behalf of President Cao, and a series of minor Cabinet members, alongside the diplomatic corps. Hearing them out, the Marshal ultimately said the rather unspoken truth: confiding in them that the Zhili too were devout republicans. Merely suggesting that the cooperation with the Monarchy is a means to the end, and that a constitutional monarchy results in winning the hearts of not just the Republican majority, but the Monarchist minority too.\n\nTaken aback by such exposition of vital information, finally detailing partially the reasoning for the Xuantong Restoration, Marshal Wang followed on. Insisting that the Restoration only happened to ensure further German Aid at little to no extra cost. Despite his earlier monarchical convictions, the Marshal was rather poignant, promising to them that Puyi will never be allowed to harm China, and that he is a means to an end. In a startling sign of generosity and genuine conviction, the anti-concessionist delegates were moved by the striking words of both Marshals, welcoming their authority to guide the nation-state."
 qiefor.78.a: "Behind closed doors, secrets are spilt."

 qiefor.79.t: "League Reconstruction Aid"
 qiefor.79.d: "Having acquiesced towards our overtures to extend a joint-cooperative approach to the grand reconstruction of the League territories, they have allowed a series of North Zhili engineers, businessmen and civil servants to oversee the expert operations. Through mass reconstitution of cities, villages, and further infrastructure efforts, we can work towards rebuilding the Eastern Provinces stronger, and better than ever before. With our officials already assisting reconstruction and providing significant aid, some ministers within the Cabinet, and advisors close to the Jade Marshal, have suggested that there exists an opportunity to escalate our endeavours to the national level, and provide far more aid there.\n\nUrging caution however, Minister Gao Lingwei has informed the cabinet that such endeavours, whilst endearing the League and its populace to our government, would thoroughly strain our own national resources, at least in the short term. Instead claiming that the current local efforts implemented on our behalf are the absolute limit in which we can provide at this time."
 qiefor.79.a: "It is absolutely imperative that we assist our fellow countrymen!"
 qiefor.79.b: "Gao is right, our resources should be used sparingly."

 qiefor.80.t: "Beijing Requests Integration!"
 qiefor.80.d: "A pivotal decision has been dumped on Marshal Chen's mind as of recent. The Central Government, seeking to consolidate power and unify China under a central authority, have once again deepened their ties with us, to the point where they have rather brazenly sent a detailed list of demands to Nanjing, effectively overturning our rule of the province, and making us subject to Central Laws and Bureaucrats. Weighing the implications of the request, it would see a brave step towards the promise of national unification, granting stability, economic growth, and a stronger, more coehrent national defense against external threats such as Japanese imperialism and Western colonial ambitions. For a war-weary population and a nation fractured by internal strife, this could represent a hopeful step toward a more prosperous and secure future.\n\nHowever, the integration also comes with significant sacrifices, particularly the loss of the Anqing Clique's local dominance. Chen's leadership has been characterized by a degree of governance that allows for tailored economic and social policies, potentially more attuned to the needs and aspirations of the local population. The surrender of this autonomy would not only diminish Chen's personal influence but also curtail the ability of the Anqing Clique reign in supremacy of the League provinces. The centralisation of power in the hands of the North Zhili and Cao's cabinet also raises concerns about potential authoritarianism, corruption, and the sidelining of local interests in favor of a broader, national agenda.\n\nNonetheless, Chen has to consider whether the merits of national unification and the bridging of the internal Zhili divide outweigh the costs of losing his local power and unique character of governance. Whatever Chen decides, the repercussions will resonate across the fragmented political landscape of China, for it could prove to be a floundering of the Zhili's authority, unable to rein in their own men."
 qiefor.80.a: "To be remembered as a national hero, of course!"
 qiefor.80.b: "Refuse, our autonomy is sacred!"

 qiefor.81.t: "Eastern China United!"
 qiefor.81.d: "Presumably taking time to weigh his options, League-Marshal Chen Tiaoyuan has formally accepted our request, allowing the League and his Southern Zhili to integrate into Central Authority. Seen as a significant step towards the realization of a unified and stable China, Chen is being hailed as a hero who contributed towards ending years of regional fragmentation and warlordism. The Cabinet views Chen's agreement as a testament to his commitment to the greater good of the nation, prioritizing national unity and the long-term prosperity of the Chinese people over personal or regional power.\n\nWith the President formally pledging to honour the spirit of cooperation and inclusivity, he has worked to ensure that the Anqing Clique's formal integration, alongside the larger League, is as smooth as possible, respectful of the delicate local governance Chen has cultivated in his lands. With Chen and his military staff maintaing all of their commissions in the Central Army, this gesture no doubt will serve as a powerful symbol to other regional leaders, encouraging them to join in the national unification effort under the banner of a strong, centralized China."
 qiefor.81.a: "Welcome that great Marshal Chen to my office!"

 qiefor.82.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Refuses!"
 qiefor.82.d: "Presumably taking time to weigh his options, League-Marshal Chen Tiaoyuan has formally rejected our request! This refusal is seen as a setback to the efforts aimed at ending the chaotic warlord era and achieving national unification, with the Cabinet presuming that Chen would recognise the critical need for a strong, unified Central Government to steer China through these tumultuous times, ensuring a brighter future for all of its people. Already Marshal Wang and General Cai Chengxun are clambering for some sort of offensive retort.\n\nWith Marshal Wu delegating to the President, he has instead opted to reaffirm commitments to the unification of China, warning that continued regional autonomy, such as that exercised by the League-Marshal, perepetuates divisions and weakness, hindering national progress and leaving the nation vulnerable to external threats, that are swiftly ammounting.\n\nAppealing to a sense of mutual patriotism, there is very little the North Zhili can feasibly do, what with Fengtian and their Japanese lapdogs once again considering war, one that will be for national survival."
 qiefor.82.a: "To sit out on the war for national struggle?"

 qiefor.83.t: "Beijing Requests Integration!"
 qiefor.83.d: "A pivotal decision has been dumped on Marshal Chen's mind as of recent. The Central Government, seeking to consolidate power and unify China under a central authority, have once again deepened their ties with us, to the point where they have rather brazenly sent a detailed list of demands to Nanjing, effectively overturning our rule of the province, and making us subject to Central Laws and Bureaucrats. Weighing the implications of the request, it would see a brave step towards the promise of national unification, granting stability, economic growth, and a stronger, more coherent national front against all those warlords that remain in light of Japan's defeat. For a war-weary population and a nation fractured by internal strife, this could represent a hopeful step toward a more prosperous and secure future.\n\nHowever, the integration also comes with significant sacrifices, particularly the loss of the Anqing Clique's local dominance.

However should he refuse again...."
 qiefor.84.a: "You mistake our light hand for weakness, Chen."

 qiefor.85.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Refuses, Again!"
 qiefor.85.d: "With League-Marshal Chen refusing our second benevolent overture for peaceful integration, it would appear that he has forced our hand. With Marshals Wu Peifu and Wang Chengbin moving forward with plans drawn up by their Chiefs of Staff, they have announced to the Assembly the commencement of military operations to \"restore national unity\". With the repeated rejections of the Central Government integration efforts being characterised as acts of defiance and betrayal, it is evidently clear that Chen will only listen to force.\n\nWith the Beijing Liaison Council rapidly fleeing Nanjing, the President has announced on radio, broadcasted all throughout the nation, that Chen Tiaoyuan and his League are officially considered traitors to not just the Zhili, but to the nation as a whole. With military measures underway, he has promised a swift neutralisation of the threat posed by Chen's continuous rebuttals. Setting a clear tone for all remaining warlords to hear, it is evident that the Central Government desires the end to the era of warlordism, with the talk of regional autonomy at the expense of nationa cohesion absolutely untenable."
 qiefor.85.a: "A foolish man, fighting a foolish last stand."
