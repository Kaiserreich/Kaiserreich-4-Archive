### Traits ###
 SIA_iron_marshal_trait: "The Iron Field Marshal\n§gBeing known for his charismatic and cunning leadership since his interwar years in Burma, it is no surprise that Phibun would eventually land himself on top of the pecking order. His obsession for total control of the state affairs and his attitude of side-lining the monarchy earned him another nickname - \"Siamese Cao Cao/Caesar\".§!"
 SIA_pho_khun_trait: "The Paternal Despot\n§gInspired by Sukhothai's era notion of Pho Khun (Patriarchal rule) and Ayuthaya's despotic rulership, Sarit felt such ruling style fits his political taste the best. He viewed himself as the foremost leader to guide the country through its \"Patiwat\" (revolutionary) phase against the rising leftist tides.§!"
 SIA_under_pho_khun_trait: "Paternal Despot's Close Confidant\n§gHis majesty the king is now properly put back on the throne, mimicking Ayuthaya's despotic rulership-style of the past. Whether if the king himself is personally involved with Sarit Thanarat's rise to power, we will never know for sure.§!"
 SIA_prancing_knight_trait: "The Prancing Knight\n§gOne simply does not rise to the top position without deceit and deception - Phao lacks neither and is ready to smack down any opposition utilising both trickery and his own heavily militarised police forces in tow.§!"

 SIA_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Initially neutral during the Great War, Siam joined the Central Powers at the last minute in 1919 to regain Champassak and the inner Cambodian lands along the Mekong Line. Siam nonetheless became embroiled in the 36th Siamese-Burmese War with the newly independent state of Burma in 1928. The great Siamese nation was able to defeat the Burmese successfully, and it was only with German and Japanese diplomatic intervention was an agreeable ceasefire was reached. Now, as the year 1936 dawns, the Siamese nation continues to enjoy peace, prosperity, and stability, with King Prajadhipok hoping to unveil Siam's first constitution."

### Intro Screen ##
 SIA_country_intro_header: "The Kingdom of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] in 1936"
 SIA_country_intro_content: "One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While [SIA.GetSIAshortname]'s relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If [SIA.GetSIAshortname] should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others power is a matter to be decided in the coming decade."

 SIA_country_intro_header_1: "The State of Politics"
 SIA_country_intro_content_1: "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth within [SIA.GetSIAshortname] have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Supreme Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weakened. Despite promising the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the Burmese Republicans to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or by force."

 SIA_country_intro_header_2: "The Kingdom's Many Other Problems"
 SIA_country_intro_content_2: "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. Moreover: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]."

## Black Monday and Early political chaos # Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
 siam.4.t: "Black Monday hits [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"
 siam.4.d: "Due to its heavy reliance on its economic ties with Germany Black Monday has quickly dragged [SIA.GetSIAshortname] into an economic abyss as demand for her main agricultural exports has fallen sharply and shipments have been left to wither in their warehouses. Clerks working for foreign companies are continually being laid off, while the people have begun to gather around the Grand Palace looking for hope. It is apparent that we must do something about our economic situation lest it worsen and send us spiralling further down."
 siam.4.a: "Khun Prah!"

 siam.5.t: "Jasmine Rice Problems"
 siam.5.d: "One of the largest exporters of rice within [SIA.GetSIAshortname], the farmers across the Chao Phraya, have asked for government intervention to deal with the excessive supply of rice due to a general fall in demand and fewer export opportunities after Black Monday."
 #-200, +2 reform:
 siam.5.a: "Purchase most of the rice to help stabilise the price."
 #-100, +1 reform:
 siam.5.b: "Agree to buy up some excess rice."
 #0, 0 reform:
 siam.5.c: "The free market shall resolve the issue!"

 siam.6.t: "Bloated Bureaucracy"
 siam.6.d: "The modern bureaucratic system was formed during the reign of Rama V and had been greatly expanded by Rama VI. However, it has proved to be too large to effectively serve the state. Firing more people, however, would mean an increase in the unemployment rate at exactly the time when we want it to drop."
 # 0 reform:
 siam.6.a: "Lay off a few of our clerks."
 #-100, +1 reform:
 siam.6.b: "Lay off managers and ministers."
 #-200, +2 reform:
 siam.6.c: "Allow the status-quo for now."

 siam.7.t: "Military Expenditure"
 siam.7.d: "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] currently spends up to 25% of her annual revenue on the preservation and maintenance of the military-industrial complex, as she is surrounded by both historical enemies and imperialistic westerners who desire her land. However perhaps slightly cutting our military expenditures wouldn't hurt us too much?"
 #-10 for 3 years, 0 reform:
 siam.7.a: "Cut any and all research funding."
 #-10 for 3 years, +1 reform:
 siam.7.b: "Cut everything bar the development of new rifles."
 #-200, +2 reform:
 siam.7.c: "We shouldn't show any weaknesses!"

 siam.8.t: "Emergency Tax"
 siam.8.d: "Even though we've enacted many sweeping reforms we still do not have enough money to sufficiently balance this year's budget. An emergency tax should help remedy this situation but will create more suffering for our loyal subjects."
 #+50, 0 reform:

## New Governmnet Established for Siam ##
 siam.10.t: "The Khana Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
 siam.10.d: "Following the bloodless revolution we must rebuild the nation from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham, head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist, is now working on the creation of a formal constitution while others are beginning to educate the masses about the merits and workings of parliamentary democracy. Alongside all of this Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena has readied his troops, in case of an opportunistic invasion by foreign powers."
 siam.10.a: "This is a great leap forward for [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"

 siam.11.t: "The Khanagummakarn Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
 siam.11.d: "Following the ratification of the constitution the People's Committee, a group chosen by Prajadhipok himself, has begun the education of the masses in the ways of proper parliamentary democracy.\n\nHeaded by the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Court, the Committee is also responsible for educational, health, and industrialisation reforms. The path ahead for [SIA.GetSIAshortname] will hardly be a stroll in the park but a bright future does await our great nation."
 siam.11.a: "This a great leap forward for the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] people!"

## Khana Ratsadon 1936 Election and subsequent Civil War ##

 siam.12.t: "The "Yellow Cover Dossier" Affair"
 siam.12.d: "Today Luang Praditmanutham, Minister of State and a member of the People's Party, presented the draft of his "National Economic Development Plan" proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nKnown as the "Yellow Cover Dossier" the plan details the formation of a welfare state, redistribution of land, state intervention in the private sector, and a system of subsidies for farmers.\n\nSome have compared the proposal to that of a syndicalist while others have agreed that the reforms will greatly improve the lives of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] people.\n\nAll that remains is to see what his majesty has to say..."
 siam.12.a: "His Majesty agrees with Praditmanutham."
 siam.12.b: "His Majesty supports a watered down proposal."
 siam.12.c: "His Majesty demands the arrest of the syndicalist sympathiser!"

 siam.13.t: "Prajadhipok's Reply"
 siam.13.d: "King Prajadhipok's reply has arrived and is heavily critical of Luang Praditmanutham's draft, going so far as to accuse Praditmanutham of being a syndicalist! An emergency session of the chief members of the People's Party has led to the party deciding to..."
 siam.13.a: "... back down for the moment."
 siam.13.b: "... file a lawsuit against the King."

 siam.14.t: "Domestic Tensions"
 siam.14.d: "Thawan Ritthidet, a private citizen, has recently filed a lawsuit against the King; accusing him of intervention in political, state, and economic affairs. The fallout over Luang Praditmanutham's plan has further divided the cabinet and has pitted the Royalists and the Parliamentarians against each other."
 siam.14.a: "Reconciliation is in order, it seems."
 siam.14.b: "Arrest those Syndicalists!"

 siam.15.t: "Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Dilemma"
 siam.15.d: "A political crisis is currently ongoing and has nearly reached the boiling point! Tensions are high and we must take steps to remedy the situation. What shall we do?"
 siam.15.a: "It's treason then! (Side with the Parliamentarians)"
 siam.15.b: "HM's dignity must be upheld! (Side with the Royalists)"
 siam.15.c: "Try to end this factional bickering."

 siam.16.t: "Dawn of the Siamese Civil War"
 siam.16.prd: "Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the monarchy, a small mutiny in Sattahip and Morlumlerng by the navy has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos."
 siam.16.ppd: "Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the new cabinet, a small mutiny in Lopburi and Nakhon Ratchasima by the army has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos."
 siam.16.pra: "For the country! (Rebel side)"
 siam.16.prb: "For the king! (Government side)"
 siam.16.ppa: "For the country! (Government side)"
 siam.16.ppb: "For the king! (Rebel side)"

 siam.17.t: "'Padauk Flowers' Wilted"
 siam.17.d: "The rising tension affects every facet of the Siamese society, perhaps with one of the more prominent examples being the Royal Siamese Navy itself. With the Royalist stronghold being mostly in non-coastal areas, most sailors and naval officers have opted to organise ad-hoc units to fortify Sattahip and surrounding areas as a Parliamentarian stronghold and support other ground units who shared their belief. The rest had deserted earlier or tried to sit out the war as 'neutrals'. In other word, this puts the majority of RSN ships outside the control of either side."
 siam.17.a: "Blessing in disguise?"

 siam.18.t: "The Reclamation of Bangkok"
 siam.18.d: "The Siamese Civil War has recently taken an unexpected turn for the better, as our side has managed to reclaim Bangkok. This is a shattering blow to the opposition and thus, while some ministers in the illegitimate government have fled abroad, most have complied with our demands and have promptly laid down their arms."
 siam.18.a: "The Royalists have reclaimed power!"
 siam.18.b: "Syndicalism shall guide our nation!"

 siam.19.t: "'Padauk Flowers' Blooming Once Again"
 siam.19.d: "Following the civil war's conclusion, actions were taken to reestablish the control over the mothballed RSN fleets left deserted due to the conflict. We've now gathered enough sailors to act as a skeleton crew for the meantime, with even more reinforcements on their way back from boot camps."
 siam.19.a: "Welcoming news."

 siam.20.t: "End of the [SIA.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] Civil War"
 siam.20.d.government_parliamentarian: "After subduing most of the separatists and rebels we have received word that the remaining rebels have fled to Yunnan. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the rebel scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre. Prajadhipok, who was largely unrelated to the rebellion, has been permitted to return to the Grand Palace."
 siam.20.d.government_royalist: "After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to Saigon, where we must contend with extradition procedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through [GetSIAprefixTH]damnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground."
 siam.20.d.rebel_parliamentarian: "After subduing most of the rebels we have received word that the remaining royalists have fled to Yunnan with the king. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the loyalist scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre."
 siam.20.d.rebel_royalist: "After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to Saigon, where we must contend with extradition procedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through [GetSIAprefixTH]damnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground."
 # Plaek Parliamentarian, Government:
 siam.20.a: "Long live may our Democracy be!"
 # Plaek Royalist, Government:
 siam.20.b: "Long live the King!"
 # Plaek Royalist, Rebel:
 siam.20.c: "Long live the King!"
 # Plaek Parliamentarians, Rebel; Chaiyo = Hurrah in Thai:
 siam.20.d: "Chaiyo for the Republic!"

 siam.21.t: "Royalist Rebels Surrender (AI side)"
 siam.21.d: "This event isn't meant to fire for Human players - please report this as a bug if this appears to you"
 siam.21.a: "They surrendered (Parliamentarians)"

 siam.22.t: "Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Coup D'état"
 siam.22.d: "As time has passed and people have adjusted to the seizure of power, the situation in [SIA.GetSIAshortname] has finally begun to stabilise. It is finally time to..."
 siam.22.a: "... repeal martial law."
 siam.22.b: "... take power for ourselves."

 #1936:
 siam.23.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 siam.23.d.syn: "Following the purge of the conservatives from all chambers of the government and the dismantling of the power of nobility, the results of the election are pretty clear."
 siam.23.d.con: "Following the purge of the socialists from all chambers of the government, in addition to the banning of their organisations, the results of the election are pretty clear."
 siam.23.d.norm: "The predictions made in the polls with regards to this election have been very close. However, it seems as though one side has managed to eke out a majority in parliament."
 siam.23.a: "The liberals have emerged victorious!"
 siam.23.b: "The socialists have emerged victorious!"
 siam.23.c: "The conservatives have emerged victorious!"

## Industrial Nationalizaion ##

 siam.26.t: "The Question of German-Owned Factories"
 siam.26.d: "Prominent German businesses within the [SIA.GetName] are mostly linked to the shipping, logging and railway industries. A large loan on good terms from the government might easily convince them to kick-start their operations again, though we could simply seize their factories as well. Doing so, however, could mean economic suicide for the [SIA.GetName]. How should we approach the situation?"
 siam.26.a: "Seize the means of production!."
 siam.26.b: "Offer monetary compensation."
 siam.26.c: "Let's look elsewhere..."

 siam.27.t: "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] Seizes Our Factories!"
 siam.27.d.bast: "The new [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalisation' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram."
 siam.27.d.comp: "The new [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalisation' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He has, however, offered us monetary compensation for our losses."
 siam.27.a: "Those bastards!"
 siam.27.b: "At least they've given us compensation."

 siam.28.t: "The Question of American-Owned Factories"
 siam.28.d: "The American car company, Ford, have their South-East Asian operations based here in Ayutthaya. Due to political and economic strife in the States it is unlikely that the United States would retaliate if we were to seize the factory. What shall we do?"

 siam.29.t: "The Question of British-Owned Rubber Plantations"
 siam.29.d: "With the British in South-East Asia forced to retreat to Australasia following the British Revolution, many private rubber plantations in Sirat Malai have been left deserted for some time by their former owners. While we could simply seize the plantations, doing so would upset the Australasians who are a major naval power in the Asia-Pacific region and, potentially, allies. What shall we do?"

 siam.30.t: "The Question of Japanese-Owned Iron Mines"
 siam.30.d: "The Japanese own a few iron mines in Yala and Nakhon Si Thammarat which are used to transfer key raw materials to their home islands. While we could potentially seize the mines doing so would alienate us and permanently damage [SIA.GetProperAdjective]-Japanese relations, leaving us without a powerful ally to help challenge the German hegemony in the region. What shall we do?"

 siam.31.t: "Phibunsongkhram Criticised For Weak Foreign Policy"
 siam.31.d: "Due to the National Industrialisation Scheme bringing about little to no economic change our opponents in the media and political arena alike have accused us of weak and ineffective leadership."
 siam.31.a: "Damn it!"

## Siamese- Burmese War (NatPop) ##

 siam.32.t: "Burmese Agitators Captured"
 siam.32.d: "Eleven Burmese agitators in Morlumlerng, one of the Mon majority cities near the Salween River Delta, were caught today spreading pamphlets which bore the slogan 'Liberation From The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Yoke'. Perhaps we can take advantage of this event to help rally support for our regime and finish off the Burmese threat once and for all!"
 siam.32.a: "Who said we were cowards?"
 siam.32.b: "A chance to show them who's boss!"
 siam.32.c: "We aren't ready for that right now..."

 siam.33.t: "[SIA.GetNameDefCap] Has Declared War!"
 siam.33.d: "Bad news! Apparently the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] have caught eleven "Burmese spies", despite them being in what is rightfully our territory. Their army is now advancing towards Yangon. This is outrageous!"
 siam.33.a: "To arms, citizens!"

 # Siamese Wins:
 siam.34.t: "Treaty of Thawai"
 siam.34.d: "The decadent Burmese in Yangon have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the Burmese government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the Burmese forever?"
 siam.34.a: "We'll demand Upper Shan and reunite the Thais."
 siam.34.b: "No peace with the Burmese, total conquest!"

 siam.35.t: "Demands of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective]"
 siam.35.d: "The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] dogs have completely overpowered us and we are humiliated. Now they've demanded we surrender the Upper Shan states. Although these are harsh terms, it might be wise to comply, lest our rivals in the region act upon our weakened situation."
 siam.35.a: "We have no other choice..."
 siam.35.b: "They must be joking, Kaba Ma Kyei!"

 siam.36.t: "The Burmese Government Refuses!"
 siam.36.d: "The foolish Burmese have refused our generous offer."
 siam.36.a: "The war must continue, it seems..."

 # Burmese Wins:
 siam.37.t: "Treaty of Thawai"
 siam.37.d: "The decadent [SIA.GetProperAdjective] in Bangkok have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of Chiang Mai. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective]?"
 siam.37.a: "We shall take back our rightful territory."
 siam.37.b: "No peace with the [SIA.GetProperAdjective], total conquest!"

 siam.38.t: "Demands of the Burmese"
 siam.38.d: "The Burmese dogs have completely overpowered us and we are humiliated. Now they've demanded we surrender the Lower Shan and Morlumlerng states. Although these are harsh terms it might be wise to comply, lest our rivals in the region act upon our weakened situation."
 siam.38.a: "We have no other choice..."
 siam.38.b: "They must be joking, Rao Suu Mai Thoi!"

 siam.39.t: "The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Government Refuses!"
 siam.39.d: "The foolish [SIA.GetProperAdjective] have refused our rightful claims."
 siam.39.a: "The war must continue, it seems..."

## Phibunsongkhram's Ratthaniyom Reform, Assassination attempt and its aftermath ##
 siam.40.t: "Implementing The Ratthaniyom Reforms"
 siam.40.d: "The Ratthaniyom, or "Popular State", reforms were proposed by the nationalists as a means to reach the ultimate goal of a strong nation which favour of the Thai people. However, this may result in some unwanted friction with the Malays, Chinese, Mons, and Cambodians living within our nation."
 siam.40.a: "Who cares? Implement the reforms."
 siam.40.b: "On the second thought, this is probably a bad idea."

 siam.41.t: "Changing Siam's Name?"
 siam.41.d: "While our country has been known as Siam since the late Ayutthaya era, intelligence within the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] community have pointed out that, since our nation is mostly made up by Thais, it would make sense to change our name to Pratet Thai, or Thailand, in order to reflect that fact. However, the could antagonise the minorities in our nation. What shall we do?"
 siam.41.a: "We shall be a nation of the Thai people!"
 siam.41.b: "We shall remain as Siam!"

 siam.42.t: "The Tai Merger and New National Anthem Act"
 siam.42.d: "Following the passage of the law which has officially made us Thailand, the use of Tai Lao, Tai Dam, Tai Daeng, Tai Puan, Tai Yai, Tai Sayam, Tai Khuean, Tai Lue, Tai Yuan and others in the Tai Kadai cultural group are now simply known as Thais. Minorities will retain the Thai prefix as they are, as mandated by law, also Thais. The national anthem shall also be changed to reflect this new reality, with a competition set to occur in thirty days to help decide the new anthem."
 siam.42.a: "Pass it!"
 siam.42.b: "Rather not."

 siam.43.t: "[GetYear] National Language and Compulsory Education Act"
 siam.43.d: "To further our policy of Thaification, or the integration of the minorities into Thailand, the central Thai dialect (the Bangkokian dialect) has now been designated the primary language, with northern Thai and Laotian dialects banned. The new law shall make the teaching of the central Thai dialect compulsory and will negatively affect ethnic and religious schools, such as Chinese-run schools, Catholic Assumption Colleges and Pornor Muslim Schools in the south, unless they agree to comply with the new law. Of course, we could also be less forceful in our implementation of the law or cancel the passage of it entirely."
 siam.43.a: "Thaification is the way forward!"
 siam.43.b: "Let us simply promote the use of the Bangkokian dialect."
 siam.43.c: "Cancel the passage of the law..."

 siam.44.t: "Foreigner Workforce Exclusion Act"
 siam.44.d: "Due to the recent influx of Chinese immigrants-who had escaped the carnage and destruction of the Chinese Civil War-into [SIA.GetName], we have seen an increase in the unemployment rate. To tackle this problem, the government has decided to declare select jobs as off-limits to unskilled immigrants and set them aside for our own people. This will, however, have negatively impact on our economy due to our reliance on Chinese labour."
 siam.44.a: "We must preserve the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] market!"
 siam.44.b: "We need the foreign labour; cancel the act!"

 siam.45.t: "Completion of the Ratthaniyom Reforms"
 siam.45.d: "All of the major laws regarding Phibunsongkhram's Ratthaniyom reforms have now been successfully implemented, in one way or another. We now eagerly await the public reaction to the news reforms."
 siam.45.a: "The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] nation is Strong!"
 siam.45.b: "The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] nation is Strong."
 siam.45.c: "At least the reforms have some sort of impact..."
 siam.45.e: "Can it be called a reform if nothing has been done?"

 siam.47.t: "Phibunsongkhram Assassinated!"

 siam.2001.t: "Conspiracy within the Army?"
 siam.2001.d: "While our regime consolidation has gone without a hitch, it would be bad to keep those commanders who might pose a risk to our new regime. While targeting Phraya Songsuradet, the direct rival to Phibun's legitimacy would totally crushed the democratic proponent within the army, the same can be said for Phraya Srisitthisongkhram and his fellow royalists. By doing a systematic purge for one of these factions, that would hopefully be enough to silenced the other."
 siam.2001.a: "Songsuradet must go..."
 siam.2001.b: "... and so does the royalist threats."

### Political Path ###
 SIA_prajadhipokreform: "Prajadhipok's Reforms"
 SIA_prajadhipokreform_desc: "The ongoing economic crisis offers the perfect opportunity to enact new reforms, as the old guard and nobility within our nation will be panicking and willing to support our initiatives... or will they?"
 SIA_ratthasapha: "Formation of the Ratthasapha"
 SIA_ratthasapha_desc: "To aid with the modernisation of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] we must begin to reform the inefficient bureaucracy that was formed during the period of absolute monarchy. The Anantasamakhom Throne Hall has been deemed a suitable location for the new Ratthasapha (parliament) building and will allow more people to participate in the development of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]."
 SIA_halfleafdemocracy: "Half-Leaf Democracy"
 SIA_halfleafdemocracy_desc: "The strong guiding hand of the monarch over the nation is required to counter the ever-approaching syndicalist tide. By granting more power to the King and allowing him to appoint the Prime Minister, alongside immunity from persecution through the law, we can guarantee stability in the long run. This will, however, dissatisfy the liberals."
 SIA_tourthenation: "Tour the Nation"

 SIA_nationwidelandreform: "Nationwide Land Reform"
 SIA_nationwidelandreform_desc: "Much land owned by the nobility lies fallow across the country, serving no purpose. We may be able to rapidly increase productivity by redistributing these lands to unlanded peasantry. This will, however, provoke the land's owners."

 SIA_modernsiamesenation_desc: "Our nation has progressed rather far from what it once was.

 SIA_buddhisttraditions_desc: "The promotion Theravada Buddhism as the national religion, to further national unity, shall begin with the establishment of a single Supreme Patriarch for both the Mahanikai and Thammayutthanikai sects; alongside the minority of Mahayana Buddhists within the nation.

 SIA_creationoftherepublic_desc: "Following the assassination of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Phao Sriyanond has managed to take control over both the armed forces and the government in quick succession.

 SIA_prestigious_senate: "The Prestigious Senate"
 SIA_prestigious_senate_desc: "The Wutthisapha (Senate), which bears a close resemblance to the British House of Lords, has been introduced with the intention of allowing the King to appoint loyal and experienced advisors. This will also allow him to halt the passage of some of the more radical bills proposed by elements within the government."
 SIA_privycouncilreforms: "Privy Council Reforms"
 SIA_privycouncilreforms_desc: "With the Supreme Council of State possessing the ability to dictate the King's policies from behind-the-scenes, perhaps we should look into reforming the old Privy Council?

 SIA_amnesty_desc: "From the brutality of the civil war we have seen that we need to unify the people to guide the nation through this period of calamity. Therefore, we have decided to grant amnesty to the officers who fought against us. While this may result in some unrest these traitorous officers continue to remain important to us, thus their assistance is necessary."
 SIA_the_great_purge: "Military Purges"
 SIA_the_great_purge_desc: "The turbulent upheavals of the civil war have taught us that traitors are behind every corner and must be rooted out, thus we shall rid ourselves of all of the officers who fought against us.

 SIA_governmentalreform: "Governmental Reform"
 SIA_governmentalreform_desc: "As it stands the current bureaucratic system is oversized, especially considering the size of [SIA.GetSIAshortname].

 SIA_juridicialreform: "Judicial Reform"

 SIA_centralizedpolicecommand_desc: "Following the Weltkrieg our police command has become paralysed as it is comprised of a mix of German, Italian, and American employees.

 SIA_regionaluniversities: "Creation of Regional Universities"
 SIA_regionaluniversities_desc: "In order to support our nation we must first create a strong educational foundation.

 SIA_chiangmaioil: "Chiang Mai Oil Discovery"
 SIA_chiangmaioil_desc: "Crude oil was first discovered in the Fang district, specifically Chiang Mai, in 1921 but was never properly exploited. The current economic crisis has driven up the price to record levels and any instability in the region might cut us off from our imported sources in Palembang. Becoming more self-reliant may well help improve our struggling industrialisation as well."
 SIA_thaioilcorp: "[SIA.GetProperAdjective] Oil Corporation"
 SIA_thaioilcorp_desc: "By investing in the foundation of a central oil company we can ensure that the oil within our nation is better managed and can more effectively prospect and drill wells."
 SIA_rayonrefineries: "Rayong Refineries"
 SIA_rayonrefineries_desc: "Formerly the 'Department of Fuel Acquisition' in the Ministry of Defence, a newly created state-owned enterprise will ensure that the oil within our nation is better managed and that we can more effectively refine what we drill."

 SIA_rubberplantations: "Southern Rubber Plantations"
 SIA_rubberplantations_desc: "Exploitation of the rubber plantations in the south should be considered a vital national industry in this day and age and can help us stimulate trade as nations around the world look for sources beyond Singapore."
 SIA_thairungcars: "Thairung's [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Cars"
 SIA_thairungcars_desc: "By investing in new car models we can promote personal mobility and develop vehicles for military use."
 SIA_prototypetankdesign: "Prototype Tank Design"
 SIA_prototypetankdesign_desc: "We must bring together all of the brilliant military minds that [SIA.GetSIAshortname] possesses and fund the creation of a prototype tank design, harkening back to the prototype built during Rama VI's reign, to help stimulate our armaments industry while also gaining an edge over any potential enemies."
 SIA_petrochemicaldepartment: "The Petrochemical Department"
 SIA_petrochemicaldepartment_desc: "By creating a new authority for the extraction of coal, oil, lignite and tar we can ensure that the process of refining and processing of petroleum is better managed and more efficiently carried out."
 SIA_new_forestry_concessions: "New Forestry Concessions"
 SIA_new_forestry_concessions_desc: "By opening up virgin forests in the north to the logging companies, we can hopefully provide more jobs in the northern parts of the country. This will assist in job creation in the frontiers while providing the badly needed timber for public work projects elsewhere."
 SIA_nakhonsiwolfram: "Tungsten Mines in Nakhon Si Thammarat"
 SIA_nakhonsiwolfram_desc: "Tungsten is an incredibly crucial resource that allows for production of modern electronics and the creation of new industrial tools."

### Agricultural Path ###
 SIA_agriculuralmechanisation: "Agricultural Mechanisation"
 SIA_agriculuralmechanisation_desc: "Rice paddy uses over half of the arable land in [SIA.GetName], yet it consists mainly of peasants farming small areas and producing modest amounts of rice. By providing cheap, low-interest loans for the purchase of tractors and modern equipment we can free some of these farmers from the rice fields and send them to the factories instead, without compromising crop yields."
 SIA_agrarianscoop: "Agricultural Cooperatives"
 SIA_agrarianscoop_desc: "While the first [SIA.GetProperAdjective] co-op was created back in 1916, co-ops themselves aren't a common sight among rural communities yet. By persuading rice farmers to pool their savings together and organise into co-ops they will have enough money to buy the badly needed farming equipment in these hard times and obtain greater bargaining power against the rice merchants."
 SIA_communalapproach: "A Communal Approach"
 SIA_communalapproach_desc: "Rice is central to [SIA.GetProperAdjective] society. Our farmers have long resisted to government intervention and embraced egalitarian methods, exchanging labour with other farmers to cover their needs. By focusing on these aspects of [SIA.GetProperAdjective] society and encouraging further cooperation among the farmers, we can ensure better livelihood in rural communities."
 SIA_newfarmingtheory: "Model Farm Initiative"
 SIA_newfarmingtheory_desc: "By creating 'Model Farms' throughout the country, where rice farmers can study new farming techniques and crop diversification, farmers can improve how they utilise their lands and thus greatly increase output."
 SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics: "Economic Self-Sufficiency"
 SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics_desc: "Our plans to boost rice cultivation have worked incredibly well so far, and a dizzying amount agricultural surplus is available. We can now fully focus on our industrialisation plan."
 SIA_exportrice: "Export-Oriented Rice Production"
 SIA_exportrice_desc: "Rice is central to [SIA.GetProperAdjective] society. Rice production normally does not amount to much more than the farmer needs to survive, leaving very little to profit from. If necessary, we can collaborate with large rice merchants and mills to supply a market pressure for more production, or we can simply obligate the farmers to produce more by reintroducing income tax for rice farming."
 SIA_ricesubsidyscheme: "Rice Subsidy Scheme"
 SIA_ricesubsidyscheme_desc: "By creating incentives for those farmers who have accomplished huge increases in their rice output and allowing peasants to own the land they've cleared for agricultural purposes we can provide simple market incentives to cultivate more land and increase crop yields."
 SIA_worldgranary: "Granary of the World"
 SIA_worldgranary_desc: "We're now one of the largest rice exporters in the world, even if the peasantry does feel a touch exploited."

### Transportation Path ###
 SIA_nationalhighway: "National Highway Commission"
 SIA_nationalhighway_desc: "The expansion of Route 3 (Sukhumvit Road: Bangkok - Rayong) and Route 1 (Vachiravut Road: Bangkok - Lopburi) has been considered by the government for some time now - with the creation of the National Highway Commission perhaps things will progress more smoothly."
 SIA_railwaygauge: "Standardisation of the Railway Gauge"
 SIA_railwaygauge_desc: "Owing to the different standards of foreign nations and extractive purpose of [SIA.GetName]'s railroads, our rolling stock is different from province to province. By beginning a long-term project of standardising the railways we can make it easier to link up our cities in future."
 SIA_isanrailway: "Isan Railway Expansion"
 SIA_isanrailway_desc: "Being the largest single region of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] nation, and a key zone between our Cambodian and Laotian provinces, Isan's transport links are of vital national interest."

 SIA_royalsiamesearmy_desc: "First formed in 1874, as a response to new security threats brought in by the 1855 Bowing treaty (which opened us to international trade) - the army is the oldest and largest branch in the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Armed Forces, fulfilling its role as the protector of our sovereignty."
 SIA_phibunsongkhramplan: "Phibunsongkhram's Reforms"
 SIA_phibunsongkhramplan_desc: "The [SIA.GetName] will adopt a doctrine based on the advice of Luang Phibunsongkhram (Plaek Phibunsongkhram). Being well known for his translation of an Austrian Weltkrieg-era Field Artillery manual into Thai, he advocates for a centralised and well-equipped army with the usage of artillery being the main focus."
 SIA_seriroengritplan: "Seriroengrit's Reforms"
 SIA_seriroengritplan_desc: "The [SIA.GetName] will follow the advice of Luang Seriroengrit (Jarun Rattanakul Seriroengrit), the leader of the Phayap Army who fought off numerous cross-border raids from Burma post-British Revolution. His doctrine emphasises the usage of a decentralised regional army command, composed mainly by militias. Similar to that of Switzerland."
 SIA_phrayaphahonplan: "Phahonphonphayuhasena's Plan"
 SIA_phrayaphahonplan_desc: "The [SIA.GetName] will adopt the proposals of Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena (Phot Phahonyothin). Studies at the Hauptkadettenanstalt during his younger years and experience of the German General Staff's work during the Weltkrieg have convinced him that proper planning is the key to victory."
 SIA_jungletraining: "Jungle Combat Training"
 SIA_jungletraining_desc: "The harsh jungles of Indochina have long been a graveyard of empires, friend and foe alike. We must train all our troops to better operate in such hostile conditions."
 SIA_femalecorps: "Suranaree Battalion"
 SIA_femalecorps_desc: "While 'Ja-Khlone', female palace guards, have been a common sight in the inner palace since the Ayutthayan era having female soldiers in active combat is on another level altogether. Luang Phibunsongkhram (Plaek Phibunsongkhram) himself has voiced limited support for the petition, but the question is still up in the air. Pursuing such measures is sure to anger traditionalists."
 SIA_asymmetricalwarfare: "Asymmetrical Warfare"
 SIA_asymmetricalwarfare_desc: "By analysing the tactics employed by the Vietnamese in the Saigon Uprising -which quickly became the Indochinese Rebellion- and some of Luang Chumnanyutthasart (Phin Choonhavan)'s exploits in Shan back in 1928, we can gain some insight into effective placement of troops and how to fight in urban terrain."
 SIA_newstandardrifle: "New Standard Rifle"
 SIA_newstandardrifle_desc: "The old Type 46 Siamese Mauser is prone to malfunction in our hot and humid climate, perhaps it's time to get a replacement?"
 SIA_artilleryresearchdivision: "Artillery Research Divisions"
 SIA_artilleryresearchdivision_desc: "Lead by Luang Wichitsongkhram (Jira Wichitsongkhram), the new artillery research division is responsible for designing our own native artillery to reduce the demand for imported artillery in the army."
 SIA_defensetechnologyinstitute: "Defence Technology Institute"
 SIA_defensetechnologyinstitute_desc: "Satisfied with their most recent project; the old artillery research division will now be expanded and put in charge of other fields of military research, ensuring our armed forces at the cutting edge."
 SIA_salacheepphurchard: "For the Motherland!"
 SIA_salacheepphurchard_desc: "Our ancestors have shed so much blood on this piece of land now called [SIA.GetSIAshortname], we shall make sure that their sacrifices aren't in vain."
 SIA_expandsupportcapacity: "Expand Support Team Capacity"
 SIA_expandsupportcapacity_desc: "'Taharn Chang' (Combat Engineers) and 'Taharn Khonsong' (Logistics Teams) are what kept our army working for so long during the Weltkrieg, let's give them better tools so that they can fulfil their role in a modern war."
 SIA_armyaffairs: "Army Reorganisation"
 SIA_armyaffairs_desc: "Our army currently uses various rifle and artillery models, which has proved to be a logistical nightmare. By adopting a unified ammunition size for each gun type and phasing the old ones out or rechambering them to fire the new 8x52mmR Siamese rimmed cartridge, we will considerably help our supply issues."
 SIA_specialforce: "Special Warfare Command"
 SIA_specialforce_desc: "Modelled after the German Luftlandetruppe and the Austrian Gebirgstruppe, 'Krom Songkhram Pisaet' will be responsible for recruiting and training our new specialised units capable of disrupting the enemy from behind their lines."
 SIA_counterinsurgencytactics: "Counter-Insurgency Tactics"
 SIA_counterinsurgencytactics_desc: "Our Taharn Pran units have shown some success in detecting enemy infiltration on our border, perhaps they can also act as our eyes and ears in occupied zones too?"
 SIA_taharpran: "Taharn Pran"
 SIA_taharpran_desc: "Also known as '[SIA.GetProperAdjective] Rangers' in English, Taharn Pran is a paramilitary light infantry unit of the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army composed of volunteers who are trained to patrol the borders. They act as a quick response force in case of foreign invasion. Local volunteers also make sure that we will always have the terrain advantage over the enemy."
 SIA_royalmilitaryacademy: "[ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy"
 SIA_royalmilitaryacademy_desc: "By merging the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army Cadet School (est. 1887) with the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Army Polytechnique Institute, the newly created \"[ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy\" should hopefully yield better graduates from cross-training with other branches of the military while save us money through the abolition of antiquated/duplicated courses in the new curriculum."
 SIA_royalmunitionsfactory: "[ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] Munitions Factory"
 SIA_royalmunitionsfactory_desc: "Having enemies on all sides, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] nearly used up all her artillery shells during the Weltkrieg, with no means of being freshly supplied. This has resulted in a massive supply of artillery shells being hoarded by the paranoid logistics department over the years, but additional ammunition factories would definitely help us in the event of prolonged conflict."
 SIA_industrialmobilization: "Industrial Mobilisation Plan"
 SIA_industrialmobilization_desc: "In the times of war, key industries will temporary be put under government control to ensure our nation's survival. While this has proved to be unpopular, it will keep our army adequately armed and increase our chance of winning this war."
 SIA_phaopoliceintegration: "Integration of the Police Command"
 SIA_phaopoliceintegration_desc: "Police General Phao Sriyanond suggests that we should elevate the police force to the same level as the other 3 branches of the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Armed Forces. This will result in a more efficient organisation in case of emergency and extra funding for the under-armed police forces, but will also involve them taking a much larger cut of our tax money than ever before."
 SIA_nationalreserveact: "The National Reserve Act"
 SIA_nationalreserveact_desc: "'... All men aged between 18-45 with [SIA.GetProperAdjective] citizenship is required to be registered at their local barracks and finish their basic training course at least once, not doing so can result in being court marshalled by the Army...'\n\n-excerpt from 2484 B.E. the National Reserve Bill"

### Navy Path ###
 SIA_royalsiamesenavy: "[ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Navy"
 SIA_royalsiamesenavy_desc: "Established in 1887, the [SIA.GetSIAnavyName] has similar organisational structures to the United States Navy, since it is composed of both the naval fleet and the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps. It was also the second Asian nation to acquire submarines, after Japan."
 SIA_expandmarinescorps: "Expand the Navikkayothin Corps"
 SIA_expandmarinescorps_desc: "Although 'Taharn Ma-Rine' were first founded back in 1833, the unit served mostly as a royal honour guard throughout the 19th century. It was not until 1913 that the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps were reorganised into the modern \"Navy Amphibious Assault Group\" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the marines can serve as yet another ace in the hole for the upcoming conflict?"
 SIA_improvedlandingcraft: "Improved Landing Craft"
 SIA_improvedlandingcraft_desc: "The [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps currently use ex-British merchant ships we seized back in the Weltkrieg as their only mean of transportation. Having dedicated amphibious landing ships will make sure that our boys can embark and secure the beachhead faster."
 SIA_newflagship: "A New Flagship"
 SIA_newflagship_desc: "As we are seriously outgunned by our neighbours having something that can reliably punch through battleship armour might be a good idea. This will also provide our seamen a sense of pride and accomplishment."
 SIA_coastaldefenseships: "Coastal Defence Ships"
 SIA_coastaldefenseships_desc: "While these heavily armed cruisers are no match against German East Asiaflotte or Imperial Japanese Navy, and have limited capability in the high seas, they will surely serve our cash-strapped navy well, especially in the island-dotted coastal waters of both the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] and the Andaman Sea."
 SIA_riverpatolunit: "Riverine Patrol Units"
 SIA_riverpatolunit_desc: "Both the Salween and Mekong rivers serve as our natural fortification against enemy advances. By sending our promising junior captains to learn from their brown water counterparts they can learn a lesson or two about naval organisation."
 SIA_destroyerfleet: "Chumphon-Class Destroyers"
 SIA_destroyerfleet_desc: "Named after late Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon, these new destroyer design will serve well as the backbone of our [SIA.GetSIAprefixTH]navi."
 SIA_subships: "The S-Ships Project"
 SIA_subships_desc: "These 'Ruea-Sor's were first envisioned by late Mahidol Adulyadej, Prince of Songkhla, who studied at the Marineschule Mürwik, as 'essential' to the defence of Bangkok and by extension the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]. While we have procured four small submarines for the first line of defence; continuing the second phase of the plan, which entails another 5 submarines for the outer defensive line, might be a good idea."
 SIA_twooceannavy: "A Two-Ocean Navy"
 SIA_twooceannavy_desc: "Our navy is perhaps too small to face the Kaiserliche Marine or the IJN head-on. Some additional funding would definitely help."
 SIA_expandsattahip: "Expand Sattahip"
 SIA_expandsattahip_desc: "Sattahip was first built as the [SIA.GetSIAnavyName]'s main naval base back in 1914. As the base is quite small and already reaching its support capacity limit, expansion of its facilities is definitely in order."
 SIA_wolfpacks: "Convoy Hunting"
 SIA_wolfpacks_desc: "Being surrounded by bigger and more heavily armed navy, Admiral Luang Yutthasartkosol (Prayoon Yutthasartkosol) suggests we play hide-and-seek with the enemy fleet instead of facing them head-on. All the while sniping them from afar with our torpedoes."
 SIA_alargefleet: "Fleet in Being"
 SIA_alargefleet_desc: "Being surrounded by bigger and more heavily armed navy, Admiral Luang Kamolnavin (Sindhu Kamolnavin) wants us to get all the firepower we can get to knock the enemy battleships out of the fight and, if possible, sink them."

### Air Forces Path ###

 SIA_royalsiameseaircorps_desc: "First founded in 1913 as the Royal Flying Corps, our flyboys have helped us achieve numerous victories by assisting us from the sky. We will therefore once again rename the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Aeronautical Service to the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Air Corps."

 SIA_thaiaviationindustries: "[SIA.GetProperAdjective] Aviation Industries"
 SIA_thaiaviationindustries_desc: "By investing in [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Aviation Industries ([SIA.GetSIAairIndustryAcronym]), previously in charge of our Air force maintenance, they will be able to contribute more to the war effort with their own locally-designed planes."
 SIA_newfighterdesign: "New Fighter Design"
 SIA_newfighterdesign_desc: "Our own Prajadhipok fighter has been proved to be obsolete for modern war. Under Luang Wechayanrangsarit (Munee Mahasantana)'s leadership our design bureau will help us create the much-needed air power."
 SIA_navalbomber: "Naval Bomber Focus"
 SIA_navalbomber_desc: "Being between the Indian and Pacific Ocean and with a long coastline it makes perfect sense to develop specialised naval bombers..."
 SIA_CASfocus: "Close Air Support Focus"
 SIA_CASfocus_desc: "Our own fighter and bomber support on the ground has proved to be inadequate - maybe a dedicated CAS plane with both mobility and proper armament is needed?"
 SIA_tacticalbombers: "Tactical Bomber Development"
 SIA_tacticalbombers_desc: "Our own Boripatr bombers, designed by Luang Wechayanrangsarit (Munee Mahasantana), served well as testbed aircraft for our own design bureau but not in actual combat. Let us use our own know-how to design proper bombers suited for modern combat."
 SIA_furtherairdevelopment: "Continued Air Development"
 SIA_furtherairdevelopment_desc: "With its increasing importance out air force needs to continue to develop its combat tactics, to be better prepared for the future."
 SIA_bangfai: "Project Phi Fa"

### Decision system ###
# War Measures
 SIA_capital_relocation: "Emergency Capital Relocation"
 SIA_capital_relocation_desc: "Bangkok is placed strategically on the Chao Phraya's river mouth, suitable for trade and seaborne communication.

 SIA_join_internationale: "Join the Internationale"
 SIA_join_internationale_desc: "Following the revolution, Siam finds itself increasingly isolated regarding international affairs, a precarious situation considering our unpredictable, if not outright antagonistic, relationship with our neighbours, as well as the always present danger of imperialist encroachment upon our nation. Taking into consideration the circumstances, it has been proposed by some voices in our government that we should join our comrades in the Internationale, as they have succeeded in their revolution so far and are a growing presence in the global stage. However, some have disparaged the idea, citing that doing so would jeopardise our independence."

 BRM_capture_Chiang_Mai_desc: "As the \"Rose of the North\", Chiang Mai act as the main cultural and trading centre since its time as the capital of the Lan Na kingdom.

Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Supreme Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot."

Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long."

Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease.

As a champion of the grassroots, the ex-Admiral favours policies which helps the common people, such as price ceiling for household commodities and expansion of public welfare.

A Thai-Chinese from upper middle-class background, Pote Sarasin's experience in the Ministry of Finance during the Black Monday has shaped his worldview. As fan of the Austrian economist Hayek and a strict adherence to the law, he is against the expansion of state-owned enterprises while trying to ensure the fair, free and open competition.

Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by the locals and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to side-line the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation."

Artillerie-Schießschule in Hajmáskér, Hungary and then at Theresianische Militärakademie in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. Not long after he returned to Siam, Phibun became known for his exploits in the Siamese Intervention in Burma 1928-1929 for the liberation of Moulmein and Dawei in Tenasserim - in which he was given his title, \"Luang Phibunsongkhram\" for his achievements. Through sheer charisma and personal connections with both the younger officers and the high command via Prince Pridi Debyabongs Devakula, his old superior - it is no surprise that he reached his current position at a relatively young age.§!\n\n§YNotes: His given name means \"Strange\" in Thai as his parents viewed the position of his ears at birth as weird, and thus usually preferred to be instead referred to by his initial character P (Por)."
