### Parties ###
 CAN_totalist_party: "WP/RLP"
 CAN_totalist_party_long: "Workers' Party/Revolutionary Labour Party\n§LWith the loss of WW1, the Socialist Party of Canada saw new life, and would affiliate officially with the Internationale soon after its founding. However, the labour repression that occurred in the latter half of the 1920s saw the SPC splinter between moderates, who remained in Canada, and radicals, who fled to Britain via America. With the leadership of the party merging disparate Canadian labour groups in exile, they took up the name of the “Revolutionary Labour Party” after their British counterparts. At the same time, a front organisation was formed by the radicals still in Canada, which would be known as the Workers’ Party. The WP, and by extension the RLP, holds little to no real influence in Canada, outside of a single digit number of seats in Provincial legislatures. The Revolutionary Labour Party does, however, enjoy the support of the Third Internationale, and is openly supportive and sympathetic of the Mann-Mosley Government in Britain, wishing to emulate it in Canada.§!"
 CAN_syndicalist_party: "WUL"
 CAN_syndicalist_party_long: "Workers' Unity League\n§LFormed out of the One Big Union in 1926, the Workers' Unity League follows in its radical footsteps, supporting the replacement of Parliament wholesale with a body elected directly by the unions. A \"dualism\" has formed between the One Big Union and the Workers' Unity League, where the leader of one is the leader of the other. While not Canada’s largest union federation, the radical Worker’s Unity League has punched well above the political weight expected for an organisation of its size, organising the majority of strikes since the arrival of the Exiles, and as such have faced harsh strikebreaking and repression by the political establishment. Unlike other unions in Canada, the WUL doesn’t give aid or organisation to the CCF, instead trying to get voters to either spoil ballots or write-in more hardline socialist candidates. They also enjoy covert funding and support from the London Government and Canada’s socialist exiles.§!"
 CAN_radical_socialist_party: "CCF (Progressive-Socialist)"
 CAN_radical_socialist_party_long: "Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation (Progressive-Socialist)\n§LThe left wing of the CCF represents the more urban union-dominated section of the party, having grown out out of the labour unrest at the end of the Great War and the \"Canadian Labour Revolt\" that spawned in response to Robert Borden’s Imperial War policy. The most famous of these strikes was the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, put down heavily by then Prime Minister William Thomas White. This faction of the CCF is notably more radical, more willing to encourage strikes, and vehemently against the notion of any war with the government in London.§!"
 CAN_social_democrat_party: "CCF (Farmer-Labour)"
 CAN_social_democrat_party_long: "Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour)\n§LThe Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist) has been a rising star in Canada’s political scene. The moderate pro-farmer wing is able to trace its origins to the post-war agrarian unrest that dominated western Canada. The CCF grew out a union between the Independent Labour Party and the radical “Ginger Group” of the Progressive Party, allying itself with unions and labour interests in order to form a party truly interested in the plight of the common man. The moderate wing heavily favours a reformist and electoralist approach, believing they will be able to force Parliament to align with their beliefs, and trying to work within the system to change it into something better than it currently is.§!"
 CAN_social_liberal_party: "Progressive Party"
 CAN_social_liberal_party_long: "Progressive Party of Canada\n§LOriginally forming out of a protest movement in 1920 and becoming the second-largest group in Parliament that same year, the Progressive Party lacked a strong structure for the first few years of its existence. Between supporting the Liberal government and refusing Thomas Crerar’s reforms for the party, it slowly lost steam as the radical \"Ginger Group\" splintered off in 1924, Social Credit grew in Alberta, and some other more moderate figures in the party, including the then-leader Robert Forke, split off to join the Liberals. Upon Forke's departure from the party in 1925, Crerar came back and his reforms were accepted by the main party, with a compromise being made with the United Farmer Parties to keep the caucus together, granting them considerable autonomy, and allowing the Progressives to survive, primarily in Manitoba, as a minor party primarily focused on free trade and the concerns of the common farmer. In 1936 it sits in coalition with Mackenzie King’s Liberals, although this alliance isn’t ironclad, and the Progressives would be willing to work with any party willing to give concessions to improve the lives of farmers.§!"
 CAN_market_liberal_party: "Liberal Party"
 CAN_market_liberal_party_long: "Liberal Party of Canada\n§LOne of the two major parties in Canada, the Liberal Party of Canada is currently dominated by the “Laurier Liberals” under Mackenzie King, following the standard set by Wilfrid Laurier, believing in Classical Liberal beliefs and holding a vice-like grip of Québec’s Federal seats. However, there are two other wings of the party, the first being the progressive wing, informally known as the Regina Group, which flanks King on the left. Led by Charles Avery Stewart, they broadly hold agrarian populist and progressive beliefs. The second wing is the Liberal-Unionists, led by James Ralston and flanking King on the right. They represent the most pro-British faction of the Liberals, and mainly hail from Ontario and Nova Scotia. Holding a minority government since the 1931 election, the Liberals, in coalition with the Progressives, have taken a more interventionist view on the economy in order to recover from the Great Depression, while also thawing out labour relations and charting a course of detente with the CCF. This warm relationship with the CCF, alongside a seeming aloofness towards invading the London Government, has caused relations between the Liberal Party and British Exiles to be fraught, neither group truly liking the other.§!"
 CAN_market_liberal_party_fake: "Liberal Party"
 CAN_social_conservative_party: "Conservative Party"
 CAN_social_conservative_party_long: "Conservative Party of Canada\n§LThe other major party in Canada, the Conservative party of Canada has historically been defined by their Imperial loyalism and anti-American views. The party is broadly split into two major camps, the Red Tories under Robert Manion, who, while certainly sympathetic to the Exiles and wanting to strike the London Government, see it as necessary to recover economically and build up, biding their time for the right moment to strike. The other faction, led by former Minister of Defence Hugh Guthrie and Ontario Premier George Henry, are the Unionists, named after Robert Borden's Great War Unionist Government. They harken back to his beliefs in Imperial loyalism, seeing the Homecoming as the utmost priority for the Canadian Government. While Manion currently leads the party, the party's right-wing poses an internal challenge to him, and he must walk a tightrope to keep this coalition happy.§!"

 CAN_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Conservative Party of Canada (Unionists)\n§LThe right-wing of the Conservative Party, this faction formed in the wake of the British Revolution. Forming around then-Prime Minister Arthur Meighen, the Unionists are primarily united on their loyalty to the British Crown and desire to see the flames of revolution in London extinguished. The leading figures of this faction, former Minister of Defence Hugh Guthrie, leader of the Conservatives in the Senate Arthur Meighen, and Conservative Premier of Ontario George Henry, have banded together and formed a sort of \"internal opposition\" to Robert Manion and the Red Tories.§!"

 CAN_paternal_autocrat_party: "British Government-in-Exile"
 CAN_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "British Government-in-Exile\n§LFollowing the collapse of the Loyalist lines in the latter stages of the Civil War, the National Government and what remained of the loyalist Parliament fled the metropole for exile in Ottawa, where they remain to this day. Largely irrelevant in the context of Canadian politics, the British Cabinet effectively repesents the exiles in political affairs and primarily concerns itself with lobbying for a Canadian military intervention to liberate Great Britain of the syndicalist menace.§!"
 CAN_national_populist_party: "Social Credit Party"
 CAN_national_populist_party_long: "Social Credit Party of Canada\n§LThe Social Credit Party of Canada initially only existed in Alberta, having been formed by the preacher William “Bible Bill” Aberhart in 1927 and sweeping into power in Alberta in the same year. Since then, John Horne Blackmore has led the Federal branch of the party. In 1930, the Backbencher’s revolt in Alberta led to a notable radicalisation of the movement, with power being given to the radical \"Social Credit Board\" chaired by Glenville MacLachlan, and the Greenshirts under Joseph Unwin and Arthur Kitson being established. Having their roots in agrarian populism, they have sympathy towards the Longists in America. While they’re apathetic to the Monarchy, they support the Homecoming out of fierce anti-socialist beliefs.§!"

 CAN_american_refugee_modifier: "American Refugees"
 CAN_bastion_of_the_old_order: "Bastion of the Old Order"
 CAN_bastion_of_the_old_order_desc: "Cast out of their home and forced to take refuge on our shores, the Exiles can only watch as Britain toils under socialist tyranny. But while they may be down, we will work so they most assuredly will not remain so. In Ottawa, Montréal, Toronto, and across Canada, the flags old and new fly triumphantly and every day men of the Dominion are emboldened to prepare for the final struggle to end the Syndicalist menace. One day a reckoning will be sent across the sea; the empire will strike back."
 CAN_divided_nation: "Divided Nation"
 CAN_divided_nation_desc: "The nation is split between the Conservatives and the British Exiles on one side, hoping to mobilise the Empire into preparing for a war in Europe, and Mackenzie King's Liberals on the other, putting Canada's sovereignty first and unwilling to commit the country to a disastrous war. It is hoped that the coming election will decide the issue once and for all."
 CAN_anglo_french_tensions_1: "Anglo-French Tensions"
 CAN_anglo_french_tensions_1_desc: "Most of Canada's French population is located in the eastern province of Québec, and the traditional distrust between the Québecois and English Canadians has heated up with recent talk of pushing the country towards war. Of all Canadians, the Québecois are the most ardently opposed to conscription and the idea of wasting their lives on a far-away war for a sovereign they feel isn't their own."
 CAN_anglo_french_friendship: "Anglo-French Peace"
 CAN_anglo_french_friendship_desc: "Not only have the tensions been resolved, for the moment relations between English and French Canadians are the best they've been in decades. Chances are something will happen which will sour things once again, but for now the French are eager to march right beside the rest of their fellow Canadians."
 CAN_great_depression_1: "The Great Depression"
 CAN_great_depression_1_desc: "Our recovery from the Great Depression was going well until Black Monday hit our shores. Thankfully, the Canadian economy isn't nearly as tied to German markets as some, and economists say it won't be long before we recover from this extra hurdle that's now been placed in our path."
 CAN_great_depression_2: "The Great Depression"
 CAN_great_depression_2_desc: "While Canada has been far quicker to recover from the Depression than their American cousins to the south, their economy is in many ways tied to southern trade and thus they will never be fully recovered until the Americans are. Still, things have been rapidly improving, and economists say a complete recovery is just around the corner."
 CAN_resistance_to_conscription: "Resistance to Conscription"
 CAN_resistance_to_conscription_desc: "The idea of conscription has long been controversial in Canada. It is resisted fiercely by French Canadians, who hold little loyalty to either the British monarchy or the French exiles. Among English Canadians, resistance is not as widespread, but the spectre of the Great War's ultimately pointless bloodshed looms over most of the population. It will take considerable political heft to change this situation."

 CAN_imp_investment_1: "Imperial Investment"
 CAN_imp_research_1: "Imperial Research"
 CAN_imp_trade: "Imperial Trade"
 CAN_professional_army: "Professional Army"
 CAN_professional_army_desc: "Some armies might pride themselves in having a lot of blokes running around with rifles, but we pride ourselves with having one of the most disciplined and organised armies the world knows. Where mass conscripted Germans and Syndicalist militias flee against a few volleys of gunfire, we stand against the fires of Hell with a stiff upper lip."
 CAN_mounties_1: "The Mounties"
 CAN_mounties_1_desc: "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or 'Mounties', have been given sweeping powers to survey and detain suspected dissidents across the country. While many now see them as a sort of secret police, there is no doubting their efficiency in preventing unrest and dissent in our country."
 CAN_quebec_in_flames_idea: "Québec in Flames"
 CAN_quebec_in_flames_idea_desc: "The enactment of full conscription has tipped the entire province of Québec into open violence and resistance to English rule.\n\n§YNOTE: This idea has no effects, but is a marker for the state effects in Québec which reduce resources and local manpower.§!"

 CAN_exiles_active_idea: "British Exiles Drafted"
 CAN_war_measures_act_idea: "War Measures Act"
 CAN_national_employment_commission: "National Employment Commission"
 CAN_national_employment_commission_desc: "While an advisory board by nature, the National Employment Commission has allowed the Government to pursue public works and employ the unemployed while avoiding the backlash the labour camps of the 1920s had."
 CAN_unemployment_insurance_idea: "Unemployment Insurance"
 CAN_cbc_idea: "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"
 CAN_cbc_idea_desc: "The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the natural continuation of our efforts to found a respected national radio service, with the British Broadcasting Corporation subverted by the Syndicalists and the Imperial Broadcasting Corporation mostly ignored by Canadians."
 CAN_cbc_propaganda_idea: "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"
 CAN_cbc_propaganda_idea_desc: "The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the natural continuation of our efforts to found a respected national radio service, and its success has afforded us the opportunity to use it as a propaganda tool to support the war cause."
 CAN_uoftoronto_idea: "University of Toronto"
 CAN_uoftoronto_idea_desc: "The University of Toronto is Canada's premier institute of learning, made even grander by the presence of British scientists and intellectuals who fled to the country after the fall of the United Kingdom. Should Britain ever be restored, they will likely return home, but - for now - their presence in Toronto is incredibly useful."
 CAN_aircanada_idea: "Trans-Canada Airlines"
 CAN_aircanada_idea_desc: "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."
 CAN_air_training_plan_idea: "Entente Air Training Plan"
 CAN_air_training_plan_idea_desc: "Air training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."
 CAN_air_focus: "Focus on the RCAF"
 CAN_navy_focus: "Focus on the RCN"
 CAN_davie_contract: "Davie Shipbuilding Contract"
 CAN_davie_contract_desc: "Davie Shipbuilding is the largest contractor in Canada, bolstered by the influx of money from the British Exiles. A lucrative contract with the Canadian government would ensure our ships get top priority and access to the latest technology when it comes to repairs and refitting."
 CAN_shipbuilding_plan_1: "Canadian Shipbuilding Plan"
 CAN_exile_admiralty_idea: "The British Admiralty"
 CAN_exile_admiralty_idea_desc: "The British Royal Navy has some of the most experienced officers in the world, with a long naval tradition, and that has now been passed down to Canada. The admirals will remain until the Home Isles have been retaken, so until that happens we should take advantage of all they have to teach us."
 CAN_navy_games_won: "Won Naval Manoeuvres"
 CAN_navy_games_lost: "Lost Naval Manoeuvres"
 CAN_invasion_plans_1: "Invasion Focus"
 CAN_invasion_plans_1_desc: "Until the Home Isles are regained, our entire navy must be geared towards invasion - our ships must range further than before, and be prepared to undertake an amphibious assault whenever possible."
 CAN_invasion_plans_2: "Invasion Focus"
 CAN_invasion_plans_2_desc: "We have contacted the resistance in the Union of Britain, giving us a network of information on their operations that nobody else would be able to acquire. More than that, we're primed and prepared for amphibious invasion tactics. Our ships have been reworked to extend their range even further. We are ready."
 CAN_loyalist_uprising: "Loyalist Uprising"
 CAN_loyalist_uprising_desc: "We always knew there were loyalists to the Old Order among us, biding their time. Now that they have risen, we can scour them from the face of Britain!"
 CAN_special_branch_idea: "The Special Branch"
 CAN_special_branch_idea_desc: "The RCMP Special Branch is a unit of the national police service which has been formed to conduct Canada's counterintelligence operations. Several of its directors once worked for MI5 in the United Kingdom, allowing this unit a head start on rivalling other, more long-established, intelligence services around the world."

 CAN_war_of_1812_idea_1: "The American Intervention"
 CAN_war_of_1812_idea_2: "The Looming War"
 CAN_war_of_1812_idea_desc: "The prospect of an intervention in the American Civil War has the entire nation terrified. If it happens, it means that battles will be fought on Canadian soil for the first time in over a century, against an opponent that could very well overwhelm us with sheer numbers. We must be ready."
 CAN_refugee_crisis_1: "American Refugee Crisis"
 CAN_refugee_crisis_1_desc: "The volumes of refugees coming into Canada from the south is taxing our support systems, as well as the ability to our military to keep order."
 CAN_refugee_crisis_sec: "American Refugees Under Guard"
 CAN_refugee_crisis_sec_desc: "It means bolstering the numbers in provincial police forces, men who could otherwise be soldiers, but this will keep the camps under close guard and prevent further problems."
 CAN_refugee_crisis_help: "American Refugees Aided"
 CAN_refugee_crisis_help_desc: "The camps will always be a source of problems for us, but we've gone out of our way to ensure the refugees are treated and fed well. Hopefully the war will be over soon."
 CAN_refugee_crisis_sam: "Project Samaritan"
 CAN_refugee_crisis_sam_desc: "The camps are being dismantled, and the American refugees integrated in Canadian cities and put to work. It's an expensive plan, but also a very Canadian one."

### Decisions ###
 CAN_political_decisions: "Canadian Political Decisions"
 CAN_enact_full_conscription: "Enact Full Conscription"
 CAN_enact_full_conscription_desc: "We cannot abide by the restrictions placed upon our conscription laws any longer - no matter the consequence, we need the manpower in the Canadian army now!"
 CAN_suppress_quebecois_state: "Suppress the Québecois in [FROM.GetName]"
 CAN_suppress_quebecois_state_desc: "We cannot allow the Québecois dissidents to disrupt Canada further. The time has come to send in the army and restore peace!"
 CAN_emergency_draft: "Enact Emergency Draft"
 CAN_emergency_draft_desc: "There are a number of British Exiles present in Canada who either are too old to serve in the military or unwilling. The old guard can serve as mentors to the new, and the unwilling should serve to fight for their homeland whether they wish to or not. The time has come to call them to service."
 CAN_expand_conscription_policies: "Expand Conscription Policies"
 CAN_expand_conscription_policies_desc: "We needn't worry about arguments from the opposition, now - it's time to loosen up our policies on conscription, so we get more able bodies out in the field and we do so faster. Let's cut through the red tape and simply get it done!"
 CAN_war_measures_act: "War Measures Act"
 CAN_war_measures_act_desc: "The War Measures Act, passed in 1914, grants the Government many useful powers and, while certainly unpopular, could be helpful in handling the crisis in Québec... however if we enact it while at peace we will certainly suffer significant backlash."
 CAN_expand_secret_police: "Expand the Secret Police"
 CAN_expand_secret_police_desc: "Keeping watch over law and order at home is the first line of our defence. Let's provide the RCMP the tools they need, even if Canadians find such a move unpopular."
 CAN_consolidate_power: "Consolidate Power"
 CAN_consolidate_power_desc: "With the Canadian Parliament sidelined, we can take power in the country wherever it's deemed necessary."
 CAN_increase_factory_prod: "Increase Factory Production"
 CAN_increase_factory_prod_desc: "Cutting through the red tape that prevents factories from working hard - such as worrying about what they pay their factory workers, or where they get them in the first place - will let us get the jump on the syndicalists."
 CAN_fund_the_military: "Fund the Military"
 CAN_fund_the_military_desc: "There is a lot of places where budgets can be cut - because the military needs the attention, desperately."
 CAN_call_emergency_reserves: "Call Emergency Reserves"
 CAN_call_emergency_reserves_desc: "We are nearing the point of no return - it is time to call on our last reserves of strength."
 CAN_claim_alaska: "Repudiate the Hay-Herbert Treaty"
 CAN_claim_alaska_desc: "The border between Canada and Alaska was made in the favour of Americans, thanks to an interest by the British government of the time in improving relations with the United States. Canadian interests were considered of secondary importance. Since the treaty was approved by a government we are no longer subservient to, we reject the arbitration and the border. Canada has a natural claim to Alaska, and it should have been ours to begin with."
 CAN_claim_washington: "Repudiate the Oregon Treaty"
 CAN_claim_washington_desc: "The Oregon Treaty was a settling of the border between the United States and Canada, with the British surrendering the southern part of what we called Columbia to the Americans in order to avoid a war. This was a treaty created before Canada was properly a nation, and we see no need to adhere to it now."
 CAN_claim_maine: "Repudiate the Webster-Ashburton Treaty"
 CAN_claim_maine_desc: "The Webster-Ashburton Treaty settled the border between the state of Maine and the province of New Brunswick, but it was negotiated by the British and we see no reason to adhere to it now."

 CAN_construct_dockyard_decision: "Expand Dockyards in [From.GetName]"

 CAN_meet_with_germany: "Meet with the [From.GetFactionName]"
 CAN_meet_with_germany_desc: "Both the Entente and the [From.GetFactionName] are at war with the Third Internationale. There have been murmurings within the Entente leadership that cooperation between our sides might be beneficial... although others say it will likely come at too high a price. Still, it would be worth meeting with the [From.GetAdjective] government to see if cooperation is even possible."
 CAN_access_to_portugal: "Ask for Access to Southern Africa"
 CAN_access_to_portugal_desc: "Our war against [SAF.GetNameDef] will be difficult to pursue unless we gain access to bases closer to their territory. Thankfully, [From.GetNameDef] is a traditional British ally and still retains territory nearby. We should ask them for military and naval access, on behalf of the entire Entente."

 CAN_returning_home_decisions: "The Home Isles"
 CAN_returning_home_decisions_desc: "Our primary goal is to see the Home Isles wrested from the hands of the syndicalists and returned to the United Kingdom. That is our duty as leader of the Entente, as subjects to [CAN_king_full_name], and as second home to over half a million British Exiles. It will not be an easy task, but we must somehow find a way."
 CAN_attack_uob: "Retake the Home Isles"
 CAN_attack_uob_desc: "We must be careful to time our attack carefully, as [From.GetNameDef] and its allies are far more powerful than us on an individual level. We cannot, however, sit on our hands forever. At some point, caution must be thrown to the wind, as fate favours the bold!"
 CAN_all_hands_on_deck: "All Hands on Deck!"
 CAN_all_hands_on_deck_desc: "The fight against the syndicalists will take everything we got - and that means casting our net for conscription wider than ever before."
 CAN_contact_british_loyalists: "Contact the British Loyalists"
 CAN_contact_british_loyalists_desc: "Once we have gained a foothold on the British mainland, the loyalists we have been in contact with will be prepared to rise up and fight on our behalf."
 CAN_contact_northern_irish_loyalists: "Contact the Ulster Loyalists"
 CAN_contact_northern_irish_loyalists_desc: "The Orange Order stands ready to fight for us against the syndicalists in Northern Ireland - all that we need to do is make contact and supply them with the resources they need."
 CAN_rally_the_country: "Rally the Country"
 CAN_rally_the_country_desc: "The country is being invaded, and now we must fight like never before lest we be overrun!"
 CAN_approach_ireland: "Approach [IRE.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_approach_ireland_desc: "The Irish may have already openly allied with the Germans, but they may still be amenable to overtures allowing us to use Ireland as a stopping point for an invasion of the Britain - provided they can trust the British government-in-exile enough to cooperate, of course."
 CAN_reconcile_with_ireland: "Reconcile with [IRE.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_reconcile_with_ireland_desc: "Ireland is perhaps the most attractive staging ground for any invasion of Britain - if access to the country could be secured, it would be an immeasurable boon. The Irish have been concerned enough about the Union since its inception that an alliance is not impossible, even if it doesn't come for free."
 CAN_bailout_iceland: "Bailout [ICE.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_bailout_iceland_desc: "Black Monday has devastated the Icelandic economy, leaving them scrambling to recover. It's a small country, however, and a bailout on our part would be easily handled - and might be enough to convince them to join the Entente and provide us a potential launching point for an invasion of Britain."
 CAN_fund_icelandic_resistance: "Fund the Icelandic Resistance"
 CAN_fund_icelandic_resistance_desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is currently under the [ENG.GetAdjective] thumb, but with some quiet funding that could rapidly change."
 CAN_seize_greenland: "Seize Greenland"
 CAN_seize_greenland_desc: "With [From.GetNameDef] in the midst of an emergency, we need to act quickly to secure our own borders - the island of Greenland is too close to allow the possibility of an enemy presence."
 CAN_build_base_greenland: "Expand Godthåb Naval Base"
 CAN_build_base_greenland_desc: "Greenland isn't the most ideal place from which to control the Atlantic, but it shall serve."

 kings_influence_exile: "Despite having lost the Home Isles, §Y[CAN_king_full_name]§! remains a potent figure in the Empire and the Entente.

 CAN_royal_visit: "Royal Visit to [From.GetNameDef]"
 CAN_royal_visit_desc: "We can send [CAN_king_full_name] on a tour through [From.GetNameDef], ideally propping up their support for the Entente's war efforts and engineering some goodwill from the [From.GetAdjective] government. Considering all the king's other duties, this can only be done once a year."
 CAN_royal_speech: "Royal Address to the Entente"

 CAN_tour_home_country_desc: "We can send [CAN_king_full_name] on a tour through [Root.GetNameDef], ideally engineering some goodwill and support for the war effort from the [From.GetAdjective] people. Considering all the king's other duties, this can only be done once a year."

 CAN_direct_exiles_desc: "The British Exiles are prominently placed within [Root.GetNameDef]. Once a year, [CAN_king_full_name] has the ability to give them direction regarding where they should commit their efforts in supporting him."
 CAN_suppress_exiles: "Suppress the Exiles"
 CAN_suppress_exiles_desc: "Having the British Exiles wield so much influence in [Root.GetNameDef] is not in our best interests. We need to begin exerting some influence of our own to stop their efforts at controlling the [Root.GetAdjective] government."
 CAN_support_government: "Support the [Root.GetAdjective] Prime Minister"

 CAN_tour_effect_ROOT_tt: "Will increase §Y[Root.GetNameDef]'s§! stability, war support, mobilisation speed, and army morale for up to a full year. Other events may also occur during §Y[CAN_king_full_name]'s§! tour.\n"

 CAN_reinforce_ottawa: "Reinforce Ottawa"

 CAN_reinforce_winnipeg: "Reinforce Winnipeg"
 CAN_reinforce_winnipeg_desc: "With the syndicalists on our southern doorstep, the prospect of war coming to Canada looms over us all. We must look to shoring up the defences around Winnipeg, a vital railway link between the Prairies and Eastern Ontario, in the eventuality of a ground assault."

 CAN_declare_war_on_WCA: "Stop the Southern Syndicalists"
 CAN_declare_war_on_WCA_desc: "It appears [WCA.GetNameDef] is on the verge of winning the civil war in the south. While they are strong, we must face them now... or risk facing them later, once they have recovered and gathered their full strength. We cannot afford to let the Internationale have a world power on our southern border. May God forgive us for what we must do, but the time has come to invade the south."
 CAN_invite_ACC_ceasefire: "Invite [ACC.GetNameDef] into the Entente"
 CAN_invite_ACC_ceasefire_desc: "The [ACW_ceasefire_name] leaves [ACC.GetNameDef] in a precarious situation: they control the west, but [WCA.GetNameDef] controls the industrial heartland and the East Coast. They will be hard-pressed to win the war once the ceasefire ends, so perhaps this is a good time to approach them about Entente membership. It will mean committing ourselves to war with [WCA.GetNameDef], but - quite frankly - that was going to happen eventually anyhow."

 CAN_delay_canadian_intervention: "Delay Canadian Intervention"
 CAN_delay_canadian_intervention_desc: "We cannot prevent the Canadians from intervening in the civil war... but we can delay them. If we sponsor nation-wide strikes with a clear syndicalist connection, they'll be tied up at home and too paranoid to take action. We will only be able to do this so many times before the Canadians figure out where the funds are coming from, however."

 CAN_kings_speech_desc: "Edward, Prince of Wales, will be coronated king as the Canadian political landscape consists of two main factions: one led by Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the other led by Conservative Robert Manion and the exiled British aristocracy. The Empire will be awaiting his radio address after the coronation, where he will be expected to declare his government's direction."
 CAN_exiled_parliament: "Status of the Exiled Parliament"
 CAN_exiled_parliament_desc: "The British Parliament-in-Exile has acted on emergency powers since the country's downfall. It's been over a decade, however, and there are many who feel that the time has come for a change."
 CAN_imperial_conference: "The Imperial Conference"
 CAN_imperial_conference_desc: "There has been several gatherings of the Dominions since the fall of the Home Isles, primarily dealing with how to keep the Empire going with Britain gone. But this year is different, the question of what to do against the London Regime will be the chief issues of this year's conference."
 CAN_question_of_the_governor_general: "Question of the Governor-General"
 CAN_question_of_the_governor_general_desc: "The Govenor-General is the representative for the Monarch in Canada, and as such holds the power to dissolve Parliament and give Royal Assent to any Bills. The Governor-General has always been a British Lord, and while that is unlikely to change, there are a few voices in Parliament who seek a more amenable lord to become the Governor-General."
 CAN_secure_parliamentary_allies: "Secure Parliamentary Allies"
 CAN_secure_parliamentary_allies_desc: "With the election over, we have gained a mandate to achieve our electoral goals. Despite this however, Parliament is heavily fractured and it may be a good idea to send out feelers to the minor parties to hopefully form a stronger governing coalition, lest the chaos in the south come to us in Ottawa."

 CAN_quebec_in_flames: "Québec in Flames"
 CAN_quebec_in_flames_desc: "The patience of the Québecois with English Canada has finally hit a boiling point. Across the eastern province, demonstrations and even riots have broken down the fabric of social order... at a time when Canada can least afford it. Somehow, things must be set right."
 CAN_negotiate_with_duplessis: "Negotiate with Duplessis"
 CAN_negotiate_with_duplessis_desc: "For all his populist posturing, Duplessis only truly cares for his own power. If we can get him to the negotiating table we can likely get him to quell the unrest through a negotiated agreement. This won't come without sacrifice, but the velvet glove may get us further than the iron fist."
 CAN_national_resources_mobilization_act: "National Resources Mobilization Act"
 CAN_national_resources_mobilization_act_desc: "One of Duplessis main issues was that of Conscription and sending the people of Québec to die in wars they didn't want any part of. Luckily for us we managed to find a compromise with the populist, a limited Conscription that will use conscripts for military production at home, allowing volunteers to move to the front lines. The Bill to pass this compromise, the National Resource Mobilization Act, must be passed through Parliament as soon as possible."
 CAN_invest_in_la_belle_province: "Invest in \"La Belle Province\""
 CAN_invest_in_la_belle_province_desc: "The other demands of Duplessis broadly fell into building more in Québec and functionally sending more money to his Province to develop it. To this end we must present an amendment to the budget, providing Duplessis with the needed funds to finally put this crisis behind us."
 CAN_send_in_the_rcmp: "Send in the RCMP"
 CAN_send_in_the_rcmp_desc: "We have had enough. Understanding the interests of the Québecois is one thing, but letting them decide when they get to be part of this country and when to fight for it? It is beyond reason. If they wish to talk, it will be after the RCMP have gone in to restore order."
 CAN_ensure_order_in_quebec: "Ensure Order in Québec"
 CAN_ensure_order_in_quebec_desc: "Arthur Meighen nationalised the Sûreté du Québec, Québec's local police force, back in 1924 during a major General Strike. With Duplessis unwilling to ensure order, we must nationalise the police once more and have them coordinate with the RCMP, preventing the riots in Québec from getting out of hand and restoring peace."
 CAN_force_the_conscription_issue: "Force the Conscription Issue"
 CAN_force_the_conscription_issue_desc: "We cannot afford to compromise on conscription, not while America is in flames and not while war with the London Regime is on the horizon. Now that the RCMP and Sûreté du Québec have restored order in the province, we can mobilise Québec to aid in the war effort."
 CAN_a_second_unionist_government: "A Second Unionist Government"
 CAN_a_second_unionist_government_desc: "The crisis in Québec echoes 1917 once again, and so we must respond to it as we did in 1917. We should reach across the aisle to sympathetic \"Unionist\" Liberals and form a coalition of the centre with them, allowing strong action in Québec and keeping the radicals in Parliament from true power."
 CAN_quell_regionalist_unrest: "Quell Regionalist Unrest"
 CAN_quell_regionalist_unrest_desc: "The formation of our new Government, and the notable exclusion of certain regions from it, has sent waves of anger through the country. In Québec, Newfoundland, and the western Provinces there have been widespread demonstrations against us. We must quell this unrest if we are to shore up our position for the inevitable conflict, the RCMP will restore order by any means necessary."
 CAN_consolidate_the_national_government: "Consolidate the National Government"
 CAN_consolidate_the_national_government_desc: "With unrest dying down we can turn our attention to Parliament, with James Ralston taking de facto control of the Liberal Party from Mackenzie King, the Independent Liberals and Independent Conservatives are losing steam, by extending an olive branch to these figures we may be able to expand our control in Parliament further and fully cement our National Government."
 CAN_the_second_parliament_stands_up: "The Second Parliament Steps Up"
 CAN_the_second_parliament_stands_up_desc: "Despite the Unionists best efforts, the unrest in Canada has grinded the country to a halt. Due to the Unionists being forced to rely on us further, we can perform a sort of soft coup and take the reigns of governance, all while we keep the Unionists in Canada's Parliament to keep a pretence of civilian rule."

 CAN_crown_corporations: "The Crown Corporations"
 CAN_crown_corporations_desc: "Enterprises founded and run by the state, so-called 'Crown Corporations', allow us to develop and maintain access to strategic resources and expertise that might otherwise by neglected or ignored by the market. Sadly, not every industrial magnate sees the use of investing in wartime resources, at least for now."
 CAN_cn_rail_expansion: "CN Rail Expansion"
 CAN_cn_rail_expansion_desc: "Rail networks are the arteries of the nation of Canada, and none more so than the state-run Canadian National Railway. Expanding this network can only strengthen the nation, and it will surely prove crucial should we need to perform wartime supply and troops transport across the nation."
 CAN_cp_rail_expansion: "CP Rail Expansion"
 CAN_cp_rail_expansion_desc: "It was only the promise of a trans-continental rail network that brought the western provinces into the Dominion. Maintaining and expanding this network will help ensure our continued control over the region, and will serve us should we ever require large-scale fret between both seas."
 CAN_invest_resources: "Invest in Natural Resources"
 CAN_invest_resources_desc: "Much of the nation's wealth lies in its untapped natural resources. While prospecting and exploiting all those deposits hidden in Canada's wastes and wilderness will take time, we can take advantage of this natural bounty to ensure our strength and independence."
 CAN_prairie_oil: "Prairie Oil Prospects"
 CAN_prairie_oil_desc: "There has been small scale drilling in the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan for some time. But perhaps there is more of this critical resource waiting for those who bother to look? Perhaps we might even be sitting on fields of oil that would rival those of the United States?"
 CAN_explore_the_north: "Explore the North"
 CAN_explore_the_north_desc: "Before we can mine it, we have to find it. While the large forests have long been explored by civilian prospectors, only state-funded geological expeditions will dare venture into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions to identify the best sites for excavation and extraction."
 CAN_create_iedc: "Create the IEDC"
 CAN_create_iedc_desc: "Suggestions have been made to form an Imperial Economic Development Council, to expand the industrial strength of the Entente by having its members work together on economic matters. Funded by Canada, the strongest remaining member of the Empire, the IEDC would serve to help us meet the challenges ahead."
 CAN_public_works: "National Employment Commission"
 CAN_public_works_desc: "The Great Depression has not released its hold upon us yet - we still have hordes of unemployed men across the country, living in poverty or turning to crime. To fix this, we will establish a National Employment Commission under the Chairmanship of Arthur Purvis, which will seek to gainfully employ the unemployed while also looking to potentially establish unemployment insurance to help people back on their feet."
 CAN_economic_recovery: "Economic Recovery"
 CAN_economic_recovery_desc: "Finally our initiatives have borne fruit: the era of the Great Depression is over, and we can move forward into prosperity once more!"
 CAN_national_housing_act: "National Housing Act"
 CAN_national_housing_act_desc: "Housing is a both a basic necessity and a major source of economic activity. By providing incentives for the construction and purchase of homes, we can create demand for key industries and promote expansion of the industrial economy as a whole."
 CAN_polymer_corp: "Polymer Corporation"
 CAN_polymer_corp_desc: "The Polymer Corporation, or Polycorp, is a crown corporation tasked with the development and production of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. These new materials will allow us to discover new ways to produce equipment that has until then proved a problem for our industry, making them cheaper and faster to output."
 CAN_create_isac: "Create the ISAC"
 CAN_create_isac_desc: "A number of university presidents and scientific leaders meeting in Toronto have called for the formation of a new organisation to coordinate research among the member states of the Entente. The work of co-coordinating these links is to be carried out by the Imperial Scientific and Academic Council, located and funded by Canada, with contributions from the rest of the alliance."
 CAN_national_research_council: "National Research Council"
 CAN_national_research_council_desc: "The National Research Council was founded during the Weltkrieg to advise the Canadian government on science and research. By providing the organisation with additional funding and support we can expand our technology base to the benefit of both industry and military."
 CAN_found_cbc: "Found the CBC"
 CAN_found_cbc_desc: "A proposal has been put forward to expand the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission into a full-fledged national radio network called the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This would help bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive foreign broadcasts."
 CAN_electronics_training: "Electronics Training Initiative"
 CAN_electronics_training_desc: "We should take it upon ourselves to train a cadre of experts to man and maintain radios, RADAR and other modern electronic weapons of war. The RADAR is no simple technology, and we will need competent engineers and field operators to ensure our stations work at maximal efficiency, especially as we build more."
 CAN_university_of_toronto: "University of Toronto"
 CAN_university_of_toronto_desc: "The University of Toronto is one of Canada's oldest institutions of learning, and it is the facility that grew the most when the brightest minds from the United Kingdom fled to the country. That gathering of intelligentsia is something we should take advantage of with increased funding on government-approved projects."
 CAN_we_need_industry: "We Need Industry"
 CAN_we_need_industry_desc: "Our biggest need right now is to expand Canada's industrial base. It will never rival that of the Americans to the south, due to our smaller population, but we need to try."
 CAN_we_need_munitions: "We Need Armaments"
 CAN_we_need_munitions_desc: "We need factories to push out guns and bullets, in greater numbers than it was ever assumed possible... even if we need to build them from scratch."
 CAN_we_need_ships: "We Need Ships"
 CAN_we_need_ships_desc: "Our enemies are all across the ocean. We cannot rely on the ageing British ships to hold us over - we need to support our fleet and improve it, and replace lost ships as they fall."

 CAN_expand_air_force: "Expand the Air Force"
 CAN_expand_air_force_desc: "The Royal Canadian Air force fought with distinction during the Great War, but has long since suffered from serious neglect. We can no longer afford to fall behind in this critical area of warfare, lest we cede control the sky to our foes, a terrifying prospect for sure."
 CAN_airspace_defense: "The Night Watchmen"
 CAN_airspace_defense_desc: "A proposal has been put forward by the NRC to construct a prototype radar warning system, code-name 'Night Watchmen'. In addition to its immediate strategic utility, this programme would provide enormous benefit to further research into RADAR technology and integration into air doctrine."
 CAN_imperial_air_training_plan: "Imperial Air Training Plan"
 CAN_imperial_air_training_plan_desc: "No matter how well designed, an aeroplane is ultimately only as good as its pilot. A large and dedicated training programme will help ensure we have a healthy supply, and its extension to other members of the Entente will allow us to pool knowledge and help our allies reach our level of greatness."
 CAN_royal_atlantic_aero_corp: "Establish the RAAC"
 CAN_royal_atlantic_aero_corp_desc: "Aviation industry leaders have put forward a proposal to form a new corporation to establish regular air links between Canada and the West Indies Federation. Such air links will not only bring the two countries closer together, but also spark aeronautics research and development."
 CAN_transcanada_airlines: "Trans Canada Airlines"
 CAN_transcanada_airlines_desc: "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."
 CAN_cfb_gander: "Expand RCAF Gander"
 CAN_cfb_gander_desc: "The air force base in Gander - an otherwise unremarkable port town in northern Labrador - is our key to controlling the skies over our Northeastern coast, as well as an excellent transitioning point for aircraft flying across the Atlantic. We will need to work hard to get it built up to where the airfield will be useful."
 CAN_cfb_north_bay: "Expand RCAF North Bay"
 CAN_cfb_north_bay_desc: "The North Bay air force base, not far to the north of both Toronto and Ottawa, is one of our most vital. In its range it covers over half of Canada's population and its most vital industrial centres. It is also the RCAF's most important training locale. We must ensure it is kept in top condition."
 CAN_fighter_programme: "Fighter Programme"

 CAN_jet_propulsion: "Jet Propulsion Initiative"
 CAN_jet_propulsion_desc: "Although an expensive and immature technology, turbojet aircraft could revolutionise aerial warfare. Let us found Turbo Research Inc. as a crown corporation to pursue this technology with all vigour. If our theorists are right, the speeds this aircraft could achieve would be beyond our comprehension."
 CAN_chalk_river_labs: "Chalk River Labs"
 CAN_chalk_river_labs_desc: "Atomic technology has enormous potential to transform industry and warfare. Establishing a laboratory to develop these technologies will help ensure we maintain a competitive edge in this field. We might even achieve breakthroughs in atomic energy generation, or as some scientists suggest, discover the basics of an atomic weapon."

 CAN_overhaul_navy: "Overhaul the Navy"
 CAN_overhaul_navy_desc: "The largest remnant of the Royal Navy sits in Halifax Harbour now, slowly ageing and still under the command of the British Admiralty-in-exile. It has remained separate from the Canadian chain of command, but this cannot continue. The Canadian and British navies need to act as one."
 CAN_state_of_british_fleet: "State of the British Fleet"
 CAN_state_of_british_fleet_desc: "If Canada is to defend itself, much less reclaim the Home Isles, it must first develop a first-rate navy. Fortunately, the legacy of the once-great Royal Navy provides a perfect foundation, and restarting from scratch allows us to get the most up-to-date navy possible."
 CAN_cfb_halifax: "Expand HMC Halifax"
 CAN_cfb_halifax_desc: "Halifax Harbour is one the best ports in the entire world, and it serves as our access point to the Atlantic and Europe. It has been stretched thin by needing to house the Royal Navy-in-exile for the last decade, and the time has come to expand it and prepare for even more ships to be serviced here."
 CAN_cfb_esquimalt: "Expand HMC Esquimalt"
 CAN_cfb_esquimalt_desc: "Our naval base on the far side of Vancouver Island gives us a gateway to the Pacific. We cannot become so entrenched in our belief that the only war that will ever come to Canada will be from the East. We must prepare to defend our western coast as well."
 CAN_deal_with_admiralty: "Deal with the Admiralty"
 CAN_deal_with_admiralty_desc: "The British Exile admirals have a great deal to teach the Canadian navy. We must take advantage of their presence, and try to heal the rivalry which has grown between the two services."
 CAN_davie_shipbuilding: "Davie Shipbuilding Deal"
 CAN_davie_shipbuilding_desc: "Canada's naval production capacity is barely adequate to maintain the former Royal Fleet, much less expand it back to its previous glory. A national programme of intensive shipyard expansion will be necessary to achieve naval supremacy once again and ensure our efforts do not go to waste."
 CAN_naval_bomber_programme: "Naval Bomber Programme"
 CAN_naval_bomber_programme_desc: "The FAA was founded soon after the Great War as the aviation arm of the Royal Navy, and its officers advocate for a new theory of naval warfare built around the aircraft carrier as the primary weapon of the fleet. Naval Bombers can threaten any fleet, and planes are starting to become a fearsome weapon of war."
 CAN_new_officers: "New Naval Officers"
 CAN_new_officers_desc: "While the officers of the British Royal Navy have much to teach us, they also have much to learn. Naval warfare is changing rapidly, and the time has come to update our methods and bring new blood into the admiralty."
 CAN_upgrade_fleet: "Upgrade the Fleet"
 CAN_upgrade_fleet_desc: "Building new ships will be a problem for Canada's small shipbuilding industry. Thus we must concentrate on upgrading those we have, researching new parts and guns and learning how to quickly fit them to the hulls."
 CAN_canadian_destroyers: "Canadian Small Ships"
 CAN_canadian_destroyers_desc: "Our fleet of destroyers and submarines is the backbone of the navy, and the most likely candidates to have replacements built here at home. We should maintain the top level of technology for them that we possibly can."
 CAN_canadian_cruisers: "Canadian Cruisers"
 CAN_canadian_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are the mid-level ships, and once the Royal Navy returns home they will be the largest ships we're likely to build and maintain."
 CAN_canadian_carriers: "Canadian Carriers"
 CAN_canadian_carriers_desc: "The aircraft carrier has proven itself the supreme weapon of the seas. It is critical that we maintain research and design efforts to maintain this supremacy, and consider massively expanding our fleet of carriers to ensure that our planes reach every corner of the world."
 CAN_canadian_battleships: "Canadian Battleships"
 CAN_canadian_battleships_desc: "We must make a concerted effort to stay on the forefront of battleship design. Our naval engineers have a few proposals that deserve exploration, and we should also consider implementing new modules to account for recent technological advances, like RADAR and radio stations, or heavy AA guns."
 CAN_focus_on_rcn: "Focus on the RCN"
 CAN_focus_on_rcn_desc: "Of the three divisions of our military, the navy is the one which requires our greatest attention. If we control the seas, then we control trade, and we can prevent invasions from being launched against our shores."

 CAN_address_army: "Address the Army"
 CAN_address_army_desc: "The current Canadian army is a strange mix of a national militia surrounding a core of exiled British professionals. With war looming on the horizon, it is time to reorganise the Canadian Army into a unified fighting force, taking inspiration from the legacy of the grand British Army and her achievements in the Great War."
 CAN_preparations_for_war: "Preparations for War"
 CAN_preparations_for_war_desc: "We have waited more than a decade for a second chance at taking on the syndicalist traitors. The time has come to seriously consider what we need to do, what we need to sacrifice, in order to achieve that goal."
 CAN_rally_exiles: "Rally the Exiles"
 CAN_rally_exiles_desc: "There are over half a million British Exiles currently living in Canada. We must rally them and get every able-bodied Brit into the army at once - it's their home we're fighting for, and if they want their children and grandchildren to grow up in the United Kingdom then they need to act now!"
 CAN_within_arms_reach: "Within Arm's Reach"
 CAN_within_arms_reach_desc: "Our biggest obstacle to retaking the Home Isles, aside from the opposition of the syndicalists themselves, is the vast distance across the Atlantic we need to cross. We either need to increase our reach or investigate places closer to Britain from which to stage our invasion."
 CAN_project_plough: "Project Plough"
 CAN_project_plough_desc: "If we are to perform an invasion, we need access not only to superior landing craft but also a division of Royal Marines who will be able to stand at the forefront of the assault."
 CAN_special_branch: "Establish the Special Branch"
 CAN_special_branch_desc: "There is another avenue of warfare outside of that on the battlefield: it's been proposed that we establish a Special Branch of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, aided by MI5 veterans living in Canada, and ensure that our counterintelligence efforts are second to none."
 CAN_contact_loyalists: "Contact the Loyalists"

With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. Canadians are growing weary of the British presence, and in 1931 the Conservative government fell to Mackenzie King's Liberals who, in a coalition with the Progressives and holding a slim majority combined, seek to assert greater Canadian sovereignty in the face of mounting pressure to prepare for the inevitable confrontation between the Entente and the Third Internationale."

### Intro Screen ###
 CAN_country_intro_header: "The Current Situation"
 CAN_country_intro_content: "The Great War ended in dismay for Canada, with French mutinies and collapse on the fronts leading to her defeat, despite the Canadian soldiers still standing strong. Even worse, Prime Minister §cRobert Lair Borden§! couldn't even secure a Canadian seat at the negotiating table and retired soon after the war in favour of his Minister of Finance, §cWilliam Thomas White§!. The last years of the §cConservative§! Government were dominated with the wartime labour unrest, which was met with violent force to put down strikes and riots, most famously the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. Naturally, the conservative Unionist Government lost reelection against new §mLiberal§! leader §mMackenzie King§!, who formed a de jure minority government, but had a de facto majority due to §lProgressive§! support. This election also saw a surprisingly strong turnout for the §SIndependent Labour Party§!, which gained 25 seats. While King focused on domestic issues and strengthened Canada's independence from Britain, most predominantly establishing a Canadian foreign office, the Conservatives sacked White and replaced him with the high Tory §gArthur Meighen§!. With an election in 1924 seemingly giving King a new mandate, things were slowly moving up for Canada..."

 CAN_country_intro_content_1: "In 1925 the unrest in Britain exploded into a §rsocialist revolution§!. However, the immediate hit to Canada was economic, as the Great Depression struck America and, by extension, Canada. A series of strikes broke out led by the §rOne Big Union§! and several §Rfar§!§o-left§! political figures. King's Government responded in force, cracking down on the strikers with impunity. At the same time, there were attempts from the Conservatives under Meighen to draw up a Canadian Expeditionary Force, or CEF, to aid the British National Government against the socialist revolutionaries. King's personal reluctancy and waffling led to his removal as leader, being replaced by §mWilliam Stevens Fielding§!. Prime Minister Fielding made the CEF an issue of confidence, which was lost in major part due to Liberal defections. In this circumstance, Governor-General Julian Byng called a General Election, and §gArthur Meighen's§! §cConservatives§! were swept into power."

 CAN_country_intro_content_2: "Meighen's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by attempts to prepare the country for war and crush left-wing dissidents. In doing so, however, he accidentially set the stage for a left wing rebound in the §SCo-Operative Common§!§Rwealth Federation§!, the §rWorkers' Unity League§! formed by the §rOne Big Union§!, and the exiled §oRevolutionary Labour Party§!. The Great Depression also saw the right-wing §nSocial Credit Party§! rise in Alberta, while Québec slowly became more and more unstable. Liberal leader §mErnest Lapointe§!, who had taken over from interim-leader Fielding, seemed unable to unseat Meighen with the support from the Exiles. Due to this, he sought out his friend, Mackenzie King, and organised King's return to politics as Liberal leader. After becoming leader, King used the fractured Parliament to force an election, which he won in triumph over Meighen, forming a coalition with the Progressive caucus and a Supply and Confidence agreement with the CCF. Meighen was finished as Conservative leader due to losing the election and his own seat. King appointed him Senator, despite their mutual hatred, and §cRobert Manion§! became the new leader of the Conservatives. Manion, a Red Tory with both Ontario and Québec ties, seeks to rehabilitate his party in Québec and represents a new §cmoderate course§! for the Conservatives."

 canada_events.4.t: "Death of King George V"
 canada_events.4.d: "In the last several months, King George has been plagued by illness and his health has been failing. This fact has been kept from the public, to keep up appearances while treatments were attempted, but it seems all was for naught. At 11.55 p.m. yesterday, the king died following a bout of severe fever. His eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Edward, has inherited the throne as Edward VIII and is expected to address the nation within the month. An official coronation will take place in several month's time, after an official mourning period for King George has been observed."
 canada_events.4.a: "The Empire enters a state of mourning..."

 canada_events.5.t: "The Coronation of King Edward"
 canada_events.5.d: "King Edward VIII is the first British monarch not to be coronated within the halls of Westminster Abbey. Instead, royal planners held an elaborate ceremony in Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa's largest Anglican church. There the Archbishop of Canterbury, himself a British exile, performed the rites as expected by tradition, with a throng of media paying close attention to every move. Rather than making his first public appearance afterwards on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, King Edward instead appeared on the balcony of Rideau Hall, the official royal residence, where he was greeted by a throng of enthusiastic Canadians."
 canada_events.5.a: "It's official!"

 canada_events.6.t: "The King's First Address"
 canada_events.6.d: "As King Edward prepares his first radio address to the Empire, he must consider what his message will be. The Parliament-in-Exile is, of course, urging him to promote the cause of retaking the Home Isles. Robert Manion, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition, suggests that he use his platform to endorse them for the upcoming election, saying that will serve the cause of war far better. Others, meanwhile, suggest that supporting the current Prime Minister and government will go a long way to mending fences and maintaining stability... though it could also be seen as a tacit endorsement of the Liberal Party's position."

From Vancouver to St. John's, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech denouncing syndicalism and the king's pledge to finish the war that his father began and finally reclaim Britain. His message was received as a tacit endorsement of the British Exiles in Canada, and a clear call to begin preparations for war... despite the current Liberal government's more tentative policy on the matter."

From Vancouver to St. John's, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech celebrating Canadian democracy. In it, King Edward specifically called out the long service of Robert Manion and the Conservative Party, and suggested Canadians - and indeed the entire Entente - would be well-served to have them leading the country into the next war. Manion, in turn, publicly thanked the king and called on all his fellow Canadians to look on this as the turning a new page and a chance to follow a young and vital king to victory at last."

 canada_events.8.t: "Status of the Parliament-in-Exile"
 canada_events.8.d: "The British Parliament-in-Exile has operated on emergency powers for the last ten years. Recently, however, there have been indications that Prime Minister Austen Chamberlain's time is up. Many Exiles see him as partly responsible for the loss of the Home Isles, and have been urging King Edward to replace him. We could push the king to appoint a more moderate candidate, however - someone more likely to work with the Canadian government. We could also urge the king to call for an election among the Exiles in Canada, though how much of a legal mandate that would give the new Prime Minister is questionable. Still, it's more democratic than an appointee."

 canada_events.9.d: "Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough has been the Governor-General of Canada since 1931, and is seeking to retire from the position this year. This means a new Governor-General must be appointed in his stead. While legally this the right of the British King and, by extension, the British Prime Minister, their tenuous situation caused by their Exile means we could easily push for a candidate that is more ubiquites to our interests. Specifically John Buchan, a moderate of the Exiles who is often seen as the most pro-Canadian Exile of considerable stature. If he were made Governor-General it would certainly be to our benefit... however the question is if we want to push the Exiles on this matter, or if we'd rather let this slide on by to pick other battles."

 canada_events.9.b: "Let’s not fight this battle, let the Exiles and King make their choice."

 canada_events.10.t: "John Buchan appointed Governor-General!"
 canada_events.10.d: "Due to our influence, the King and Exiles have appointed the 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, John Buchan, to be Governor-General of Canada. This is wonderful news for us as Buchan is not just a friend to Mackenzie King, but a patron of Canadian art. Unlike many Exiles he has spent his time in Canada encouraging the country to take the reigns of governance, of foreign policy, helping it develop it's newfound sense of nationalism is these trying times. With any luck the appointment of Buchan may mean a warmer relationship with the Government-in-Exile, which has been admittedly frosty in the preceding years."
 canada_events.10.a: "Give our congratulations to his Excellency."

 canada_events.11.t: "Ernest Makins appoined Governor-General."
 canada_events.11.d: "The Exiles and King have decided to appoint Ernest Makins, 1st Baron Sherfield, to be the new Governor-General. A hardliner even amongst the Exiles, and a former member of Henry Page Croft's \"National Party\", he fought with distinction in the British Civil War, and was given the peerage of Baron of Sherfield for his fighting in 1926. For us this is a concerning development, as a poltiical hardliner aligned with Croft he's more willing to personally intervene in Canadian affairs, and believes Canada should be focused on mobilising to destroy the London Regime."

 canada_events.23.d: "Just when we thought we were almost through the doldrums of the Great Depression, the German economic markets have experienced a massive crash which has come to be dubbed 'Black Monday'. While the Canadian economy isn't as tied to the German markets as some, the ripples have been felt throughout the world... particularly in the United States, a market we are particularly dependent upon. This setback is difficult to take, though Prime Minister King has assured the country, 'We will make it through this, just as we have the dark years prior! Now is the time for us to join together and work as we never have before!'"
 canada_events.23.a: "More troubles? Bah!"

 canada_events.24.t: "Writ of Election Issued"
 canada_events.24.d: "The House of Commons has issued the writ of election, calling for general elections to be held in October of this year. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have already begun campaigning, and, with the growing tensions between the great powers in the 1930s, the general sentiment is that this election will be an important one - does the country push hard towards a confrontation with the Union of Britain, or does it take a more cautious approach and focus on building up Canada's strength and that of the other Dominions? The Liberals favour the latter, while the Conservatives and the British Exiles heavily favour the former."
 canada_events.24.a: "May the best party win!"

 canada_events.25.t: "The Prime Minister and his Party"
 canada_events.25.d: "Leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister, Mackenzie King represents the mainstream strain of Canadian Liberalism. His internal faction refers to itself as the Laurier Liberals. Primarily made up of the French Canadian caucus, the Laurier Liberals gained their name by standing with Wilfrid Laurier, and against Liberal-Unionists, in the Great War. Fiercely anti-conscription, the most extreme of the Laurier Liberals question the need for the Homecoming as a whole, not interested in the \"Exiles war\". They also remain more moderate on the economy compared to their leftward allies, willing to play nice with businesses if it ensures economic growth, and sometimes hostile to Unions when they believe it necessary.\n\nOn the left of King is what’s informally known as the \"Regina Group\", named after those who backed Charles Avery Dunning as Liberal Leader in 1926. These Progressive (even made up of former Progressive Party members) Liberals, representing western Canada, seek for more economic intervention and a significant reduction in tariffs, while generally being less focused on the issues of conscription and the Homecoming.\n\nFinally on the party’s right is the Liberal-Unionists, led by James Ralston. These Liberals are the most pro-war, seeking to work with their Conservative counterparts in order to aid Britain and pursue the Homecoming to their greatest ability. Ralston and the Unionists find themselves at odds with King and the main parts of their party, primarily finding allies within the Conservative Party and being an internal thorn in the Prime Minister's side"
 canada_events.25.a: "A steady hand guiding a creaking ship."

 canada_events.26.t: "On the Official Opposition"
 canada_events.26.d: "Currently sitting across the bench, in the Official Opposition, is Robert Manion and the Conservative Party. Having been pushed out of Office in 1931, the Conservatives have been hopeful that this next election would give them a much needed boost and grant them a victory.\n\nTo that end, they had drafted their new leader, Robert Manion, a Red Tory who has a confusing combination of supporters, half being from Québec, owing to his French Canadian wife and Catholic faith, and half from Ontario, owing to his ties to members of the Orange Order. However despite those ties to those in the Orange Order, his election as leader represents the Conservative Party’s moderate wing, the Red Tories, taking the reins, forming a significant departure from the Unionist and High Tory style of Governance that has dominated the Party under both Robert Borden and Arthur Meighen.\n\nThe Red Tories believe in a more moderate Conservatism, supporting limited intervention in the economy, believing in the need to support farmers. Manion himself is uniquely against conscription, and wishes to improve their chances in Québec and rehabilitate the party in the Province.\n\nThe other end of the party couldn’t differ from them more, in many ways descending from Robert Borden’s wartime Government, the “Unionist Conservatives” centred around Hugh Guthrie, leader of the Opposition in the Senate Arthur Meighen, and Ontario Premier George Henry, support full conscription, war with the Union of Britain, and an \"Imperial War Policy\" echoing the parties policy in the Great War. To this end they’re willing to work with like-minded Liberals and to use more authoritarian methods to achieve their goals.\n\nThe Blue Tories, led by R.B. Bennett, represents the centre of the Party, focused on austerity and fiscal conservatism, they dislike the Red Tories economic policy, however they’re willing to compromise on Social issues and, importantly, are not as willing to entertain authoritarianism as the Unionists are."
 canada_events.26.a: "Manion stands upon a house of cards."

 canada_events.27.t: "The Spectre of Conscription"
 canada_events.27.d: "In an unplanned speech today, the High Tory, leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen spoke on the importance of Canada in restoring the United Kingdom, and the necessary sacrifices that will need to be made to do so. He further explained what he meant by stating that what Borden did in 1917 was only by necessity, and war with the London regime would necessitate conscription once more.\n\nBefore either party leader could respond to Meighen’s comments, Québec became ablaze with fury. The tenuous balance that had held and kept the Liberals in power in 1935 broke, with Henri Bourassa merging his Bloc National with the Conservative Party under Camillien Houde, they formed the \"Union Nationale\" and drafted Conservative Party member Maurice Duplessis as leader, forcing a snap election in Québec.\n\nKing, after seeing this, gave a speech in Montréal denouncing Meighen’s words, promising a Liberal Government would not enact Conscription under any circumstance. Robert Manion remained publicly silent, but had met with Meighen in private to reprimand him for speaking out of line, especially in the middle of an election."
 canada_events.27.a: "The High Tory sets the country ablaze from his Ivory Tower."

 canada_events.28.t: "Demonstration at King Speech"
 canada_events.28.d: "A campaign stop by Mackenzie King in Toronto was marred today when it was met by a large demonstration organised by the Blueshirts. Led by Adrien Arcand, who holds extreme, Integralist like view, and is infamous for his loyalty to the Crown, has been calling for greater action against the Union of Britain, and declared the Liberal 'no conscription' position as an outrage that threatens the very survival of the Empire. The raucous chanting and shouting prevented King from continuing the speech, and altercations between Liberal supporters and the Blueshirts almost ended up in a riot before the police were finally called in to intervene."
 canada_events.28.a: "They shouldn't have been there"
 canada_events.28.b: "They were unfairly provoked"

 canada_events.29.t: "Duplessis Wins Québec Election"
 canada_events.29.d: "Running a populist campaign painting the Liberals as unable to defend Québec from the spectre of conscription, Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale have won a majority government in the Québec provincial elections, usurping the Liberal encumbet Government. Duplessis has sworn to fight any plan to enact conscription, stating that he would use \"whatever means necessary\" in order to maintain Québec's autonomy and defend her people. This is horrible news for us, with one of our most industrious Provinces unwilling to work with us, a delecate hand will be needed to calm tensions in Québec."
 canada_events.29.a: "Damn Meighen for being so short sighted!"

 canada_events.30.t: "Manion Rejects Conscription?"
 canada_events.30.d: "At a campaign stop in Hamilton, Manion was aggressively questioned by a French-Canadian reporter over the Arthur Meighen's comments on conscription, asking why the Conservatives want to send another generation of French Canadians to die in the trenches. To the surprise of both the reporter and many others, Manion outright stated his opposition to conscription, and that while he believes in liberating Britian from the London regime, he has no desire to force Canadians, French or English, to die for that cause. While this response has certainly won him points in Québec, former Minister of Defence Hugh Guthrie, leader of the Opposition in the Senate Arthur Meighen, and Premier of Ontario George Henry have spoken out against Manion for being too soft, stating that conscription is necessary for a war to be won."
 canada_events.30.a: "It seems like Québec is happy with his response..."
 canada_events.30.b: "...the Unionists however, would like some words."

 canada_events.31.t: "Farmers and Labourers"
 canada_events.31.d: "On the left of the Liberal Party is the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, or CCF. When the Great Depression hit Canada in the wake of the British Revolution, the unemployed workers and farmer groups coalesced into the CCF in 1926, using the Regina Manifesto as the bedrock of the Party’s ideological beliefs.\n\nThe Party is split into two main factions, its more moderate wing representing farmers and Agrarian issues, generally in line with Social Democracy and trying to reform the Capitalist system, while caring greatly about the needs of the common farmer. This wing of the party is led by Party Leader J.S. Woodsworth and Secretary M.J. Coldwell.\n\nThe other wing of the party is led by Clarence Gillis, a former Union man and protegé of J.B. McLachlan, one of the leaders of the Canadian Labour revolt during the early 20s. The radical CCF members believe in the complete eradication of capitalism, however they are still democratic socialists who wish to combine socialist economics with liberal parliamentarianism, believing they can take the best of both systems.\n\nIn the CCF caucus is also the \"Newfoundland Party\" that formed in response to Canada’s annexation of the Dominion, left wing and separatist, it wishes to see Newfoundland under its own banner once more, separated from the Government in Ottawa.\n\nThe CCF’s entire caucus is notably anti-war, and has no interest in pursuing the Homecoming, which may make them difficult to negotiate with when it comes to retaking the Home Isles. Despite this, they’ve been willing to tacitly support Mackenzie King’s Government since his election in 1931, showing a pragmatism that other self-proclaimed socialists lacked. Currently the Party is campaigning hard, hopeful that this next election will see them gain more seats in Parliament"
 canada_events.31.a: "Let’s see if their hopes match reality."

 canada_events.32.t: "Social Credit in Canada"
 canada_events.32.d: "One of the more odd movements in Canada, the Social Credit Party got its start when it swept into power in Alberta in 1927. This came primarily from harnessing anti-establishment anti-exile sentiments in the wake of the Great Depression. Now the Party is seeking to increase its gains in this next election, and give more of a voice to those on the right dissatisfied with the Conservatives.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Party has two main factions, its moderate traditional conservative faction, which is primarily based on Alberta and is the larger of the two. And the more radical faction, based primarily from the Union des électeurs in Québec.\n\nThe moderate Albertan faction, under William Aberhart and Ernest Manning, broadly uses Social Credit, the monetary theories of Exile C. H. Douglas, as nothing more than a talking point. The more radical faction in Alberta has made alliances with the Social Credit League in the Exiles community, and Joseph Unwin, party whip of the Alberta branch, has formed the Greenshirts with Arthur Kitson, who both often work with the head of the Social Credit Board, Glenville Maclachlan. Despite this, the majority of the party tends to a more traditional social conservatism, while supporting more interventionist economics.\n\nThe Québec branch under Louis Even is far more radical, considering themselves to be the true believers of Social Credit. There is friction between them and the Alberta branch on the latter being seemingly unable and unwilling to implement Douglas theories, but they still remain united in opposition to the establishment and exiles.\n\nDespite those anti-exile opinions however, they do still support the Homecoming out of a sense of extreme anti-socialism, and will vote in favour of measures to eradicate it both domestically and abroad."
 canada_events.32.a: "A troublesome ally, but a potential one nonetheless."

 canada_events.33.t: "The Progressive Party"
 canada_events.33.d: "The smallest of Canada’s third parties, the Progressive Caucus is made up of two major groups, with two subfactions each that work together. The Progressive Party and United Farmer’s Parties can both trace their roots to the agrarian populist unrest that dominated western Canada in the postwar period. Although by 1936 their influence has diminished greatly.\n\nIn the Progressive Party itself, you have the Liberal-Progressives, led by their Federal Party Leader Thomas Crerar, and the Progressive Conservatives, led by Progressive Premier of Manitoba, John Bracken. While it would seem that Crerar holds more power as the leader of the Federal Party, the party is situated almost entirely within Manitoba, giving the Premier notable power over the Party. The Liberal-Progressives naturally align more with the Liberal Party, particularly the Regina Group, and are more willing to work with the CCF. While the Progressive Conservatives align more with Robert Manion’s Red Tories, and are less willing to work with the CCF.\n\nThe second group of the caucus are the United Farmer’s Parties, who enjoy considerable autonomy and are informally led by UFA member William Thomas Lucas. The United Farmers of Alberta aligning most with the Progressive Conservatives, meanwhile the United Farmers of Ontario align with the Liberal-Progressives. Generally speaking however, all of the caucus supports agrarian reform, free trade, and tends towards rural populism, with a tinge of anti establishmentism coursing through the Party, although that trend has diminished as time has gone on."
 canada_events.33.a: "Progressives or Populists?"

 canada_events.34.t: "Recommendations of the National Employment Commission"
 canada_events.34.d: "Arthur Purvis has come back with a comprehensive report on uemployment in the country, and has primarily organised his report into a registry of the unemployed and two major suggestions to solve the crisis at hand.\n\nThe first suggestion is establishing federal public works, hiring many of these unemployed labourers to aid in construction projects around the country. This is broadly supported by the different Parties, even the Conservative Unionists feel positively on it, beliving it will aid in building up and fighting the London Regime.\n\nHis second recommendation is far more controversial however, that of unemployment insurance. While heavily supported by the CCF and factions of the Liberal Party, even being considered for Liberal Party Platform in the 1931 election, it's heavily pushed against by the Unionist Conservatives and the Blue Tories, who decry it as socialistic policy that would only weaken the country. Despite these objections however, public opinion seems to be on Purvis side."
 canada_events.34.a: "Implement the public works..."
 canada_events.34.b: "...and start looking into unemployment insurance."

 canada_events.36.t: "Unemployment Insurance Amendment"
 canada_events.36.d: "With the suggestions of the National Employment Commission in mind, an amendment to the Constitution to allow the Federal government has been opposed, while passing the House Liberal and CCF support, it still has to be accepted by every province. So far all provinces have accepted the bill except for Alberta, who's Social Credit Government is stubbornly pushing against. Due to the public support of the amendment, the Albertan Government is feeling pressure to accept the amendment and give the Federal Government authority over this matter. If the pressure makes them give way the first unemployment insurance programme in Canada will be founded, if they continue to resist it will not."
 canada_events.36.a: "Through public pressure Alberta relents, the law passes."
 canada_events.36.b: "Alberta remains stubborn, unemployment insurance is killed in Edmonton."

 canada_events.37.t: "Anti-Syndicalism on the Imperial Broadcasting Service"
 canada_events.37.d: "The Imperial Broadcasting Service was founded by Sir John Reith in 1925 after the British Revolution when his previous broadcasting organisation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, was taken over by the syndicalists. The service proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire, and also as a tool to marginalise syndicalism within our borders. There have been calls to install Reith as the head of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in order to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists in the country. Others have suggested using Reith to employ propaganda with a more external focus, to prepare our people for the coming fight against syndicalism."
 canada_events.37.a: "The CBC is fine as it is"
 canada_events.37.b: "Put Reith in charge of the CBC"
 canada_events.37.c: "Put Reith in charge, so long as he focuses attention on our foes abroad"

 canada_events.38.t: "Billy Bishop Criticises Priorities"
 canada_events.38.d: "Billy Bishop, our Air Marshal and a long-standing air force hero, has criticised the government's military spending priorities. The coming war, he says, will be decided in the air... and if [Root.GetNameDef] is to be ready for it, that will mean more money and manpower be spent on modernising the air force. He has a detailed plan, and it seems like it could work, but this will take resources from other projects."
 canada_events.38.a: "Bishop is a good man and I trust his methods"
 canada_events.38.b: "The air force will get no more of a priority"

 canada_events.39.t: "Naval Exercises in the Atlantic"
 canada_events.39.d: "With the international situation deteriorating, it is imperative we demonstrate our strength and exercise our right to free passage in the Atlantic. To this end, the Admiralty have scheduled an extensive array of fleet manoeuvres and war-games in the North Atlantic. We can play it safe, but the Admiralty seems to believe we could also challenge a navy of roughly equal measure to a bit of a game... if they're up for the challenge. Doing so would be risky, but the experience for our navy would be much greater."
 canada_events.39.a: "Conduct a large exercise off the coast of Britain and Ireland"
 canada_events.39.b: "Conduct a large exercise in the North Sea"
 canada_events.39.c: "Conduct a large exercise off the American Coast"
 canada_events.39.e: "Conduct normal exercises in Canadian territorial waters"

 canada_events.40.t: "A Challenge from the Canadian Navy?"
 canada_events.40.d: "A large flotilla of ships ranging dangerously close to our territorial waters has been identified as Canadian. We can't be certain, but they appear to be testing our responses... challenging us, in other words. We could send out our fleet to rattle our sabres in a game of manoeuvres, but we are taken a bit by surprise. If we lose, it will be embarrassing for us, though perhaps not as much if we don't act at all."
 canada_events.40.a: "They want to play? We'll play!"
 canada_events.40.b: "Ignore them - they're just Canadians"

 canada_events.42.b: "What, not even an 'I'm sorry'?"

 canada_events.43.t: "Coalition negotiations"
 canada_events.43.d: "Well our victory in the election seems to have granted us a mandate, Parliament is fractured to a considerable degree. Because of this, it may be worthwhile to reach out to some of the third parties in Parliament and find allies sooner rather than latter. A few suggestions have already come up for potential allies, and we will begin negotiations with each soon."
 canada_events.43.a: "Let's begin looking for allies."

 canada_events.44.t: "Alliance with the Progressive Party?"
 canada_events.44.d.lib: "The Progressive Party have been natural allies of the Liberal Party, and Mackenzie King, since the early 20s. Even though the Progressives have shrunk in size dramatically, they still hold a solid foundation in the Province of Manitoba. King met personally with Crerar to discuss bringing the latter's party back into Government with the Liberals, and Crerar seemed happy to accept their previous arrangement continuing. Ensuring farmers are protected, an agricultural considerate development scheme, and Crerar himself getting the Ministry of the Interior."
 canada_events.44.d.con: "Despite past opposition to the Conservative Party, the Progressive Party has been hopeful that this invite to talk represents a new leaf for their relationship in Parliament. [GetSecondInCommand] met with Federal Leader Thomas Crerar, with Progressive Premier of Manitoba John Bracken serving as mediator, owing to the Premier's more Conservative views within the Progressive movement. The three men quickly sat down to negotiations, where Crerar made it clear he would only accept a deal that's at least as good as King had given him previously. That being that the Government ensured farmers are protected, adopted an agricultural considerate development scheme, and that Crerar himself would get the Ministry of the Interior."
 canada_events.44.a: "We can agree to their terms."
 canada_events.44.b: "They're being unreasonable, reject their terms."

 canada_events.45.t: "Alliance with the Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation?"
 canada_events.45.d: "Our second choice for cooperation, the CCF is a fellow left-of-centre party. While their economic views may be considerably more radical than ours, they feel similarly on the influence of the Exiles on the Monarchy and desire a more peaceful solution to our foreign policy concerns. As odd as it would be for the flag-bearer's of Canadian Liberalism to join forces with the Democratic Socialists of the CCF, they do hold a considerable amount of sway in the west and in Newfoundland.\n\nHowever an alliance with them would be precepitated on both taking the Ministry of Labour, and our Government pursuing the rights of trade unions, looking at the United States Wagner Act as a clear example.\n\nUltimately the question for us is... are these demands acceptable to secure the CCF's support?"
 canada_events.45.a: "We can agree to their terms."
 canada_events.45.b: "They're being unreasonable, reject their terms."

 canada_events.46.t: "Alliance with the Social Credit Party?"
 canada_events.46.d: "Our second choice for cooperation, the Social Credit Party is an odd option, but not an impossible one. While the party doesn't care much for the Exiles and takes pride in its antiestabilshmentarianism, it is a fellow right-of-centre party that is virulently anti-socialist. It's primarily on these grounds that we can find cooperation.\n\nHowever their support won't come cheap, they've immediately demanded we offer them the Agricultural Ministry, focus on improvements in Alberta, and turn a blind eye to their Provincial Branches actions in said Province. These are high demands for Social Credit's political clout, but are we willing to grant them in order to obtain their support?"
 canada_events.46.a: "We can agree to their terms."
 canada_events.46.b: "They're being unreasonable, reject their terms."

 canada_events.47.t: "End of Negotiations"
 canada_events.47.d: "We've negotiated with every party willing to hear us out and work with us, we've made what alliances we possibly could. With that in mind we now should look towards pursuing our mandate, and making sure any potential coalition partners remain happy with us."

 canada_events.50.d: "The moment has come, with the country heading to the polls to decide between the Liberals under William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Conservatives under Robert Manion.

 canada_events.52.t: "Bill 7 Debate Begins"
 canada_events.52.d: "The first major issue for our new Government to take on is that of Bill 7. As it is officially a budget bill, it has been introduced in the House of Commons by [CAN_minister_of_finance], the Minister of Finance.\n\nWhile most of the Bill is non-controversial to the House, there are a few provisions within the Bill that have split the Houses opinions, primarily centred around the questions of economic recovery and the status of Canada’s industry. While we could always rely on our majority, it may be worthwile to consider what other voices in the House have to say and to compromise with them."
 canada_events.52.a: "We will do what we need to make this pass."

 canada_events.53.t: "Bill 7: Economic Recovery"
 canada_events.53.d: "As Bill 7 primarily deals with issues around the budget, the questions of economic spending and recovery naturally make up the most important sections of the Bill. It also, naturally, makes it the most contentious part of the Bill, with the House opinions being split into three major camps.\n\nThe first camp is the interventionists. Tacitly supported by Mackenzie King, and made up of the CCF, the Progressive Party, and the left wing of the Liberal Party, the interventionists believe in large-scale Government intervention to solve the economic crisis and recover from the ripple effects of the Great Depression and Black Monday, including investment in infrastructure, and major support for the Western Farmers. This plan is also tolerable to the Social Credit Party, due to the inclusion of farm subsidies.\n\nThe second camp is those who support austerity. Broadly led by R.B. Benentt and made up of the Unionists and the Blue Tories, their main argument is that Black Monday’s effects are limited, that the economy will be able to recover on its own, and that Canada needs to focus on building up a war chest, owing to both the unrest to our south, and the growing boldness of the London Regime. This austerity would, however, involve major cuts to farm subsidies and leave the west out to dry, making it intolerable to the CCF, Social Credit, the Progressives, and even left Liberals.\n\nThe third camp finds itself squeezed between the other two. Supporting a limited interventionism that still maintains a positive budget. The plan, primarily supported by Robert Manion, the Red Tories, right-wing Liberals, and the Social Credit Party. It calls for similar investments in infrastructure and the farming sectors, however to a far lesser extent than King’s plan, making it agreeable to most factions in Parliament."
 canada_events.53.a: "We need to recover quickly, interventionism is the way forward."
 canada_events.53.b: "We need to save our resources, it’s time for austerity measures."
 canada_events.53.c: "Now is the time for compromise, a limited intervention is best."

 canada_events.56.t: "Bill 7: The Future of Canada's Industry"
 canada_events.56.d: "With matters of economic recovery settled, the second issue of Bill 7 is that of the direction Canada’s Industrial development should take. Both major parties believe strongly in the need to develop Canadian industry, however they disagree on the focus of that development.\n\nThe Liberals support the plan put in by C.D. Howe, dubbed the “Minister of Everything” for his wide portfolio under Mackenzie King. He supports the development of the civilian sectors of our industry, and believes that through the support of the civilian sector, military arms will come to follow.\n\nThe Unionists, especially former Minister of Defence Hugh Guthrie, disagree with Howe, claiming he’s selling our soldiers equipment for temporary gains. Guthrie has presented a counter proposal that would focus on investment in Canada’s military industry, preparing for the conflicts that seem inevitable by this point.\n\nRobert Manion, once again, finds himself between two worlds. While he recognises Guthrie's concerns, he believes that economic development needs to be balanced between the Civilian and the Military sectors, and has presented a compromise he hopes will make both sides happy."
 canada_events.56.a: "C.D. Howe has shown his talent before, we should trust him."
 canada_events.56.b: "Guthrie is right, we need armaments now, not later."
 canada_events.56.c: "Both have their points, Manion’s compromise is best for Canada."

 canada_events.57.t: "Bill 7: Domestic Security"
 canada_events.57.d: "Finally, one last issue has come up in relation to Bill 7. It’s no secret that Canada’s Labour movement has moved in a more radical direction, while Tom Moore’s Trades and Labour Congress seems happy to decry revolutionaries and violence, the Canadian Congress of Labour is in a bitter power struggle between it’s moderate President, Aaron Mosher, and it’s radical Secretary-Treasurer, Harold Pritchett.\n\nOwing to this increased radicalism in our labour movement, the Unionist Conservatives have pushed forth a proposed addendum to the Bill, suggesting the RCMP be empowered to crack down on dissidents and Socialists. They have also forwarded their own George Stanley White to lead this empowered RCMP. A committed anti-socialist and former Solicitor-General, he would make for a natural choice.\n\nHowever, even before the Liberals could suggest their own man, both Charles Avery Dunning and James Garfield Gardiner threatened to raise hell if they were to be forced to vote in favour of a bill containing this. Both remembering the violence from the RCMP that befell their home Province in Saskatchewan under Meighen, and not wishing to see a repeat of those times. The CCF, supported by both the TLC and CCL, echoed these sentiments strongly.\n\nRobert Manion has suggested a compromise, the empowerment of the RCMP as designed by the Unionists, but letting Liberal Lucien Cannon, a French MP and former Solicitor-General, take charge of it. While this appeases the Conservatives and the right Liberals, the CCF and left Liberals still have held firm against any sort of empowered RCMP."
 canada_events.57.a: "We need to hold firm against Socialism, appoint White to the position"
 canada_events.57.b: "Cannon should be tolerable to the Liberals, whilst also appeasing the Unionists."

 canada_events.61.t: "Bill 7 Killed in the Senate"
 canada_events.61.d: "After several readings and amendments, the bill narrowly passed a vote in the House of Commons... though not without considerable grumbling from both sides.

As promised, it contains no provisions for conscription or a secret police, and adheres closely to C.D. Howe's original plan for economic subsidisation. Despite his personal destain for Mackenzie King and the Liberal plan, leader of the Opposition in the Senate Arthur Meighen swallowed his pride and spoke on the importance of \"National Unity\" at this time, voting in favour of the Bill, and allowing it to pass through the Senate."

His Minister of Finance, Nelson Edgar Rhodes, becoming Acting Prime Minister as the Unionist caucus debated on who to make the new Prime Minister.\n\nAfter a surprisingly brief debate, the caucus came to the decision to make George Stewart Henry, current Premier of Ontario, the leader of their group and Prime Minister of Canada. Resigning from his seat in the Ontario Legislature and running for Guthrie’s old seat in Wellington South. In Ontario the Liberal-Unionist Mitchell Hepburn, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, has controversially been made the new Premier in Ontario’s own Unionist Government between the two major parties, betraying Hepburn’s alliance with the CCF and UFO to topple the Conservative Government.\n\nDespite this slight controversy, Prime Minister Henry has been sworn in to applause from the entire Unionist caucus, and should be a stable hand for the upcoming struggles that we still face."
 canada_events.73.notunionist: "Leader of the unofficial “Unionist” group in Parliament, Hugh Guthrie, has died today. A former Liberal who joined the WW1 Unionist Government due to his support of British Imperialism, Guthrie continued with the Conservative Party in the post war. Most famous for his reforms to manage the twin armed forces after the British Revolution, Guthrie quickly became the most high profile Unionist in Parliament. At different times being Minister of Justice, Attorney-General, Solicitor-General, and Minister of National Defence.\n\nHis death marks a notable weakening of the Unionists caucus, lacking a Parliamentary leader means the group has become more disorganised, granting us breathing room on our right flank. Despite his opposition to our leadership however, it’s not good of us to speak ill of the dead, and we should show kindness in this moment."

The king thanked him for his service to the British cause, and then appointed Robert Vansittart to the post. The replacement comes at the largest shake-up in the British Exile power structure since their arrival into Canada in 1925, and as Vasittart begins to make changes to the cabinet-in-exile the ripples are sure to be felt throughout the government."

Like Britain and France before it, a Socialist Revolution has come for America, beginning in the “Steel Belt” states right around the Great Lakes. This comes as drastic news for us, as those states surround the Ontario Peninsula, granting this uprising a near perfect strike against our largest population and industrial sectors.\n\nThis has set our Parliament into a frenzy, with debates immediately raging in the halls of governance about how to respond. The Prime Minister has entered talks with the armed forces about readying the Army in case the revolution in the south decides to march north against us.\n\nNotably however, the Unionist leaders, Hugh Guthrie and James Ralston, seem to be eerily silent. Given the severity of what is happening in the south and the importance of both men in their parties, it’s a cause for concern at the least. This is only exacerbated by reports of the two men seemingly drafting some sort of Bill together, what it is however is unknown."

 canada_events.98.d: "The silence of the Unionists ends today. At the start of today’s Parliament Unionist Conservative Hugh Guthrie and Liberal-Unionist James Ralston have co-sponsored a bill to enact a peacetime draft in order to “protect the Dominion from her revolutionary enemies”, clearly referring to the Government down south\n\nWhile conscription would be of considerable help in case war with the south broke out, enacting a peacetime draft would be unheard of and would certainly lead to a repeat of 1917. With neither major party leader wanting to see a repeat of the 1917 Conscription Crisis, both have distanced themselves from the bill, refusing to put the full weight of their party behind it. Mackenzie King in particular has derided the Bill as trying to push an agenda of a few while ignoring the opinions of the average voter.\n\nQuébec, the hotbed of anti-conscription sentiment, and Premier Duplessis, have been questionably silent on the Bill, seemingly biding the time to strike. Prime Minister [GetSecondInCommand] is on a knife’s edge between upsetting the Unionists in his Party or letting Québec explode in anger once more. At this moment a balance has been struck, but even a small push could cause this house of cards to collapse entirely."

 canada_events.99.d: "British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] gave a speech in Ottawa today in an attempt to drum up support for Guthrie and Ralston's bill. First he praised Guthrie and Ralston for looking beyond partisan lines, and instead focusing on the good of both the Dominion and the Empire at large.\n\nWhile this speech was generally received well in the Tory stronghold of Ontario, it gave Duplessis and Québec the ammunition they needed to strike. The situation in Québec is tense, there’s gasoline all over the floor, and [GetBritishExilePM] has just struck a match..."

With protests in Québec already mounting, decrying both Prime Ministers. Duplessis has fanned the flames of popular anger by tying the Bill to both the Conservative and Liberal Parties, despite protests of the Laurier Liberals and Red Tories against it.\n\nHis incendiary speech in Québec City has done significant damage to us and our standing in Québec.

Conscription was the primary concern of the meeting. Initially making maximalist demands for no form of Conscription to be enacted in any capacity, the Prime Minister and other Federal Government members managed to, after fierce and lengthy negotiations they managed to agree on an extremely limited form of Conscription, where Conscripted men would work in factories and home defence, and most importantly they would not be sent to fight overseas.\n\nAlongside these official agreements, there has been an under the table and official agreement that the Federal Government would be willing to help fund certain projects in Québec in order to help quell the unrest in the region. With this, and promises to reduce any form of potential conscription, in mind we can start to mend the relations with the Province of Québec."

Provincial conservative aligned agitators already began rousing up their voting base to what they call a 'blatant violation of provincial rights'.

After a series of fierce debates, insults, and anger from Red Tories and Unionists alike, Robert Manion, the Red Tories, and the Québec caucus stormed out of the meeting. At the same time the Unionists pushed forth their plan of a Unionist Government, [CAN_unionist_leader] as their choice to lead this Government. Seeing the writing on the wall, Bennett resigned as leader in favour of the Unionists.\n\nAs [CAN_unionist_leader] was sworn in as Prime Minister, the rioting in Québec grew even worse. Manion’s prediction had come to pass, he and his faction of the Party resigned from their posts and formed a new “independent Conservative” caucus. Their Ministry positions were quickly replaced by the Liberal-Unionists under James Ralston, forming a second Unionist Party and Government under [CAN_unionist_leader], ready and willing to do what’s necessary to restore order."

The self proclaimed \"Independent Liberals\" under Mackenzie King, and the splinter faction of \"Independent Conservatives\" under H. H. Stevens.\n\nHowever with the slow political consolidation the Party and Government has been undertaking, the independents have quietly been leaving their respective leaders and rejoining our Party. This has most clearly been shown with men like Robert Manion, who initially walked out of the Party when Guthrie was appointed, but has since returned to the Unionist fold.\n\nOn the Liberals side, the Party is a ghost of its former self, while Mackenzie King still commands the Québec caucus, rank and file Liberals see the writing on the wall and have folded under James Ralston’s Liberal-Unionist faction.\n\nAlthough Stevens and King themselves have been unwilling to join our Unionist Party, a rational Government of the Establishment has cemented itself in the face of domestic crisis and foreign uncertainty. With this calm and rational Governance we can serve both King and Country, and ensure Britain is liberated from the crimson red regime that has befallen London."

Utilising obscure legal mechanisms, it is indeed 'lawful' for the still functioning British Parliament to assume legislative responsibilities for the Dominions and after a marathon session, it had decided by majority vote to effectively relieve its Canadian counterpart of governing responsibility and legislate for Canada directly. Nevertheless, the need to maintain some legitimacy has necessitated the continued survival of the Canadian Parliament - for now anyway - and continued collaboration with the Unionists.

 canada_events.158.t: "Ulster Says No!"
 canada_events.158.d: "After months of mounting unrest following the collapse of Irish democracy, the loyalists of Northern Ireland have finally reached their breaking point and have risen in violent revolt against Dublin's tyranny. While many would of course like to immediately send troops to Belfast to aid the Crown's loyal subjects in their cause, it is feared that any direct involvement may be seen as a provocation by both the Germans and the regime in London.\n\nThis does not mean however that the government cannot seek to aid their revolt in less official ways, and preparations are already being made to facilitate arms shipments and advisors to swing the tide in our favour."
 canada_events.158.a: "We cannot abandon Ulster for a second time, we must act!"

 canada_events.159.t: "The Emerald Isle turns Red"
 canada_events.159.d: "While relations between Ireland and the British Crown have certainly not been the smoothest for the past few decades, to put it lightly, the harrowing news that has been received over the past week from Dublin has been met with sympathetic sorrow. In the wake of chaos breaking out in Ulster, and a German backed military coup, the socialist scions of [ENG.GetLeader] and their ilk have seized power in Ireland as part of a revolution of their own.\n\nAlthough many may resign themselves to despair, the brave loyalists of Northern Ireland have vowed to not take this laying down and have already opened contact with Canadian intelligence services to help coordinate resistance to socialist rule. It seems that ultimately their plan will be to launch an uprising, ironically similarly mirroring the Easter Rising they so detest, and seek logistical and materiel support for such an endeavour.\n\nWhilst such a plan may grant the foothold needed to secure the Home Islands once more, not everyone is on board with sending equipment to loosely organised militias, instead of in the hands of proper Canadian soldiers, and a choice must be made as to if it is worth the potential cost."
 canada_events.159.a: "The loyalists will have our full support!"
 canada_events.159.a.tt: "§YWhen we are at war with the Third Internationale, Northern Ireland will rise up against [IRE.GetNameDef] after we make contact.§!"
 canada_events.159.b: "They will unfortunately have to handle this themselves."

 canada_events.170.t: "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 canada_events.170.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with an interesting offer: seeing as we are in dire straits, economically, they are willing to assist our recovery with a large aid package. In return, we would join the Entente and enjoy their protection... and provide them with a means to launch an invasion of [ENG.GetNameDef]. While this solves several of our issues, it also means involving ourselves in a war we have no real stake in."
 canada_events.170.a: "We can't turn this down"
 canada_events.170.b: "We regretfully must refuse"

 canada_events.171.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 canada_events.171.d: "While the [From.GetAdjective] government is reluctant to get involved in a war, they are in desperate enough straits to agree to our proposal."
 canada_events.171.a: "Excellent"

 canada_events.172.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 canada_events.172.d: "While the [From.GetAdjective] government admits they are in desperate straits, they claim they are well on their way to recovery and have no desire to come between us and [ENG.GetNameDef]. They have expressed thanks for our offer, but have regretfully declined it."
 canada_events.172.a: "Unfortunate"

 canada_events.173.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Funds for the Resistance"
 canada_events.173.d: "Quietly, through indirect channels, [From.GetNameDef] has funnelled equipment and funds for the resistance movement against the syndicalists."
 canada_events.173.a: "Much appreciated!"

 canada_events.174.t: "Government Urged to Attack"
 canada_events.174.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] has been active over the last several weeks, loudly and publicly demanding to know why an attack on [ENG.GetNameDef] hadn't already begun. 'We are ready,' he proclaimed. 'What's more, the syndicalists become more prepared every moment longer we wait, so we shall never be more ready than we are right now. Come what may, the attack must begin!' A large number of Canadians agree with him, it appears, as newspapers across the country have splashed 'Begin the Attack!' across their front pages for days, now."
 canada_events.174.a: "Perhaps he's right..."
 canada_events.174.b: "We will attack when we're ready, no sooner"

 canada_events.175.t: "Rise of the British Loyalists"
 canada_events.175.d.scotland: "Our attempts to contact the Loyalists remaining in [ENG.GetNameDef] have been successful. As we thought, they've been collecting numbers and equipment since the fall of the Empire... and while they haven't the strength to take on the syndicalists by themselves, they're more than ready to rise up now that we have our foothold in [invasion_state.GetName]. They have gathered in the hills of northern Scotland, and are prepared to attack at our command."
 canada_events.175.d.england: "Our attempts to contact the Loyalists remaining in [ENG.GetNameDef] have been successful. As we thought, they've been collecting numbers and equipment since the fall of the Empire... and while they haven't the strength to take on the syndicalists by themselves, they're more than ready to rise up now that we have our foothold in [invasion_state.GetName].

 canada_events.175.a: "Bravo, gents!"

 canada_events.176.t: "Rise of the British Loyalists"
 canada_events.176.d: "With [CAN.GetNameDef] having taken a foothold in [invasion_state.GetName], the monarchists - who we always knew have been present among us, but have had a pernicious time driving out into the open - have shown themselves and risen up. Their appearance has sent shock waves throughout Britain, though ministers have assured the government the matter should be stabilised within months. With any luck, this is our opportunity to wipe out the Canadians and the loyalists both."
 canada_events.176.a: "An inconvenience, nothing more"

 canada_events.177.t: "Rise of the Northern Irish Loyalists"
 canada_events.177.d: "Confirmation has been received that the weapon shipment sent to Northern Ireland has now arrived in Belfast, and has already been distributed amongst the Ulster Volunteers who are prepared to execute their plans at any moment's notice.\n\nAll that is left now is for them to receive the final signal from Ottawa and their uprising against socialist tyranny shall begin."
 canada_events.177.a: "For King and Country, Gentlemen!"

 canada_events.178.t: "Rise of the Northern Loyalists"
 canada_events.178.d: "In an almost unsurprising turn of events, the loyalists of Ulster have turned once again to the British Crown, and with their help have managed to seize control of much of Northern Ireland in a coordinated strike against Irish rule. As part of a takeover ironically reminiscent of the Easter Rising, the UVF have seized buildings across the six counties, most notably at Belfast City Hall where, in imitation of the Ulster Covenant of 1912, they have signed a document proclaiming independence from Dublin with Entente support and vowing to rise up to defend the \"loyal people of Ulster\" against \"syndicalist and Papist tyranny\".\n\nNorthern Catholics in many areas, despite their own conservatism, have resisted the separatists who wish for their subjugation, with the Irish Citizen Army waging a guerrilla war of their own in defence of their besieged communities and even Catholic supporters of the National Guard have putting aside their misgiving to participate in resistance against the UVF, though internal clashes with the ICA have not been infrequent.\n\nThis uprising has thrown the government into a frenzy as the potential of an Entente landing to reinforce their reactionary loyalist allies and acquire a base next to Great Britain has become a grave security threat both nationally and to the Internationale as a whole. The Cathaoirleach has responded with a speech announcing a state of war against the UVF and that, while acknowledging Protestants as fellow workers duped by the bourgeois into turning against their brothers, the forces of imperialism would be routed."
 canada_events.178.a: "We'll put them down, just as before!"

 canada_events.200.t: "The Situation in America"
 canada_events.200.d: "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States, particularly with the rise of the Socialist Party of America. A syndicalist-aligned nation on our southern border would be unthinkable. The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
 canada_events.200.a: "Unbelievable!"

 canada_events.201.t: "The Prospect of Intervention"
 canada_events.201.d: "Parliament has begun a tense debate over whether the Canadian government should recognise one of the warring factions in the south the 'real' America. It's a tricky situation, as doing so will anger the other factions and potentially leave us with a hostile victor in the south... but even worse is the prospect of the so-called [WCA.GetNameDef] winning the day. We cannot be expected to fight wars elsewhere with a syndicalist government sitting directly to the south, can we? For now, support merely means directing the Entente to send volunteers and equipment, but - if we pick a side - some suggest our getting drawn into the conflict will become inevitable."
 canada_events.201.a: "We should not get involved"
 canada_events.201.b: "The Federal government is, of course, the only legitimate one"
 canada_events.201.c: "We recognise [ACC.GetNameDef] as the true America"
 canada_events.201.e: "We support Huey Long and [APG.GetNameDef]"
 canada_events.201.f: "We support New England's government"

 canada_events.202.t: "Refugees Flood into [refugee_state.GetName]"
 canada_events.202.d: "With the situation in America worsening, it's no surprise that [Root.GetNameDef] has become the top destination for those fleeing the violence. Many of the immigrants are legal, but an increasingly large number are not. Already there are several refugee camps in [refugee_state.GetName], many of them coming from [flee_from_state.GetName], and their numbers are putting a strain on our supplies. Observers comment that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better."
 canada_events.202.a: "American refugees? The irony..."

 canada_events.203.t: "[refugee_state.GetName] Refugee Situation Worsens"
 canada_events.203.d: "While officials in [refugee_state.GetName] have already been struggling to contain the numbers of American refugees crossing the border, recently the situation has grown even worse. A new flood of refugees, most coming from [flee_from_state.GetName], has already arrived and put an increasing strain on the province's infrastructure."
 canada_events.203.a: "Let's hope this ends soon"

 canada_events.204.t: "The Refugee Crisis"
 canada_events.204.d: "The number of illegal refugees crossing the border from America has become a national crisis, impacting [Root.GetNameDef]'s stability and supply capabilities, not to mention the amount of soldiers required to keep the peace. If the current rate of arrivals continues, things are sure to get worse. Parliament is arguing that the government should figure out what to do -- and quickly."
 canada_events.204.a: "What a mess"

 canada_events.205.t: "The Refugee Crisis Deepens"
 canada_events.205.d: "Having not heeded earlier warnings, the crisis caused by the mass arrival of American refugees fleeing the civil war in the south has become worse. Violence in and around the camps along the border has increased, and their reputation is such that many refugees are now attempting to enter the country illegally - where they are sure to face exploitation by the unscrupulous."
 canada_events.205.a: "Something must be done"

 canada_events.206.t: "Trade with America"
 canada_events.206.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] relies a great deal on its trade routes that go to the United States. While the civil war has benefited us in some ways, namely that orders for Canadian goods from abroad have increased as American sources become unreliable, the fact is that many of our exports have always gone to America itself... with our biggest customer now an unreliable destination, our economy is left reeling and attempting to figure out what to do until the civil war is ended."
 canada_events.206.a: "As if we needed more problems"

 canada_events.207.t: "Clashes in Windsor"
 canada_events.207.d: "The city of Windsor lies directly across from Detroit, a stronghold of the syndicalist [WCA.GetName]. We've suspected for a while, now, that syndicalist agents have crossed the border secretly, some with the refugees, and now it seems that belief has been vindicated with the city being engulfed in clashes between industrial workers and the police. The police say these 'sympathisers' are being spurred on by syndicalist agents. Whether this is true or not, the violence has continued for several days and only just now been contained."
 canada_events.207.a: "At least the violence was contained, we cannot let the Revolution come North."

 canada_events.208.t: "Militias Cross into [473.GetName]"
 canada_events.208.d: "A syndicalist uprising in the state of Washington has spilled across the border as the militia units use it to evade and get around their opponents. This has caused considerable consternation in the region, as Canadian forces have needed to move in and tighten security, with several clashes having already occurred along southern highways. Several incidents of attacks and looting on civilian townships have led to British Columbia being gripped with fear, thinking that - at any moment - syndicalist militias could arrive out of nowhere."
 canada_events.208.a: "Not good"

 canada_events.209.t: "Riot at St. Catharines Camp"
 canada_events.209.d: "Violence has been a common problem at refugee camps, due mainly to conflicts between the refugees themselves as well as with the guards, but also due to the poor conditions. The St. Catharines Camp is one of the most densely-populated in the province, and conditions there have apparently gotten so bad that a full-scale riot by the refugees broke out. They overwhelmed the guards, spilling out of the camp and heading into the outer Toronto area where they were eventually stopped by Ontario provincial police. It is feared this is only the first incident on this scale we're likely to see."
 canada_events.209.a: "This needs to stop"

 canada_events.210.t: "Sympathy Strikes Across Canada"
 canada_events.210.d.wca: "Across the nation, numerous labour unions have risen up in sympathy strikes for [WCA.GetNameDef]. The SPA, they say, has been unfairly characterised as tyrannical, when it is merely combating the larger tyranny of capitalism run rampant. They want the Canadian government to stop 'fear-mongering' against the syndicalists. The strikes have been unruly and disruptive, and in several cases have resulted in violent clashes with the RCMP. Several arrests have been made, and the RCMP is keeping a close eye on strike organisers."
 canada_events.210.d.aus: "Across the nation, numerous groups have risen up in 'sympathy strikes' for [APG.GetNameDef]. They are creating blockades and enforcing work-stoppages in several cities, claiming they are doing so in support of Huey Long. 'His fight for the average American is the same fight faced by average people everywhere,' said one organiser. The strikes have been unruly and disruptive, and in several cases have resulted in violent clashes with the RCMP. Several arrests have been made, and the RCMP is keeping a close eye on strike organisers."
 canada_events.210.a: "Interesting"

 canada_events.211.t: "The New Home of the Free"
 canada_events.211.d.nee: "Parliament has been engulfed by argument over what to do regarding the American refugees. Doing nothing is not an option, but many MP's are saying that a massive relief effort is needed to improve conditions in the camps. The expense, they say, is justified because 'Americans are our brothers and sisters, and we must care for them in their hour of need'. In a similar vein, Progressive Party leader Thomas Crerar has proposed what he calls Project Samaritan - an even broader relief effort, spreading out the camps and housing refugees with average Canadians. There, the most able would be put to work alongside factory workers and labourers, a far better life than doing nothing inside a camp. The Conservatives, meanwhile, say that the security risk is too great. They have proposed the majority of refugees all be shipped to [NEE.GetNameDef], along with all newcomers. 'This is an American problem,' they say, 'and it should be handled by Americans.'"

Their reasoning is, apparently, that this is an American problem which should be handled by Americans. We have no choice but to deal with this as best we can."
 canada_events.212.a: "Thanks a lot, Canada"

 canada_events.213.t: "Recruitment of Refugees Begins"
 canada_events.213.d: "All across the country, recruiters are now active at refugee camps, offering the most able a placement within the army. Most understand this is a temporary arrangement - once the war is over, it seems likely that many of them will leave the army and return home again. In the mean time, however, our good treatment of the refugees has led to a large number of men entering our service. They'll fight for the country which has taken them in, they say, even if it means fighting against Americans back home."

 canada_events.214.d.ceasefirewca: "The ceasefire has meant an end to the American civil war, at least for now, and so a large number of refugees have begun returning home. The fact that [WCA.GetNameDef] is victorious in the east does not sit well with many, however. Those that can are largely going to [ACC.GetNameDef], while others have decided to stay in Canada for good. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
 canada_events.214.d.ceasefirenowca: "The ceasefire has meant an end to the American civil war, at least for now, and so the vast majority of refugees have begun returning home. The fact that the ceasefire will eventually end and the conflict undoubtedly renewed does not still well with many, who have decided to either stay in Canada for good or head for destinations further afield. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
 canada_events.214.d.noceasefirewca: "The civil war in America is over, with [WCA.GetNameDef] having won the day. While this does not sit well with most of the refugees, many believe they have no choice but to return - the worst of the violence is over, after all, or so they hope. Many others have decided to stay in Canada, saying that America is now syndicalist and thus dead to them. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
 canada_events.214.d.noceasefirenowca: "The civil war in America is over, and thus the vast majority of the refugees have decided to return - either to face justice or participate in the reconstruction.

 canada_events.216.t: "Visit by Canadian Prime Minister"
 canada_events.216.d: "The Canadian Prime Minister has made a state visit to [Root.GetNameDef], congratulating the President on having reformed America. In private sessions, he has stated his belief that this could not have been done without the help of Canada and the Entente, and thus he hopes that a more permanent alliance between our two countries will result. He suggests a transfer of any owned states claimed by the other, to prevent future conflicts, and for [Root.GetNameDef] to be a more committed and permanent member of the Entente going forward. 'Ours is a special friendship,' he said, 'and I believe it benefits the world if it continues.'"

We cannot prevent it from happening, but some believe it might be possible to delay. If we were to quietly contact and fund Canadian labour movements, get them to rise up in strikes that have obvious syndicalist connections, the Canadians might be too paranoid to take action until the strikes are shut down.

Regardless of the intent, all agree that the strikes must be shut down before we can think about intervening in the south."

The Entente cannot abide the prospect of a syndicalist America on Canada's southern border, they say, but they're wary of throwing advice to one of the war's factions and are thus asking our advice."
 canada_events.232.a: "The Entente should not support a faction"
 canada_events.232.b: "We should support the Federal government"
 canada_events.232.c: "We should support the Constitutionalist Coalition"
 canada_events.232.e: "We should support Huey Long's government"
 canada_events.232.f: "We should support the New Englander government"
 canada_events.232.g: "They can make their own decision on the subject"

 canada_events.300.t: "Departure of the British Exiles"
 canada_events.300.d: "With the restoration of [GBR.GetNameDef], many of the British Exiles in Canada have begun to depart for home - including British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] and most of his senior staff, as well as a large number of the Exiles which had been drafted into the Canadian military, their presence needed back home immediately to restore order in the country. The rest will likely leave over the next year, constituting a large drain on [Root.GetNameDef]'s resources. Still, most of Canada is relieved to see them go. This is, after all, the moment the Empire has been waiting for since 1925, and it feels like a hard-won victory."
 canada_events.300.a: "It will take some adjustment, but we'll manage"

 canada_events.301.t: "The Restoration of Parliament"
 canada_events.301.d: "Also with the departure of the British Exiles comes the end of the War Measures Act and the restoration of full civilian government to the nation. In the wake of the Unionist Party's dissolution the Conservative Party has assumed control over Parliament , which they re-opened to full fanfare while a loud crowd gathered outside... many of them protesting how the nation had been handled during the emergency, and demanding investigations into the conduct of senior officials. For the moment, the government has scheduled new elections to occur within a year's time."
 canada_events.301.a: "Thank heavens for that!"

 canada_events.302.t: "The Canadian Governor General"
 canada_events.302.d: "With the end of the second World War, the Governor-General we appointed back in 1936 seeks to retire after the stress these years have put on him. The time has come to appoint a new Governor General to stand in his stead. The question is who to send. Rewarding one of our generals with the prestigious post will certainly look good to our military, but the Canadians might appreciate rewarding one of their own instead."
 canada_events.302.a: "Prince Albert will take the post"
 canada_events.302.b: "Give the job to Lord Mountbatten"
 canada_events.302.c: "A man like John Vereker will do well in Canada"
 canada_events.302.e: "Let the Canadians choose their own representative"

 canada_events.303.t: "The New Governor General"
 canada_events.303.d.albert: "With the end of the second World War, the Governor-General we appointed back in 1936 seeks to retire after the stress these years have put on him. Thus the King has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Prince Albert for the task. While many Canadians appreciate having such a senior member of the Royal Family assuming the post, and greeted the Prince with wildly cheering crowds as he arrived in Ottawa, many were hoping that the British government might have allowed a Canadian to assume the post, for once."
 canada_events.303.d.mountbatten: "With the end of the second World War, the Governor-General we appointed back in 1936 seeks to retire after the stress these years have put on him. Thus the King has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Lord Louis Mountbatten, cousin to the king and esteemed admiral of the British Navy, for the task. While many Canadians appreciate having such a senior member of the Royal Family assuming the post, many had hoped a Canadian might assume the position instead of it being used as a reward for yet another British military man, and so the crowds greeting Lord Mountbatten in Ottawa were subdued at best."
 canada_events.303.d.vereker: "With the end of the second World War, the Governor-General we appointed back in 1936 seeks to retire after the stress these years have put on him. Thus the King has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Lord John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort, for the task. Many had hoped a Canadian might assume the position instead of it being used as a reward for yet another British military man, and so the crowds greeting Lord Vereker in Ottawa were subdued at best."
 canada_events.303.d.mcnaughton: "With the end of the second World War, the Governor-General we appointed back in 1936 seeks to retire after the stress these years have put on him. Thus the King has appointed a new Governor General to stand in his stead, and has chosen Canadian general, Andrew McNaughton, for the task. Canadians are ecstatic at the prospect of one of their own finally being given the role, and thus the crowd which greeted his arrival in Ottawa were large and enthusiastic."
 canada_events.303.a: "We wish the new Governor General all the best"

 canada_events.304.t: "Debate on the Referendum Begins"
 canada_events.304.d: "It seems there are enough Canadians who either feel the British overstayed their welcome or who now feel as if Canada has been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten, that the idea of a referendum on Canada's future in the Commonwealth has rapidly gained traction. French Canadians in Québec are the ones most strongly in favour of cutting ties with the monarchy, but the sentiment is strong enough elsewhere that a national vote is felt necessary. The debates have already sprung up, and it's a contentious issue - one responsible for a sharp and bitter divide between Canadian households and family members, some who feel that Canada should be proud of what it has accomplished for the Empire and others who ask 'what has the Empire done for us?'"
 canada_events.304.a: "This could get ugly"

 canada_events.305.t: "Demonstrations Across Québec"
 canada_events.305.d: "The national debate over the referendum heated up this week with anti-monarchy demonstrations taking place across the province of Québec. The largest was in Québec City, where a massive crowd of over 100,000 showed up from across the province, angered by the suppression they endured during the conscription crisis - on the orders, they believe, of the British Monarchy. If the crowd was at all subdued, it was because the demonstrations were watched over by thousands of wary Canadian soldiers and police officers."
 canada_events.305.a: "So much for suppression"

 canada_events.306.t: "The March on Rideau Hall"
 canada_events.306.d: "A huge crowd descended on Rideau Hall in Ottawa today, the building which was until recently home to the exiled British king and the royal family. The angry protestors railed against a police line which protected the building from damage, and with good reason considering the threats in previous days by anti-monarchy radicals to burn Rideau Hall to the ground. After hours of confrontation, anti-riot police were called in to disperse the crowd with tear gas, leading many moderate observers to say that it was a dark day in the history of Canadian democracy."
 canada_events.306.a: "An ugly scene"

 canada_events.307.t: "March for the King"
 canada_events.307.d: "Responding to the waves of angry protest over the last several weeks, a march took place in the city of Toronto today - this one in support of [CAN_king_first_name]. While some pointed out that the crowd was largely formed of older, English-speaking Canadians, it was still a stern reminder of how deeply British traditions run in Canada. The conservative speakers reminded the crowd that, without Britain, Canada would not even exist... and they were met with loud cheers. Many of those present spoke fondly of the royal family, and expressed disgust that Canadians would even think of breaking with tradition so readily."
 canada_events.307.a: "Interesting"

 canada_events.308.t: "The King's Radio Address"
 canada_events.308.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] today spoke to the Canadian public by a radio address from Buckingham Palace, taking pains to thank the country for its years of labour and the blood shed on the Empire's behalf. 'Do not think we have forgotten Canada's service,' he said, 'for it has not been and shall never be. Canada has proven itself to be far more than a colony, far more capable and more dutiful than we could possibly have hoped. It was a safe harbour, and for many of us it was home.' He asked that Canadians consider carefully before they chartered a destiny away from the Commonwealth, though in added that - should they choose to leave - the British would be morally bound to respect their collective decision and merely hope that the two countries could continue a long and fruitful friendship."
 canada_events.308.a: "Well said!"

 canada_events.309.t: "The Fleming Inquiry Begins"
 canada_events.309.d.wma: "Considered by some to be disastrous timing, a federal inquiry into the alleged abuses by the government after the invocation of the War Measures Act, headed by Conservative MP Sir Donald Fleming, released its preliminary findings today. While the inquiry stated that it had a great deal more statements to collect and research to conduct, it stressed that it had so far found little evidence to support the idea that the government went beyond that which was 'merited by extreme circumstances'. For those furious at the Canadian government's short cut around democracy, they have declared the inquiry nothing short of a cover up. Rather than addressing the anger, it seems the Fleming Inquiry has stoked it even further."
 canada_events.309.d.pataut: "Considered by some to be disastrous timing, a federal inquiry into the alleged abuses by the government after the shutdown of Parliament on the king's order, headed by Conservative MP Sir Donald Fleming, released its preliminary findings today. While the inquiry stated that it had a great deal more statements to collect and research to conduct, it stressed that it had so far found little evidence to support the idea that the government went beyond that which was 'merited by extreme circumstances'. For those furious at the idea that the British government-in-exile took control over Canada in what they deem a coup, they have declared the inquiry nothing short of a cover up. Rather than addressing the anger, it seems the Fleming Inquiry has stoked it even further."
 canada_events.309.a: "Congratulations, Mr. Fleming, you played yourself"

 canada_events.310.t: "Prime Minister Calls for Unity"
 canada_events.310.d: "The Canadian Prime Minister today spoke to the country through a televised address, warning that a rift in the 'special relationship' between [CAN.GetNameDef] and [GBR.GetNameDef] would be disastrous for both countries. He pointed out that the government maintained a strong record of democracy throughout the war, and that the king's guidance was invaluable without ever overstepping the boundaries allowed him by both law and tradition. 'After going so far to see the United Kingdom and the monarchy restored, it would be ill-suited for us to spit in the face of our own history. This is a time of healing and recovery, not one where we should create further divisions and anger.'"
 canada_events.310.a: "But will Canada listen?"

 canada_events.311.t: "Canadian Referendum Imminent"
 canada_events.311.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] has evidently been left with the feeling that the British overstayed their welcome... or that Canada has now been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. The country has been debating a national referendum on the future of the Commonwealth, and should the vote pass then it will cut ties with the monarchy completely. What this would mean for [CAN.GetNameDef]'s place in the Entente, and the connections it developed with its fellow alliance members during its years of leadership, is currently unknown."
 canada_events.311.a: "Campaign hard for the vote to fail"
 canada_events.311.b: "It's their decision to make"
 canada_events.311.c: "Goodness!"

 canada_events.315.t: "The National Referendum"
 canada_events.315.d: "The day of Canada's referendum is upon us, with millions of Canadians going to the polls across the country. Indeed, interest is so high that polling stations are having trouble keeping up with the long lines. The question facing the nation: do they cut ties with the British monarchy and the Commonwealth, continuing on as a nation in charge of its own constitution and its own government, or do they go on as a Dominion and a close ally of [GBR.GetNameDef], the monarchy continuing as a symbol of tradition and history both?"
 canada_events.315.a: "We must cut ties with the monarchy"
 canada_events.315.b: "We are a loyal member of the Empire"

 canada_events.316.t: "Canada Cuts ties with the Monarchy"
 canada_events.316.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] evidently now feels left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. Over the last month, the country has been gripped with a divisive debate over the future of their place in the Commonwealth. French-speaking Canadians were adamantly opposed, while more traditional-minded English-speaking Canadians were in favour of remaining. The anger over the referendum led to violent demonstrations and near riots, culminating in the vote that took place today - which has been answered with a definitive 'yes'. Canada will go forward, no longer a Dominion but rather a country in charge of its own government. Whether it will have a place in the Entente alliance remains to be seen."
 canada_events.316.a: "The people have spoken"
 canada_events.316.b: "Interesting"

 canada_events.317.t: "Canadian Referendum Fails"
 canada_events.317.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] has evidently been left with the feeling that the British overstayed their welcome... or that Canada has now been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. Over the last month, the country has been gripped with a divisive debate over the future of their place in the Commonwealth. French-speaking Canadians were adamantly opposed, while more traditional-minded English-speaking Canadians were in favour of remaining. The anger over the referendum led to violent demonstrations and near riots, culminating in the vote that took place today - which has been answered with a definitive 'no'.

 canada_events.317.a: "The people have spoken"
 canada_events.317.b: "Interesting"

 canada_events.321.t: "Canadian Constitution Patriated"
 canada_events.321.d: "The British North America Act, which established the Confederation of Canada in 1867, has been under the jurisdiction of the British Parliament - indeed, even while the British government was in exile, they were still technically the masters of Canada's destiny. This is true no longer, as the document has been officially patriated and presented to the Canadian Prime Minister in a solemn ceremony held in Ottawa today. The Prime Minister greeted a cheering crowd, saying that 'Canada is a colony no longer - together we have achieved victory against the syndicalists and proven our strength and perseverance as a nation. Now, with our constitution ours to amend as we see fit, we go forward a truly independent nation!'"
 canada_events.321.a: "Well done, Canada!"

 canada_events.322.t: "The Birth of Canadian Nationalism"
 canada_events.322.d: "Canadian nationalism was never like that of their American cousins to the south. Always it has been more geared towards the idea of national unity rather than that of manifest destiny. In a century where America has faltered, however, it is Canada who has risen to the challenge... and thus this a national pride has begun to take hold, one where Canadians seek to prove their independence and shake off their image as an unassuming country existing on America's fringes, coupled with a growing disaffection for their ties to - and the decisions made by - the Old Empire."
 canada_events.322.a: "Let's not get carried away, eh?"

 canada_events.323.t: "Canada Withdraws from the Entente"
 canada_events.323.d: "Having cut ties with the British monarchy, it was only a matter of time before the Canadian government addressed their role in the Entente alliance - and now they have done so, definitively, announcing their withdrawal from all roles in the Entente effective as of today. Considering that it was Canada who led the Entente for so many years, military leaders in the alliance are left wondering what this means for its future... and, indeed, if the ties to Canada can ever truly be broken.\n\nWhile British officials have scoffed at Canada leaving itself 'foolishly isolated', the Canadians appear confident that their role as an independent and strong nation can only bring further prosperity."
 canada_events.323.a: "It was time."
 canada_events.323.b: "It's their decision to make, foolish as it may be."
 canada_events.323.c: "The Entente without Canada is difficult to imagine."

 canada_events.324.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims [claimed_state.GetName]"
 canada_events.324.d: "With a surge in nationalism since cutting ties to [GBR.GetNameDef], [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [Root.GetNameDef]. It is, according to the [From.GetAdjective] government, part of their 'greater destiny'. Whether they intend to back up their claim remains to be seen."
 canada_events.324.a: "They dare!"

 canada_events.325.t: "Growth of the Social Credit Party"
 canada_events.325.d: "The growth of Canadian nationalism has had a number of side effects, one of which has included the rapid growth of the Social Credit Party. Considered until now to be a third party, unable to muster the political support to form their own Government. Recently a large number of Conservative Party members defecting to the party, trying to save their own careers as the Conservative Party's popularty plummets, due to being seen as deeply tied to the now defunct Monarchy. The party leader, John Horne Blackmore, has promised to an enthusiastic crowd of supporters that they would lead Canada into a new era of prosperity in the next election."
 canada_events.325.a: "Interesting, but doubtful"

 canada_events.326.t: "Canadian Investments"
 canada_events.326.d: "After the fall of the United Kingdom, the British Exiles flocked to Canada with their expertise and their money... and, now that we are the ones struggling to rebuild a tattered economy, the reverse is happening. Canadian entrepreneurs, many of the British expatriates who have chosen to remain in their new home, are coming to Britain to take advantage of the many opportunities that exist here. It is making the Canadians wealthy, true, but it is also benefiting us a great deal. We have so many ties between us, so many familiar contacts, that the association is a natural one, and it is helping Britain rebuild faster than ever before."
 canada_events.326.a: "We welcome their presence"

 canada_events.327.t: "A New Generation of Officers"
 canada_events.327.d: "Many young Canadian officers proved their value during the reconquest of the United Kingdom, showing their valour and their commanding abilities. Now that many British officers have returned home, the Armed Forces Council is promoting many of these Canadians to higher command posts. Some of them have also been given important roles in military academies, so that their experience will help shape a future generation of tacticians, strategists, and leaders."
 canada_events.327.a: "Excellent"

 ### Flavour ###
 canada_flavour_events.1.t: "Miss Serene Efficiency"
 canada_flavour_events.1.d: "Canada's political establishment is, quite clearly, dominated by men. It's rather rare to see a woman in a bureaucratic position, but Phyllis Gregory, nicknamed “Miss Serene Efficiency”, has broken through those ranks, and made quite a name for herself.\n\nBorn in 1903 in Nova Scotia to a modest family, she quickly showed herself to be an intelligent girl. She quickly learned piano as a child, and was an excellent student. In 1925 she graduated from the University of British Columbia, earning a Bachelor's degree in economics and political science with first class honours. Along with earning her Bachelor's she also earned the “Susan B. Anthony Memorial Scholarship” allowing her to study at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she earned her Masters of the Arts. After that she moved to Germany and studied at the University of Marburg, where she wrote her Thesis.\n\nEventually she came back home, to Canada, and she managed to get the position in Ottawa as an Economist. Here her education, intelligence, and sheer skill caused her to raise the ranks, even befriending the Conservative R.B. Bennet.\n\nWith the onset of the Homecoming and the war, she only continued to shine. First she was put on the” War Time Prices and Trade Board” as an economic advisor. After that she became the “Fats and Oils Administrator”, putting her in charge of countless items. Soap, paint, starch, printing ink, as a few examples. She was also tasked with finding new sources of oil to help with the War Effort.\n\nToday she has been made the Chief Economist of the Tariff board, the highest office a woman can hold in Canada. An intelligent and elegant woman, who's fought and earned every position and accolade she's been given, an example to all Canadians of what hard work and determination can bring"
 canada_flavour_events.1.a: "A truly remarkable woman"

 canada_flavour_events.2.t: "The Hobbit, or There and Back Again"
 canada_flavour_events.2.d: "The George Allwen and Unwin publishing house has put out a new book by British émigré J. R. R. Tolkien, who returned to South Africa following the revolution. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a strange small creature called a Hobbit, who goes on an adventure featuring wizards, dwarves, giants, goblins and a fire-breathing dragon before returning home a wealthy man. The tale has already received widespread critical acclaim and Tolkien has been nominated for literary prizes. There have been hints that he is working on something longer and larger, but the author's notorious perfectionism might well delay its publishing."
 canada_flavour_events.2.a: "A delightful story!"

 canada_flavour_events.3.t: "Gilbert K. Chesterton Dies"
 canada_flavour_events.3.d: "British writer Gilbert Keith Chesterton died today in his exile in Ottawa, at 62. A prolific author whose most-known novel is certainly \"The Man Who Was Thursday\", he was a devout Roman Catholic and a Christian apologist, two reasons that forced him to leave Britain to avoid persecution after the Syndicalist Revolution."
 canada_flavour_events.3.a: "The Prince of Paradox died."

 canada_flavour_events.4.t: "Edmund Allenby Dies"
 canada_flavour_events.4.d: "General Allenby died today in his exile at Ottawa, aged 75. Retired since 1925, he was mostly known as the commander-in-chief of the British expeditionary forces in the Middle East. After achieving major victories thanks to Arab help, such as taking Jerusalem, he was forced to withdraw as the Weltkrieg went bad for Britain. By honouring him with state funerals, [CAN_king_full_name] wants to show his desire for revenge."
 canada_flavour_events.4.a: "A war hero died today."

 canada_flavour_events.5.t: "Edward VIII Crowned as King of Great Britain"
 canada_flavour_events.5.d: "George V, the last King of Great Britain and Ireland to have ruled the Home Isles themselves, has passed while in exile in Canada. The first Windsor King's reign shall be remembered with sorrow and sadness, as during it Britain lost both the Weltkrieg and its homeland. The crown was inherited by Edward, Prince of Wales, who now stylises himself as Edward VIII.\n\nKing Edward is a vengeful and ambitious man, and not on good terms with Prime Minister Mackenzie King. He lives on the goal of avenging his father and reconquering the Home Isles, and thus is quite popular among the British exiles in Canada, among others."
 canada_flavour_events.5.a: "Interesting."

### Entente Events ###
 entente_events.2.t: "Invitation to the IEDC"
 entente_events.2.d: "A delegation from the [From.GetAdjective] government arrived today to formally invite [Root.GetNameDef] to join the IEDC - the Imperial Economic Development Council. The IEDC was created to foster greater economic cooperation within the Entente, with yearly (and voluntary) contributions of political power which are invested back in member nations at the discretion of [From.GetNameDef]. There are those in the government who express concern whether [Root.GetNameDef] would actually see a return for its investment, seeing as [From.GetNameDef] could simply decide to invest everything in itself, but considering donations are voluntary it seems like that would ensure a short life for the IEDC."

 entente_events.3.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom of our offer and agreed to join the IEDC, including an initial investment of £pol_power [?From.iedc_contribution] Political Power. The first [From.GetAdjective] economists and engineers have already begun to arrive in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 entente_events.3.a: "Excellent!"

 entente_events.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Join"
 entente_events.4.d: "Perhaps seeing the Entente as unable to impact its economy in any meaningful way, or simply not trusting the [Root.GetAdjective] government to administer its investments, [From.GetNameDef] has turned down our offer and refused to join the IEDC."
 entente_events.4.a: "Disappointing"

 entente_events.5.t: "IEDC Advisors"
 entente_events.5.d: "Our contribution to the IEDC allows us to take advantage of their pool of advisors - the benefit from which is greater, depending on how much we contributed to the group. How shall we use them over the next year?"

 entente_events.12.a: "So be it!"

 entente_events.13.t: "IEDC Shut Down"
 entente_events.13.d: "Without any membership in the organisation, the IEDC has finally elected to disband. There were a few protests on the board, those who said the IEDC could still prove valuable even if it was only coordinating efforts within [Root.GetNameDef] and not within the entire alliance, but for most it was clear that the IEDC had fallen short of its mission."
 entente_events.13.a: "Unfortunate"

 entente_events.15.t: "The Foundation of the ISAC"
 entente_events.15.d: "While the Entente alliance and our membership within it is, theoretically, of a purely military nature, the reality is far more complex than that. One of the legacies of the Great War was the advent of mass mobilisation - the consolidation of large swathes of potentially useful sectors of society into an apparatus designed to aid the war effort. The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\n\nTo this end, [ENT.GetNameDef] has established an Imperial Scientific and Academic Council - an organisation intended to unify and coordinate the Entente's research efforts across borders, allowing for the swift spread of major technological breakthroughs between member states and the elimination of some wasteful duplicate work. As a member of the alliance, we have been invited to participate in the initiative and reap the benefits alongside our allies, a prospect that has generated much excitement within our scientific community."
 entente_events.15.a: "A wonderful initiative!"

 entente_events.20.t: "[CAN_king_first_name]'s Address"
 entente_events.20.d.home_isles: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in regaining the Home Isles and thanking them for their support during Britain's darkest years. 'There is much cause for grief and much left to be rebuilt,' he said, 'but we should also take this moment to rejoice, for our homecoming is a dream in which some had lost hope. Hope, however, has always been our strongest ally. It sails with us on the seas and marches beside us on the battlefield, and it is to hope we must cling as we move together as one into this next era of our common alliance.'"
 entente_events.20.d.war_eng: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, remarking on the state of the alliance now that war with [ENG.GetNameDef] was finally underway. 'It is with a sadness in our hearts that we wage this war,' he said, 'knowing full well that it is waged against our own countrymen, and that it is British blood we must spill on British soil. Yet there is also resolution, for the tyranny of syndicalism cannot be allowed to reign over any free people... least of which the people of our United Kingdom. There are those who say our alliance stands little chance, but to them I say that we know better, as the men and women who fight for freedom shall always fight with the strength of twenty.'"
 entente_events.20.d.war_ger: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, remarking on the state of the alliance now that it was at war with [GER.GetNameDef]. 'It was not our intention to replay the events of the Great War,' he said, 'but now that war with the Germans is upon us, we will fight with all our heart to see that the same mistakes are not made and that, this time, we shall achieve victory. We go into this battle knowing that the Kaiser fights only to sate his hunger for power and conquest, while we fight for the sake of the world and the good of all men. It is this glad knowledge that shall give us all the strength we require.'"
 entente_events.20.d.war_acw: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, remarking on the state of the alliance now that it had become embroiled in the American Civil War. 'We cannot stand by and pretend that the fate of America does not also dictate the fate of our alliance,' he said. '[CAN.GetNameDefCap] shares a long and vulnerable border with the Americans, and there is yet hope that our intervention can yet restore a peaceful and democratic government, possibly even an ally. Our hearts go out to those Americans and Canadians inevitably caught up in this struggle, fighting only for the freedom they have so long enjoyed.'"
 entente_events.20.d.france_taken: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in retaking the French mainland. 'To see French soldiers once again walking the streets of Paris, and French citizens overjoyed at their liberation from syndicalist tyranny, gives us all hope,' he said. 'There is much in [NFA.GetNameDef] yet to be done, but our alliance goes forward into the future with a glad heart, knowing that our victory has provided a blow for freedom and for the good of all mankind.'"
 entente_events.20.d.france_mainland: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in bringing the exiled French government back to the mainland. 'Paris yet eludes us,' he said, 'but we can rejoice in seeing French soldiers once again marching in the streets of Marseille, a bold step closer to their ultimate goal of liberating all freedom-loving citizens of [NFA.GetNameDef]. Our alliance has fought hard for this victory, and while there is much yet to be done, and many losses yet to be grieved, we must take a moment to acknowledge all we have accomplished. For we have done it together, as a common alliance seeking only the better for all mankind.'"
 entente_events.20.d.india_united: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in uniting [RAJ.GetNameDef]. 'Ever since the terrible civil war which tore India apart,' he said, 'we have held onto a desperate hope that one day their nation would once again be made whole. That victory has finally been achieved. We thank the Indian government for the role they have so graciously played within the Commonwealth, and wish them well on the next step of their journey as they begin the healing process that still divides the people of their great nation. Let our alliance keep this in mind, what can be accomplished when we strive to achieve what so many have told us lay forever beyond our grasp.'"
 entente_events.20.d.italy_united: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, congratulating them for their successful efforts in restoring the Italian mainland to [SRD.GetNameDef]. 'So many nations have been split apart by war and syndicalist unrest since the end of the Great War,' he said, 'and here we are reminded once again that there is a path to redemption... for the brave Sardinians, for the Italians liberated from the tyranny of syndicalism, and for us all. As an alliance, our strength lies in our unity and in our resolution that only together can we strike a blow against the forces that would seek to oppress the free peoples of our world.'"
 entente_events.20.d.india_defeated: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning them to not give into despair after the fall of the Dominion of India. 'Our alliance exists to offer a path to redemption and freedom for each of our members,' he said, 'but we go into this knowing that not every battle will be won, and not every brother and sister will come out the other side of this war unscarred and intact. Even so, we must be resolute. We are weaker for the loss of India, yes, but we are not broken, and if we remain together we shall enjoy the strength we need to see ultimate victory.'"
 entente_events.20.d.aus_syndicalist: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning them to not give into despair after the fall of Australasia to syndicalist forces. 'One of our number has succumbed to strife and tyranny,' he said, 'and so we hang our heads in sadness at the battle which freedom-loving Australasians now have before them. To them we say to take heart, for the British crown sees their struggle, and the Entente is not yet done. The day will come when our alliance lands upon the shores of the Antipodes and puts an end to the syndicalist menace there once and for all.'"
 entente_events.20.d.wif_syndicalist: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning them to not give into despair after the fall of the West Indies to syndicalists. 'It was our hope that each of the men and women of our great alliance would be spared the tyranny which syndicalist rule brings,' he said, 'but we know that is not to be. To the West Indian usurpers we can only say that they must prepare themselves, for the Entente shall not rest, shall not waver, until its corrupt and unjust government has been toppled and the West Indians who so bravely fight against them are restored their freedom. That is the mission of our alliance, and this setback does not sap our strength but rather provides us clarity of purpose. That is the lesson we all must cling to in this hour.'"
 entente_events.20.d.acw_begins: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, issuing a sombre note regarding the onset of a second civil war in America. 'Our heart goes out to those noble Americans who now find themselves called upon to fight against the forces of tyranny and oppression in their own homeland,' he said, 'for we know full well the consequences of their failure as well as the terrible cost to one's soul when the enemy is one's own countrymen. Our alliance cannot merely grieve for the devastation, however. We must stand ready to act, for the fate of America is inextricably linked to our own. Should America fall to syndicalism, so too shall [CAN.GetNameDef] and then us all. Would that we did not need to consider such a grave possibility as intervention, but consider it we must - for the good of all humanity.'"
 entente_events.20.d.war: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, calling on them to dedicate their common forces towards the war effort. 'We are an alliance of nations tied together by tradition, yes, but also by a common interest in freedom and the good of mankind. Ours is a noble purpose, and we give thanks each day that allies of such stout heart still remain, still fight against the wearying tide of oppression and syndicalism. We must hold our heads high, and know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. This war will have an end, and we must see it through... together.'"
 entente_events.20.d.peace1: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, calling on them to prepare for the coming war against [ENG.GetNameDef]. 'All of us desire peace,' he said, 'but at the very same time know what it is that must be done. Millions of our countrymen struggle under syndicalist tyranny, a terrible wave which threatens to drown not only the British and the French but also the entire world. It is only with brave hearts and a sense of resolution that we move forward as one, until the day comes when our mettle shall be tested once more. We have every confidence that, on that day, our brave men and women shall prove that they are all the stronger for the trials and tribulations each of us has faced.'"
 entente_events.20.d.peace2: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning that - even in this time of peace - the alliance must stand ready to face the unknown. 'The Union of Britain has been defeated,' he said, 'but ours is a brittle peace, and it is only through vigilance that our freedom is maintained. There yet remains much to be done in this world, much that requires our attention, and as our alliance has proven strong by every possible measure it is with every confidence that I know we shall continue to meet these challenges with the grace and courage with which our alliance has been long-defined.'"

 entente_events.21.d.high: "Speaking to a large and wildly enthusiastic crowd in the capital, [CAN_king_full_name] commended the [Root.GetAdjective] contribution to the Entente and kicked off a three-month tour of the country. [CAN_king_first_name] is expected to meet with all manner of dignitaries throughout [Root.GetNameDef] - indeed, there are so many clamouring for royal attention, the king's staff has been reportedly overwhelmed with requests. Each stop on the king's itinerary is expected to have huge crowds, with a massive parade planned in [parade_state.GetName] in the king's honour. [Root.GetAdjective] officials are extraordinarily pleased with the king's visit, and it seems every effort to roll out the red carpet for him will be spared."

[CAN_king_first_name] is expected to meet with officials and dignitaries throughout [Root.GetNameDef], with at least one parade planned to be held in his honour in [parade_state.GetName]. Considering the king's meagre popularity, attendance is not expected to be very high... though there are still those who eagerly anticipate the king's presence, and [Root.GetAdjective] military leaders are eager to consult with the king's attachés regarding Entente coordination."

 entente_events.23.d: "While on his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], [CAN_king_first_name] has found himself embroiled in a scandal - allegedly involving a married [tour_country.GetAdjective] heiress. While there is no direct proof beyond a few blurry photographs, attempts to keep the scandal under wraps have failed and it's been the front page on [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers for weeks. The king says his tour will continue, though there are many who say the goodwill previously generated by it has already all but evaporated."
 entente_events.23.a: "How terrible!"

 entente_events.24.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] in Major Royal Scandal"
 entente_events.24.d: "While on his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], [CAN_king_first_name] has found himself embroiled in a major scandal. Apparently, the king was overheard in private conversation with his aides, and the nature was so inflammatory that it led to immediate headlines in [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers... headlines which were then supported by anonymous sources within the king's staff and then carried onto papers throughout the Entente. While initially [CAN_king_first_name] insisted on continuing his tour, he has since cut it short and declared that he is 'taking some time' in his private [KR_king_base.GetAdjective] estate. This is no doubt to give the scandal time to blow over, though the damage to his reputation - and the goodwill he generated during his tour - has clearly already been done."
 entente_events.24.a: "How terrible!"

 entente_events.25.t: "Attempted Assassination on [CAN_king_first_name]"
 entente_events.25.d: "While on parade in [tour_country.GetNameDef], an assailant in the crowd shot at the royal carriage, causing a severe panic which almost turned into a stampede. The king was unharmed but quickly evacuated, and a manhunt for the would-be assassin is already underway. [CAN_king_first_name] has been forced to call his tour short, taking with him a sincere apology by the [tour_country.GetAdjective] government... though, outside of the trouble caused by the clamp-down of [tour_country.GetAdjective] security forces, the goodwill of the [tour_country.GetAdjective] public has been unaffected. Indeed, the newspapers have been declaring nothing but praise for the king, who has since declared he will be taking a few months off of public appearances to recover from the ordeal."
 entente_events.25.a: "Phew! A close call!"

 entente_events.26.t: "Royal Tour Cut Short"
 entente_events.26.d: "[CAN_king_first_name]'s tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef] has been cut short due to the king's illness, which the royal staff claim is nothing serious and most likely brought on by exhaustion. The [tour_country.GetAdjective] public is clearly disappointed by the decision, though well-wishes have been pouring into the royal residence since the announcement was made. It's unknown how long the king will require to recover, and in the case of the [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour, the only likely effect is that the lingering effects of the goodwill it generated won't last nearly as long as hoped."
 entente_events.26.a: "At least His Majesty is all right"

 entente_events.27.t: "Royal Speech Well-Received"
 entente_events.27.d: "A speech made by [CAN_king_first_name] during his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], one where he pressed the virtues of the Entente and the need for a restoration of order in a world which has been thrown into chaos, has hit a particularly strong note among the [tour_country.GetAdjective] people and also been picked up by many national newspapers. The king has been complimented for his eloquence as well as his advocacy, making a strong positive note as the [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour begins to wrap up."
 entente_events.27.a: "Well done!"

 entente_events.28.t: "Royal Speech Poorly Received"
 entente_events.28.d: "A speech made by [CAN_king_first_name] during his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef] ended up in disarray when the king fared poorly against several hecklers in the crowd. He was overheard making some choice comments regarding the 'rudeness' of the hecklers, who turned out to be wounded veterans... a story which has been picked up in many [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers and resulted in [CAN_king_first_name] being painted in a rather unfavourable light. It's not a scandal, at least, but it does ring a rather sour note as the king's [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour begins to wrap up."

 entente_events.30.t: "Directing the British Exiles"
 entente_events.30.d.low: "The Exiles do not currently have a great deal of influence within [Root.GetNameDef]. Those placed within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have mostly used up their favours, and the British industrialists in the country are still consolidating their wealth.

The charge brings up several sticky points, not least of which is whether [Root.GetAdjective] courts have jurisdiction over a British national. Other expatriates have been arrested in the past, but never someone of such a high profile, and the [Root.GetAdjective] press has pounced on the scandal to the point where the public lingers over each day's lurid headlines. [CAN_king_first_name] is willing to personally intervene on the man's behalf, though it would cost the king a great deal of his reputation, and there are others who say it is time for the government to step in."

The story has gone public, and the [Root.GetAdjective] press is playing it up as a betrayal of the country by the Exiles themselves... flames which have been fanned by recent comments by the king, defending the official as a personal friend. Now we are left with allowing the trial to be played out with the full eyes of the public upon it, allowing [CAN_king_first_name] the chance to intervene despite the damage to the monarchy, or intervening ourselves and handing the trial over to the British government-in-exile to be handled quietly, despite the outrage this would cause."

 entente_events.54.d.2: "A recent law being considered by the [Root.GetAdjective] regarding the legal status of British expatriates in [Root.GetNameDef] is seeing heavy opposition by [CAN_king_first_name] and the exiled Parliament - who are threatening to exert royal prerogative over the bill, which is their legal right even though it would come at a heavy price, considering how the Exiles are sometimes viewed by the [Root.GetAdjective] public. Some members of the government are desperate to find a compromise."
 entente_events.54.d.3: "A dispute is slowly rearing its head within [Root.GetAdjective] military circles - namely who holds ultimate command over those British expatriates which are currently supported, and housed, within the [Root.GetAdjective] armed forces. Normally the Exiles and the [Root.GetAdjective] government would work together on these matters, but there are several sticking points which are refusing to go away and neither side appears ready to give on inch."
 entente_events.54.d.4: "Several recent comments by the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef], have been taken as a sign of interference in the next [Root.GetAdjective] election, and some members of the [Root.GetAdjective] government have taken umbrage - to the point of going to the [Root.GetAdjective] press with complaints regarding what they see as the erosion of [Root.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty. It is feared that this conflict might very easily get out of hand."
 entente_events.54.d.5: "The current influence of the British Exiles wielded within the [Root.GetAdjective] government has recently become a concern to opposition parties, some members of which have complained to the press - citing several examples where the Exiles Parliament has overruled the government on matters they considered important, particularly if they believed it would lengthen the timetable for [Root.GetNameDef] reclaiming the Home Isles. The [Root.GetAdjective] press is eager to take up the challenge, and if the matter is not addressed soon it could lead to a larger streak of anti-British sentiment within the country."
 entente_events.54.d.6: "Several prominent [Root.GetAdjective] businessmen have been complaining about the favouritism shown towards British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef]. British industrialists, they say, are given preferential treatment on contracts and even allowed to skirt a number of legal requirements that ordinary [Root.GetAdjective] citizens must comply with. The complaints are gaining traction with the [Root.GetAdjective] press, and if not addressed could grow into a much more serious matter."
 entente_events.54.d.7: "At least one major British industrialist, an Exile within [Root.GetNameDef] and member of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, has been loudly complaining at the number of what he calls 'arbitrary' restrictions placed on British Exiles when it comes to operating businesses within the country. 'We are doing the best we can,' he has said to the [Root.GetAdjective] press, 'and our help is surely needed for the war effort!' The government, meanwhile, claims it cannot afford to give the British Exiles an unfair advantage in business circles. With the king considering weighing in on the argument, it might be better to address sooner rather than later."

 entente_events.55.d: "The British Exiles have amassed a great deal of influence within [Root.GetNameDef]... so much so, in fact, that they have become accustomed to having their way. When [CAN_king_first_name] recently questioned a decision of the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the exiled Parliament, the result was an unexpected feud between the Exiles and their monarch, one that the [Root.GetAdjective] press has become aware of. The resulting war of words was short, but enough that both parties were damaged in the eyes of the [Root.GetAdjective] public."
 entente_events.55.a: "Let us hope that doesn't happen again..."

 entente_events.56.t: "British Exile Fortunes Improve"
 entente_events.56.d.1: "Several of the more prominent British industrialists currently living in [Root.GetNameDef], members of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, have been doing quite well as of late. Their investments in the [Root.GetAdjective] economy have been paying off handsomely, and thus their potential contribution towards the Exiles' overall influence has increased accordingly."
 entente_events.56.d.2: "A wealthy family of British expatriates living in [Root.GetNameDef], having fled the Union of Britain shortly after its rise, has been seen in the company of [CAN_king_first_name] much over recent months. Word has it that they have been admitted to the king's inner circle. If the rumours are true, the influence of the British Exiles is quickly improving."
 entente_events.56.d.3: "One of the members of the Exiles has become something of a darling in the [Root.GetAdjective] media as of late. Following his much-publicised marriage to a [Root.GetAdjective] actress, his speeches have been well-attended and many consider him an up-and-comer... indeed, even the [Root.GetAdjective] government seems to listen with rapt attention when he speaks."
 entente_events.56.d.4: "A high-profile member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government died today. Much known for his public rants on the importance of [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty in the face of the British presence, and a self-avowed Republican, his replacement is a much more moderate figure as well as a friend of [CAN_king_first_name]. It is acknowledges in many circles that this is a boon for the British Exile cause in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 entente_events.56.d.5: "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning towards the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] conducting several interviews on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which have painted the Homecoming as a cause that cannot be given up on just yet. Numerous other expatriates have gone on the radio to regularly tell fond stories of the United Kingdom which once was in the weeks since, offering the Exiles even more public sympathy."
 entente_events.56.d.6: "A prominent member of a British noble family currently living in [Root.GetNameDef] died recently, and his funeral gained much national attention - which included a last statement written by the man, explaining at length how his final wish had been to walk on the grounds of his family's ancestral estates one last time. The funeral has gained a great deal of public sympathy for the plight of the other British Exiles."
 entente_events.56.d.7: "Several public policy meetings within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have ended in favour of the British Exiles recently, with prominent members of the exiled Parliament - and even [CAN_king_first_name] himself - attending and making a very public show of being conciliatory and asking for [Root.GetAdjective] forbearance rather than demanding it. The effort has clearly gone over well, and the influence of the exiled Parliament in government circles is definitely improving."
 entente_events.56.a: "Excellent"

 entente_events.57.t: "British Exile Fortunes Worsen"
 entente_events.57.d.1: "One of the most prominent British industrialists currently living in [Root.GetNameDef], a member of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, today had to declare bankruptcy after months of declining fortunes - and, rumour has it, a pending scandal of insider trading. While there is some sympathy for the industrialist, who was forced to leave a great deal of his fortune behind in the Home Isles, it does not change the fact that this negatively impacts the fortunes of the British Exiles a great deal."
 entente_events.57.d.2: "One of the wealthy families of British expatriates living in [Root.GetNameDef], having fled the Union of Britain shortly after its rise, has noticeably cut its ties with [CAN_king_first_name] in recent months following a very public dispute between the family's patriarch and the king. Seeing as the family was once considered an integral part of [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, the fortunes of the British Exiles have surely been hurt by this parting."
 entente_events.57.d.3: "One of the more integral British ministers, a member of the exiles Government, has been caught up in an increasing series of scandals in the [Root.GetAdjective] media as of late, starting with the revelation of an affair and ending with accusations of bribery and nepotism. [CAN_king_first_name] finally ended the matter by releasing him from his position today, though it is clear that the damage has already been done to the overall influence the British Exiles currently enjoy in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 entente_events.57.d.4: "A high-profile member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government died today. Much known for this personal friendship with [CAN_king_first_name], and having been among the first to welcome the British Exiles to [Root.GetNameDef], his replacement is a man more known for questioning British influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] government... and thus his loss is considered a severe blow to the cause of the British Exiles."
 entente_events.57.d.5: "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning against the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] having conducted a rather disastrous interview on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which painted him as accusing the [Root.GetAdjective] people as being too 'lazy' to achieve victory against the Union of Britain. The Prime Minister later clarified strenuously that this was not what he meant, but the damage has already been done."
 entente_events.57.d.6: "A speech made by a [Root.GetAdjective] politician, considered almost a nobody with little chance of reaching Parliament, gained national attention recently, no doubt due to the man's angry declaration that it was time to 'give the boot' to the British Exiles who he described as 'leeches dependent on [Root.GetAdjective] goodwill'. The attention would have quickly passed had [CAN_king_first_name] not gone on record derisively insulting the man's 'lack of loyalty' - which provoked considerable anger and even more press coverage for months."
 entente_events.57.d.7: "Several public policy meetings within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have ended recently with the British Exiles decidedly on the losing end. Prominent members of the exiles Government - and even [CAN_king_first_name] himself - attended these meetings in an effort to aid their cause, but their presence ultimately did more harm than good, and was seen as an attempt to exert undue influence over [Root.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty. The Exiles have dutifully backed off from attendance in recent weeks, though it is clear the damage to public perception has already been done."
 entente_events.57.a: "An unfortunate setback"

 entente_events.58.t: "[CAN_king_first_name] in Royal Scandal"
 entente_events.58.d.1: "[Root.GetAdjective] newspapers are all abuzz with the details regarding [CAN_king_first_name]'s latest alleged affair - this one with a British aristocrat who is herself married. While both parties have denied the allegations, they have been photographed together on several occasions, and more than one source inside the royal household affirms that the rumours are completely true. The scandal has done considerable harm to [CAN_king_first_name]'s popularity in [Root.GetNameDef], with the public declaring the king's conduct 'disgraceful'."
 entente_events.58.d.2: "A member of the British royal family has been caught up in a royal scandal, with the headlines in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers dominated by accusations of infidelity and deceit. While [CAN_king_first_name] himself is not part of the scandal, it has not reflected well on the monarchy as a whole."
 entente_events.58.d.3: "Recent revelations reported in a [Root.GetAdjective] national newspaper claim that [CAN_king_first_name] used underhanded tactics to have a personal friend appointed to a plum political position within the [Root.GetAdjective] government. It has not helped matters that the king's friend has been overheard bragging about the favours he's received from the royal family, and all the recent attention has painted the monarchy in a particularly bad light."
 entente_events.58.d.4: "A dispute within the British royal family has gone public, and although the conflict has been denied by all parties involved, [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers are filled with accounts supported by 'unnamed sources' inside the royal household. The [Root.GetAdjective] public, amused by the royal antics, has been glued to the headlines... and a stiff response from [CAN_king_first_name] has likely done the monarchy more harm than good."
 entente_events.58.d.5: "There has been a recent upsurge in anti-monarchist sentiment within [Root.GetNameDef], likely driven by syndicalist propaganda... but also not helped by newspaper accounts depicting the British royal family living in luxury and going about their day-to-day business as if nothing had changed. The newspaper stories were intended to promote the royals through an 'inside look' at their lifestyle, but appear to have had the opposite effect."
 entente_events.58.d.6: "A public spat between [CAN_king_first_name] and a rather prominent member of the British aristocracy has grown rather ugly. The aristocrat is said to have disavowed the monarchy, and his family is leaving [Root.GetNameDef] for an unknown destination... and the king is angry enough that he resorted to public comments in a [Root.GetAdjective] newspaper that called the family 'traitors' and worse. Public sentiment, however, seems to be that the entire affair reflects badly on the monarchy itself, rather than the aristocrat."
 entente_events.58.d.7: "A recent interview with [CAN_king_first_name] by a [Root.GetAdjective] publication has been received poorly, with several of the king's comments being perceived by the [Root.GetAdjective] public as 'out of touch'... particularly in light of the hardships suffered by the [Root.GetAdjective] people in recent years. The royal establishment has offered explanations and apologies, so the furore in the press is already dying down, but there is a general sentiment that the damage to the monarchy's reputation is already done."
 entente_events.58.a: "Unfortunate"

 entente_events.59.t: "Popularity of the Monarchy Rises"
 entente_events.59.d.1: "A recent wedding within the greater royal family has captured the imagination of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. Perhaps the state of the world and the country is such that the public is looking for a distraction... and thus [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have been reporting on the royal wedding with a certain amount of glee. Royalists have been happily waving the British flag, glad for a moment of respite."
 entente_events.59.d.2: "A recent interview with [CAN_king_first_name] by a [Root.GetAdjective] publication has been received positively. The article is considered a rare look inside the king's private life and his private thoughts, and the [Root.GetAdjective] public has responded enthusiastically."
 entente_events.59.d.3: "[CAN_king_first_name] completed a visit to a [Root.GetAdjective] military base this week, and while some have complained that it was a clear publicity stunt the pictures of the king shaking hands with excited, grateful soldiers has done wonders for the king's reputation. 'He really seems to care about us,' one soldier was remarked on saying. 'It makes me so proud to fight in his name.'"
 entente_events.59.d.4: "[CAN_king_first_name] recently took time out of his busy schedule to visit a [Root.GetAdjective] hospital, spending the afternoon meeting with the sick and the elderly. The visit was apparently not intended for publicity, with the king banning all cameras and reporters within, but word still got out afterwards. Most of those he visited gave the king a glowing review, saying that 'he is such a kind, caring man'. Some cynically suggest that it was a publicity stunt nevertheless, and - if so - it certainly seems to have done the trick for the king's reputation."
 entente_events.59.d.5: "A recent death within the greater royal family - a young cousin of [CAN_king_first_name]'s who has been serving with the [Root.GetAdjective] military - has gained a great deal of sympathy and attention from the [Root.GetAdjective] public. There is a sense among many that the royals are truly part of [Root.GetNameDef], willing to shed blood alongside [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers in pursuit of a common goal."
 entente_events.59.d.6: "There has been a recent upswing in pro-monarchist sentiment within [Root.GetNameDef], despite - or perhaps because of - syndicalist propaganda. Some portrayals of the royal family within [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have been depicting them as more down-to-earth and accessible, which is new territory for the traditionally aloof royals but appears to be working for them."
 entente_events.59.d.7: "[CAN_king_first_name] has been quite busy lately, making appearances at public openings, christening a new ship, attending church, sitting personally in his seat at the [Root.GetAdjective] parliament buildings... it has left the king quite exhausted, but it's had the effect of heightening the king's profile with the [Root.GetAdjective] people. For the moment, they appear quite fond of him."

 entente_events.60.d.2: "[CAN_king_first_name] has recently scaled back his public appearances and other duties, claiming the need to see to personal matters at his [Root.GetAdjective] estate. He told at least one reporter that there is nothing additional to be concerned over, though that hasn't stopped newspapers from speculating."
 entente_events.60.d.3: "Recent trouble within the royal family has led to [CAN_king_first_name] scaling back his public appearances and governmental obligations, at least over the next few months.

 entente_events.61.d: "[CAN_king_first_name] has spent the last few weeks touring [Root.GetAdjective] military bases, reviewing the troops and meetings with generals regarding the preparedness of the [Root.GetAdjective] military. He appeared pleased overall, though not as pleased as the [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers were to meet him - many got to shake the king's hand and exchange a few words, and the entire tour reflected well in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers."

Indeed, the new king appears to be enjoying his new status so much it's led to a growing commentary in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers that Edward doesn't seem to be taking his role with the gravity that some would expect for a British Exile. 'I saw him laughing and carrying on with the lords and ladies,' one witness stated. 'You'd think he didn't have a care in the world, that he may as well have been back in London.' Monarchists have been quick to defend the king, saying that his social appearances are quite normal, and should be welcomed after George V's long period of reclusiveness following the royal exile from the Home Isles."

 entente_events.63.d: "With American refugees flooding north by the thousands, Canada has seen great difficulty in dealing with them all. King Edward, however, has recently made it his personal mission to greet them and make them feel welcome - at least for the time being. After several visits to camps in Ontario and Québec, the king held an elaborate garden party in Montreal to meet with more prominent Americans, the wealthy elites and celebrities who were able to come north immediately upon the outbreak of the civil war. There are some accusing the king of using this as yet another excuse to expand his social contacts, but it cannot be denied that most of the Americans were delighted by their treatment and treated the king with all the respect and ceremony anyone could desire."

The problem with the king's announcement, however, is that Constance Bennett, while of unclear religious affiliation, is a twice-divorced woman who is still legally married to her third husband, Henri de la Falaise. As the nominal head of the Church of England, which does not permit the divorced to remarry with a living former spouse, this is clearly unacceptable for the king... and already [Root.GetNameDef] and the remains of the Empire are tearing themselves apart over what this could mean."

Loyal citizens throughout the country reacted with joy, and newspapers ran headlines with a photo of King Edward and 'Queen' Constance embracing each other for the first time in public."

 entente_events.106.t: "The British Exiles Intervene"
 entente_events.106.d: "Despite the in-fighting within the king's exiled Government, it still holds a great deal of sway in [Root.GetNameDef]. With the vote on the abdication about to arrive, and the Exiles foreseeing an international headache should Edward be forced to step down, they have called in every favour they possessed and forced the [Root.GetAdjective] government to accede to the royal engagement... regardless of the opinion of the public or the Empire. A special decree for clemency has been issued by the Church of England, offering clemency for Constance Bennett when and if the wedding takes place. The public is ill at ease with this result, and newspapers across the country have declared that it renders the monarchy itself illegitimate."
 entente_events.106.a: "But Edward is still the king, yes?"

 entente_events.107.t: "The Question of Abdication"
 entente_events.107.d: "The question of King Edward's abdication has come to a fore. Seeing as the king refuses to abandon his engagement under any circumstances, the [Root.GetAdjective] government must now decide: should he be forced to abdicate the throne? Edward has indicated his willingness to step down, if the government should force his hand, though he says he will do so regretfully... and with great concern for the Empire's well-being. Others are less concerned about the fate of the Empire, though the king does still have supporters throughout the country declaring their ardent support for the king in his time of crisis."
 entente_events.107.a: "For the good of the Empire, he must abdicate"

 entente_events.108.d.george: "With Edward stepping down from the throne, now the question of who will succeed him has arisen. The logical choice would be Prince Albert - he is the eldest heir and favourite of the late King George, though there is concern regarding both his health and his profound lack of social ability. Is he the right choice to lead the Empire? With normal succession already thrown out the window, it would be possible for another prince to be chosen. Prince Henry is considered a biddable man, and has military experience that would be of great use. Prince George, meanwhile, is the youngest but is charismatic - and already has a son, to ensure a future king to follow him."

 entente_events.110.d: "After the announcement by King Edward VIII of his engagement to American film star, Constance Bennett - a woman not only twice-divorced, but currently still married to French director Henri de la Falaise - the [From.GetAdjective] government was thrown into a tailspin. King Edward is the nominal head of the Church of England, an institution which does not permit a divorcee to remarry, and thus the scandal of such a marriage was too much for many. Even so, the king's popularity in the Empire has won the day. A radio plea made by the king to the public prompted a series of demonstrations which eventually encouraged the government to abandon any notion of Edward's abdication."

Twice-divorced and currently still married, Bennett was seen as unsuitable for a king who is also the head of the Church of England, which does not permit divorcees to remarry, and Edward was unwilling to give her up for any reason.\n\nPrince Albert, viewed by many as a quiet and socially awkward man, is set to be coronated as King Albert I, inheriting the rule over a British Empire that is vastly different from that of his grandfather's."

It will undoubtebly take years for the Royal Navy to rebuild to her former pre-revolution levels. As the dockyards in the home isles are busy rebuilding the British fleet, the Canadians have reached out with the possibility of leasing dockyards from us. Despite large gains in shipbuilding capacity developed during the exile, our shipyards can still far outpace their Canadian counterparts. If we agree to lease the Brooklyn Yard to the Canadians, they are offering us support in rebuilding the nation."

In exchange for leasing of the Brooklyn Naval Yard, they will contribute funding and other resource to help us rebuild the wartorn nation. If the Canadians and the British Exiles are to reconquer the United Kingdom they will need a strong navy; one that our shipyards could produce. This could also pave the way towards future cooperation between our two nations in shipbuilding. Our assistance in building ships to take part in the Homecoming would earn us much gratitude from our neighbours to the north."

 entente_events.280.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees To Lease Brooklyn Yard"
 entente_events.280.d: "Since 1801, the Brooklyn Naval Yard has served the interests of the American Navy by providing it with modern shipyards, facilities, drydocks - to build and refine some of the largest and most powerful warships of the American fleet. In the years before the Great War, the Brooklyn Naval Yard helped facilitate the construction of the Connecticut-class battleships although the workforce of the naval yard dropped significantly as a result of the Great Depression.\n\nDuring the Second American Civil War, the borough of Brooklyn became the battleground for some of the most intense and fierce fighting of the war. When [FROM.GetNameDef] asserted their full control over the city of New York, the Brooklyn Naval Yard was eventually rebuilt and refurbished (despite extensive war-time damage) to fulfil their naval capacities. Due to the necessity of maintaining the Royal Navy, our government has approached [FROM.GetNameDef] about their willingness to lease the dockyard. It appears that our persuasion and arguments have borne fruit since they have expressed their willingness to lease the Brooklyn Naval Yard for the time being in order to allow us to expand our naval power."

 entente_events.281.d: "Since 1801, the Brooklyn Naval Yard has served the interests of the American Navy by providing it with modern shipyards, facilities, drydocks - to build and refine some of the largest and most powerful warships of the American fleet.

Due to the necessity of maintaining the Royal Navy, our government has approached [FROM.GetNameDef] about their willingness to lease the dockyard. Unfortunately, our offer has been turned down. The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has cited their own necessary purposes for their dockyard and have also sternly reminded our government, that despite the contribution we provided them in the American Civil War, they are unwilling to provide American land for our utilisation. Accordingly, we will have to continue developing our own naval capabilities on our own soil."
 entente_events.281.a: "Unfortunate!"

 #ACW - CAN ends lease
 entente_events.282.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Brooklyn Yard"
 entente_events.282.d: "With their conflict overseas over, the Canadian Government has formally approached us today regarding the status of the Brooklyn Naval Yard. They are extremely thankful for the aid that we have provided them in allowing us to utilise the naval facilities for their own construction purposes and are most of all, thankful that the labour pool drawn to aid them came from the American nation. However, with their conflict now over, they no longer have any purpose in maintaining control of the naval yard. In the spirit of our strong alliance, they have formally ended their lease to the Brooklyn Naval Yard, returning this valuable dockyard of liberty to the American nation."
 entente_events.282.a: "A debt repaid!"

 #CAN - ACW ends lease
 entente_events.283.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Recquistions The Brooklyn Yard"
 entente_events.283.d: "A message came from the American government today that our lease to the Brooklyn Naval Yard has now been terminated. This comes as a result of [FROM.GetNameDef]'s' current state of war requiring that all of their naval facilities be utilised to their utmost potential in order to facilitate mass construction of warships, submarines, and aircraft carriers in the newly revived American navy. As such, while they value our friendship and alliance, they have cited that their current efforts require that our lease be terminated as they need all hands on deck for their coming storm. While this is regretful to hear, we wish them the best of luck in their endeavors and will do what we can to aid them in their conflict."

 CAN_create_naval_research_group: "Create Joint Naval Programme"
 entente_events.284.t: "Joint Naval Programme Created"
 entente_events.284.d: "Both the United States Navy and the Royal Navy are distinguishable in their long-standing naval histories and experience throughout the world. The Royal Navy has always been the premier world navy especially in regards to maintaining control and protection of the former British Empire. When the British Revolution occurred, most of the experienced naval commanders of the former United Kingdom managed to flee to Canada with a large portion of their former fleet. Since then, they have maintained the quality and tradition of the Royal Navy - making them worthy heirs of the United Kingdom's former navy.\n\nThe United States Navy has long been the darling of its armed forces. First established in the American Revolutionary War, it has remained one of the largest and modern parts of the American Armed Forces up until the Second American Civil War. Most of the naval commanders from [FROM.GetNameDef] earned invaluable experience fighting on the high seas or partaking in blockade operations during the civil war.\n\nIn order to strengthen the bonds between our two countries and to modernise both countries' respective fleets, the Canadian Government and [FROM.GetNameDef] have agreed to create a new naval think tank. This collaboration seeks to not only modernise the navies of the Entente but also to share ideas on how to develop new ships and tactics with the advice from our engineers and shipbuilders. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible and ensure the freedom and liberty of the seas."
 entente_events.284.a: "Together for victory!"

 entente_events.300.t: "Cooperation with the Entente?"
 entente_events.300.d: "Many of our military experts believe our war against the Third Internationale will be a difficult one to win without some additional force applying pressure to the syndicalists. Fortunately, the experts in [From.GetNameDef] appear to agree. They have suggested that we meet with leaders from the [From.GetFactionName], now that they are also at war with [FRA.GetNameDef], and discuss the possibility we might work together. An alliance is out of the question, of course. What is the question is how much their cooperation is worth, considering they must fight the syndicalists anyhow."
 entente_events.300.a: "Let us meet - we'll help them however we can"
 entente_events.300.b: "We don't need their help"

 entente_events.301.t: "Germany Refuses to Talk"
 entente_events.301.d: "The Germans apparently believe they don't need our help, or they think talking is worth little since we have to fight the syndicalists anyhow. Whatever the reason, they have declined to meet with us to discuss cooperation. The idea is done before it began."
 entente_events.301.a: "Ah well"

 entente_events.302.t: "Germany Agrees to Talk"
 entente_events.302.d: "Apparently the [From.GetAdjective] government believes as we do: cooperation between those with mutual enemies could prove beneficial. They will meet with us and fellow Entente leaders in [CAN.GetConferenceLocation] in one week's time."
 entente_events.302.a: "Excellent"

 entente_events.303.t: "The Entente and Reichspakt to Meet"
 entente_events.303.d: "With both the Entente and the Reichspakt now at war with the Third Internationale, [ENT.GetNameDef] has called for a conference between their leaders in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] in order to discuss the possibility of cooperation... and [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed. While it is currently unclear how far such 'cooperation' would go, it seems worth the attempt. A representative from [This.GetNameDef] has been asked to attend."
 entente_events.303.a: "We'll be there!"

 entente_events.304.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference"
 entente_events.304.d: "Leaders from the Entente and the Reichspakt gathered in [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] today in order to discuss the possibility of cooperation in the war against the Third Internationale. What this cooperation would consist of was not difficult to ascertain: military and naval access between all members, but - more importantly, for the Entente - the willingness on the part of the Reichspakt to stay out of both France and Great Britain once the war is done. This would allow for a swift return to Europe for the French and British exile governments, the ultimate goal of both, but now a single question hangs over the conference: would [GER.GetNameDef] even agree to such terms, and if so what would they ask in return?"
 entente_events.304.a: "That's an excellent question"

 entente_events.305.t: "Our Demands"
 entente_events.305.d: "Staying out of both France and Great Britain in the peace conference following our future victory would mean [GER.GetNameDef] walking away from a long and costly war with little to show for it - and possibly two restored neighbours who we have vanquished previously and who have no reason to be fond of us. We cannot rely on their gratitude... so do we even consider the idea? What do we ask for in return?"
 entente_events.305.t.return: "Do We Demand More?"
 entente_events.305.d.return: "We have made it this far in the negotiations. Do we demand more concessions from the Entente, or have we reached a successful conclusion to the treaty?"
 entente_events.305.a: "The French must publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine"
 entente_events.305.b: "After they return to Paris, the French must join Mitteleuropa"
 entente_events.305.c: "They must recognise their former colonies in Africa and Asia as ours"
 entente_events.305.e: "The British must renounce their claim to Northern Ireland"
 entente_events.305.f: "Let us proceed to the treaty"
 entente_events.305.g: "This discussion is pointless - we will never cooperate"

 entente_events.306.t: "The Conference Goes Nowhere"
 entente_events.306.d: "It appears it was barely worth the delegates even coming to [ENT.GetConferenceLocation]. While the Germans initially appeared willing to talk, the idea of completely staying out of both France and Great Britain didn't appeal. They claimed they would come out of a long and costly war with nothing to show for it, and none of the delegates could convince them anything the Entente would part with would be worth their while. The delegates from the Reichspakt are already returning home, and the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference has been deemed an utter failure."
 entente_events.306.a: "They asked for too much!"
 entente_events.306.b: "What a waste of time"

 entente_events.307.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Alsace-Lorraine"
 entente_events.307.d: "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their cooperation: that our government publicly renounce all future claims to Alsace-Lorraine. It's no surprise, really, and while there's nothing to stop us from re-claiming it after the war is done it will certainly appear like an illegitimate act. Our allies might not even support us in such an endeavour. Or perhaps the Germans just wish us to humiliate ourselves, to renounce something everyone knows is ours, for cooperation they probably need as much as we do."
 entente_events.307.a: "We will never renounce Alsace-Lorraine!"
 entente_events.307.b: "Very well, we agree"

 entente_events.308.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente_events.308.d: "Unsurprisingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegate has refused to give up their claim to Alsace-Lorraine - not even for the help they desperately need to return to the continent. They are too proud to give up a claim to something they cannot possibly hope to recover."
 entente_events.308.a: "That's it for the conference, then"
 entente_events.308.b: "We'll put this demand aside, for now"

 entente_events.309.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Alsace-Lorraine"
 entente_events.309.d: "Shockingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegates have agreed - after much discussion with the Germans - to publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine... if the Germans agree to the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference's treaty of cooperation. Considering the humiliation involved for the French to do so, it speaks much of how much they believe the treaty will help their return to the continent."
 entente_events.309.a: "That is a relief"
 entente_events.309.b: "A sweet admission on their part"
 entente_events.309.c: "We have little choice"
 entente_events.309.e: "How unexpected"
 entente_events.309.f: "For the sake of Frenchmen elsewhere, we must..."

 entente_events.310.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Mitteleuropa"
 entente_events.310.d: "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their cooperation: once we have returned to Paris, we will join Mitteleuropa - the German economic union. No doubt they wish to ensure they economically dominate us as we rebuild the country... though rebuilding would also go much more quickly with their assistance, it's true. Do we swallow this pill? It's not impossible that we could simply refuse once Paris is ours, though there will undoubtedly be consequences for doing so."
 entente_events.310.a: "No, we will not surrender our independence"
 entente_events.310.b: "Very well, we agree"

 entente_events.311.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente_events.311.d: "It seems the French will not even accept an offered hand of assistance, believing that membership in Mitteleuropa would allow us to economically dominate their country. And they are correct, of course. Surely they did not think we'd allow France to restore itself without us having some kind of control? Now we must ask ourselves whether this is worth ending the conference over."
 entente_events.311.a: "It certainly is!"
 entente_events.311.b: "No, we must press forward"

 entente_events.312.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join Mitteleuropa"
 entente_events.312.d: "The German delegation has demanded that [NFA.GetNameDef] agree to join Mitteleuropa, the German economic union, after Paris has been regained. Most present at the conference believe the Germans intend to have some form of economic control over the French as they rebuild their country, but possibly their offer is benign. Whatever the motivation, the French delegation have agreed: when the time comes, they will join Mitteleuropa as requested."
 entente_events.312.a: "Ah, good"
 entente_events.312.b: "We'll believe it when we see it"
 entente_events.312.c: "How humiliating"
 entente_events.312.e: "Interesting"
 entente_events.312.f: "The unfortunate price for our homecoming..."

 entente_events.313.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Our Former Colonies"
 entente_events.313.d: "The German delegates at the conference have a demand: essentially, that the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia which Germany gained after the First Weltkrieg be recognised as theirs. It's a symbolic move, perhaps, but the Germans would like to forestall any attempts on our part to re-establish our old empires in those regions once our power is regained. That we would even be prepared to go to war for our far-flung colonies is hard to imagine, but - even so - the idea of abandoning them completely does sting."
 entente_events.313.a: "We will not abandon our colonies"
 entente_events.313.b: "They have already been lost"

 entente_events.314.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente_events.314.d: "Interestingly, even though the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia have been lost for decades, now, [From.GetNameDef] has still refused to let them go. They would be 'abandoning' their former charges, as they see it, and will not relinquish even their moral claim to their colonies. Now we must decide whether this is enough to end the conference over. It is not, after all, like their refusal to recognise our colonies means they are any less ours."
 entente_events.314.a: "Clearly they do not want cooperation enough"
 entente_events.314.b: "It was a minor matter - let's move on"

 entente_events.315.t: "German Colonies Recognised"
 entente_events.315.d: "The French and British colonies gained by the Germans since the First Weltkrieg have been a sticking point - some annexed, others occupied 'temporarily' due to the lack of what the Germans claimed was a competent government to administer them. Now the Germans have demanded the colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia be officially recognised as theirs, forestalling future efforts to see them restored, and the Entente has agreed. It's a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that could prevent a great deal of conflict in the future."
 entente_events.315.a: "It will be worth it"
 entente_events.315.b: "Good"
 entente_events.315.c: "Just get us to Paris"
 entente_events.315.e: "Interesting"

 entente_events.316.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Northern Ireland"
 entente_events.316.d: "The German delegates have done something unexpected: after discussion with their Irish allies, they have presented a demand from us - the British government must renounce future claims to Northern Ireland. It is no small thing, effectively annulling the Acts of Union and breaking apart the United Kingdom once and for all. Considering the Irish were never planning on relinquishing the land without a war, perhaps it is best that the question be settled now."
 entente_events.316.a: "We won't be forced into this, not by Germany"
 entente_events.316.b: "So be it, we agree"

 entente_events.317.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 entente_events.317.d: "The British government has refused to give on the matter of Northern Ireland. Annulling the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, they say, is too large a matter to be decided here and now - the British delegates question whether they even have the authority to make such a promise. The Irish delegates are, of course, infuriated."
 entente_events.317.a: "Too bad, we're done"
 entente_events.317.b: "We won't end this for Ireland's sake"

 entente_events.318.t: "The British Renounce Northern Ireland"
 entente_events.318.d: "Today has caused much uproar at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: the German delegates, acting on behalf of their Irish allies, have demanded that the British renounce all claims to Northern Ireland. Even so it would annul the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, the British delegates have agreed to do so. They do not wish to war with the Irish, of all people, and while they have said the matter should in the end rest with the citizens of Northern Ireland themselves, they will not personally press British claims."
 entente_events.318.a: "It had to be done"
 entente_events.318.b: "I cannot believe they agreed to that"
 entente_events.318.c: "Hah! I bet they renege!"
 entente_events.318.e: "A difficult choice"
 entente_events.318.f: "Astounding!"

 entente_events.319.t: "Reichspakt and Entente Will Cooperate"
 entente_events.319.d: "After meeting in a conference in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation], representatives from the Entente and the Reichspakt have worked out a deal to cooperate in their war against the Third Internationale. The main terms of the deal involve both sides having military and naval access to the other, but - more importantly - [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed that, once the syndicalists have been beaten, they will take no territory in France or Great Britain and thus allow both the French and British exiled governments a swift return to Europe.\n\nSources at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference say that the Germans elicited a host of promises from Entente leaders, though it remains to be seen whether - once the war is done, should they prove victorious - either side ultimately intends to keep them."

 entente_events.319.b: "This will make things easier"
 entente_events.319.c: "There is hope, after all"

The loss of Australia and New Zealand has shattered the Entente's grip in the Asia-Pacific region, leaving few viable bases for them to hold out. With fewer and fewer options as the months go by, the diplomatic corps has suggested that the Entente may be willing to accept peace. This would allow us to establish legitimate governments in their former colonies and allow Pacific trade to flow again."
 entente_events.347.a: "Let's get [ENT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] on the line!"
 entente_events.347.b: "No, we will continue the war!"

 entente_events.348.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Peace"
 entente_events.348.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has driven us out of the Pacific and it remains clear that we will not be able to reclaim our foothold in the region without significant effort. Many in our government question whether that is possible, and with the [FROM.GetAdjective] government offering peace, now may be the best time for our government to save face."
 entente_events.348.a: "Very well, we accept"
 entente_events.348.b: "We fight on!"

 entente_events.349.t: "[ENT.GetNameDefCap] accepts our peace offer!"
 entente_events.349.d: "With Pacific firmly in our control and the prospects of an Entente counter-invasion increasingly unlikely, the [ENT.GetAdjective]s have accepted our offer for peace. They will cede their holdings in the East and recognise our authority over their former colonies. The days of foreign imperialism over the Pacific are coming to end!"
 entente_events.349.a: "Excellent."

 entente_events.350.t: "[ENT.GetNameDefCap] rejects our peace offer!"
 entente_events.350.d: "Despite our control over the Pacific, the [ENT.GetAdjective]s have definitively rejected our peace offer. They believe they can retake control of their former strongholds and maintain their hegemony over the Pacific. We must gird ourselves for a longer fight and finish this war for the freedom of the Pacific!"
 entente_events.350.a: "Very well."

 entente_events.351.t: "[FROM.FROM.GetNameDefCap] Signs Peace with the Entente"
 entente_events.351.d: "The war that has raged across the Pacific for months between the crumbling British Empire and their [ENT.GetFactionName] allies and the upstart [FROM.FROM.GetName] has ended in a conclusive British defeat. In brilliantly conducted coordinated naval and air invasions, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] - humiliated just a few decades ago by former allies and enemies alike - have successfully driven the forces of the worldwide Entente alliance from the Pacific basin. The battered losers, reeling from their defeat, must place their hope entirely on the reconquest of Europe, but in diplomatic centres of power it is already commonplace to remark that the sun has finally set on the British Empire."
 entente_events.351.a: "Western Imperialism has been defeated."
 entente_events.351.b: "We suffer yet another defeat..."
 entente_events.351.c: "A grave defeat."
 entente_events.351.e: "The Entente is crumbling!"

 entente_events.352.t: "Albert's Impediment"
 entente_events.352.d: "It is no secret that Prince Albert, the Duke of York, has troubles. Born on a sad day for the Royal Family, and seemingly under a bad sign, Albert has always lived in the shadow of his brother Edward. It is an unavoidable fact however that the intense pressures upon the exiles, and his brother's many shortcomings, mean Albert cannot afford to provide anything less than his total commitment.\n\nWhile he is rightly known for his diligence and humility, his history of illness, hatred of public speaking and infamous speech impediment have unfairly tainted his reputation as a leader. Nonetheless, having overcome adversity to serve his country admirably in the past, he is resolved to do all he can to serve his family and people in the hour of their greatest need.\n\nAfter yet another failed treatment plan, the royal couple are looking for specialist help once more. They must do so quietly however, lest they lose face to an apprehensive public.\n\nWhile their best chance for discretion is to continue seeking help from within the exile community and assemble a brain trust of ex-Harley Street types, perhaps a new perspective is warranted?\n\nThe University of Toronto has begun plans to refine and standardise the study of “Speech Therapy”. Not only are Canadian specialists the obvious alternative but it might also help to show the appreciation and respect we have for our hosts. However through his father's personal secretary, Albert has recently learned of an aspiring Australian actor and amateur elocutionist who has been making waves among the veteran communities of Ontario for his dedicated treatments. While his efforts seem noble, many of our more established experts dismiss him as a quack and an opportunist."
 entente_events.352.a: "We must not lose faith in our countrymen, assemble a brain trust."
 entente_events.352.b: "Let us see what progress our Canadian cousins have made."
 entente_events.352.c: "The establishment has failed us, send for this Australian chap, post-haste!"

 entente_events.353.t: "Rome Wasn't Built in a Day..."
 entente_events.353.d: "Nothing comes quickly in medicine, especially regarding something as complex as speech. After all, if the brain were so simple we could understand it, we would be so simple we couldn't.\n\nWhile the Duke is understandably irritated by this slow progress and is reluctant to continue, the appointed brain trust of exiled professionals are confident that a breakthrough will come in time. While they may not be the freshest or most up-to-date of specialists, they have a century of experience between them and, when they do all agree on a course of action, use only the best tried-and-tested efforts.\n\nHis Majesty's progress may be slow, but it could certainly be worse."
 entente_events.353.a: "Damn these old fools and their ridiculous marbles..."

 entente_events.354.t: "Lionel Logue"
 entente_events.354.d: "In the months that the Duke of York has been meeting with Mr Logue, he has found his guidance to be invaluable and has quickly taken to this eccentric “Speech Therapist” and his amateur dramatics. Though initially dismissed as a quack, his self-taught methods and superhuman patience have worked wonders and, what's more, the two have struck up a friendship.\n\nNot only have His Majesty's public speaking skills improved but so have his confidence and outlook. Already Lionel Logue has become a familiar presence at the royal household and he and his family even attended the royal family's christmas dinner. While Logue's pioneering methods have been essential in ensuring this good progress, it is the love and support of his wife Elizabeth and his family that have made it all possible.\n\nEven with the bleak situation faced by the British exiles, Albert is relieved to be making this personal progress and stands readier than ever to do his duty.\n\nAs Lionel requests another round of Shakespeare recitation and places headphones upon the Duke's head, Albert breathes deep..."
 entente_events.354.a: "Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York"
 entente_events.354.a.tt: "Should Albert find himself in a position of greater responsibility, he will be better prepared for the burdens of leadership."

 entente_events.355.t: "A Leaky Ship"
 entente_events.355.d: "While initially promising, the visits to the royals by specialists from the faculty of the University of Toronto did not go unnoticed. This was expected to some degree and while most Canadian and British journalists have been hesitant to publish any revealed details, American and French-language articles on the subject are easy to obtain.\n\nTo add insult to injury however, it appears that a doctoral student of an assisting psychologist has given information to the press detailing Albert's struggles with speech and even some references to his childhood!\n\nTogether with Edward's controversial outspokenness and rumours of George's debauched lifestyle, this has severely damaged the royal tradition of aloof, restrained leadership.\n\nWhile the head of the department has given his deepest apologies, and the student has been appropriately disciplined, Albert and his staff are uncomfortable at the prospect of continuing their relationship with the university. For now it seems he and the Duchess of York are back to square one..."
 entente_events.355.a: "It takes a year to build a university, it takes 100 to build a tradition..."

 entente_events.356.t: "Ready to Lead"
 entente_events.356.d: "Bertie Windsor, who has endured so much trouble in his life and was never expected to wield much responsibility, is now the moral leader, symbol and guardian for millions of people. While many is the time he dreaded being in such a position, and ever-present is his hatred of public speaking, he is emboldened by the invaluable therapy of Lionel Logue, the love and support of his family, and his own stubborn determination to do the best he can."
 entente_events.356.a: "England expects that every man will do his duty."
