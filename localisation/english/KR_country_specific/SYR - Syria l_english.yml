### Pre-rework portraits not in the parties listed above

# Nazik al-Abid
# Female Syrian called 'Joan of Arc of the Arabs' who fought for emancipation and joined the Syrian army. The hell am I supposed to do with her? She's a nobody with 1 policy she fights for. Even a minister slot is too much for her.

# Sabri Al-Asali
# A member of the National Bloc with little relevance until the late 50ies when he pushed for the Nasserist cause in Syria and in part caused the UAR. He's not in the top brass of the National Bloc and played second fiddle to the more important Quwaitli who also has a portrait. I guess he's useful for an election event in the 50ies?

# Muhammad al-Ashmar
# Syrian Sheikh who was a commander in the Great Syrian Revolt and the Palestinian War. Islamist fundamentalist who opposed Shukri for being 'too liberal', for some miraculous reason became a communist later in life (likely just to protest the National Bloc) despite being against basically everything communism stands for. Euh? What slot is this guy supposed to be? Maybe has potential as a general but I honestly doubt it, not that we need any more of them either

# Michel Aflaq
# Founder of the Ba'ath movement who is completely irrelevant in KR since his formative years in France don't happen and he is far too young to take over a nation in 1940 (the Ba'ath was only created otl in 1940 with the first real succes being close to 1950). No use for him

# Ibrahim Hananu
# Leader of the Hananu Revolt in Northern Syria just after the proclamation of the Mandate. After being released from jail in 1925, he became a prominent member of the National Bloc. Died otl in 1935 of tuberculosis. He could theoretically be given a sip from the Fountain of Youth and form the front of the Aleppan wing of the National Bloc...?

# Sultan al-Atrash
# Leader of the Jabal al-Druze and the Druze people living there. Didn't want any position in the Syrian government despite being offered and had as sole goal a Syria free from foreign tutelage in which the Jabal al-Druze was a de facto independent region. He would work together with al-Jazairi and al-Nashashibi but has no ambition to become HoS of Syria. Only use is perhaps as general?

### Coups ###
# Anti-Egyptian nations will support al-Za'im (IRQ, OTT, PER)
# Pro-Egyptian nations or nations that are pursuing Arab unification will support the National Bloc if Syria is democratic and Hinawi if not democratic (EGY, IRQ, HEJ)
# Iraqi socdems will support al-Za'im and al-Hourani (but withdraw this support when it becomes apparent they are a bunch of corrupt twats) (IRQ)
# If Syria is democratic, Iraq will support the Aleppan People's Party (IRQ)
# Adib Shishakli will take over with the SSNP if the nation fails to stabilise after a regime change. They could potentially receive support from Saudi Arabia but this isn't guaranteed
# The Internationale can either work together with al-Za'im if he goes after the pro-German officers or depose him through Hinawi (FRA, ENG)
# The Reichspakt can either work together with al-Za'im if he goes after the pro-German officers or depose him through Hinawi (GER)

### Focuses ###
 syria_focus: "Syria Focus Tree"

# Maintain the Status Quo #
 SYR_status_quo: "Maintain the Status Quo"
 SYR_status_quo_desc: "For as long as we can remember, the region of Syria has been ruled by its cities and their powerful families. These families, taking up the key positions in both the bureaucratic and religious hierarchy serve as the patrons for those less fortuned and form the core of the Syrian tapestry. European mass politics, aimed at giving direct representation to the people is downright hurtful to the Syrians and is likely to make us all prey for rabid marxists, religious extremists or jingoist brutes."
 SYR_egypt_cooperation: "Syrian - Egyptian Cooperation"
 SYR_egypt_cooperation_desc: "Without the help of Egypt, we would have no free Syria to call our home. It is only right that we continue our strong relations with them and work together towards a brighter and more prosperous future!"
 SYR_ban_parties: "Ban Political Parties"
 SYR_ban_parties_desc: "Political parties are only a burden on the Syrian people. If we wish to be a strong and successful Arab state, it is time we disband these troubling factions."
 SYR_military_directorate: "Found the Military Intelligence Directorate"
 SYR_military_directorate_desc: "Expanding our military's intelligence operations will allow us to better infiltrate and destroy the rebellious factions in our nation."
 SYR_suez_damscus_rail: "Suez - Damascus Railroad"
 SYR_suez_damscus_rail_desc: "Our increasing ties with Egypt have nowhere as much been felt as in the economy. Where Syria was once fully oriented towards the North and the Mediterranean, trade connections and Egyptian influence in the state monopolies have brought great change. To further strengthen their position, the Egyptians are now pushing for an expansion of the rail and road connections between our economic heartland and the Suez Canal."
 SYR_integrate_military: "Integrate Military Command"
 SYR_integrate_military_desc: "The Egyptian military command's intelligence and skill during the war of independence has not gone unnoticed, it is thanks to their actions that we were able to achieve freedom from the Turks. With our alliances with Egypt growing ever stronger, it is necessary that we merge our two military commands in the region."
 SYR_end_land_reform: "Abolish Ottoman Land Reform"
 SYR_end_land_reform_desc: "When the Ottoman land reforms of the late 19th century were introduced in Syria, their primary aim was to weaken the influence of a quasi feudal class of landowners and pull power away from the influential Arab families to a centralising state. Scions of these families, it is our duty and promise to revert these changes and prevent further damage from being done to the state of Syria."
 SYR_undercut_aleppan: "Undercut Aleppan Influence"
 SYR_undercut_aleppan_desc: "While Damascus is undoubtedly the principle urban centre of Syria, it faces significant competition from Aleppo and Northern Syria as a whole. We must take steps to limit the influence this region can hold over our politics through encouraging the growth of the economy of Syria."
 SYR_destroy_mudafa: "Destroy the Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri"
 SYR_destroy_mudafa_desc: "The terrorists of the Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri represent a fundamental danger to our state, steps must be taken quickly and effectively in order to eliminate them once and for all."
 SYR_sunni_dominance: "Uphold Sunni Dominance"
 SYR_sunni_dominance_desc: "While many different groups make up Syria, to deny that the Sunni population make up the largest bloc would be foolish. While some may accuse of discrimination towards the minorities of our state, really we are simply recognising the reality that Syria is a Sunni nation."
 SYR_abolish_mt_lebanon: "Abolish the Mt Lebanon Autonomous Region"
 SYR_abolish_mt_lebanon_desc: "While the various militia groups of Lebanon served an important role during the war, they have slowly shown themselves to be more concerned with protecting their own backyard rather than Syria as a whole. Given they have shown their true colours, there is no need to continue tolerating the slight to our national integrity their autonomous region represents."
 SYR_jewish_land: "End Jewish Land Acquisitions"
 SYR_jewish_land_desc: "The influx of Jewish individuals to our cities may have brought prosperity, but it also adds to the already disgruntled pot of minorities in Syria. In order to stop this process in its tracks, we will place tight restrictions on the acquisition of further land by Jewish individuals."
 SYR_sewcure_alawyin_mountains: "Secure the Alawiyin Mountains"
 SYR_sewcure_alawyin_mountains_desc: "The terrain of the Alawiyin Mountains allow it to become a breeding ground of Alawite unrest. As long as these areas are allowed to be a rats nest, we can never hope to end those who rebel against our rule."
 SYR_expand_harbours: "Expand the Haifa & Tripoli Harbours"
 SYR_expand_harbours_desc: "The ports in Haifa and Tripoli, while seeing growth over the past few years, still have a lot of potential for further growth. By expanding the port facilities further, they have the potential to become major entrepôts in the eastern Mediterranean."
 SYR_contest_al_jazziris: "Contest the al-Jazairis"
 SYR_contest_al_jazziris_desc: "The reputation wielded by the al-Jazairis is increasingly becoming less of an annoyance and more of an inconvenience, robbing us of support in the Damascus area. We must use any means we can, from tormenting their events to investment in areas loyal to them in order to win their base to our side."
 SYR_centralise_authority: "Centralise Damascene Authority"
 SYR_centralise_authority_desc: "The decentralist ideas professed by some will only lead to inefficiencies, it shall be through concentrating political, economic and social power that we will be able to rise to greatness. While our policies are beginning to bring this to fruition, we must create a unitary constitution in order to cement this structure once and for all."
 SYR_hawran_secured: "Secure the Hawran"
 SYR_hawran_secured_desc: "The Hawran, with its agricultural output will be vital to securing our new state. Through the appointment of administrators loyal to Damascus we can make sure that the region does not get any notions and remains a tool for us to wield."
 SYR_hama_damascus_axis: "Develop the Hama-Damascus Axis"
 SYR_hama_damascus_axis_desc: "Thanks to our policies, the region between the cities of Hama and Damascus is fast becoming the centre of the Syrian state, a core which is loyal to us. Through developing this region further we will entirely eliminate the possibility that other regions could compete with what is becoming known as the 'Damascus-Hama Axis'."
 SYR_cooperate_with_nasha: "Cooperate with the al-Nashashibis"
 SYR_cooperate_with_nasha_desc: "It is foolish to try to compete with the al-Nashashibis in Jerusalem, and we do not really have any interest in trying such a task. We will instead come to an understanding with the Al-Nashashibis and win them over to our side, making promises to them in exchange for support."
 SYR_palestnian_railroad: "Eastern Palestinian Railroad Initiative"
 SYR_palestnian_railroad_desc: "In order to further transportation east of Jerusalem, we will work on creating a Railroad in Eastern Palestine. This will aim to connect Amman and other cities to the rest of Syria, providing the twin benefits of encouraging economic growth and further centralising the nation on Damascus."

# A republic of Equals #
 SYR_republic_of_equals: "A Republic of Equals"
 SYR_republic_of_equals_desc: "Syria is a diverse place, and while Arabs control the majority ethnicity, they are not the only ones. Kurds, Turks, Alawites and more all fall under the Syrian banner. By working together, we will be able to achieve a strong republic of equals."
 SYR_1940_census: "The [GetYear] Syrian Census"
 SYR_1940_census_desc: "With our lands consolidated, it is absolutely vital that we conduct a large census of all Syrian lands to better understand the regions of our ethnic minorities."
 SYR_palestinian_round_table: "The Palestinian Round Table Conference"
 SYR_palestinian_round_table_desc: "As a region which has seen increasing conflict in recent years, Palestine is undoubtedly an area in which we must tread carefully. As part of this we shall establish a broad assembly of representatives from the region to come up with an agreement that guarantees future peace in the region."
 SYR_jewish_investment: "Encourage Jewish Investment"
 SYR_jewish_investment_desc: "The Jewish community in the Levant has only grown in recent times, and while it can be convenient for some to discriminate against them, we believe this policy is short sighted. By making our position in favour of Jewish investment in Syria, we will be able to bring some much needed capital into the country."
 SYR_restore_mt_lebanon: "Restore the Mt Lebanon Autonomous Region"
 SYR_restore_mt_lebanon_desc: "The region around Mt. Lebanon is too diverse to simply be subsumed into our nation, we must restore the autonomous region in order to allow the regional minorities to coexist."
 SYR_alawite_region: "Create the Alawite Autonomous Region"
 SYR_alawite_region_desc: "The mountainous areas inhabited by our Alawite citizens will never be tamed by the sword, but perhaps through the granting of Autonomy we can show them we understand their wish to protect themselves and their traditions."
 SYR_kurdish_region: "Create the Kurdish Autonomous Region"
 SYR_kurdish_region_desc: "Split between different nations, Syria's Kurdish community will always feel a degree of reluctance to be part of our nation, feeling themselves a separate group. By providing them with their own autonomous region we can acknowledge how we are united in our diversity, while also conveniently ending the conflict."
 SYR_druze_region: "Create the Druze Autonomous Region"
 SYR_druze_region_desc: "Our Druze population, while small, shall not be forgotten, we shall provide them with their own autonomous region in order to prevent discrimination and violence being committed on them again."
 SYR_syrian_federation: "Proclaim the Syrian Federation"
 SYR_syrian_federation_desc: "With the groundwork laid, it is time to cement our new federal system once and for all and draft a constitution proclaiming us the Syrian Federation. We will show that it is not our differences that divide us, but instead bring us together."
 SYR_national_pact: "The National Pact Compromise"
 SYR_national_pact_desc: "It is pointless to claim that we represent the interests of all minorities if we do not adequately represent them in governance. While it may seem artificial, and many will argue damages to our claims to meritocracy, equal representation is more important."
 SYR_adana_voting: "The Adana Plebiscite"
 SYR_adana_voting_desc: "While we may try to defeat the Turkish rebels through force, the fact is that every insurgent we kill is a martyr, and brings ten more to their cause. We must cut our losses while we're ahead and concede to a referendum on the future of our northern territories. Hopefully this may allow us to save face."
 SYR_maintain_sunni_dominance: "Maintain Sunni Dominance"
 SYR_maintain_sunni_dominance_desc: "While we undoubtedly wish to give our minorities the freedom they deserve, we shouldn't begin promoting people based on nothing more than the circumstances of their birth. While it may be that almost all positions of power are held by a Sunni, perhaps that is because we only choose the most qualified individuals?"
 SYR_decentralized_development: "Decentralised Development Scheme"
 SYR_decentralized_development_desc: "Syria faces a problem of being both poorly developed and unequally developed. In order to kill two birds with the same stone as it were, we will begin encouraging development across our nation, rather than concentrated in our cities. While they say a rising tide lifts all boats, it doesn't hurt to do a bit of the carrying ourselves."
 SYR_syrian_agri_bank: "The Syrian Agricultural Bank"
 SYR_syrian_agri_bank_desc: "Banking is not the most developed in Syria, particularly for our rural citizens. In order to allow for access to capital in these areas, we will encourage the growth of agricultural banks which will provide loans to farmers seeking to improve their output."
 SYR_support_hawran: "Support the Hawran"
 SYR_support_hawran_desc: "The Hawran is a vital part of our nation's agricultural sector. We must encourage the prosperity of this region to provide food for the rest of the country."
 SYR_redistribute_state_land: "Redistribute State Land"
 SYR_redistribute_state_land_desc: "Many of our farmers live on the margin of poverty, and while this situation will be difficult to solve we can resolve this situation we can make a start by handing our parcels of state land to the most desperate in the country."
 SYR_ghab_project: "The Ghab Project"
 SYR_ghab_project_desc: "Hydroelectric power has the potential to provide almost limitless electricity for thousands of people. While the initial investment will be costly, the access to electricity will provide us countless social and economic benefits, placing us among the modern nations of the world."

# An Army with a State
 SYR_army_with_a_state: "An Army with a State"

 SYR_chief_agency_desc: "In order to safeguard our state, we must establish a board tasked with the preservation of state secrets and the monitoring of dangerous elements."
 SYR_restore_democracy: "Restore Parliamentarian Democracy"
 SYR_restore_democracy_desc: "Whether it was due to pushing the military too far, a personal rivalry or possibly even a genuine belief in democracy, factions within the armed forces have begun making moves against the new regime. In backrooms, plans are being made and connections are being made, ready to spring into action when the time is right."
 SYR_replace_civilian_admin: "Replace the Civilian Administration"
 SYR_replace_civilian_admin_desc: "The incompetence of civilian officials cannot be allowed to continue, going forward we shall entrench military discipline and structures into the government of the state. The Syrian state of the future will be one that does not bow to the whims of bureaucrats."
 SYR_revise_constitution: "Revise the Syrian Curriculum"
 SYR_revise_constitution_desc: "The culture of a nation is born in the youth, the beliefs and ideals the youth hold dear are the bedrock which the future will be built on.

 SYR_1940_conscription_law: "Enact the [GetYear] Conscription law"

 SYR_basic_principles: "Pursue the Basic Principles"
 SYR_basic_principles_desc: "The birth of the Syrian nation transformed the Levant, but that transformation has not gone far enough. We must forge a new system, a new society, one which can safeguard Syria until the end of time."
 SYR_mandatory_education: "Enact Mandatory Education"
 SYR_mandatory_education_desc: "The ignorance of our people is an embarrassment, and if this error is not rectified will continue to hold us back for decades to come. And if we do not take a firm hand in teaching our citizens what is right and what is wrong, their ignorance will be manipulated by syndicalist book societies and other destructive elements."
 SYR_fight_darkness: "Fight the 'Forces of Darkness'"
 SYR_fight_darkness_desc: "The petty divides of religious doctrine and belief only undermine and weaken us, there is no Muslim, Jew or Christian, there is only Syrians. We must fight the past, shine a light into the darkness. We will make them forget their past, to see what really matters."
 SYR_separate_church_state: "Separate Church and State"
 SYR_separate_church_state_desc: "Fire and Ice, Light and Dark, Church and State; two things which should never be fused together, for fear of the feeble offspring they create. You may pray in your home, but you must be a patriot in life. Every Syrian must know that the state must always come first, for without the state, they would have nothing."
 SYR_integrate_ssnp: "Integrate SSNP Paramilitaries"
 SYR_integrate_ssnp_desc: "While there is no doubting the bravery and capabilities of the army, their understanding and support of our principles is questionable. In order to resolve this misunderstanding we must begin integrating our paramilitaries as an official part of the Syrian military, in order for our principles to become as much a part of army understanding as drilling or strategy."
 SYR_syrian_assimilation: "Syrian Integration and Assimilation Programme"
 SYR_syrian_assimilation_desc: "The minorities of our nation are misguided, they do not yet understand that they are no different from us, separated only by artificial divisions than anything else. We must take determined steps to make them see the truth. While some may call it forceful, it is the amount of pressure needed to change hearts and minds."
 SYR_nationalize_the_economy: "Nationalise the Economy"
 SYR_nationalize_the_economy_desc: "The laissez faire beliefs which have traditionally governed economies leaves them open to being fickle and responding to broad whims, caught up in speculation and profit seeking.

 SYR_abolish_feudalism: "Abolish Feudalism"

 SYR_economic_planning_desc: "Our economic situation would be better managed through a central committee which can plan and control commerce and development for the nation."
 SYR_military_production: "Expand Military Production"

# Defend Syrian National Interests #
 SYR_defend_natural_syria: "The Defence of Natural Syria"
 SYR_defend_natural_syria_desc: "While pan-Arab ideals are nice, the reality on the ground is that this goal feels a long shot at best, and many are also reluctant to see our new independence simply be subsumed into a sprawling and likely conflicted Arab state. Ultimately we must make it clear what our position is, that we must safeguard what we have won, and that we are first and foremost a Syrian state."
 SYR_greater_syrian_nationalism: "Greater Syrian Nationalism"
 SYR_greater_syrian_nationalism_desc: "While we have achieved far more than most could have expected, there are still territories outside our control which are rightfully ours. While the great struggle for independence is over, a new struggle is about to begin, one to unite all Syrian territory once and for all."
 SYR_cypriot_claim: "The Cypriot Claim"
 SYR_cypriot_claim_desc: "The island of Cyprus may be on the edge of our Pan-Syrian goals, the island is a vital strategic point in the entire Eastern Mediterranean. For the first time in hundreds of years, this vital island is free from control from one of the regional hegemons, and therefore far less capable of resisting the vultures that now circle it. We have a duty to ourselves to capture the island, before somebody else does."
 SYR_reclaim_cillcia: "Reclaim Cilicia"
 SYR_reclaim_cillcia_desc: "The region of Cilicia has been snatched from us while we were weak, we have an obligation to undo this slight. We will have to remind the Turks who won the war, and ensure that this is a lesson that they do not forget."
 SYR_syria_assyria: "Unite Syria and Assyria"
 SYR_syria_assyria_desc: "Uniting the people's of natural Syria is the culmination of our goals uniting the fertile crescent and winning us a state which will not falter until the end of time. When our flag flies of Baghdad, we will be able to cement our new nation once and for all."
 SYR_international: "Cooperate with the International"
 SYR_international_desc: "More than any other international bloc, the Internationale represents the true liberation of all peoples, they are not the naked imperialists of Germany nor Egypt, seeking to further their own goals at the expense of us. While we don't want to become part of their syndicalist system, we can at least make it clear we are not opposed to them."
 SYR_phalanstere: "Join the Phalanstère International"
 SYR_phalanstere_desc: "The Phalanstère is the syndicalist academic community, sharing knowledge equally between its various members. By requesting to join the Phalanstère, we will put our academics and scientists in direct contract with global leaders in Paris and London."
 SYR_reichspakt: "Negotiate with the Reichspakt"
 SYR_reichspakt_desc: "Unlike the Egyptians, the Germans have very little interest in getting involved in the Levant for anything more than investment, by cooperating we would be able to get one of the most powerful military and economic alliances to support our development and defence."
 SYR_destroyers_forbases: "Destroyers for Bases"
 SYR_destroyers_forbases_desc: "While the Germans may not be interested in colonial expansion in the Levant, European powers are attracted to naval bases like ants to sugar. We can exploit this desire to our own benefit, asking for surplus German naval assets in return for providing them with basing rights."
 SYR_foreign_investors: "Encourage Foreign Investors"
 SYR_foreign_investors_desc: "While Syria is not known for being an economic centre of the world, there is a lot of growth potential in the reason, as well as a reasonable amount of resources. We must try to sell this image of our nation to foreign investors, and persuade them to invest much needed capital in the Syrian economy."
 SYR_cairo_pact: "Collaborate with the Cairo Pact"
 SYR_cairo_pact_desc: "The Cairo Pact is uniquely placed to understand our situation, being founded on a similar wish to bring an end to Ottoman hegemony over the Arabs. It would be foolish to align with anybody other than our fellow Arabs."
 SYR_cairo_damascus_line: "Refurbish the Cairo-Damascus Line"
 SYR_cairo_damascus_line_desc: "The railway link between Cairo and Damascus has fallen into disrepair due to the Ottoman-Egyptian conflict and a lack of investment, with the birth of our new partnership with the Egyptians, we can restore this important rail link as a testament to our friendship and a boon to our trade."
 SYR_defend_syrian_national_interests: "Defend Syrian National Interests"
 SYR_defend_syrian_national_interests_desc: "While we may wish to avoid conflict, the global situation is not so understanding to the wishes of individual nations, and the global struggles which affect the great powers inevitably come to affect us. We must choose a side and safeguard what we hold dear, lest we find ourselves alone and defenceless."
 SYR_pursue_neutrality: "Pursue Neutrality"
 SYR_pursue_neutrality_desc: "While they say neutrality is craven, in reality there is nothing more courageous. Unlike less self-assured nations we do not feel the need to tie our colours to anyone's mast save for our own. We will stand apart from the others, and if they should come to intrude upon us, we will remind us that neutrality is not a position of weakness."
 SYR_standard_small_arms: "Standardise Small Arms"
 SYR_standard_small_arms_desc: "With our armouries being filled with surplus weapons from the Ottomans and others, supplying our troops can sometimes give quartermasters severe headaches. In order to cut down on this logistical nightmare we will begin to standardise our equipment and supplies going forward."
 SYR_military_colleges: "Re-open the Military Academies"
 SYR_military_colleges_desc: "The importance of having a skilled officer corps cannot be understated, and while currently our officers are quite skilled, we must not allow this to deteriorate going forward. We will reopen the old Ottoman Military Academies to train the next generation of Syrian officers, who will hopefully lead their troops to future greatness."
 SYR_munution_factories: "Refurbish the Aleppan Munition Factories"
 SYR_munution_factories_desc: "The Munitions factories of Aleppo have fallen into some disrepair due to a lack of investment, and are beginning to look outdated in comparison to other arms factories. We shall make extensive investment in these facilities in order to ensure they remain relevant and equipped to supply the Syrian army of tomorrow."
 SYR_domestic_arms_production: "Domestic Arms Production"
 SYR_domestic_arms_production_desc: "While we currently rely on surplus equipment from other nations, in the future it would be far better for our security to rely on our own production, with the renovation of our Munitions factories we now have the facilities to self-sufficient production of weapons and munitions."
 SYR_lion_of_syria: "The Lion of Syria"
 SYR_lion_of_syria_desc: "While our nation has been constantly focused on development and industrial expansion, it is important to take a moment to look around and appreciate how far we have come. From a few ambitious desert rebels we now stand triumphant against all comers. The Lion of Syria roars, and the rest of the Levant, and the Mediterranean would do well to listen to it."
 SYR_hawk_of_qurash: "The Hawk of Quraish"
 SYR_hawk_of_qurash_desc: "Airpower will dictate the wars of the future, and as a young military we can avoid becoming entrenched in tradition and recognise this fact. We will be like hawks, soaring high over the ground, ready to strike those who are not as adequately prepared."
 SYR_phoncian_shipbuilding: "Expand Phoenician Shipbuilding"
 SYR_phoncian_shipbuilding_desc: "We are the heirs to the Phonecian legacy, and just like them we will always maintain a firm connection with the sea, a source of wealth and goods, we must make sure to remain experts in the maritime field in order to safeguard our trade and fishing rights."
 SYR_syrian_naval_academy: "Open the Syrian Naval Academy"
 SYR_syrian_naval_academy_desc: "While having the ships is nice, it is the quality of the sailors that matter far more. We shall create a naval academy in order to train future sailors to ply our seas and protect our interests."

# Leadership of the Arab Movement #
 SYR_arab_leadership: "Assume Leadership of the Arab Movement"
 SYR_arab_leadership_desc: "While others may claim the mantle, we must make it clear that we are the true leaders of the Pan-Arab movement, we are already a nation composed of many different peoples, something that makes us more prepared than others to form into such a federation. While this step will undoubtedly win us few friends, and make many enemies, we are ready."
 SYR_League_of_Arab_States: "Found the League of Arab States"
 SYR_League_of_Arab_States_desc: "The first step to unity will be bringing the various Arab states into a similar political, economic and social alliance. To facilitate this we will create the League of the Arab States to facilitate discussion and integration efforts."
 SYR_Economic_Social_Council: "Found the Economic and Social Council"
 SYR_Economic_Social_Council_desc: "The first step of our integration will be creating an economic and social council, this will focus on the elimination of trade barriers and ensuring integration does not leave the economically weaker states behind."
 SYR_Arab_Customs_Union: "The Arab Customs Union"
 SYR_Arab_Customs_Union_desc: "With trade barriers being progressively eroded, we will take these efforts a step further and create a common customs area between the member states. This will fully transform our economies into one common system."
 SYR_Joint_Defence_Council: "Found the Joint Defence Council"
 SYR_Joint_Defence_Council_desc: "The second area where cooperation is vital is in the area in defence. To begin this effort we will create a joint defence council which will foster military cooperation between the various member states."

 SYR_Arab_Parliament: "Found the Parliament for Arab Affairs"
 SYR_Arab_Parliament_desc: "With economic and military integration efforts well underway, it is time to begin what will likely be the most contentious phase, political integration. While expecting monarchies and republics to join as one overnight would be foolish, we can begin the process by creating a parliament for all Arabs to come and debate."
 SYR_Council_of_Transportation: "The Council of Transportation"
 SYR_Council_of_Transportation_desc: "While railways and roads cross the middle east, connecting the various cities more and more each day, there is no common structure to govern them, breeding inefficiencies and making the process of travel far more complicated than it needs to be. To rectify this issue we will create a council which will govern transport networks between the member states."
 SYR_Council_of_Justice: "The Council of Justice"
 SYR_Council_of_Justice_desc: "Between islamic, civic and even customary law in different parts of the middle east, it will be difficult to create a common judicial system. To work around this wide difference, a common justice council will be created, to apply fair and common justice across the member states of the League."
 SYR_Council_of_Social_Affairs: "The Council of Social Affairs"
 SYR_Council_of_Social_Affairs_desc: "While the future Arab state is traditionally seen as a union between the dominant groups of the member states, it is important to remember that the region is filled with many minorities, both cultural and religious. All of these groups have their own beliefs and social systems and it is important that the future federation respects that. We will create a council of social affairs to foster understanding and respect between our many groups."
 SYR_Arab_Federation: "Proclaim the Arabian Federation"
 SYR_Arab_Federation_desc: "Against all the odds, the united Arab nation looks on the cusp of being born. We have worked hard to foster an understanding between the Arab States, and soon those efforts will pay off. All that is left to be done is draft the last few agreements and draft the charter that this new federation will be based on, whatever the future holds, there is no denying that through our actions we have reshaped the middle east beyond recognition."
 SYR_challenge_egypt: "Challenge Egyptian Domination"
 SYR_challenge_egypt_desc: "While the Egyptians deserve credit for their role in fostering this latest Arab movement, the new regional hegemon is beginning to show its growing pains. It is time for a new nation, one that is younger and more dynamic to take up the Arab cause, even if that means confrontation with the old title holder."
 SYR_destablise_hejaz: "Threaten the Hejazi State"
 SYR_destablise_hejaz_desc: "The Hejazi monarchy believes themselves above the pan-Arabic cause and has refused to join our cause. This slight against us cannot be allowed to persist. Fortunately there are many supporters of the united Arab cause across their nation who can be stirred into action, supporters who will be vital administrators when the Hashimi are removed."
 SYR_destablize_the_imamate: "Destabilise the Imamate"
 SYR_destablize_the_imamate_desc: "The Yemeni state has always felt themselves protected by difficult geography, and has exposed their true colours in their decision not to join our new state. They underestimate the fervour of our cause though, and we will take steps to bring the Yemeni nation under the Pan-Arab cause."
 SYR_arab_broadcasts: "Sawl Al-Arab Broadcasts"
 SYR_arab_broadcasts_desc: "While there are many supporters of our cause, it is important that we win hearts and minds wherever we can. We must begin an intense broadcasting campaign to stir up support for pan-Arabic causes, laying the groundwork for the united state having popular support."
 SYR_destablise_persian_gulf: "Destabilise the Persian Gulf"
 SYR_destablise_persian_gulf_desc: "The desert monarchies of the gulf had always had an independent streak, one which makes itself apparent with their rejection of our overtures. Fortunately these states were never the most stable to begin with, and it will only take a minimal application of force to bring the entire house of cards tumbling down."
 SYR_destablize_iraq: "Undermine the Iraqi State"
 SYR_destablize_iraq_desc: "It is unfortunate that our fertile crescent neighbours of Iraq reject our cause, believing they would be better off going it alone. We make them realise the error in this belief, and drag them from the darkness into the light. We know our cause is popular in the nation, so we must stir these sentiments to bring the governments that hold our cause back crashing down."
 SYR_arabistan_claim: "The Arabistan Claim"
 SYR_arabistan_claim_desc: "While might term the claim over Khuzestan as tenuous or motivated by resources, the region is Arabic, plain and simple. We will liberate our brothers from the Persians and bring them under the Arab fold forever, as well as gain access to the many resources of the region."
 SYR_cooperate_oman_muscat: "Cooperate with Oman & Muscat"
 SYR_cooperate_oman_muscat_desc: "While distant from the rest of the region's conflicts, preferring to keep to themselves, the Omani people belong in our nation, we will begin making overtures to their government about joining into the pan-Arab movement."

### Ideas ###
 syr_lebanese_unrest: "Mt Lebanon Conflict"
 syr_lebanese_unrest_desc: "The Mt Lebanon region has always been a thorn in the sight of Ottoman governors in Syria and this issue has only deteriorated since the proclamation of an independent Syrian state, including Lebanon. As a region set on separating itself from the authority of Damascus, a guerrilla war is being fought out between the Sunni Syrian army and Maronite militias."
 syr_alawite_unrest: "Alawite Unrest"
 syr_alawite_unrest_desc: "Ruled over by Alawite tribes, the Alawyin Mountains have never felt much attachment to the idea of Syria and interacted only if necessary with Ottoman walis or Syrian notables in the lowlands. With the sudden proclamation of a Syrian state, these groups are contesting their participation and waging a guerrilla war to assert their autonomy."
 syr_ottoman_military: "Disorganised Army"
 syr_ottoman_military_desc: "As the Ottoman Empire preferred using Iraqis over Syrians in their officer ranks, our young nation suffers from the lack of military knowhow necessary to lead our new army. Those that do exist are either militia members who rose up during the Levantine War or former Ottoman officers who have ideas of their own on how the new state should be ruled."
 syr_sunni_elite_control: "Sunni Political Dominance"
 syr_sunni_elite_control_desc: "Despite boasting an immense cultural and religious variety, Sunni families have been ruling the Syrian region almost since the arrival of Islam in the Bildur al-Sham. Other religions and sects such as the Shi'ites, Alawites, Orthodox Christians, etc all have very little so say in this rigid model and have as such set up their own self-serving institutions for education, protection and religion.\n\nWhilst this rigid model guarantees tremendous power for the Damascene elite, it has reduced political debates to a purely sectarian and regional issue where debates are centred around the individual power of Syria's largest cities and their dominant religious groups."
 syr_mudafaa_hukuk: "The Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri"
 syr_mudafaa_hukuk_desc: "Called the Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri or Association for Defence of National Rights, various groups of Turks and their allies are waging a guerrilla war in the former vilayets of Adana and Aleppo against their annexation into the new Syrian state. With fighting in Antep and Adana especially fierce, a solution will have to be reached quickly as the coordination of these groups more often than not outranks our own military."

Tens of thousands of Syrians are fleeing to the cities which have grown way out of proportion and are pressing hard on the already limited sanitation and health facilities. Northern Syria, which has suffered the least in the Levantine war is trying to produce enough for the nation but Turkish resistance and Aleppine politics are putting a definite halt to almost every attempt."

 syrian_foreign_policy_events.1.d: "To strengthen the unity of the Arab peoples and to protect them from imperialist ambitions, the government in Damascus has announced a new initiative to bolster economic and diplomatic ties between the various Arab states. Dubbed the \"Arab League\", this supranational organisation is without a doubt a tool of the Damascene government to extend their influence over the peninsula but it is also a genuine attempt by Arab nationalists to strive for a stronger and more prosperous Arabia."

 syrian_foreign_policy_events.3.d: "The vile dogs in [FROM.GetName] have decided that sharing their water pipe with the imperialist shoe peddlers is more worthy of their time than the unity of the Arab peoples. Whilst it is unlikely that we will be able to change their mind, a fair few politicians all across Syria have raised their voice against this despicable treachery."

## Syrian Republic
 syrian_republic_events.1.t: "Proclamation of the Syrian Republic"
 syrian_republic_events.1.d: "As the main battlefield of the Levantine War, the region of Greater Syria is in complete shambles. Its political elite has been torn apart by assassinations, deportations, and executions as revenge for the Ottoman occupation is performed without mercy by guerrilla groups and hard liner Arab nationalists. Even though the (predominately) Sunni caste that has ruled Syria for almost a thousand years is still in charge, many of them are cautiously trying to find their footing in this unknown landscape as the power of families, merchants and landowners is now reliant on both the Arab irregulars roaming the countryside and the Egyptian army trying to smoothen transition to a stable, yet ‘loyal' government in Damascus.\n\nFurther aggravating the situation is the inability of the ‘central government' to exert its control over the more rowdy territories under its curfew. In the North, Turkish & Kurdish ex-soldiers organised in so-called ‘defence organisations' are fighting tooth and nail in opposition to the annexation of Cilicia and Kurdistan. Closer to the capital are Maronite guerrillas (in some parts assisted by Druze tribesmen) fighting for their independence, having proclaimed their own country of Lebanon in the lands of the former Mutasarrifate. The border with the state of Iraq remains contentious as well, with little agreement between those in Baghdad and Damascus over its exact location as both parties see control over the Mesopotamian rivers as quintessential to their rule."
 syrian_republic_events.1.a: "It seems that we have our work cut out for us..."

 syrian_republic_events.2.t: "The Damascene All-Syria Congress: National Bloc & People's Party"
 syrian_republic_events.2.d: "Convened by the Damascene elite under the watchful eye of Egyptian observers and with multiple additions from the exiles in Egypt, the All-Syria Congress will try to find a solution to the de facto civil war raging across Greater Syria. It has quickly however become apparent that the Syrian 'unity' from before the war is nowhere to be found as family, regional and generational conflicts are everywhere.\n\nThe older generation, Ottoman notables and for the most part Damascene elite, has organised itself into the National Bloc which sees itself as the continuation of both Al-Fatah (the Syrian resistance during the Weltkrieg) and the post-war anti-Turkish movement. Large landowners, high-ranking religious figures and proponents of the age old Middle Eastern patron-client system, they are looked at favourably by the Egyptian government but have with the departure of Turkish troops, found themselves faced with increasing animosity.\n\nSimilar to the National Bloc but opposed to its Southern Syrian focus, the industrialists and merchants of Aleppo have organised themselves into the People's Party. Even though their social class is similar to that of their Damascene colleagues, they are striving for union with Iraq and are opposed to the monopoly on power held by the elite of the capital."
 syrian_republic_events.2.a: "\"Stability and continuity will guide us through these troubled times!\""

 syrian_republic_events.3.t: "The Damascene All-Syria Congress: The Second Generation"
 syrian_republic_events.3.d: "Both of these groups however hail from an older generation, a generation whose only purpose has been to maintain the old social system and strive for autonomy from Kostantiniye. Through the education efforts of the OHF and with massive changes on the European continent, a new generation of Syrians has arrived on the scene who don't hold the same opinion as their elders. Inspired by socialist movements in Europe, the Socialist and Communist parties of Syria are utilising the poverty and crisis caused by the economic depression and the Levantine War to strengthen their parties, with support of the Left in Europe. On the other end of the spectrum, the SSNP has taken inspiration from the Italian and Russian movements and has created a secular, militarist organisation with revolutionary ideas for the Syrian region.\n\nThe biggest threat to the National Bloc however may come in the shape of the League of National Action. Created by highly educated, second generation Arab nationalists, this group forms the moderate centre supporting both the secular ambitions of the extremists and believing in the power of the ballot. Newspapers, radio broadcasts, scouts and militias form big parts of their organisation and their service during the Levantine War may prove a deciding factor.\n\nTime will tell which of these movements will achieve the highest office and which will be forever lost to the sands of time..."
 syrian_republic_events.3.a: "\"Syria needs to look towards a new future!\""

 syrian_republic_events.4.t: "Said al-Jazairi Announces Elections"
 syrian_republic_events.4.d: "As the sun sets on the gathered collection of intellectuals, merchants and notables, Speaker of the House Said al-Jazairi has called for elections to determine the future of his country. Descendent of the legendary Algerian Emir Abdelkader al-Jazairi, whose role in the Lebanese Civil War has made him revered throughout the entire world as \"Saint among the Princes, the Prince among the Saints\". Whilst his grandson doesn't have anywhere near his credentials, his decisive action during both the Weltkrieg and the Levantine War to secure stability within Damascus has shaped his destiny as one of the city's most influential notables, further reinforced by a long tenure in the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies.\n\nAll parties, associations and groups gathered have promised to stand for open, free and fair elections and are set to return to their constituencies to run their campaigns. Even though these ideals sound nice on paper, the deeply engrained patron-client system in Syria is likely going to secure a victory for the old elite than bring a true representation of the Syrian peoples."

 syrian_republic_events.5.t: "Chaos at the Ballots"
 syrian_republic_events.5.d: "Despite the good intentions of the All-Syria Congress to organise fair elections, this promise seems to have been discarded just after crossing the doorstep. Reports of fraud, bribery and manipulation from all across the country have arrived in Damascus where foreign observers are looking with horror at the unfolding crisis.\n\nIn Aleppo the opposition claimed being denied access to voting stations, 'especially those in Rushdi Bey's constituency.' Rushi al-Kikhiya claimed that voter fraud and intimidation had taken place throughout the Aleppo countryside, where farmers were paid to vote against him and his allies. In one instance, two citizens tried to resist and were escorted out of the voting station at gunpoint. Merchant Abu Saleh Saadiddine and Mohammad Kheir al-Halabi of the Islamic Scholars Association officially filed complaints in Damascus. They claimed to have been beaten with clubs and kicked out of voting booths because they had shown their discontent with the elections. National Bloc loyalists were accused of breaking into the polling stations in the Jewish quarter of town and stealing the ballot boxes. When confronted by residents, they fired gunshots in the air and set the boxes ablaze. In the rampage, one officer was killed. In Bab Srija in the Old City, sporadic fighting occurred and one citizen was shot dead. Assailants disguised as police officers responded by shooting Abdul Rahman Mekki. In downtown Aleppo, a bomb was discovered at a café that had been planted to kill Rushdi al-Kikhiya, according to the police report.\n\nThe Damascus daily al-Qabas reported that the elections are taking place 'in an atmosphere of terror' with all sides using intimidation to gain the upperhand."

 syrian_republic_events.6.t: "The First Syrian Elections"
 syrian_republic_events.6.d: "With intimidation from both sides running rampant and not fully demobilised militias using scare tactics in the countryside, the elections have not as much shown the desires of the Syrian people but affirmed the law of the strongest in a war-torn nation. Despite promises of equal representation for all religious and ethnic groups, it has already become clear that real power will remain with the Sunni establishment with only token representatives of the Christian minority. No Jews have been elected either as the Zionists in Palestine have boycotted the elections and proclaimed them an affront to the interests of the Jewish people whilst in cities with a large Jewish population such as Aleppo and Damascus, various ballot boxes from their neighbourhoods have been either reported 'missing' or 'invalid'.\n\nDespite high hopes for the socialist parties, their success at the ballots has remained almost entirely absent with only really Akram al-Hourani establishing himself as a key player in his constituency of Hama. The far right under Saadeh has fared equally badly with only limited victories in the urban centres of Northern Syria but without even acquiring a seat for its party leader. Both sides of the spectrum have nonetheless blamed their defeat on the fraudulent elections and call for new elections whilst their militias march through the streets waving the party flag."

 syrian_republic_events.7.d: "Headed by the ageing Hashim al-Atassi, the National Bloc has ever since the end of the Levantine War looked for a new leader to take over from al-Atassi. Whilst Hashim al-Atassi is by many seen as one of the most prominent Syrian nationalists, he has decided that with the independence of Syria achieved it is now time to pass the torch to the next generation.\n\nProminent nationalist Shukri al-Quwatli was long rumoured to be waiting in at the sidelines for his mentor to retire and has now fully taken the stage. A resistance fighter since the days of the Weltkrieg, al-Quwatli received immense popularity after being imprisoned and reportedly tortured by the tyrannous regime of Djemal Pasha. Set free, he fought back against the Allenby administration until its withdrawal from Northern Syria in 1920 after which he promptly resumed his activities against the Turkish occupier. After a few close calls with the Ottoman gendarmerie, he would ultimately be forced into exile in Cairo where he became a prominent activist amongst the Shawam, calling for the liberation of his homeland.\n\nAs such his credentials are a given within Syrian nationalist circles but nonetheless there is discontent amongst the party members concerning the age of Quwatli. Albeit younger than al-Atassi, many had hoped that his retirement would enable the next generation to take up the torch and decide the new course of Syria."

 syrian_republic_events.8.d: "As the National Bloc predominately expresses the interests of the Damascene elite, al-Quwatli has been searching for allies amongst the other groups of Greater Syria. Whilst the Lebanese identity of the Beiruti hinterland has proven an issue in forming an acceptable government, the Constitutional Bloc of Bechara el-Khoury has ultimately accepted a coalition offer from the National Bloc in exchange for drastic concessions to the Lebanese party.\n\nDelivering to the Speaker of the House; the minister of the Navy and extra funding for the Beiruti recovery, there has been protest within the National Bloc as they see this as an insult to the unity of Greater Syria and an indirect acceptance of a separate Lebanese identity."

 syrian_republic_events.9.d: "Son of the famous Haji Uthman Sharabati, one of the wealthiest men in Damascus and supporter of the Syrian nationalist movement, the young Ahmad Sharabati has been appointed Minister of Education by President al-Quwatli. Going back decades, the two men closely worked together with Sharabati functioning as al-Quwatlis liaison in Damascus during his years in exile. A student of MIT and one of Syria's most highly educated engineers, the man however has very little experience in managing an administration and many of al-Quwatlis opponents have decried the decision as nothing more but sheer nepotism."
 syrian_republic_events.9.a: "We'll keep an eye on him."

 syrian_republic_events.10.t: "The Sharabati Reforms"
 syrian_republic_events.10.d: "Under the late Ottoman system, students were forced to take mandatory Turkish classes as the government decided that only through a shared language, it would be able to modernise. Whilst the reasoning may have been flawed and protested against by the Syrian population, it also led to a significant expansion of schools and colleges across the Levant which in turn greatly helped literacy in the region.\n\nNow that Syria has become an independent nation however, the need for Turkish classes has almost entirely disappeared and Sharabati has thus decided that a reform of the education system is in order. Turkish will be removed from the curriculum whilst the focus on Ottoman history is to be replaced by the study of Syria with explicit focus on the Damascene Caliphate. Furthermore there has been an increase in students sent to study abroad and bring the knowhow of the West to Syria, although global instability has caused this to be mainly limited to Egypt for now. To replace Turkish, there is however a debate raging amongst the cabinet whether it is best to instead teach the German language, the English language or stick to just Arab."

 syrian_republic_events.11.d: "Coming as somewhat of a surprise, the National Bloc has been trounced at the ballot as reports of widespread corruption by its members tipped opinion at the last minute. An active campaign by members of the Aleppan People's Party with the indirect assistance of the Socialist Party to smear their reputation also greatly assisted whilst the promises of candidates in the minority regions for more rights and greater autonomy, caused landslide victories in their constituencies.\n\nEven though the coalition has nonetheless won the elections, there is still much disagreement on the office of the President as Emir Said al-Jazairi of the Damascene wing has the support from the Druze, Alawite and Maronite minorities whilst Rushdi al-Kikhiya has the ear of Syria's industrial capital, Aleppo. al-Kikhiya also benefits from his support amongst the League of National Action who are boycotting al-Jazairi who they believe is too old and too removed from the (young) Syrian population to represent its interests."

Many however had not expected to come this far and alliances, backdoor deals and gentleman agreements made for the elections are already sustaining severe strain as it becomes apparent that the former agreement is nothing but a few hastily drawn compromises.\n\nIn Lebanon the Reform Society is awaiting its promised autonomy whilst similar questions are being posed in the Jabal al-Druze, Kurdistan and the Alawite Mountains. Across the Taurus Mountains, the Turks are increasing their protests and strikes, hoping to convince the government of the need for a referendum that will see them reunited with the rest of Anatolia."
 syrian_republic_events.12.a: "We will have to walk a tightrope..."

 syrian_republic_events.13.t: "Famine in Syria"
 syrian_republic_events.13.d: "Even though Syria was in peacetime one of the most important agricultural export regions of the Ottoman Empire, the devastation caused by the Levantine war and the displacement of tens of thousands of Syrians has had a catastrophic toll on this sector. Fields are left unattended or destroyed, orchards made into kindling and fuel for the locomotives and farms all across Syria destroyed by roaming bandits.\n\nWhilst the Egyptian government has agreed to send relief, it has proven tricky to organise as the damage to railroads, ports and roads has made it difficult to reach the Syrian interior. Various Syrian industrialists and merchants have allocated a part of their fortunes to the relief campaign whilst contact has been made with the Syrian diaspora across the world, hoping that they will be able to move their governments to action."
 syrian_republic_events.13.a: "This is a catastrophe!"

 syrian_republic_events.14.t: "The State of the Syrian Army"
 syrian_republic_events.14.d: "As the Ottoman Empire largely relied on the Iraqi Arabs for military positions, both because those were seen as less influenced by Arab nationalism and due to the contempt held by the Syrian establishment towards the army, we are finding ourselves stuck in a difficult situation. The Ottoman Syrian army which was largely disbanded after the Turks were pushed back into Anatolia, forms the new backbone of our military but is infested with officers holding less than stellar opinions of the democratic government.\n\nLeading this ragtag force is the former Ottoman colonel Husni al-Za'im who mostly due to lack of better options has been appointed its first in command. The man, of Kurdish origins, is seen by many as corrupt, inadequate and a liability but holds tremendous influence amongst the troops, especially those coming from the minority regions.\n\nThis has convinced most of the government that ridding themselves of the man, whilst they barely control their own provinces, may lead to a coup toppling the young democracy and ushering in a military regime, not unlike our Iraqi neighbours."

 syrian_republic_events.15.t: "Coup d'Etat in Damascus"
 syrian_republic_events.15.d: "Shortly after midnight, armed units marched into Damascus under the command of General Husni al-Za'im carrying orders to arrest the president and his top officials. As soldiers marched through the empty streets of the Old City, morning dew covered the trees and jasmine flowers that filled the balconies of Damascus. It was chilly before dawn. A few people were already awake, heading to work either on foot or by bicycle. Tanks and machine guns were placed at strategic points throughout the Syrian Capital.\n\nIt is the first time — but many are expecting it to be far from the last — that the word 'coup' or Inkilab was uttered in Syria.\n\nAll of the borders were closed and communication with the outside world was suspended. Telephone lines to and from Damascus were cut off. One military unit headed through the sleeping city to the president's residence in Bustan al-Rais. The soldiers easily disarmed the one guard on duty at [SYR.GetLeader]'s residence and broke in only to be confronted by the president himself. After reading out a short arrest warrant, the man was subsequently escorted out of his home at gunpoint and driven to Mezzeh Prison on a hilltop west of Damascus."

 syrian_republic_events.16.t: "[SYR.GetLeader] Submits His Resignation"
 syrian_republic_events.16.d: "Only recently elected president of the Syrian Republic, [SYR.GetLeader] submitted his resignation earlier today from his prison cell: ‘I present the noble people of Syria with my resignation from the Presidency of the Republic, wishing them eternal splendour and glory.' He made a point by addressing it to the Syrian people and not to Husni al-Za'im or to the disbanded Chamber of Deputies. Al-Za'im had it zincographed and printed in a propaganda booklet distributed by the Media Department of the Syrian Army, accompanied by testimonials showering the General with praise. Everybody of note in Syria pitched in with a word or two about his wisdom, charm and chivalry — including the friends of the deposed president.\n\nDespite all the violence — it has to be noted that not a single person was killed during the coup —, international press mentions: \"‘Most Syrians, sipping coffee in the bazaars and smoking their hubble-bubble pipes, took hardly any notice of the change in government. In their 4,000-year history they had tasted the rule of Persians, Greek, Romans, Mongols and Turks. They were prepared to get used to Husni al-Za'im too\". Curfews have been installed and government personnel forced to attend to their normal positions but all in all the people of Syria are too tired to put up much resistance. The next few weeks and months will likely see an increase in opposition but for now al-Za'im rules supreme."

 syrian_republic_events.17.d: "With the take-over of the Syrian state apparatus nearing completion, the time has come for the second phase in al-Za'ims four-phase plan. Well aware that to legitimise his rule, he needs to enact sweeping reforms catering to all sides and above all needs to restart the crumbling Syrian economy, al-Za'im sees this only feasible through the acquisition of tremendous economic and military support from abroad for his regime.\n\nWhilst described as a brute by many of his enemies and colleagues, al-Za'im has avoided to anger supporters of either of the two European power blocs, both catering to the socialist Akram al-Hourani and the Syrian army consisting of many pro-German ex-Ottoman officers supportive of his government. If Syria is to acquire its much needed support however, it will need to take a decisive stance in the stand-off between the two blocs and rid itself of agents within the nation that may harbour support for the opposing bloc."

 syrian_republic_events.18.d: "Despite efforts from the late Ottoman government to crush the power of traditional feudal landlords, these have controlled the majority of land in Syria since the times of the Umayyad Caliphate. With little land left to the simple farmer, the socialist Akram al-Hourani was able to spread his populist rhetoric across the country, most successfully in his hometown of Hama where widespread corruption and poverty ensured him a landslide victory in the last elections.\n\nBy co-opting the plans of his friend al-Hourani, al-Za'im is both breaking the power of the great Syrian families, his main opposition, and winning the favour of the common man who is struggling to survive in the wake of the Levantine war and desperately pleads for a strong figure to restore order."

 syrian_republic_events.19.t: "al-Za'im Introduces Social Reforms"
 syrian_republic_events.19.d: "Inspired by the programmes of the late Ottoman OHF and its leader Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu, has set his eyes on modernising the Syrian state and breaking with its traditional, religious, origins. Targeting schools, universities and courts, the cabinet of al-Za'im has arrested or replaced figures who have been identified as enemies of the regime, rewritten curricula to devalue the Arab nationalists that founded the National Bloc. Religious schools, closed by the late Ottoman regime but reopened after their departure from Syria, have been closed once more as the new generalissimo sees in the Ulemma nothing but an ancient, decrepit institution out to weaken the Syrian people from within.\n\nWith all political parties banned, the government has also embarked on a crusade against newspapers and underground political organisations to ensure that its control can not be challenged. A 24-hour propaganda broadcast on the radio waves has been set up, whilst strict control is exercised over any other stations. Despite these efforts to suppress the opposition, papers and broadcasts produced by Syrian exiles in our neighbouring countries are able to infiltrate the nation."

 syrian_republic_events.20.d: "As promised by Husni al-Za'im when he took power, 'free' elections were held throughout Syria last week to decide on the future of the nation. That the elections would be a sham was to be expected but not many expected it to be so obvious as al-Za'im was today declared president with 117% of the votes after running unopposed, successfully finding 150.000 more votes than there were eligible voters. State newspapers were quick to congratulate the president on his astonishing victory whilst in Damascus festivities were thrown to celebrate the consolidation of power by the military establishment.\n\nIndustrialists, National Bloc supporters or intellectuals who hadn't yet left the country are now fleeing en masse, scared by the intense anger outed against their figure by student manifestations and pro-Za'im protestors. The government is doing nothing to hinder their departure but has already decreed that every enemy of the state who leaves the country shall have his possessions confiscated and redistributed (to the cronies of al-Za'im)."

 syrian_republic_events.21.t: "Coup d'Etat in Damascus"
 syrian_republic_events.21.d: "Much like happened only a few months ago, Syrian tanks and trucks rolled through the streets of the Old City during the early hours today as former friend and colleague of al-Za'im, Sami al-Hinawi, performed his own coup.\n\nThe Syrian dictator was abducted from his home in al-Rawda off Abu Rummaneh Street, suffering basically the same fate he had inflicted on the last democratic president. When soldiers showed up at his doorstep at 2:00 am, al-Za'im confronted them from his balcony window, having just returned from a charity ball at Bloudan Hotel hosted by the Syrian Red Crescent. They opened fire, missed, then broke in and dragged him out in his undershirt, screaming like a madman. Fadlallah Abu Mansour, one of the officers leading the coup, slapped the Syrian president across the face. ‘Don't hit me' snarled al-Za'im. He quickly added: ‘Listen, I have 80,000 Syrian pounds on me. Take 50,000 and give 20,000 to your troops. Just let me get out of Syria alive.' Abu Mansour struck him again, ‘From where did you get such wealth? How did your poverty transform into wealth?' The soldiers had already confiscated 36,000 pounds from al-Za'im's home. By now in tears, al-Za'im muttered: \"I tell you I am innocent.\" He then asked \"Who is behind the coup?\". Abu Mansour loaded his pistol and pressed it hard against his head, ‘If you don't shut up, I will blow your brains out!'\n\nUpon reaching an abandoned plot of land in Mezzeh, near the old cemetery, al-Za'im suffered just this fate. He was executed by firing squad, along with his prime minister and advisor, Muhsen al-Barazi, in the early hours of the day, with a total of 117 bullets fired into his body."

All bakeries and bread mills were shut down, whilst students and merchants marched through the streets. Whilst the main theme of this protest is centred around the weak economic policies of the government, it is in fact an outcry by the industrial capital of Syria against the limited influence they have in the decision making which is almost solely done by the Damascene elite."

 syrian_republic_events.23.t: "Death of Saadallah al-Jabiri"
 syrian_republic_events.23.d: "Saadallah al-Jabiri was found dead earlier this morning in his house in Aleppo. The National Bloc heavyweight and staunch defender of democracy by many seen as the unofficial leader of Aleppo was a close friend of al-Quwatli and functioned as his partner and ally in the contentious Northern Syria. It is as of now still unclear what the cause of death is but the still relatively young politician had been struggling ever after a mortar shell hit his home during the siege of Aleppo in the Levantine war. It is unlikely that rumours of murder will ever be discarded as in Muslim tradition the body has to be buried as quickly as possible.\n\nWith his passing, many Aleppines are now looking to the People's Party who formed his main opposition within the city. Their leaders, Rushdi al-Kikhiya and Nazim al-Kudsi, were however quick to mourn his passing and praised him as a paragon of virtue and Syrian nationalism."

 syrian_republic_events.24.d: "Led by Pierre Amine Jumayyil and William Hawi, the Marada guerrillas have intensified their attacks on military outposts in Western Syria. The group derives its name from independent communities in Lebanon and the surrounding highlands after the conquest of Syria by the Arab army in 630 CE, renown for their fierce martial prowess. It is on their legacy that the predominately Maronite militia wants to build and their goals for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian interference are non-negotiable.\n\nNot all Lebanese citizens are supportive of their actions however as many see their excessive violence and brutality versus Muslims as ruining the newfound role of Lebanon within the Syrian nation. Mayor of Beirut and scion of the prominent Daouk family, Ahmad Daouk, has denounced their actions and has urgently requested Jumayyil and Hawi to stand down."

Calling themselves the \"Lebanese Volunteer Army\", these men fight under the leadership of their general Fouad Chehab.\n\nWith conflict still raging all across Syria, the government in Damascus is calling on all parts of the Syrian Army to assist in restoring order. The LVA however is refusing to fight outside of Lebanese territory, claiming those are Syrian problems and not Lebanese ones. This has caused quite the outrage in Damascus which denies that Lebanon is a separate entity from Syria and has sent new orders to Chehab, deploying him and his troops to Palestine to assist in quelling Zionist cells."

Citing this as blatant disregard of the Beirut Treaty which stipulated the autonomy of the Maronite community and promised that the Lebanese forces would solely be used on Lebanese territory, their general Fouad Chehab has declared the 'Syrian-Lebanese Union' to have run its time.\n\nThe Syrian public is outraged at this blatant betrayal of the Arab cause and is demanding direct military action to bring the rebelling province back into the fold. With Beirut as the most important harbour of the Levant, the economic damage is likely to be massive to the fledgling Syrian state if a solution isn't found. President [SYR.GetLeader] was quick to declare the Lebanese state illegitimate and has received support from across the Arab world in this stance with the Egyptians promising to assist Syria if need be."

Whilst this sets a dangerous precedent for other groups willing to leave the Syrian state, the government had to admit that it was utterly incapable of defeating the irregular Turkish forces and has written out a referendum in the hopes of saving face.\n\nDaggers have already been drawn and shoes thrown in the capital as the population is striking and protesting against what they see as the death of Syria. Police and military units have been sent into the city in an attempt to stop the violence from escalating but in Damascus and cities further up North, Turkish speaking citizens are being attacked and shouted at on the streets."

The manifesto has outraged the military leadership in Damascus but has gained widespread popularity amongst both members of the Lebanese volunteer Army and the Lebanese civilian population.\n\nThere have been calls to potentially sack Fouad Chehab, and appoint the more pro-Syrian officer Shawkat Shukayr to lead the Lebanese Volunteer Army into Palestine, but even Shukayr appears to be showing doubts, as his telegrams back to Damascus are taking longer and longer to arrive, with each reply.

Although our agents tracked the vehicle to the Beiteddine Palace, an old castle built in the ages of the Lebanese Emirate, they were held up by a detachment of the Lebanese Volunteer Army, who appeared to be garrisoning the Palace without any clear explanation. A somewhat tense conversation ensued, which devolved into a complicated argument over credentials and bureaucratic red tape, as the soldiers denied them entry.\n\nBefore they were forced to leave, our agents noted the presence of other political figures at this suspicious gathering. Considering Beiteddine's location within the district of Chouf, the territory of the Druze Jumblatt Clan, it is highly likely that the young chief Kamal Jumblatt and his relatives were also in attendance.\n\nAlthough the Syrian constitution upholds the right for its citizens to hold a public assembly, the presence of both military men, politicians and tribal leaders, conversing in a palace which has been seen as a symbol of Lebanese independence, has sent a fright to Damascus."

Enthusiasm for his plans remains low amongst the Sunni Arabs however as they fear this will greatly weaken the power of the Syrian government and hinder its potential in becoming the leader of the Arab movement.\n\nTo show their discontent, the National Bloc has spoken out against the Jaffa Conference and asked its members not to attend in the hopes of preventing any accord. Division is running rampant in both the party and the Sunni group in general however as many figures see Jaffa as a stepping stone to power in the new Syrian system. Aleppines, weary of losing power to the Damascenes and fearful that an aggressive Syrian government might wreak havoc in their primarily Turkish and Kurdish economic hinterland have already announced they will show up. Alawites, Druze and Maronites have also accepted the invitation whilst the Turks thus far have refused to participate. To immense protest of his peers in Damascus, the President has also made the curious decision to extend an invitation to David Ben-Gurion of the Yishuv, hoping that he may be able to come to an accord with the remaining Zionists that could benefit Syria."
 syrian_republic_events.32.a: "Jaffa will break or make the new Syria..."

 syrian_republic_events.35.t: "Coup d'Etat in Damascus"
 syrian_republic_events.35.d: "Much like happened only a few months ago, Syrian tanks and trucks rolled through the streets of the Old City during the early hours today as former friend and colleague of al-Za'im, Adib ibn Hassan, performed his own coup.\n\nThe Syrian dictator was abducted from his home in al-Rawda off Abu Rummaneh Street, suffering basically the same fate he had inflicted on the last democratic president. When soldiers showed up at his doorstep at 2:00 am, al-Za'im confronted them from his balcony window, having just returned from a charity ball at Bloudan Hotel hosted by the Syrian Red Crescent. They opened fire, missed, then broke in and dragged him out in his undershirt, screaming like a madman. Fadlallah Abu Mansour, one of the officers leading the coup, slapped the Syrian president across the face. ‘Don't hit me' snarled al-Za'im. He quickly added: ‘Listen, I have 80,000 Syrian pounds on me. Take 50,000 and give 20,000 to your troops. Just let me get out of Syria alive.' Abu Mansour struck him again, ‘From where did you get such wealth? How did your poverty transform into wealth?' The soldiers had already confiscated 36,000 pounds from al-Za'im's home. By now in tears, al-Za'im muttered: \"I tell you I am innocent.\" He then asked \"Who is behind the coup?\". Abu Mansour loaded his pistol and pressed it hard against his head, ‘If you don't shut up, I will blow your brains out!'\n\nUpon reaching an abandoned plot of land in Mezzeh, near the old cemetery, al-Za'im suffered just this fate. He was executed by firing squad, along with his prime minister and advisor, Muhsen al-Barazi, in the early hours of the day, with a total of 117 bullets fired into his body."

# GREAT SYRIAN REVOLT #
#######################
 syrian_revolution_events.1.t: "The Great Druze Revolt"
 syrian_revolution_events.1.d: "As the war with [EGY.GetNameDef] progresses, the people of the Levant have been growing restless and uncertainty graps the region. It is against this backrop, that the latest setback to Turkish rule has occurred, with the Druze of Syria in open revolt. Having kicked out the local Turkish garrison, and armed themselves, they are an inspiration to all Arabs under Turkish rule.\n\nWhile currently only mustering minor forces, if they are allowed to strengthen, who knows where this avalanche of popular discontent will stop."
 syrian_revolution_events.1.a: "They must be crushed!"

 syrian_revolution_events.2.t: "Damascus Joins the Revolt"
 syrian_revolution_events.2.d: "With war in the Mashriq, the Damascenes have once again shown where their true loyalties lay as earlier today a Druze army marched into the capital of the Suriye vilayet and successfully overthrew, together with assistance from the local population, the Turkish garrison. All around the city Turkish shops are destroyed and Turkish citizens attacked as a new revolutionary fervour is spreading through the Arab inhabitants."
 syrian_revolution_events.2.a: "By Allah!"

 syrian_revolution_events.3.t: "Al-Karak Joins the Revolt"
 syrian_revolution_events.3.d: "Cracked down on by the Young Turks in 1910 to assert Ottoman control over the region, the bloody repression and forced disarmament of the Bedouins of the Al-Karak region have answered the call of the Druze and other Syrian movements, joining in on the Syrian revolt. As a vital station on the Hejaz railway, this move has greatly shocked Ottoman authorities further up North who now fear that their inability to quickly react to movement in the Hejaz will lead to an open insurrection in the Holy Cities themselves."
 syrian_revolution_events.3.a: "An all out Arab Revolt seems inevitable now..."

 syrian_revolution_events.5.t: "Halep Joins the Revolt"
 syrian_revolution_events.5.d: "The revolt keeps spreading as the tribes around Halep and Antioch have now also taken up arms to join their comrades in the quest for a free Syria. The Vilayet whose connection to Turkish Anatolia is the most solid of the whole Syrian region seems to now also abandon the Sultan in favour of self determination. Chaos rules supreme on the streets of the city as agitators are spreading as North as Iskenderun although the same signs of complete dedication to the revolt as in the Southern Vilayets remain absent for the time being, likely due to the rivalry between the various citizens and the large non-Muslim population of the city."
 syrian_revolution_events.5.a: "This. Ends. Now!"

 syrian_revolution_events.6.t: "Homs Joins the Revolt"
 syrian_revolution_events.6.d: "After their Sunni compatriots, the Alawites have now also joined the revolt in anger towards Ottoman actions all across Greater Syria. A fragile alliance at best, the two groups are now bundling their forces towards the common goal."
 syrian_revolution_events.6.a: "We will be back!"

 syrian_revolution_events.7.t: "Haifa Joins the Revolt"
 syrian_revolution_events.7.d: "Even in Palestine, resistance has reached the breaking point as the house of the Wali was stormed earlier today by an angry mob, tearing down the Ottoman flag and lynching the governor himself. A detachment of the Ottoman navy resting in port was able to successfully escape but a large supply of ammunition and weapons was unable to be retrieved in time."
 syrian_revolution_events.7.a: "Down with the traitors!"

 syrian_revolution_events.8.t: "Syrian Insurrection Crushed"
 syrian_revolution_events.8.d: "As the dust settles in Damascus and the last remaining cells are shut down with the assistance of armoured cars and the Ottoman armoured division, it seems that order will soon be restored in Syria. With Ottoman military might dominant once more, it seems unlikely that a second attempt will be undertaken any time soon."
 syrian_revolution_events.8.a: "Huzzah!"

# Yishuv Flavour (by Ido) #

 yishuv_flavour_events.1.t: "Jewish National Council Resumes Peacetime Activities"
 yishuv_flavour_events.1.d: "The Jewish National Council, active since the establishment of the M.O.J has governed affairs in the Yishuv, the myriad Jewish settlements that were established as part of the Zionist movement has resumed peacetime activities after the conclusion of the war in Palestine. David Ben-Gurion has offered to resign from his position as President of the JNC, probably as a gesture of reconciliation with the nascent Syrian government and has called for elections in the Assembly of Representatives to elect his replacement. While many are surprised to see the most powerful Zionist leader in Palestine resign, many speculate that he'll have a hand at the handling of future JNC governments."
 yishuv_flavour_events.1.a: "Just don't cause a mess."

 yishuv_flavour_events.2.t: "Jewish National Council Quietly Endorses the People's Party"
 yishuv_flavour_events.2.d: "While boycotting the Syrian election officially, the Jewish National Council has hinted its quiet support for the People's Party, possibly hoping that a liberal government in Damascus would give them a greater chance for autonomy, which is preferable to the National Bloc. Even before the establishment of the Syrian Republic, the Yishuv had cordial relations with Raghib al-Nashashibi which translated to a positive opinion of al-Jazairi and his ideals of a multicultural federal Syria. This new acceptance of the status-quo under Syria is already causing anxieties in the more militiant nationalist elements of the Yishuv."
 yishuv_flavour_events.2.a: "Expected but surprising."

 yishuv_flavour_events.3.t: "Haganah-Etsel Ceasefire Collapses"
 yishuv_flavour_events.3.d: "During the war between the Cairo Pact and the Ottoman Empire, the Haganah, aligned with Ben-Gurion's allies and the overall Yishuv establishment and Etsel, a more militiant paramilitary aligned with the right-wing Revisionist movement led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky have agreed to a temporary truce to defend Jewish interests in Palestine. But now with the JNC seemingly aligning itself with Syria, Etsel has terminated the ceasefire, declaring that the JNC, Ben-Gurion and the Haganah have betrayed the Zionist movement by allying themselves with Damascus. The JNC has quickly agreed to ban the Revisionist party from all of its organs, including the Assembly of Representatives. Many are afraid that Etsel is planning an armed uprising in Palestine, destabilising the region."
 yishuv_flavour_events.3.a: "Palestine destabilises again..."

 yishuv_flavour_events.4.t: "Election for the Yishuv's Assembly of Representatives"
 yishuv_flavour_events.4.d: "The Yishuv's Assembly of Representatives election of [GetYear] has been held in the Jewish cities of Palestine. With the resignation of Ben-Gurion as President of the JNC, his party the social-democratic Mapai has nominated the uncontroversial Zalman Shazar as his successor, and with Mapai's dominance in Yishuv organisations, easily won the plurality of the vote. Many speculate that Zalman Shazar is covertly influenced by Ben-Gurion, who retired to a Kibbutz in the Negev. A concerning result of the election for Mapai is the left wing syndicalist-aligned bloc of HaPoel HaTzair and Poale Zion could signal Mapai's weakening hold over the Yishuv's left wing. Other major parties that emerged in the election are the New Aliyah Party, supported by many middle class liberal-minded Zionists and the social-conservative HaPoel HaMizrachi. The Revisionist Party, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, while barred from running in the election due to its rejection of the new status-quo, has declared that their supporters will boycott the election for good measure."
 yishuv_flavour_events.4.a: "Who?"

 yishuv_flavour_events.5.t: "Jabotinsky's Declaration of National Liberation"
 yishuv_flavour_events.5.d: "Citing the betrayal of the Yishuv's establishment to the Zionist ideal of a sovereign Jewish nation-state, Jabotinsky has declared in a radio address that the Irgun will now move to \"liberate the land of Israel from its subjugators\" and urged all \"proud\" Jews in Palestine to resist the Syrian government in any way possible. The fears of the Syrian government, and the JNC have come true with Etsel rising in rebellion. Etsel's chances of success are slim, but many fear that this is just the beginning of worse things to come. The JNC has declared Jabotinsky and several leaders of the Revisionist movement and Etsel as persona-non-gratas, with the Syrian government issuing the same declaration."
 yishuv_flavour_events.5.a: "This means trouble..."

 yishuv_flavour_events.6.t: "Attempted Bombing of the Governor's Office"
 yishuv_flavour_events.6.d: "An Etsel plot to bomb the Governor's Office in Jerusalem was narrowly thwarted by authorities today, with a home-made bomb found in the room below the office room of the Governor of Jerusalem. The Haganah has agreed to collaborate with the Syrian authorities to track down the perpetrators of the attempted bombing."
 yishuv_flavour_events.6.a: "At least someone is cooperating with us..."

 yishuv_flavour_events.7.t: "The Saison"
 yishuv_flavour_events.7.d: "The Haganah has launched a series of raids against Etsel posts across Palestine, seizing caches of weapons and taking around 200 people as prisoners, some posts violently resisted those raids resulting in firefights that would sometime last hours. Among the killed is the notable Etsel member Avraham Stern, who was quickly martyred by Etsel after the fight."
 yishuv_flavour_events.7.a: "The Yishuv turns on itself?"

 yishuv_flavour_events.8.t: "Jabotinsky goes into Exile"
 yishuv_flavour_events.8.d: "Jabotinsky, citing the despair caused by the 'War of Brothers' went into exile, left for a self imposed exile in Greece, vowing to continue the 'true Zionist cause', with him went Avraham Tehomi, commander of Etsel who is allegedly still organising new underground Etsel cells to bide their time before striking again against Syria."
 yishuv_flavour_events.8.a: "May he stay in exile!"

 yishuv_flavour_events.9.t: "Kakal Planting Trees in Palestine"
 yishuv_flavour_events.9.d: "Keren Kayemet L'Israel, known by its acronym Kakal and its English name, the Jewish National Fund has started a campaign of planting trees around Palestine. While many criticise its efforts to buy land around Palestine, accusing it of stealing land, many also welcome their tree-planting push due to Palestine historically suffering from severe deforestation in recent centuries. The government has indicated that it will be keeping an eye on the JNF's efforts to acquire land to calm possible tensions and maintain regional stability in Palestine."
 yishuv_flavour_events.9.a: "Seems harmless enough."
