 USA_totalist_party: "TUEL"
 USA_totalist_party_long: "Trade Union Educational League\n§LThe latest and longest lasting of several Syndicalist labour organisations founded by William Z. Foster, the Trade Union Educational League was founded in 1920 from the remnants of Foster's Syndicalist League of North America and International Trade Union Educational League. Opposed to the Socialist Party's policies of electoral participation and the IWW's strategy of dual unionism, the TUEL instead maintains an anti-political ultra-syndicalist approach of \"boring from within\" the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a strategy which has seen some success, particularly in Chicago, where the Chicago Federation of Labor led by John Fitzpatrick has become closely aligned with Foster. Ideologically meanwhile, the TUEL has diverged somewhat from mainstream socialism in the United States, promoting a form of \"Patriotic Syndicalism\" that borrows from Sorelian ideas emerging across the Atlantic.§!\n"

 USA_syndicalist_party_long: "Farmer-Labor Party - Socialist Party of America (Industrial Unionist Faction)\n§LFounded in 1930 as a broad alliance of progressive and labour organisations, the Farmer-Labor Party has steadily grown throughout the 1930s. After several false starts in the 1920s, Farmer-Labor has emerged as the primary vehicle for left-wing politics in the United States, for the first time clearly orienting American politics on class lines.\n\nThe largest single member organisation in Farmer-Labor is the Socialist Party of America. Founded in 1901, the Socialist Party first drew support from workers, farmers, immigrants, and social reformers, among others. The revolutionary wave of the late 1910s sparked a large factional struggle within the party, between the moderate \"Regulars\" and the \"Radicals\", who supported revolutionary action. Though the Radicals emerged victorious, they were compelled by the success of the British Revolution to join Farmer-Labor, a decision which enabled them to make sweeping electoral gains in the 1932 and ‘34 elections, taking control of several midwestern state governments.\n\nBroadly, the SPA demands the nationalisation of industry, as well as immediate relief for the unemployed, workers, and farmers. Though all factions of the SPA agree with the need for a \"workers' and farmers' government\", there is disagreement as to whether it should take a syndicalist or traditionally republican form.§!\n"

 USA_social_democrat_party_long: "Farmer-Labor Party - Progressive Faction\n§LFounded in 1930 as a broad alliance of progressive and labour organisations, the Farmer-Labor Party has steadily grown throughout the 1930s. After several false starts in the 1920s, Farmer-Labor has emerged as the primary vehicle for left-wing politics in the United States, for the first time clearly orienting American politics on class lines.\n\nOutside of the Socialist Party, various Progressive politicians compete in elections under the Farmer-Labor label. Some, such as members of the La Follette family's Wisconsin Progressive Party, are members of their own distinct organisations, while others are members of state Farmer-Labor organisations hewing more closely to the national party line. These non-socialist members of Farmer-Labor are often more agriculturally-oriented, and believe in a more limited platform of social benefits and the nationalisation of utilities and certain industries, as well as the empowerment of organised labour.§!\n"
 USA_social_liberal_party: "Democrats (Lib.)"
 USA_social_liberal_party_long: "Democratic Party - Liberal Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democrats, usually associated with the north, follows largely in the legacy of Woodrow Wilson. It is generally supported by urban \"ethnic\" catholic voters, as well as liberals opposed to Farmer-Labor, and supports modest government intervention to support the economy, as well as greater participation on the world stage.§!\n"
 USA_market_liberal_party: "Republicans"
 USA_market_liberal_party_long: "Republican Party\n§LFounded in 1854 as a broad tent party opposed to the Slave Power, the Republican Party has generally been regarded as the United States' \"natural governing party\" since the end of the American Civil War. Representing the industrial interests which came to predominate in the country after the defeat of the Slave Power, as well as northeastern old stock protestants and wealthier western farmers, the Republican coalition has until recently generally maintained a long-term stranglehold on US politics.\n\nDivided between progressive, liberal, and conservative wings, the ideological divides of the \"Grand Old Party\" are generally more mild than that of the Democrats or Progressives. Conservative Republicans generally support higher tariffs and laissez-faire economics, while liberal or progressive Republicans are inclined towards tariff reform and economic interventionism, though to a less centralised degree than other liberals. They also differ on foreign policy, where liberals favour more foreign involvement, in contrast to isolationist progressives and conservatives.§!\n"

It is the natural ruling party in most of the south, with nomination tantamount to election. Divided between agrarian reactionaries and more reform-minded moderate conservatives, they are generally opposed to Civil Rights reform and cartelisation of the economy, supporting smaller businesses and landowners.§!\n"
 USA_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Democrats (React.)"
 USA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Democratic Party - Reactionary Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nPerhaps the most anachronistic section of the party are the reactionaries of the Deep South, who have for years maintained their opposition to liberalising trends represented by those such as Al Smith. Nativist, white supremacist, and generally reactionary, albeit with populist elements, these southern Democrats are quickly becoming tired of the national party leadership, and may jump ship if the opportunity arises, as figures like Theodore Bilbo and Eugene Talmadge reconsider their place in the party.§!\n"
 USA_paternal_autocrat_party: "U.S. Military"
 USA_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "United States Military\n§LOnce viewed as an unthinkable taboo, military interference in American politics has emerged as an inevitable byproduct of growing civil unrest and political violence in the country. Among particular agitators such as Smedley Butler and George Van Horn Moseley, General Douglas MacArthur's clique is unique for its comparative reach among the officer corps. As the country veers closer to the precipice, MacArthur's calls for the defeat of \"anti-American\" domestic forces gain greater attention, both within the military and among both sympathetic and non-sympathetic forces outside of it.§!\n"

 USA_national_populist_party_long: "Democratic Party - Longist Faction\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nPerhaps the most famous name to emerge from the Democratic Party in recent years is that of Louisiana Governor Huey Long. Long's populist \"Share Our Wealth\" platform has captivated large sections of a country mired in economic depression. It is well known however that Long's relationship to the Democratic establishment has seen better days. Years of conflict with the Smith administration has left him poised to mount a bid for the Democratic nomination, one which may not subside if he does not win outright at the Democratic National Convention.§!\n"

A broad-tent alliance comprising Democrats, reactionaries, and anti-syndicalist Progressives, they are united by little more than their shared opposition to the Smith Administration, and at least a temporary unity behind Long as their leader.\n\nThough traditionally Long's base of support has been in the midwestern farm states, reactionary and populist southern Democratic leaders such as Eugene Talmadge and Theodore Bilbo have rallied behind Long out of their opposition to Smith. These southern Democrats are united primarily by their belief in white supremacy and disdain for Smith's particular brand of liberalism. Their unity behind Long however is clearly conditional, and unlikely to last if push comes to shove.§!\n"

Long has aligned himself with western senators such as Burton Wheeler, who have come out to support his \"Share Our Wealth\" platform. It is this western faction of Long's new party which is most loyal to him personally, and likely to stick with him through thick and thin.§!\n"

 USA_authoritarian_democrat_party_compromise_long: "$USA_authoritarian_democrat_party_compromise_long_tt$\n§LThe oldest continually active political party in the world, the Democratic Party was founded over 100 years ago in 1828 by Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. Originally an agrarian populist party upholding Jeffersonian principles, it transformed first into a (generally) pro-slavery party, then into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations.\n\nPerhaps the most famous name to emerge from the Democratic Party in recent years is that of Louisiana Governor Huey Long. Long's populist \"Share Our Wealth\" platform has captivated large sections of a country mired in economic depression. Though Long famously ran on a third party platform in 1936, he has since re-entered the Democratic fold, now more popular than ever. Now it appears likely that he will finally have a shot as the Democratic nominee, with a broad populist coalition backing his White House aspirations, though perhaps with less militancy than in previous years.§!\n"

 USA_national_populist_party_compromise_long: "$USA_national_populist_party_compromise_long_tt$\n§LWith the outbreak of civil war, far-right and isolationist tendencies gained considerable popularity. Though those views were previously represented in the Union Party, Huey Long's abandonment of that electoral vehicle divided the far-right. Some joined Long in returning to the Democrats. Others however, inclined to a more clearly conservative view, chose to follow a different path. The result is the America First Committee, a political pressure group advocating for isolationism, anti-syndicalism, and traditional values. Headed by former Long ally Gerald L. K. Smith (who Long fired in mid-1937), and famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, the organisation initially showed promise, however soon its momentum stalled, and it appears unlikely that it will be a decisive power player any time soon.§!\n"

Nativist, white supremacist, and generally reactionary, albeit with populist elements, these southern Democrats initially jumped ship to join Huey Long's crusade against the Democratic establishment, but in the wake of the Kingfish's death they have limped back into the embrace of their old party, battered and bruised for it.§!\n"

 USA_market_liberal_party_postwar_long: "Republican Party\n§LFounded in 1854 as a broad tent party opposed to the Slave Power, the Republican Party has generally been regarded as the United States' \"natural governing party\" since the end of the First American Civil War. Representing the industrial interests which came to predominate in the country after the defeat of the Slave Power, as well as northeastern old stock protestants and wealthier western farmers, the Republican coalition has until recently generally maintained a long-term stranglehold on US politics.\n\nDivided between progressive, liberal, and conservative wings, the ideological divides of the \"Grand Old Party\" are generally more mild than that of the Democrats or Progressives. Conservative Republicans generally support higher tariffs and laissez-faire economics, while liberal or progressive Republicans are inclined towards tariff reform and economic interventionism, though to a less centralised degree than other liberals. They also differ on foreign policy, where liberals favour more foreign involvement, in contrast to isolationist progressives and conservatives.§!\n"

 USA_great_depression: "The Great Depression"
 USA_great_depression_desc: "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by an unprecidented economic malaise that has come to be termed the Great Depression. After the agonising years of Frank Lowden's prsidency, many hoped that the Democrats under Al Smith could return the nation to prosperity. Despite an outpouring of hope surrounding his election in 1928 however, President Smith has ultimately proved unable to pull the country out of its malaise. As Congress has been reluctant to endorse overtly interventionist measures, and Smith has tended towards managerial and structural reforms, dissatisfaction with the political mainstream grows. The situation has been on a gradual upturn since the Depression's nadir in 1929, as well as the interruption of the recession of 1931, but the struggling state of the economy is fueling radical discontent on both sides regardless. Support for the left-wing Farmer-Labor Party grows, while a big-tent Democratic Party is hopelessly divided on what action needs to be taken."

 USA_black_monday: "The Great Depression"
 USA_black_monday_desc: "The Great Depression which has gripped America for over a decade gradually improved under the stewardship of Al Smith, but Smith's personal reluctance for radical reform and an inability to pass significant reform through Congress made any such progress painfully slow. But now, the situation has been blown apart. Black Monday, the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market in February, has resulted in a renewed wave of economic damage that is spreading throughout American society. Small businesses, already struggling in the inclement economic climate, fall bankrupt by the thousands as it appears any progress made since 1931 has been wiped out in a matter of days and weeks. Rightly or wrongly, fingers are being pointed at the White House, and whoever sits within it come 1937 has a seemingly impossible problem to solve."

 USA_a_house_divided: "A House Divided"
 USA_a_house_divided_1_desc: "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. With Congress split between a divided Democratic Party, a weakened Republican Party and an insurgent Progressive bloc, President Smith has been unable to fix the many ills facing American society, and voters are abandoning the centre in droves. On the left, the Socialist Party of America has grown into a legitimate political force across the Steel Belt, while on the right an eclectic coalition of nationalists, anti-syndicalists, spurned progressives and disillusioned liberals flock to the banner of Senator Huey Long, whose rhetoric grows increasingly violent as the acrimony of his quest for the Democratic nomination heats up."
 USA_a_house_divided_2_desc: "The United States is a house divided. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has only been worsened by the Berlin Stock Market Crash. The recent Democratic National Convention has collapsed in ignominy, with Huey Long's populist faction of the party walking out and exacerbating the deep-seated polarisation of American society. Congress is now hopelessly divided between four feuding coalitions, and President Smith is now forced to govern through executive orders if anything is to be done at all. In a climate of radicalisation and violence, confrontations between strikers spurred on by Socialist Party militancy and the growing paramilitaries aligned with the Longist movement score the midwest. America faces a four-way race for the presidency, and it looks unlikely that any one man will win a majority in the Electoral College."
 USA_a_house_divided_3_desc: "The United States stands on the brink. While the Great Depression grips the nation in an iron vice, the political system has been shattered. For the second time in two elections, the Presidency was thrown to a contingent election, no man able to win a majority in the Electoral Collage in the incredibly tight race. The contested election means fingers are being pointed in every direction, as radicals cry of corrupt bargains to keep the nation out of the hands of the majority, strikes grow with ever more militancy, and political violence rolls on. Tears in the very fabric of American society grow with each passing day, and a national tragedy looks to be on the horizon."
 USA_a_house_divided_4_desc: "The United States stands on the brink. For the first time in American history, the presidency is vacant. As the House is incapable of certifying the results of the election, no contingent election for either the Pesidency or Vice Presidency can be held. As Smith's term ends, outgoing Secretary of State Cordell Hull finds himself as a seat-warmer while the Presidency is decided, an unenviable position as the nation is on the brink of civil war. With the headless federal government paralysed, the seemingly inevitable national calamity seems only days away from coming to pass..."

 USA_strike_season: "Strike Season"
 USA_strike_season_desc: "While the initial years of the Great Depression proved damaging for union activities, there has since been massive growth in both the scale and militancy of organised labour, spurred on by awful economic conditions and the legacy of the syndicalist revolutions in France and especially Britain. The election of President Smith, a man considered an ally of the AFL, ironically encouraged labour militancy, as Smith both passed pro-union reforms such as the Wagner Act, and failed to put forward a compelling progressive economic vision. The failure of the administration to foster any enduring sense of recovery has sparked a new wave of strikes, far larger and more numerous than at any prior point in American history. Syndicalist organisers like Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and William Foster fan the flames - perhaps hoping that the strikes could be the seeds of a revolution of their own - and violent alteractions along picket-lines by armed strike breakers and paramilitaries fuel them ever further."

 USA_strike_season_7: "General Strike"
 USA_strike_season_7_desc: "With the nation in the midst of a political crisis, a general strike has engulfed the steel belt. The massacre of Cox's marchers has destroyed any remaining faith in a peaceful resolution to labour issues. Instead, in both wildcat and organised fashion, workers in key industrial sectors, CIO, IWW, and even AFL alike, have joined together and walked off the job. By far the largest strike in American history, it represents the culmination of the militant labour actions of the past year, as well as of the mobilisation of American labour towards the far-left, a trend which now seems destined to lead to cataclysmic violence."

 USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea2_desc: "While we may have stopped the cholera epidemics and famines, most of the country is still on fire. The only place one can find any modicum of stability is the heavily guarded military depots containing newly-delivered famine relief aid and medicine."

 USA_political_crisis_decisions_intro: "The last decade has not been a shining one, to say the least. The Great War's fallout largely ended the prosperity of the pre-war era, as the economy proceeded to initially stagnate, then fall into a depression, with Presidents McAdoo and Lowden being unable, unwilling or too indecisive to stem the tide. What little progress has been made has largely been erased by crisis after crisis - first the British Revolution of 1925, followed by the Creditanstalt collapse of 1931."
 USA_political_crisis_decisions_pre_bm: "While we are no longer in the depths of the depression as in 1929, the country's political sphere continues to grow increasingly febrile - if the tide is not stemmed soon, the situation may spiral out of anyone's control..."
 USA_political_crisis_decisions_post_bm: "With Black Monday entirely erasing all of the gains made under President Smith, the economy has reached its worst state in two decades. The country's political sphere, already increasingly febrile, is quickly reaching a fever pitch - if the situation is not stabilised, it may spiral out of anyone's control..."

 USA_help_economy_mission: "Deal with the Great Depression"
 USA_help_economy_mission_desc: "The Great Depression has left the United States reeling, and President Smith's government has been struggling to deal with the fallout. The last hope is to pass a bill that will finally get some relief in the hands of those who need it - if Congress can work quickly enough."
 USA_father_coxs_march: "Father Cox's March"
 USA_father_coxs_march_desc: "Pittsburgh's \"Pastor of the Poor\", the labour preacher and unemployment activist James R. Cox, is gathering his supporters in Pennsylvania for a civic march to the capital, in order to spur congressional action against unemployment, and an increase to the inheritance tax. Though Cox himself is a moderate supporter of Al Smith, there are concerns that radical and even syndicalist elements will be among the marchers he brings to D.C., as his unemployed rally looks set to be the largest demonstration in the capital in American history. With the tense situation across the nation, the capital awaits the arrival of these marchers with trepidation..."

 USA_new_monroe_doctrine: "The New Monroe Doctrine"

 USA_attack_canada: "Attack Canada"
 USA_attack_canada_desc: "We have traditionally been on friendly terms with our neighbours to the north... except when we haven't. If the time comes when Canada is controlled by an unfriendly government or has decided to occupy American lands, then the time has also come for us to change the nature of our relationship."
 USA_attack_mexico: "Attack Mexico"
 USA_attack_mexico_desc: "Our preference would be that Mexico was ruled by a friendly government, and kept to its own business. If that is not the case, we cannot ignore that it sits on our borders - borders we will actively protect, even if it means invading our neighbours to the south."
 USA_attack_philippines: "Attack the Philippines"

###Post Civil War - democracy ###
 USA_victory_in_the_civil_war: "Victory in the Civil War"
 USA_victory_in_the_civil_war_desc: "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America. Though both radical socialists and populists dug into our power base, we have proven the power of legitimate government once more. The would-be dictators Reed and Long are no longer welcome in America."
 USA_democracy_triumphs: "Democracy Triumphs!"
 USA_democracy_triumphs_desc: "Though the temptation towards autocracy was great, America stood with its three branches intact, without giving up to executive authority. Congress is called into emergency session and the Appellate Courts are dealing with their mountain of paper trying to sort out the consequences."
 USA_democratic_education: "Constitutional Education"
 USA_democratic_education_desc: "A common talking point by radicals and populists was the idea that the Federal Government is a voluntary organisation. Some even claim to use ridiculous false loopholes like naval law or the rights to secede from the union. We must correct this by making the U.S Constitution as widely available as possible."
 USA_defend_democracy: "Defend Democracy"
 USA_defend_democracy_desc: "Out of the former rebel states, reports have come in of voter intimidation based on class and race. Candidates running for office without an oath of allegiance to the United States. We must protect the peoples' right to vote, and politicians do not incite rebellion again."
 USA_bill_of_rights: "Bill of Rights Reminder"
 USA_bill_of_rights_desc: "Building off of a Constitutional education initiative, Congress has approved of an education push to younger Americans on the importance of our Bill of Rights. This will also allow citizens to better appeal for their rights in a non-violent manner."
 USA_american_values1: "American Values"
 USA_american_values1_desc: "The passive promotion of civil government through high minded publications was undercut sharply by pamphlets and private publishers that promoted an uncivil government. Congress has decided that a multifaceted approach to instilling American values through mass media will finally undercut pamphleteers."
 USA_restore_legitimacy: "Restore Legitimacy"
 USA_restore_legitimacy_desc: "The numerous embassies we were not able to staff during the crisis have finally received relief. We shall re-establish ourselves to the world community as a stronger and more unified nation with an expanded diplomatic corps."
 USA_malice_and_charity: "Malice and Charity"
 USA_malice_and_charity_desc: "With the words of president Lincoln reminding us to \"bind the nation's wounds\", Congress has created a system to reintegrate the rebel states on a massive scale. Through a non-partisan Committee called \"Malice and Charity\", districts can be re-added to the Union."
 USA_destroy_radicalism: "Destroy Radicalism"
 USA_destroy_radicalism_desc: "While the US Government tolerates political discourse, Congress has rallied against the syndicalist and distributionist platforms of Long and Reed. Legal bodies found to be advocating for trade unions or mutualist organisations will be prosecuted under the 1917 Sedition Act."
 USA_strengthen_democracy: "Strengthen Democracy"
 USA_strengthen_democracy_desc: "During the civil war, democratic processes were halted at the local level. Many elections in the border areas were skipped in order to focus more time on the existential crisis of the war for America. Democracy shall now rise from the ashes, and Congress has appointed a committee to ensure elections take place at the local level once more."
 USA_civil_liberties: "Loyalty to America"
 USA_civil_liberties_desc: "The early 1930s was the era of loyalty to men over ideals. Reed, Long, and even Macarthur accrued a sort of clique of allies that saw their leaders as above the law. Several Congressmen have come out to apologise for their statements made during the war."
 USA_ensure_political_stability: "Ensure Political Stability"
 USA_ensure_political_stability_desc: "Although it is opposed by some of the legislatures, use of the FCC to monitor the airwaves against rebel radio stations is necessary. This measure along with several other forms of censorship are still necessary to end rebel pockets within the Contiguous U.S."
 USA_protect_democracy: "Protect Democracy"
 USA_protect_democracy_desc: "The 17th Amendment enhanced the democratic representation in America, but failed, in the long run, to make the electoral process more democratic. Congress shall strengthen the democratic process directly through the review of poll taxes and registries of felons, to ensure the word of the law is followed."
 USA_land_of_the_free: "Land of the Free"
 USA_land_of_the_free_desc: "The use of penal labour in the prisoner of war camps is no longer tolerable to Congress. Although the fate of these prisoners is still up to the court's system, their exploitation in both loyal and rebel states should be rolled back."
 USA_home_of_the_brave: "Home of the Brave"
 USA_home_of_the_brave_desc: "The veterans of the Second Civil War have sacrificed it all to preserve their home, if only they didn't have to fight other Americans.

 USA_for_the_people: "For the People"
 USA_for_the_people_desc: "The people of America as a collective are our constituents and our lifeblood.

 USA_a_more_perfect_union: "A More Perfect Union"
 USA_a_more_perfect_union_desc: "The goal of the United States as an independent nation is to form a more perfect union of the people of the United States.

### Post Civil War - Reconstruction ###
 USA_begin_reconstruction: "Begin Reconstruction"
 USA_begin_reconstruction_desc: "The nation has suffered much long before this war started. It is both a monumental task and an opportunity to unify transportation networks, and push through bolder economic ideas to elevate American industry above this ailing world."
 USA_rebuild_railroads: "Rebuild American Railroads"
 USA_rebuild_railroads_desc: "The Railroad networks that cross America are in shambles, and war-era constructions are jury-rigged to older tracks. Congress has approved of rebuilding our railroad network in the form of mandatory third rail electrification. Electrified tracks will force our energy grid to reform as a result."
 USA_electrification: "Electrification Program"
 USA_electrification_desc: "In order to accommodate the mandatory Third Rail, as well as ensure the safety of the more remote parts of America, an electrification project is approved to cross all state lines. Congress is now pulling state governments to fund transformers and hydroelectric power, as it is their responsibility."
 USA_business_subsidies: "Business Subsidies"
 USA_business_subsidies_desc: "Small businesses in America have struggled to expand their employment opportunities, which is contributing to unemployment. The issue of unsafe working conditions returning to prominence due to the need for faster production has led to agitated workers. Congress has approved of a federal purse to subsidise small businesses."
 USA_rebuild_americas_industry: "Rebuild America's Industry"
 USA_rebuild_americas_industry_desc: "America's exports have fallen during the depression despite taking a laissez-faire position on trade laws. Exports are also one of the main ways we measure economic activity. We must invest in the tertiary services our industrial businesses use in order to lower their bottom line and increase output."
 USA_economic_investments: "Economic Investments"
 USA_economic_investments_desc: "A more bold strategy is devised by Congress to assist in economic recovery. Traditional notions that government purchases are negatively associated with growth, newer theories hold that smart purchases can stimulate the economy."
 USA_esmwt: "Fate of the Unions"
 USA_esmwt_desc: "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of rebellious unions. Some are calling for just their chair-people to resign, while others insist on collecting transcripts of union meetings, paving the way for prosecuting all active members."
 USA_rebuild_the_roads: "Rebuild America's Roads"
 USA_rebuild_the_roads_desc: "The state-funded interstate highway system was easy targets for sabotage. We must cooperate with the states in order to ensure safe commerce and travel through America once more."
 USA_american_industry: "American Industrial Might"
 USA_american_industry_desc: "The war may have temporarily reinvigorated heavy industry, but its design was temporary and facilities were essentially built on top of closed factories. We must bring our safety and management efficiencies to bear in order to make this upswing permanent."
 USA_rebuild_agriculture: "Rebuild Agricultural Industry"
 USA_rebuild_agriculture_desc: "In order to transport and process the food to feed our nation, we must encourage innovative preservation and agronomy sciences. Congress has set up a fund to investigate this and several politicians have contributed to it directly."
 USA_aviation_industry: "Aviation Industry"
 USA_aviation_industry_desc: "The United States used to lead the world in civilian aircraft manufacturing. Now assembly line systems in Germany have us outpaced. Congress has spoken to intelligence agencies about what we can do to encourage businesses to adopt these techniques, including our contractors."
 USA_farming_subsidies: "Farming Subsidies"
 USA_farming_subsidies_desc: "It is necessary to subsidise farms for crops we are in need of, and paying farmers to terminate their fields of lost assets for products like tobacco we don't need right now, but want the skilled labour to still be available."
 USA_maritime_industry: "Maritime Industry"
 USA_maritime_industry_desc: "The Merchant Marine was severely damaged in the war, and Congress has approved the extension of veteran benefits to those active duty sailors who are not on tour if they become a Merchant Marine in their downtime."
 USA_synthetic_oil: "Oil Production"

 USA_reconstruction_finished: "Reconstruction Over"
 USA_reconstruction_finished_desc: "The years of poor economic management and civil strife have not left our minds, but their most damning effects are diminished."

### Post Civil War - Macarthur ###
 USA_american_caesar_desc: "President MacArthur has proclaimed he would not concede victory to the very partisans who caused the civil war. His American Junta promises a national restoration and adoption of functional democracy as MacArthur sees it. Elimination of unnecessary politicians and appointment of more competent officials will bridge the gap between people and politics."
 USA_army_education: "Army Education"
 USA_army_education_desc: "Parents' organisations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage. Our solution is to divert prospective youth into military education while keeping them in public school. The ideas of physical education and moralist taught by Bellamy will revive that old Nationalist fervour that failed us in the 1910s."
 USA_nationalize_boy_scouts: "National Youth Administration"
 USA_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc: "The simultaneous pull to mandate a higher working age is countered by the multitudes of unemployed youth strewn across America. The solution is to establish a National Youth Administration in order to provide work and education to Americans too young to vote."
 USA_the_american_legion: "The American Legion"
 USA_the_american_legion_desc: "With the American Legion National Commander Smedley Butler now a fugitive, it is necessary to rebuild the organisation to remove the stain of partisan politics. No longer will National Commanders be permitted to campaign for politicians, nor will they be permitted to stay once they are career politicians."
 USA_americanism: "Loyal to the Flag"
 USA_americanism_desc: "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a Great Man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans. Loyalty to the unchanging ideal of America must be put above himself, so long as MacArthur's popularity holds out."
 USA_martial_law: "Martial Law"
 USA_martial_law_desc: "At Congressional approval, habeas corpus is suspended in accordance with the constitution. As the threat of invasion from Syndicalist and Populist forces still looms over part of the land, the writ of habeas corpus and free speech is still suspended for political expediency."
 USA_fbi_cointelpro: "Second American Protective League"
 USA_fbi_cointelpro_desc: "As the largest part of the Continuous United States has been pacified, it is essential that American citizens remain vigilant. The reformation of the League aims to create a free information system to report potential populist or syndicalist spies to the Federal Government and to discourage public protest."
 USA_control_congress: "Control Congress"
 USA_control_congress_desc: "Many former Democrats and Republicans have folded into MacArthur's new regime, while holdouts have fled. Fortunately, we were able to fill their vacancies with qualified, trustworthy individuals. These new Congressmen are not politicians per se, they are instead public servants for the American people."
 USA_office_of_war_information: "Signals Intelligence Service"
 USA_office_of_war_information_desc: "Cryptographic machines designed to interact with its sender to create an encryption that cannot be easily broken are the newest toy in our arsenal. The Signals Intelligence Service, which required the installation of underground cables to ensure secrecy, has finally been implemented."
 USA_allien_sedition_acts: "Executive Order 7250-A"
 USA_allien_sedition_acts_desc: "An Executive Order signed by President MacArthur hopes to bring an end to the threat of foreign infiltration. This order restores some parts of the Alien and Sedition Act, notorious in the early 1800s. State legislations are already appealing cases to the Supreme Court. It is firmly believed, however, that MacArthur's new judges will side in his favour."
 USA_empower_the_army: "Empower the Army"
 USA_empower_the_army_desc: "Crisis has already arisen in our new military administration. The Army and Navy are constantly at each other's throats over funding and political kickbacks. We need to relegate the Navy to a secondary governmental position and grant the Army full power."
 USA_loyal_officers: "Old Soldiers Never Die"
 USA_loyal_officers_desc: "The new regime recognises the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home. Thanks to an Executive Order, officers may now pursue a technical education in universities or go into law. This will ensure loyalty long after we fade away."
 USA_loyalty_to_macarthur: "The Commander-in-Chief"
 USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc: "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
 USA_national_rehabilition: "National Rehabilitation"
 USA_national_rehabilition_desc: "The creeds of Long and Reed were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
 USA_root_out_traitors: "Root out Traitors"
 USA_root_out_traitors_desc: "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the SPA and Longists to grow. These organisations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
 USA_american_stratocracy: "American Stratocracy"
 USA_american_stratocracy_desc: "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional democracy as he sees it. While some complain that career politicians have been replaced by officers, few will argue that the bureaucracy hasn't improved. The American people can now trust their politicians to use legal means to achieve their goals."

 USA_social_security_act: "[USA_GetSocialSecurityFocusName]"
 USA_social_security_act_desc: "[USA_GetSocialSecurityFocusDesc]"
 USA_social_security_act_default: "The Social Security Act"
 USA_social_security_act_default_desc: "With Congress soon re-entering session, it will soon be our last chance to push forward any new significant legislation before the election. President Smith, wanting to leave office on a high note, and hoping to weaken the pension issue as an attack on the next Democratic nominee, has chosen to focus on passing Social Security. Though the path to passage is difficult, we believe we may just have the votes for one more win."
 USA_social_security_act_failure: "Failure Of the Social Security Act"
 USA_social_security_act_failure_desc: "The economic crisis in Germany has reached America's shores. In a panic, Congress has tabled the Social Security bill, essentially killing President Smith's last hope for a major legislative accomplishment. Now the nation waits with bated breath to see what their government will do to address the crisis."
 USA_introduce_gmbill: "Introduce the Garner-McNary Bill"
 USA_introduce_gmbill_desc: "The renewed crisis on Wall Street demands immediate action by the administration. President Smith has called on Congress to pass emergency economic relief legislation to prevent a return to the dark days of 1929. To that end, Democratic Speaker John Nance Garner and Republican Senator Charles McNary have co authored a relief bill, which has the support of the President."
 USA_gmbill_fails: "The Bill Fails"
 USA_gmbill_fails_desc: "The Garner-McNary Bill has failed to pass. This leaves America without a clear route towards recovery, and with a growing insurgency which will need to be addressed."
 USA_war_plan_white: "War Plan White"
 USA_war_plan_white_desc: "War Plan White is a military action plan to contend with domestic violence or an insurgency. It's time to dust off the plan and deal directly with the growing violence in America."
 USA_deploy_national_guard: "Deploy the National Guard"
 USA_deploy_national_guard_desc: "The violence caused by supporters of the Huey Long and the Socialist Party is only getting worse. We need to increase funding to National Guard units, and put them where their efforts will count most."
 USA_macarthur_plan: "MacArthur's Plan"
 USA_macarthur_plan_desc: "General MacArthur has raised a solid point: New York City and Texas are two of our most vital, and vulnerable, strongholds. MacArthur has a plan which could see one of these areas secured, should the violence escalate to a full civil war."
 USA_gmbill_succeeds: "The Bill Passes"
 USA_gmbill_succeeds_desc: "The Garner-McNary bill has been passed! This is good news for America's economy - though now we must find ways to fund the bill, or the good news isn't going to last."
 USA_new_shipyards: "Shipyard Funding Scheme"
 USA_new_shipyards_desc: "Two major shipbuilding companies are vying for federal relief funding, and the one we select could mean a large number of new jobs in the region. The trouble is: which one do we focus on?"
 USA_hawking_plan: "The Barkley Plan"
 USA_hawking_plan_desc: "Alben Barkley, Democrat and junior Senator for Kentucky, has proposed a plan which would see the Garner-McNary bill funded by increased corporate income taxes. The plan is controversial with some, but it just might give the economy the boost it needs."
 USA_new_industrial_act: "The New Industrial Act"
 USA_new_industrial_act_desc: "We need to kickstart heavy industry in America's heartlands, where the Great Depression has hit the hardest."
 USA_demand_payment: "Demand Payment of Docking Fees"
 USA_demand_payment_desc: "After the British Revolution, to avoid mothballing the remaining Royal Navy, the Canadian Government docked many formerly British ships in American ports at discounted docking rates. The question of payment for this service however has remained a sore spot in American politics. While it's unlikely Canada could repay all of their fees right now, demanding repayment will appease isolationists in Congress, whom we believe will join the political fringe if not appeased."
 USA_reconciliation_with_canada: "Reconciliation with Canada"
 USA_reconciliation_with_canada_desc: "The isolationists are elated, but at the cost of our relations with Canada. We can try rebuilding those relations by offering a compromise: some assistance from Canada now, with the fees deferred until after the war. In exchange, we'll reduce the import tariffs from the Entente."
 USA_raise_entente_tariffs: "Raise Entente Tariffs"
 USA_raise_entente_tariffs_desc: "Canada refused to pay the docking fees - unsurprisingly - and thus in return our only option is to press punitive tariffs on Entente goods imported into the US. That will put some money in our coffers, though repairing relations with Canada will take a long, long time."

 USA_president_borah: "President Borah"
 USA_president_borah_desc: "The election of the Republican candidate to the presidency after months of speculation has come as a relief to the American people. A progressive in the old Teddy Roosevelt mold, William Borah will have to prove that the old parties can meet a progressive moment."
 USA_president_landon: "President Landon"
 USA_president_landon_desc: "The election of the Republican candidate to the presidency after months of speculation has come as a relief to the American people. A moderate but not a conservative, Alf Landon will have to lean on the establishment to save the republic."
 USA_re_light_the_western_torch: "Re-light the Western Torch"
 USA_re_light_the_western_torch_desc: "Not one for idleness, President Borah enters office with an ambitious plan to save the republic. While some suggest otherwise, the radicals can be distinguished from one another: while the socialists are destructive, and cannot be reasoned with, Huey Long is a known quantity, and winning him over to Borah's reform program may be the key to building a national consensus."
 USA_the_iron_fist: "The Iron Fist"
 USA_the_iron_fist_desc: "Radicalism has become a disease afflicting America. Both Long and the Socialists threaten to tear the country apart, and engage in open street violence to get their way. Enough is enough. We must put our foot down at once to suppress the growth of anti-constitutional movements, even if it costs us important political capital."
 USA_the_first_100_days: "The First 100 Days"
 USA_the_first_100_days_desc: "While President Landon may be a moderate, he recognises the need for immediate relief to American businesses, and now intends to shore up employment by pushing through a blanket relief bill. Faced with the opposition of the radicals however, he will have to thread the needle through a fractured congressional centre in order to achieve a victory early into his administration."
 USA_president_olson: "President Olson"
 USA_president_olson_desc: "The American people have demanded and gotten change. The first Farmer-Labor President, Floyd Olson has ridden a radical coalition of the left to the White House. Now he must deliver on the promises of a coalition gradually growing more radical than he is."
 USA_legalise_expropriation_of_idle_factories: "Legalise Expropriation of Idle Factories"
 USA_legalise_expropriation_of_idle_factories_desc: "Across the nation, hundreds upon thousands of factories lie dormant, due to the failure of their operators to turn a profit. As the burden of capitalist failure is cast downwards, millions of workers lie unemployed next to the empty factories in which they once worked. Enough is enough. If the capitalists will not run these factories, we will seize them and run them ourselves, and we will make work for those who have been left behind."
 USA_enforce_labour_and_lynching_laws: "Enforce Labour and Lynching Laws"
 USA_enforce_labour_and_lynching_laws_desc: "Some of the few positive developments of the Smith Administration were the passage of various labour laws, and the Anti-Lynching Act. Though these represent an important step forward, they often went unenforced in Smith's time. We will rectify this. With the full force of the federal government, we will make the rights promised to workers and African-Americans a reality."
 USA_president_long: "President Long"
 USA_president_long_desc: "The impossible has occurred and Huey Long has gained the presidency on a third-party ticket. His allies do not, however, have control over the Senate or the House of Representatives, and President Long thus faces both a wary legislature and a country on the verge of utter chaos."
 USA_the_nye_sweeney_banking_bill: "The Nye-Sweeney Banking Bill"
 USA_the_nye_sweeney_banking_bill_desc: "Wall Street banks have long trodden over the common American with impunity, foreclosing on properties and destroying livelihoods. That the instruments of financial power in this country remain outside of the control of the American people is a disgrace. The Nye-Sweeney Banking Bill rectifies this by placing banking activity under democratic control, bringing in popular accountability and binding Wall Street to the will of the people."
 USA_deputise_the_minutemen: "Deputise the Minutemen"
 USA_deputise_the_minutemen_desc: "Day by day, America falls further into chaos. Violent anarchists and criminal syndicalists roam freely, spreading sedition and inciting mayhem in the name of foreign radicalism. As it becomes clear that local law enforcement is incapable of meeting the threat alone, we must bolster their numbers by deputising loyal and patriotic Minutemen, who will stamp out the criminal element and restore order to the country."

 USA_restart_examining_boards: "Restart Examining Boards"
 USA_restart_examining_boards_desc: "The Army's review process has had its share of reformers, but by-and-large the system has remained stagnant for a decade. McNair insists that improvements can be made."

 USA_shock_and_awe: "Shock and Awe"
 USA_shock_and_awe_desc: "Entrenchment can turn an open field into a stagnant killing ground, and despite our better nature, we must employ the heaviest artillery shells in order to force our enemies to retreat in such a scenario."
 USA_take_the_fight_abroad: "Take the Fight Abroad"
 USA_take_the_fight_abroad_desc: "Finally, the top brass is satisfied with the progress we have put into the Army. Now we just need a target to put rubber to the road."
 USA_military_research: "Military Research"
 USA_military_research_desc: "Our national security is threatened by the asymmetrical advancement of technology. We cannot be blindsided by an enemy with some previously unknown weapon of war. We must increase military research and development funding drastically."

 USA_liberty_bonds: "Liberty Bonds"
 USA_liberty_bonds_desc: "Funding the war effort will require more than victory gardens and volunteerism. Liquid assets are in short supply, especially with our economic programs ongoing. We can capitalise on public trust and implement War Bonds as most other free nations do."
 USA_army_rangers: "Army Rangers"
 USA_army_rangers_desc: "Training Regiments to acclimatise soldiers into new environments will enable American soldiers to fight effectively no matter where the course of war may take them. The Rangers are a newly proposed force conceptualised around adaptation to harsh terrain, with the purpose of introducing their advancements slowly the Army as a whole. Let us found this organisation."
 USA_walkie_talkies: "Walkie Talkies"
 USA_walkie_talkies_desc: "Usually military equipment has strong names. Walkie Talkie? How did that slip through the system? Our generals claim that this new untethered communication device will enable our troops to speak effectively when they're in the field. And we called it Walkie Talkie?"
 USA_defense_logistics_agency: "Defense Logistics Agency"
 USA_defense_logistics_agency_desc: "The layout of the United States may be suited for interstate commerce, but is unprepared for massive deployments. We must correct this."
 USA_increase_military_production: "Increase Military Production"
 USA_increase_military_production_desc: "The gratefully employed are in our factories toiling towards victory, though they may not believe that. Where propaganda has failed, monetary incentive will work to increase production."
 USA_tank_competition: "Tank Competition"
 USA_tank_competition_desc: "Tank designs are a dime a dozen, we need a streamlined system to determine which design will best fill its role in combat."
 USA_armored_cavalry: "Armoured Cavalry"
 USA_armored_cavalry_desc: "Top officers have long had experience in cavalry and have designed and planned to transform motorised and tanks to fit new needs. Working closely with the government, the military, Henry Ford and other Industrialists, we can make this plan a reality."
 USA_gi_bill: "G.I. Bill"
 USA_gi_bill_desc: "Young men have a variety of motivations for going to war. The G.I. Bill will hopefully encompass those motivators that patriotism cannot reach."
 USA_fighter_development: "Fighter Development"
 USA_fighter_development_desc: "While we were still stuck with the P-26 Peashooter, our national companies have made huge breakthroughs with the P-36 Hawk, the Seversky P-35, the P-39 Airacobra and the new Prototypes of the P-40 Warhawk which could give us an edge on the battlefield. Let us fund these companies so that their projects may enter mass production."
 USA_expand_air_corps_tactical_school: "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
 USA_expand_air_corps_tactical_school_desc: "We are in need of a space to train new pilots for the variety of operations the Air Force handles. In Virginia, a section of the ACTS has remained loyal to us, despite all shortcomings of the Air Force, and their installations and expertise may prove vital to train the airmen of tomorrow."
 USA_expand_wasps: "Create the WASPs"
 USA_expand_wasps_desc: "The Women Air Force Service Pilots will help support the Air Force, while they will be subordinate to the main male air-force and not be allowed to fly in combat situations, they will help to keep our boys flying in the air."
 USA_screaming_eagles: "'Screaming Eagles' Program"
 USA_screaming_eagles_desc: "General John C.H. Lee is insisting on starting off a new experiment in Air Assaults done in response to the Hang-glider operations pioneered in Europe. With airborne forces we will be able to overwhelm defenders from multiple angles in ways that it was impossible decades ago. As such, the general staff has authorised the experiments and funding shall be diverged to it."
 USA_radar_development: "R.A.D.A.R. Development"
 USA_radar_development_desc: "RADAR, the top-secret technology to detect air movement will allow our sky watchers to rest easy at night."
 USA_expand_the_USAAC: "Expand the USAAC"
 USA_expand_the_USAAC_desc: "The United States Air Army Corps, in service since 1926, has largely remained on the sidelines of military development. Despite receiving a meagre budget, they've yet managed to innovate in many aspects and High Command barely sees any reason to reform. Provided High Command's disputes in the past few years with Airmen, it has been decided they'd be better off remaining as an integral part of the Army."
 USA_create_the_USAAF: "Create the USAAF"
 USA_create_the_USAAF_desc: "The United States Air Army Force is the success of both the airman and the politician. With the dream of Billy Mitchell realised in all but name, we can now focus on improving on Harold L. George's doctrine and enhancing America's long range strike capabilities."
 USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics: "Modernise Cavalry Tactics"
 USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics_desc: "It was apparent from our observers in the Weltkrieg that new tactics and technologies are becoming vital in the battlefield. Bearing this in mind, it's no wonder General Chaffee has seen fit to redistribute new manuals specifying how to use and counter armoured advances as the old counter-cavalry tactics grow outdated."
 USA_mechanization_program: "Mechanisation Program"
 USA_mechanization_program_desc: "The speeds Chaffe is promising on new vehicles will require a systematic change in how we build and maintain military vehicles."
 USA_top_notch_artillery: "Top-Notch Artillery"
 USA_top_notch_artillery_desc: "Artillery pieces will need to be stronger as well as lighter if we are to respond to battlefield changes as the plan dictates. McNair's expertise in the 1920s with the Examining boards seems to have not gone to waste, and he has proposed an overhaul of the American Artillery production which he projects will lead to artillery pieces being easier to produce and repair, as well as more accurate on the battlefield."
 USA_production_priority: "Production Prioritisation"
 USA_production_priority_desc: "As our War Industry hums along, McNair has stressed the necessity of the usage of both Anti Air and Anti Tank cannons to stop both armoured and aerial threats dead in their tracks. However, High Command will require some solid report evidence to divert the funding McNair is requesting..."
 USA_CAS_doctrine: "Air-To-Ground Cooperation Exercises"
 USA_CAS_doctrine_desc: "While the USAAC has technically worked with the Army for well over a decade, they have hardly ever worked together. The Army is now requesting the Air Force to support their advances, and provided that doing so blindly might lead to friendly fire, generals are being paired in specific combat areas to exercise their coordination and to make sure our casualties are minimised."
 USA_CAS_model: "CAS Model Development"
 USA_CAS_model_desc: "As the Air Corps never intended to be integrated into the army, hardly any development has gone into newer Close Air Support Models. Thankfully, Contractors have already been kind enough to provide us with prototypes like the Brewster XSBA-1 and the already ageing Northrop A-17 \"Drifter\". High Command will need to choose carefully who'll become our main Attack Bomber if we wish to succeed..."
 USA_strategic_bomber_development: "Strategic Bomber Development"
 USA_strategic_bomber_development_desc: "America hardly has any enemies within attack range to fear. As such, there has been a generalised thought that has been taking over the USAAF, spread by a group led by famous airmen like Carl Spaatz. The Army has dubbed them the \"Bomber Mafia\" due to their methods, and this \"Bomber Mafia\" is now requesting the funding to further expand on their long range strike plans."
 USA_strategic_bombing_doctrine: "Strategic Bombing Doctrine"
 USA_strategic_bombing_doctrine_desc: "The idea pushed by Spaatz and his acquaintances is a rather simple one: The Enemy won't be able to continue fighting if the home for which they are fighting for no longer exists. By destroying both their industry and their fighting spirit at the homefront, our troops will prevail both in morale and equipment on the front line."
 USA_long_range_escorts: "Long Range Escorts"
 USA_long_range_escorts_desc: "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own. They will need an escort capable of facing off enemy fighters and come back in one piece. Luckily for us, plane designer Kelly Johnson has contacted us with a new and innovative design: The P-38, dubbed \"The Lightning\"."
 USA_aerodrome_construction: "Aerodrome Construction"
 USA_aerodrome_construction_desc: "We should pepper the nation with airfields, enabling our Airmen to reach any part of the nation easily."

 USA_central_operating_bases_desc: "We should concentrate on safer, larger airfields strategically located near major zones of control."
 USA_flexible_bombers: "Flexible Bombers"
 USA_flexible_bombers_desc: "The Army has stated they require multi-purpose air craft that can easily adapt to battle situations. Thankfully for us, our private contractors have come up with the NA-40, which could serve as a baseline to a new flexible bomber model, which the airmen insist on naming after Billy Mitchell despite High Command's protests. We shall fund these development efforts."
 USA_Quesada_CAS: "Quesada's Close Air Support"
 USA_Quesada_CAS_desc: "General Quesada has a very hands-on attitude to directing Air missions, and his approach to air tactics is near revolutionary for our young Air Force. Let us fund his efforts and help distribute his manuals to pilots so our CAS doctrine may be the best in the world!"
 USA_new_arms_factories: "New Arms Factories"
 USA_new_arms_factories_desc: "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies. We have had to expand facilities and repurpose old buildings in order to manufacture parts needed for heavy weapons in our territory."
 USA_new_tank_assemblies: "New Tank Assemblies"
 USA_new_tank_assemblies_desc: "Armoured warfare will change the face of the battlefield forever. We cannot sid idly as the world rearms, and with the Tank, we may be able to beat our enemies in a matter of weeks instead of years. As such, it would be a priority for us to build more of these deadly machines, so that we may be ready for fight for freedom not only in America, but on the whole world."
 USA_woman_army_corps: "Create the Women's Army Corps"
 USA_woman_army_corps_desc: "Despite protests from socially conservative elements in the US Army, the Commander in Chief has stood firm in defence of the Women's Army Corps. Led by Secretary of the Department of Health, Oveta Hobby, the WAC has received more than twice their requested number of volunteers. Women's Auxiliary will help maintain and safeguard our weapons of war, and keep our massive supply chain working."
 USA_new_rifle_development: "Rifle Improvements"
 USA_new_rifle_development_desc: "While the M1 Johnson managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
 USA_tis_ill_defend: "'This We'll Defend'"
 USA_tis_ill_defend_desc: "The US Army has reached a new peak in both size and efficiency. We can rely on them to defend our values both domestically and abroad, and in the process, High Command has managed to learn some valuable lessons that give us an edge over inexperienced militaries."
 USA_Craig_plan_desc: "Malin Craig's plan is the only plan that guarantees a large fighting force in the shortened time frame we have given."
 USA_hierarchical_reorganization: "Hierarchical Reorganisation"
 USA_hierarchical_reorganization_desc: "The meritocracy in the US Army has fallen to the wayside for nepotism and incompetence. We must reaffirm the code of the US Army and ingrain this in our staff hierarchy."
 USA_joint_chiefs_of_staff: "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 USA_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc: "The disputes common in the Federal inter-service politics persist in our own government. In order to avoid this interdisciplinary contention from spilling over, we must ensure that all our Chiefs of Staff are given equal attention."
 USA_establish_a_new_officer_training_center: "Establish a New Officer Training Centre"
 USA_establish_a_new_officer_training_center_desc: "With the immediate danger posed to our most prestigious officer schools, we must reorganise and fund new schools in safer territory."
 USA_a_gun_for_every_hand: "A Gun for Every Hand"
 USA_a_gun_for_every_hand_desc: "A priority of General Craig is not only the Mobilisation of large infantry units, but the consistency of supplies for them. As such, he insists that a second budget needs to be drawn, one that favours Weapon contractors heavily to produce more equipment so our troops at the front may be able to fight with a full kit against any threat."
 USA_engineer_corps_expansion: "Engineer Corps Expansion"
 USA_engineer_corps_expansion_desc: "We are finally able to provide enough infrastructure and planning to provide Engineering Corps in the field. Through coordinating our intelligence network with scouting and surveillance systems, we are able to ensure that non-combat elements in battle are accounted for and able to complete their tasks."
 USA_american_auto_industry: "American Auto Industry"
 USA_american_auto_industry_desc: "Since the invention of the Automobile, it has been taken up in earnest by the people of America. Most of the factories for cars are in the north where the syndicalists are running things. However, J. Kaiser has moved North, so we should encourage other companies to follow in his footsteps."
 USA_cult_of_aviation: "Spaatz's Air Superiority"
 USA_cult_of_aviation_desc: "General Carl Spaatz has long since been growing in notoriety within the USAAC and USAAF. The success of his ideas on the field of battle have proven that Spaatz's approach to air warfare may be correct, and as such, the Army should focus on promoting and distributing manuals regardless of disagreements with the \"Bomber Mafia\" so that our pilots may learn and apply his ideas on the skies."

### Military - Navy ###

 USA_navy_desc: "The American navy, an institution whose history is so deeply interwoven with that of the nation as a whole, has been in steady decline after years of neglect. No more! We must again turn our attention to naval affairs."
 USA_grand_navy: "Great White Fleet"
 USA_grand_navy_desc: "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."

 USA_light_cruisers: "Light Cruiser Development"
 USA_light_cruisers_desc: "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
 USA_naval_aviation: "Naval Aviation"
 USA_naval_aviation_desc: "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
 USA_expand_dockyards: "Expand Dockyards"
 USA_expand_dockyards_desc: "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
 USA_submarines: "Submarine Development"
 USA_submarines_desc: "Submarines allow us to wreak havoc on enemy shipping and heavy ships. We should ensure that our designs stay up to date against enemy destroyers and anti-submarine tactics."

 USA_new_ship_buildings: "Maritime Industry"
 USA_new_ship_buildings_desc: "America has a naval tradition rivalled only by the great powers of Europe, and an equally illustrious history of naval production and innovation. With the dockyards and merchant marine now much improved, let us focus on streamlining and better integrating the increasingly national process of naval production."
 USA_new_admirals: "New Admirals"
 USA_new_admirals_desc: "In the face of crisis, many admirals committed the greatest treason - desertion. We should train a new generation of naval leaders to ensure our continued maritime dominance."
 USA_expand_waves: "Create the WAVES"
 USA_expand_waves_desc: "Women can serve many auxiliary roles in the navy, freeing up men for combat duty. While this might be socially controversial, it will significantly help the war effort."
 USA_marine_corps: "Improve the Marine Corps"
 USA_marine_corps_desc: "The Marine Corps was the epitome of American power projection around the globe. From the shores of Tripoli to the halls of Montezuma, the Marines were always there. We should ensure they have modern equipment and training."
 USA_urban_warfare: "Expand the Marine Corps"
 USA_urban_warfare_desc: "We need to enlarge the Marine Corps, and ensure that they are able to project our power around the globe."

 USA_arsenal_of_democracy_desc: "The Good Neighbour Policy necessitates an internal programme to ready arms for future conflicts.

The result was a Central Powers victory, and the country struggled economically thereafter. European trade declined and the repayment of loans to the Entente was precluded by the German victory. Internationally isolated, the nation now faces mounting internal dissent as the aging and unpopular Smith Administration is challenged by new, radical political forces on the left and right. With malaise at home and only a modest reputation overseas, things aren't looking good for the United States..."

 USA_country_intro_header: "The United States of America"
 USA_country_intro_content: "Though spared the horrors of the European War, the United States has fared poorly in its aftermath, as the German-led global order has taken hold. The prosperity of neutrality gave way to a stagnant economy in the early 1920s, as President §lWilliam Gibbs McAdoo§!, who had only narrowly succeeded Woodrow Wilson, failed to contain social and labour unrest, making enemies of both conservatives and progressives alike. McAdoo's successor, Republican §mFrank Lowden§!, was faced with an even greater crisis however: the British Revolution severed America's trade links with its largest remaining major trading partner, leading to the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in April and December 1925, which allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy. Lowden's administration struggled to respond effectively, pursuing generally non interventionist policies and continuing to raise tariffs, further damaging American trade relations.\n\nThe election of §lAl Smith§! in 1928, initially welcomed by progressives and reformers, soon failed to live up to grand expectations. Though Smith successfully stopped the bleeding and stabilised the banking sector, he continued to reject any large interventionist measures, particularly any that would send the budget into deficit. Spurned by the Democrats once again, progressive and labour forces united for the first time with the Socialist Party in a progressive political alliance, the §SFarmer§!-§RLabor§! §rParty§!, which opposed the Smith administration from the left, and forced the 1932 election to the House of Representatives, where Smith was re-elected with their consent. Within the Democratic party meanwhile, a growing opposition bloc headed by §nHuey Long§! united by a common contempt for Smith gains ground, as Long adopts increasingly radical rhetoric in advocating for his \"§nShare Our Wealth§!\" agenda.\n\nAs the year turns to 1936, the Union seems more divided than at any time since the Civil War. Though Smith has managed a modest recovery (aside from the hiccup of the 1931 recession, caused by the Creditanstalt collapse in Austria), the strong position the Democrats held upon his ascension to office has eroded significantly, as Farmer-Labor has united the left under an independent (and often militant) banner and the Democrats themselves are beset by conflict. Confidence that Smith will be able to achieve anything of note in the remainder of his term is low, as no party holds a majority in either house of Congress. Meanwhile, organised labour grows bolder by the day, stoking fears of revolutionary violence, and pushing the right to seek out a leader who will defend the country from Syndicalism.\n\nThe country balances tenuously on a knife's edge, and one small push may be all that's needed to send it tumbling."

 USA_country_intro_header_1: "Parties and Factions"
 USA_country_intro_content_1: "The §lDemocratic§! §cParty§!\nThe oldest continually operating political party in the world, The Democrats have had a storied history, having transformed from a (generally) pro-slavery party, into agrarian and southern opposition to the Republicans, and then into a western, southern, and increasingly urban party with liberal inclinations. Currently, the leading faction of the Democrats are the §lliberals§!, including both President §lAl Smith§! and Vice President §lJoe T. Robinson§!. Generally supported by northern \"ethnic\" voters, they support greater government involvement in the economy, as well as a degree of internationalism. §cConservative§! Democrats meanwhile are generally associated with the south, though they are certainly not exclusive to that region. Divided between agrarian reactionaries, aristocratic southern planter \"Bourbons\", and more reform-minded moderate conservatives, they are generally opposed to Civil Rights reform and cartelisation of the economy, supporting smaller businesses and landowners. A more extreme variation are the §greactionaries§! of the Deep South. Nativist, white supremacist, and generally reactionary, albeit with populist elements, these southern Democrats are quickly becoming tired of the national party leadership. In recent times, they have drawn closer to the §nLongists§!, the personal supporters of §nHuey Long§!, who advocate for his \"§nShare Our Wealth§!\" platform, and his upcoming campaign for President.\n\nThe §mRepublican Party§!\nFounded in 1854 as a broad tent party opposed to the Slave Power, the Republican Party has generally been regarded as the United States' \"natural governing party\" since the end of the American Civil War, as until recently it has generally maintained a long-term stranglehold on US politics. On the left, §4progressive§! (usually western) Republicans upholding the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt such as William Borah support broader government intervention in the economy, though usually in a more decentralised manner than liberal Democrats and Farmer-Laborites. Being isolationists, they differ in their approach to global affairs to §3liberal§! Republicans, such as Alf Landon, who are otherwise similar on issues such as tariff reform. §2Conservative§! Republicans meanwhile are resolutely opposed to free trade, and are strongly isolationist. Defeats in recent years make them unlikely to hold the Republican banner in 1936 however, and as such they are lining up behind the liberals to defeat Borah.\n\nThe §SFarmer§!-§RLabor§! §rParty§!\nThe newest player in national politics, the Farmer-Labor Party is a federated entity with no national party membership outside of its affiliates. The bulk of its supporters are §Sprogressives§!, generally united behind 1932 standard-bearer §SFloyd Olson§!, as well as a platform of social benefits and the nationalisation of utilities and certain industries, and the empowerment of organised labour. The bulk of its activists and congressional contingent however belong to the §RSocialist Party of America§!, the main American party in the §rThird International§!. The Socialist Party has been a revolutionary party since 1920, however it has been compelled to participate in Farmer-Labor due to the success of the Labour Party in Britain. The SPA is itself divided between factions: The most prominent are the \"§RProgressive Caucus§!\" under §RNorman Thomas§! on the right, and the pro-syndicalist \"§rIndustrial Unionists§!\" on the left, led by §rJohn Reed§!, the party's leader in Congress, national Chairman, and the face of American socialism."

 USA_country_intro_header_2: "Organised Labour"
 USA_country_intro_content_2: "In the United States, §Ylabour unions§! have for decades been divided between multiple competing trade union centres. Ideological conflicts over industrial versus craft unionism, as well as the relationship between labour and political parties and politics in general have often dominated discussion of union activities.\n\nThe oldest and most established of the union centres is the §lAmerican Federation of Labor§!. The AFL, headed by president §lWilliam Green§!, has traditionally been dominated by conservative proponents of §lcraft unionism§!, who have spurned industry-wide organising as well as the organisation of immigrants and unskilled workers. Politically, it has been opposed to the idea of binding labour to any singular political party, opportunistically supporting both Democrats and Republicans (though usually the former) when they serve labour's interests.\n\n§SIndustrial unionists§! who had previously worked within the AFL split from it in 1929 to form the §SCongress of Industrial Organizations§!. The CIO, headed by President §SSidney Hillman§!, supports both organisation by industry as well as the §SFarmer§!-§RLabor§! §rParty§!, to which it is formally affiliated and sends a membership levy. Since its split from the AFL, the CIO has grown rapidly, cornering the steel and automobile industries which the AFL previously declined to organise. The CIO also retains looser and more informal ties to the §RSocialist Party of America§!, from which it draws a significant share of its activists and leadership. A prominent outgrowth within the CIO is the ultra-syndicalist §oTrade Union Educational League§!, led by §oWilliam Z. Foster§! and §oEarl Browder§!. Following Foster's strategy of \"boring from within\" existing trade unions, the TUEL believes that it is the task of a \"§omilitant minority§!\" within the unions to capture them for revolutionary syndicalism.\n\nThe final major union centre is the famed §rIndustrial Workers of the World§!, or \"Wobblies\", led by §rElizabeth Gurley Flynn§!. The IWW is an explicitly syndicalist union, organising based on industry and having been in conflict with the AFL since its founding. It is noted for enthusiastically supporting efforts to organise immigrants, African-Americans, women, and even the unemployed. Politically, the IWW retains a fierce independent streak: though it is no longer in open conflict with the Socialist Party, cooperation between the two has seldom reached beyond informal and circumstantial partnerships, a situation which has not been helped by the SPA's affiliation with Farmer-Labor, which the IWW denounces as a bourgeois electoral project."

### Events - Pre Election ###
 united_states_events.2.t: "Black Monday Hits America"
 united_states_events.2.d: "Catastrophe! Just a few days ago, news reached the shores of the United States by wire, informing us of a massive wave of panic-selling in the Berlin Stock Market, which has led to a general collapse of investor confidence. The persistent sense of dread that has permeated American life - the feeling that, even when the economy has been on an upturn, another two steps backward are just around the corner - has now been proven correct. By the end of the day, a massive sell-off in the New York Stock Market followed.\n\nOn Sunday, the Dow Jones had already been sliding, but had fallen only two percent. By the end of trading on Monday, however, it fell by twelve percent, and on Tuesday, another eleven percent. A full quarter of all investments had been wiped out within two days. Despite William C. Durant and other members of the Rockefeller family attempting to rally the market with a substantial buy-off, the market has continued its plummet, with some economists airing concerns that it may simply continue indefinitely, until there is no more value to lose - investor confidence has been shattered for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile this stock market crash had almost no impact on the vast majority of Americans, owing to the fact that only a tiny percentage of the population has investments, fear has permeated the middle and working classes as well. Already, massive strikes have been planned by all major unions in protest of the predicted wave of terminations and wage cuts, and demonstrations have begun in the countryside by farmers. North, South, East, and West, exactly the same course of events, and therefore the same atmosphere, pervades now as it did prior to the woes of 1925. As far as the American people can tell, there is simply no hope for the future."
 united_states_events.2.a: "This is just not our year."

 united_states_events.17.t: "Father Charles Coughlin"
 united_states_events.17.d: "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing a weekly radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fermented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in.\n\nHis hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
 united_states_events.17.a: "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
 united_states_events.17.b: "It would be best if we did not interfere."

 united_states_events.18.t: "Father Charles Coughlin's CBS Radio Broadcasts"
 united_states_events.18.d: "Charles Couglin is a Canadian-born Catholic priest who was assigned to the National Shrine of the Little Flower in Michigan in 1923. He began broadcasting his Sunday Sermons in 1926 on a local radio, and despite working in a relatively small parish he quickly gained traction among Catholics amid KKK violence and general anti-Catholic sentiments.\n\nBy 1930 his program was signed to the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and his weekly topics shifted from religion to politics - taking aim at income inequality, banking, and Jews. He attracted significant controversy, and CBS refused to renew their contract so Coughlin established an independently financed radio network and continued to achieve popularity in the backdrop of the Great Depression. His popularity allowed him to found the National Union for Social Justice in 1934 and his shows drew tens of millions of listeners each week.\n\nThings have come to a head with the NUSJ holding a series of massive rallies in Cleveland Municipal Stadium, where Coughlin predicted the NUSJ will take half of Ohio thanks to the large slate of NUSJ backed candidates. He also presided over the so-called Townsend Convention, demanding further expansions of old-age pensions, and formally endorsed Huey Long for President. Exhausted by the frenzy of activity, Coughlin nearly fainted by the end of his speech.\n\nFather Coughlin's words have divided the Catholic-American world, with even his friend Joseph Kennedy (a leading Massachusetts Democrat and prominent Catholic) attempting to convince him to tone down his rhetoric. Bishop Francis Spellman and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, at Kennedy's suggestion, as well as other members of the Catholic clergy have sought to muzzle Coughlin, but only Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit has the authority to do so. The bishop, a supporter, has refused though he is said to be in poor health. The Federal government has entertained denying him a broadcasting license, but that might further radicalise his followers."
 united_states_events.18.a: "Coughlin is a becoming a danger to the public, shut him down."
 united_states_events.18.b: "I hate what he says, but I defend his right to say it."

### Victory in the civil war
 united_states_events.116.t: "MacArthur's Power"
 united_states_events.116.d: "With our victory in the civil war, the question of MacArthur's status must be decided upon. Although President MacArthur is legally the acting president according due to his position as Secretary of State, an appointment confirmed by Congress on several occasions, it was obvious to all in 1937 that MacArthur took power illegally.\n\nMany now wish for the general to step down and hand power back over to the elected vice president of the 31st administration. Hardliners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, however, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant if he stayed."
 united_states_events.116.a: "MacArthur remains in power."
 united_states_events.116.b: "MacArthur gives up power."

 united_states_events.117.t: "Democracy Triumphs"
 united_states_events.117.d: "At long last, the Republic has been saved. The radicals from both the left and the right which tried to destroy America have been defeated.\n\nWe may have been battered and bruised but democracy has been saved."
 united_states_events.117.a: "God Bless America."

 united_states_events.118.t: "Malice or Charity?"
 united_states_events.118.d: "The question of what to do with those that fought against the government has to be decided.\n\nShall we offer clemency to those that fought against the government and try and rehabilitate them back into society or shall they be punished for their actions against America?"
 united_states_events.118.a: "Charity."
 united_states_events.118.b: "Malice."

 united_states_events.119.t: "The Fate of the Electoral College"
 united_states_events.119.d: "As we work to strengthen democracy following the civil war, the question of the Electoral College has been brought up.\n\nMany are calling for the end to the first-past-the-post system, which would be replaced by a simpler national popular voting system. A majority of Congress believes that we should keep FPTP around as a safeguard against radicalism in the future. What should we do?"
 united_states_events.119.a: "Abolish the College."
 united_states_events.119.b: "The Electoral College stays."

 united_states_events.120.t: "National Rehabilitation"
 united_states_events.120.d: "While we root out those that continue to still fight on for their treasonous cause, the question has come before MacArthur about what to do to those that have laid down their arms.\n\nSome of his advisors are suggesting clemency, others suggest they must be imprisoned for their actions. What shall the commander in chief choose?"
 united_states_events.120.a: "Down with the Traitors."
 united_states_events.120.b: "We have spilt enough blood."

 united_states_events.121.t: "Reconcile with Washington?"
 united_states_events.121.d: "The tyrant MacArthur has done the unthinkable and has stepped down from power. Thus a debate has arisen about if we should reunite and make America whole.\n\nMany believe that even though MacArthur has stepped down from power, he still has control and that he won't hesitate to re-assume power should politics don't go his way."
 united_states_events.121.a: "Let us reunite with Washington (Game Over)"
 united_states_events.121.b: "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

 united_states_events.122.t: "America Is Reunited!"
 united_states_events.122.d: "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America.\n\nThe military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
 united_states_events.122.a: "From Sea to shining Sea!"

 united_states_events.123.t: "No Reconciliation"
 united_states_events.123.d: "Since MacArthur stepped down many wondered if the country would be whole again. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us.\n\nIn their senate, they denounced Congress as just being a pawn of MacArthur who they still regard as a tyrant despite the fact he saved the country."
 united_states_events.123.a: "America one day shall be reunited."

 united_states_events.125.t: "The National Labor Relations Board"
 united_states_events.125.d: "With the civil war over and reconstruction now under way, the question of trade unions have been brought up. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThis board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed together. Congress has decided to...?"
 united_states_events.125.a: "Accept the AFL into the NLRB."
 united_states_events.125.b: "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

 united_states_events.127.t: "The Red Scare"
 united_states_events.127.d.macarthur: "Since MacArthur has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism. They are, after all, the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must know the role that they played in the conflict.\n\nNow, as the so-called \"red scare\" begins, many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
 united_states_events.127.d.elected: "Since the election of [USA.GetLeader], the government of the United States has begun a campaign against socialists of all stripes. They were one of the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must understand their role.\n\nMoreover, socialists and syndicalists must not allow their subversion to survive and as such as the so-called \"red scare\" begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
 united_states_events.127.a: "Better Dead than Red."

 united_states_events.128.t: "Lavender Scare"
 united_states_events.128.d: "With the so-called Red Scare under way, [USA.GetLeader] has passed Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include \"Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion\". This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual.\n\nThe press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocrisy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, has long been rumoured to be in the closet with his secretary Clyde Tolson. As Director of the most important intelligence agency, Hoover is of course beyond investigation. Even if we were to, J. Edgar probably has much more dirt on us than we have on him."
 united_states_events.128.a: "Let's not investigate J. Edgar Hoover."

 united_states_events.134.t: "The Great Migration"
 united_states_events.134.d: "As MacArthur has not given up power, a large number of Americans have made their way to [migrate.GetNameDef] - which is occupying American land and desecrating the flag and everything we hold dear.\n\nThe question, however, is what shall we do in regard to this \"Great Migration\"? Should we let these traitors freely go and present a security risk, or shall we use the army to capture and detain as many as possible?"
 united_states_events.134.a: "They shall not leave."
 united_states_events.134.b: "Let them go."

 united_states_events.135.t: "Refugees from MacArthur"
 united_states_events.135.d.let_go: "As expected, the tyrant Douglas MacArthur has refused to give up his grip on power. As such a large wave of Americans are making their way across the [Root.GetAdjective] border where they will find a new life out of MacArthur's shadow.\n\nMoreover, military leaders believe that we shall be able to make use of this intel and use it against [USA.GetNameDef], if it comes to that."
 united_states_events.135.d.army: "As expected, the tyrant Douglas MacArthur has refused to give up his grip on power. A wave of migrants and refugees have come across the [Root.GetAdjective] border.\n\nWhile we and our special services have done what we could to bring them across, MacArthur used his army upon many, massacring them like the butcher that he is. However, this has only fuelled people's desire to see MacArthur punished."
 united_states_events.135.a: "Welcome to [Root.GetNameDef]"

 united_states_events.136.t: "The Provisional President"
 united_states_events.136.d: "With democracy now restored to the country, a question remains: who shall lead the country until the next election?\n\nMacArthur has picked two candidates who could serve in that role and submitted their names to Congress: Senator Arthur Vandenberg of the Republicans and former House Speaker John Nance Garner of the Democrats. Both of these figures supported MacArthur's emergency government, and although their image among anti-MacArthurites has suffered by his association with this handover, Congress and General MacArthur hope that the country will be able to unite behind their choice as a lawful civilian president."
 united_states_events.136.a: "Welcome, President Vandenberg."
 united_states_events.136.b: "Welcome, President Garner."

 united_states_events.152.t: "NAACP and FBI Defame Socialists"
 united_states_events.152.d: "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African-American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African-Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defense, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters.\n\nSeeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist public relations campaign.

A proposed civil works programme to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace.\n\nThe Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land. Conservative Democrats oppose such intrusions as these, saying that it violates states' rights to govern trade.

Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun.\n\nThe site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste.

Garner's choice of Sam Rayburn came with the implicit understanding that Rayburn's position meant very little to the executive branch.\n\nThis is why today's newspaper of Rayburn coming out to criticises Garner for failing to appease radicals was so shocking.

Speaking in favour of integration in the military, and also getting a few jabs at Republicans and Democrats for failing to protect black voters from the SPA.\n\nHis speech ended with a support for Jewish rights to democracy, and forewarned that socialists would target them next if antisemitism reached the levels of racism in America.

A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works.\n\nPresident Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan.

A controversial and much maligned figure in the years leading up to his death, Smith lived his last years in relative obscurity in New York, avoiding much public attention during the long years of the civil war.\n\nThe former president passed away at 6:45 A.M. after suffering a heart attack earlier in the morning. Since May, Smith's health has been on the decline, primarily due to the passing of the former First Lady. Diagnosed with heat exhaustion by his personal physician Dr. Raymond P. Sullivan, Smith remained away from public life as some of the nation's top physicians attempted to alleviate his conditions. As the former president's condition became increasingly critical, a call went out for Bishop Francis A. McIntyre to administer the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn spite of the inspirational nature of Smith's humble rise from newsboy and fishmonger to governor and president, he is despised in many circles of American life. Held responsible by many for the civil war, many of Smith's accomplishments, such as the recovery of the economy prior to Black Monday and the passage of the Costigan-Wagner Anti-Lynching Act, have been overshadowed by his presidency's ignominious end.

Pledging to keep the same liberal reforms as his predecessor, Roosevelt's Fair Deal aims to restore confidence in the economy and the federal government despite the recent civil war. The son of the former American president Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt, \"Bullmoose Jr.\" hopes to lead the Republicans in the first election since the tragic months of 1937.\n\nLong meanwhile seeks to take advantage of continued discontent with the economy by once again putting forward his \"Share Our Wealth\" platform. Promising that significant redistribution of wealth will prevent a return to the dark days of the depression, Long is a formidable opponent to the incumbent, and many regard him as a hero for recognising the syndicalist threat early on and securing the south for the federal camp.\n\nWith the full resumption of free elections once more in the United States, the time has come for American voters to make their decisions at polls across the country.

Despite the reactionary and radical elements that sought to undermine American freedom, in the true spirit of democracy - the Republican President Landon has announced that the 1940 elections will proceed as usual. Seeking a second term, most observers have predicted that Landon will secure the White House for another four years. The wartime presidency has shown remarkable resilience and determination in the face of such a national crisis. At a time when Americans held such little faith in their government, it was Landon's voice on the radio that encouraged loyalists to remain loyal to the federal government.\n\nRunning against him will be Wendell Willkie of the Democratic Party. While few think that the Democratic Party will be able to contest the popularity of the Republican leadership, it is never too late for a comeback. The lawyer and former executive has vowed to carry on President Landon's policies regarding government social security and has promised a program of full employment based on cooperation between the private and public sectors. Willkie's platform also advocates for America's growing role in the world and, surprisingly for a Democrat, support for the civil rights movement, vowing that he will see the integration of the American Armed Forces.\n\nWith the full resumption of free elections in the United States, the time has come for American voters to make their decisions at polls across the country.

 united_states_events.253.a: "Excellent!"

 united_states_events.255.t: "Benefits of the League"
 united_states_events.255.d: "As the number of members in the League of American States changes, so do the benefits we derive from it."
 united_states_events.255.a: "OK."

 united_states_events.256.t: "American Imperialism"
 united_states_events.256.d: "Just as some had feared, the Americans are slowly insinuating themselves into every level of the [Root.GetAdjective] government. Within a few months, they will have complete control over us.\n\nOur only option is to kick them out and renounce our membership in the League... but that will almost certainly bring the Americans down upon us."
 united_states_events.256.a: "Of course we must resist!"
 united_states_events.256.b: "There is nothing we can do."

 united_states_events.257.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Resistance"
 united_states_events.257.d: "Perhaps foolishly, the [From.GetAdjective] government has noticed our plans for a coup, and has both renounced membership in the League of American States as well as ejected almost every American official they can find.\n\nThis, of course, gives us every excuse to take action against them... if we so desire."
 united_states_events.257.a: "What do they hope to gain?"

 united_states_events.258.t: "An American Puppet"
 united_states_events.258.d: "It has come to pass: the legitimate [Root.GetAdjective] government has been replaced by one approved of by the Americans and under their control.\n\nWe are now a colony of [From.From.GetNameDef]."
 united_states_events.258.a: "We welcome our new overlords."

 united_states_events.259.t.country_leaves: "Leaving the League of American States"
 united_states_events.259.d.USA_dead: "Despite rebuilding itself from the horrors of the Second American Civil War, it would appear that the United States has once again fallen - only at the hands of a foreign occupier.\n\nWith the collapse of the North American colossus, it would appear that the military and economic might of the United States are not a credible enough force to hold together the League of American States. With this final defeat of the American government, the League's existence has officially ended."
 united_states_events.259.d.USA_puppet: "Despite the industrial might and power of the United States, they have been vanquished and are now the de facto puppet of a foreign nation. With the strength of the United States entirely subdued, they no longer have the power and authority to hold together the League of American States. With this final defeat of the American government, the League's existence has officially ended."
 united_states_events.259.d.USA_in_faction: "In their changing world alignment, the United States government has announced their entry into the [USA.GetFactionName].\n\nWith their ties with this faction solidified, they have declared that they will no longer be willing to lead the League of American States. With this revision in American foreign policy, the League's existence has officially ended."
 united_states_events.259.d.USA_war: "With the outbreak of war between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and the United States of America, all cordial and economic ties established by the League of American States have officially ended between the two nations.\n\nThe United States has stated that in response to the belligerent status between the countries, [ROOT.GetNameDef] has been formally removed from the League of American States."
 united_states_events.259.d.puppet: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has come under the domination of a foreign power, and its independence has now been reduced to that of a puppet.\n\nWith their government's new reorganisation, they are now the responsibility of their occupiers. As they are no longer capable of partaking in their own international affairs, they will no longer be members of the League of American States."
 united_states_events.259.d.in_faction: "Citing growing world tensions and a desire to be safe, [ROOT.GetNameDef] has aligned itself with the [ROOT.GetFactionName].\n\nAs a result of their shift in foreign policy and allies, they will no longer be associated with membership in the League of American States. As of today, they have officially exited the American faction."
 united_states_events.259.d.invalid_government: "It appears that radicals have overtaken the government of [ROOT.GetNameDef], bringing their current government to one that is incompatible with forming ties with the United States.\n\nTheir new government poses a threat to the democratic integrity of the League of American States, and as such, we will not recognise the new regime that has taken place in their country. As a result of this sudden change in political alignment, they will no longer be members of the League of American States."
 united_states_events.259.a: "Very well."

 united_states_events.260.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Advisors?"
 united_states_events.260.d: "Since we are both comrades-in-arms against the same foes, [From.GetNameDef] has offered to send military advisors our way, suggesting we should work more closely in the war effort."
 united_states_events.260.a: "Of course!"
 united_states_events.260.b: "They can keep their \"advisors\"."

 united_states_events.261.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 united_states_events.261.d: "Perhaps believing our advisors to be spies, or simply not trusting our motives, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer."
 united_states_events.261.a: "Their loss."

 united_states_events.262.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 united_states_events.262.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] has readily agreed to our offer, and the advisors are already en route."
 united_states_events.262.a: "Excellent."

 united_states_events.270.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Asks for New England"
 united_states_events.270.d: "With the civil war now over, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to ask for the return of New England. We had intervened in the region to protect our interests, but with [From.GetNameDef]'s victory in the civil war, they - as the claimant to American legitimacy - are asking for New England's rightful return.\n\nTheir ambassador has stressed that war is rather likely should we refuse. What shall our response be?"
 united_states_events.270.a: "This is not worth a war."
 united_states_events.270.b: "We cannot entrust New England to them."

 united_states_events.271.t: "New England Rejoins America"
 united_states_events.271.d: "The Canadians have withdrawn their troops from Boston and the cities of New England and have stated their occupation is over and that they were just keeping the region safe from Syndicalism.\n\nNew England has at least been reunited with the rest of America."
 united_states_events.271.a: "God Bless America."

 united_states_events.272.t: "Canada Refuses"
 united_states_events.272.d: "Canada has informed us that they shall not return New England to us.\n\nThis has caused many within Congress to demand war to reclaim our rightful territory, though shall we go to war right now?"
 united_states_events.272.a: "Then it shall be war."
 united_states_events.272.b: "We shall bide our time."

 united_states_events.273.d: "With the civil war now over, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to ask for the return of Alaska. We had seized it to protect our interests, but with [From.GetNameDef]'s victory in the civil war, they - as the claimant to American legitimacy - are asking for Alaska to be returned.\n\nTheir ambassador has stressed that war is rather likely if we refuse. What shall our response be?"
 united_states_events.273.a: "We shall return it."
 united_states_events.273.b: "We shall not return it."

 united_states_events.281.d.middle: "This has followed weeks of other, smaller feelers by the [FROM.GetAdjective] at our embassy in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nAn acceptance on our part would secure a major diplomatic victory for the [ROOT.GetFactionName] and may help stabilise our geopolitical situation, particularly in the Americas. In private however there have been concerns that another major power may weaken our grip over the alliance as a whole and tie our fate to a nation still recovering from a devastating civil war.\n\nWith that in mind, after careful deliberations, we are forced to prepare a final response."
 united_states_events.281.d.britain: "President [From.GetLeader] has asked the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador to meet with King [ROOT.GetLeader] and Prime Minister [GetSecondInCommand] to begin preliminary discussions about bringing [From.GetNameDef] into the [Root.GetFactionName]. $united_states_events.281.d.middle$ We have long cultivated close relations with the Americans, in part due to the realities of sharing a long Canadian-American border. Finalising an alliance in many ways is the logical final step in preserving stability in a changing world."
 united_states_events.281.d.france: "President [From.GetLeader] has asked the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador to meet with [ROOT.GetLeader] and his staff to begin preliminary discussions about bringing [From.GetNameDef] into the [Root.GetFactionName]. $united_states_events.281.d.middle$ Located far across the ocean, American aloofness has always been a sore spot in Franco-American relations, and such a pact will almost certainly tip the balance of our alliance back towards Anglo-spheric advantage. Still, we were one of their first allies in their independence war, and perhaps this is finally their chance to repay the favour."
 united_states_events.281.d.germany: "President [From.GetLeader] has asked the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador to meet with Kaiser [ROOT.GetLeader] and Chancellor [GetSecondInCommand] to begin preliminary discussions about bringing [From.GetNameDef] into the [Root.GetFactionName].$united_states_events.281.d.middle$ Accepting such an arrangement certainly is a contentious issue. It would bring the usually isolationist Americans onto the world stage, and it is not entirely clear how long they will tolerate our undisputed leadership. Still, their entry would ensure the [ROOT.GetFactionName]'s continued and global presence across the world."
 united_states_events.281.d.other: "President [From.GetLeader] has asked the [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador to meet with [ROOT.GetLeader] to begin preliminary discussions about forming an alliance between America and [Root.GetNameDef]. This has followed weeks of other, smaller feelers by the [FROM.GetAdjective] at our embassy in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nDespite the devastation of the civil war, it appears for the most part stability has been re-established in the troubled nation. Given its natural resources and geopolitical position, it is likely [FROM.GetNameDef] will return to a place of prominence in world affairs, and a pact with them will bolster our efforts at preserving mutual security.\n\nThat said, as we deliberate on a final response, there have been some concerns about the nature of this alliance, and how truly equal of a partnership it would entail."
 united_states_events.281.a: "Of course! We welcome them."
 united_states_events.281.b: "We have no need of them."

 united_states_events.282.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 united_states_events.282.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance.\n\nPerhaps we are not good enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."

 united_states_events.283.t: "Congress Confirms MacArthur's Appointment"
 united_states_events.283.d: "General MacArthur's \"temporary\" occupation of the Washington has led not to a calming of tensions, but a fiery shockwave of resistance all across the nation. With the situation worse than any in D.C. could have predicted, MacArthur has taked the steps necessary to legitimise his regime. MacArthur has had a sympathetic member of the removed president's cabinet appoint him as Secretary of State, an appointment confirmed quickly by a session of a rump Senate shorn of its SPA, Farmer-Labor, and Longist members. As such, MacArthur now claims that, according to the Presidential Succession Act of 1886, since the presidency and vice presidency are vacant, he is the highest ranking official in the line of succession, and therefore the acting president.\n\nThough it is expected that a more sturdy constitutional justification for the military administration will be devised in due time, MacArthur has been hurriedly sworn in in the midst of his preparations for incoming civil war, and has addressed the nation, reminding all \"traitors\" that they still have time to lay down their arms."
 united_states_events.283.a: "We need hard men for hard times."
 united_states_events.283.b: "A barefaced assault on the Constitution!"

 united_states_events.300.d: "We are having our best scientists and business leaders look into what we should invest our efforts into guns, artillery, tanks, our improving our own doctrines.\n\nWhat should we choose?"

 united_states_events.300.b: "Modernise our Artillery."

 united_states_events.300.e: "Modernise our Doctrines."

 united_states_events.301.t: "Full Utilisation of Force"
 united_states_events.301.d: "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell.\n\nAt the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."
 united_states_events.301.a: "Lawrence Bell's Jet."
 united_states_events.301.b: "Oppenheimer's Atom Bomb."
 united_states_events.301.c: "Authorise more funds for both."

 united_states_events.302.t: "Albuquerque Project"
 united_states_events.302.d: "Bell's X project has proceeded satisfactorily, with a successful implementation of rocket technology into planes being able to double the speed of older aircraft.\n\nBrave test pilot Jack Woolams today was the first person to fly the plane faster than 741 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier."
 united_states_events.302.a: "Prepared for even Interplanetary War."

 united_states_events.303.t: "Winchester Project"
 united_states_events.303.d: "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project.\n\nThis makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
 united_states_events.303.a: "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

 united_states_events.304.t: "The War and Peace Studies"
 united_states_events.304.d: "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts.\n\nThis is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
 united_states_events.304.a: "Constrained by diplomats no more."

 united_states_events.305.t: "The White House and Xanadu"
 united_states_events.305.d: "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction.\n\nA beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilising factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
 united_states_events.305.a: "We appreciate your support."

 united_states_events.306.t: "The New Normal in America"
 united_states_events.306.d: "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time, hundreds of thousands of Americans were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state.\n\nThese past few years have seen a great many galvanise into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."
 united_states_events.306.a: "Endorse the new supporters."
 united_states_events.306.b: "Refuse this congressional oeuvre."

 united_states_events.308.t: "Superweapons on a Budget"
 united_states_events.308.d: "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives.\n\nThe second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."

 united_states_events.308.f: "Decline — we already possess the ultimate weapon."

 united_states_events.309.t: "Goddard's Successful Launch"
 united_states_events.309.d: "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height.\n\nNow the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
 united_states_events.309.a: "Good boy Goddard."

 united_states_events.310.t: "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
 united_states_events.310.d: "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project.\n\nAfter a long period of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
 united_states_events.310.a: "The breath goes now."

 united_states_events.311.t: "Reich's Failed Explosion"
 united_states_events.311.d: "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project has been discontinued and it seems millions of dollars have been wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see.\n\nThe bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
 united_states_events.311.a: "Not our proudest moment."

### New Pre-ACW Events ###
 united_states_events.500.t: "Garner-McNary Bill Introduced"
 united_states_events.500.d: "With the blessing of President Smith, Republican Senator Charles McNary and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have introduced a new unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it.\n\nThe presence of Senators from the Farmer-Labor Party, particularly in the SPA, as well as those aligned with Huey Long complicates things immensely. Even with Smith's support, it's unknown if Garner-McNary has a real chance of passing."
 united_states_events.500.a: "We shall see."

 united_states_events.501.t: "Long and Farmer-Labor Demand Changes"
 united_states_events.501.d: "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-McNary Bill have come from the Longists and Farmer-Labor. Huey Long and his informal caucus have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. John Reed and the SPA, meanwhile, scoff at the provisions of the bill, which they say does little to protect workers or fundamentally change the reality of the depression.\n\nThough not as set against the bill as their radical comrades in the SPA, the non-socialist Farmer-Labor caucus is sympathetic to Reed's view, and will have to be accommodated if they are to be swayed to our side. All three groups have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
 united_states_events.501.a: "Interesting."

 united_states_events.502.t: "Senators Break Ranks"
 united_states_events.502.d: "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-McNary Bill - most notably Democratic Senator Robert Wagner, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added.\n\nMany other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the Longists and Farmer-Labor, and claim they will not vote for the bill if any concessions at all are made to either group. Others say that not courting either the Longists or Farmer-Labor will make passage difficult, if not impossible. President Smith will need to intervene in order to save the bill."
 united_states_events.502.a: "Pledge support to Wagner and the establishment Senators."
 united_states_events.502.b: "Force the establishment to compromise with the Longists."
 united_states_events.502.c: "Force the establishment to compromise with Farmer-Labor."

 united_states_events.503.t: "Anti-Establishment Forces Furious"
 united_states_events.503.d: "Both Huey Long and the Farmer-Labor Party have reacted with fury at President Smith's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-McNary Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a \"corrupt government which refuses to recognise the reality of America\".\n\nWhile both Long and Farmer-Labor have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
 united_states_events.503.a: "Let's hope it does!"

 united_states_events.504.t: "Compromise with Long"
 united_states_events.504.d: "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and Huey Long, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as Long originally demanded. Even so, Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls.\n\nBoth John Reed's SPA and a large number of Republican and Farmer-Labor Senators and Representatives have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-McNary bill when the vote comes."
 united_states_events.504.a: "We've done what we can..."

 united_states_events.505.t: "Compromise with Farmer-Labor"
 united_states_events.505.d: "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the Farmer-Labor Party, with numerous extra provisions included for worker protections and unemployment relief - though nowhere near as far as Farmer-Labor originally demanded. Even so, John Reed has still declared his opposition to the bill, and more belligerent supporters of Farmer-Labor have flocked to the SPA over the moderates' \"betrayal\" of the American working class.\n\nA large number of Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives, including Huey Long and his supporters, have also declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-McNary bill when the vote comes."
 united_states_events.505.a: "We've done what we can..."

 united_states_events.506.t: "Voting Commences on the Garner-McNary Bill"
 united_states_events.506.d: "Voting has now begun on the Garner-McNary Bill. With Congress divided between radical and establishment Senators, whether or not the bill will pass is anything but certain.\n\nEven if the bill passes, the question of where its funding will come from remains without an answer - however, if it fails, the consequences will be disastrous and widespread violence can be expected."
 united_states_events.506.a: "... the bill is approved!"
 united_states_events.506.b: "... the bill is shot down!"

 united_states_events.507.t: "The Garner-McNary Bill Passes!"
 united_states_events.507.d: "Though the vote was incredibly close, the Garner-McNary bill has passed Congress.\n\nPeople throughout the United States are celebrating this welcome relief to the country's disastrous economic situation, though many within the government are wondering: how will the bill now be paid for?"
 united_states_events.507.a: "A victory for us all!"

 united_states_events.508.t: "The Garner-McNary Bill Fails!"
 united_states_events.508.d: "After an incredibly close vote in Congress, the Garner-McNary bill failed to pass. While several groups are declaring personal victory, protests have broken out in various parts of the country. There will be no relief for the American worker, and many have declared the government to be corrupt and dysfunctional.\n\nThere will be considerable time for blame, but for the moment the Smith Administration's concerns must turn to the growing violence throughout American cities - violence which is expected to only worsen in the months leading up to the election."
 united_states_events.508.a: "All that for nothing..."

 united_states_events.509.t: "War Plan White"
 united_states_events.509.d: "The time has come to dust off one of the American military's colour-coded war plans, this one meant for dealing with domestic disturbances and insurgencies. It cannot come a moment too soon, as violence is escalating in areas where the Longists and the SPA have been contending with local authorities for dominance.\n\nMinnesota and North Carolina are the two states where the violence is at its height, and - at the moment - we can only focus our efforts in one place."
 united_states_events.509.a: "Focus on the SPA in Minnesota."
 united_states_events.509.b: "Focus on the Longists in North Carolina."

 united_states_events.510.t: "Bringing out the National Guard"
 united_states_events.510.d: "The National Guard has been deployed for over six months now, fighting to maintain security in a number of American cities, but there is a growing fear that commanders within the Guard are not entirely loyal to the Republic, that many harbour sympathies for the Longists and the SPA.\n\nMore focus needs to be put on strengthening the units we know are loyal. We also need to decide where to focus their deployment, for the time being."
 united_states_events.510.a: "Focus on restoring order in Minnesota."
 united_states_events.510.b: "Focus on restoring order in Iowa."
 united_states_events.510.c: "Focus on restoring order in Tennessee."

 united_states_events.511.t: "General MacArthur's Plan"
 united_states_events.511.d: "There is growing concern that America is descending into a possible civil war, and that - despite all our efforts to maintain security - supporters of Huey Long and the SPA simply have too much influence in some parts of the country. General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas.\n\nBoth are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the Longists and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."
 united_states_events.511.a: "New York City is of vital importance."
 united_states_events.511.b: "We absolutely need that Texan oil."

 united_states_events.512.t: "The Barkley Plan"
 united_states_events.512.d: "Alben Barkley, Democrat and junior Senator for Kentucky, has introduced a bill which will see the relief efforts largely funded by taxing American corporations - in exchange for hefty tax considerations down the line, once the economy has recovered. This has caused considerable controversy in some corners, especially among Longist and SPA supporters.\n\nOthers say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolis or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are now Longist and SPA strongholds."
 united_states_events.512.a: "Base the agency in Minneapolis."
 united_states_events.512.b: "Base the agency in Charlotte."

 united_states_events.513.t: "The New Industrial Act"
 united_states_events.513.d: "As an offshoot of the Barkley Plan, relief efforts will see new industrial growth in several vital areas - primarily in the military sector. Several of these new companies are planned for Denver, Colorado.\n\nAt least one other area can be promoted, and the cabinet believes that putting them in depressed areas which are currently strongholds of the Longists or SPA may see their influence in those areas drastically weakened."
 united_states_events.513.a: "Promote the industry in Minnesota."
 united_states_events.513.b: "Promote the industry in Iowa."
 united_states_events.513.c: "Promote the industry in Tennessee."

 united_states_events.514.t: "The Shipyard Funding Scheme"
 united_states_events.514.d: "The Barkley Plan has led to two major shipbuilding companies vying for a federal contract, one in New York City and the other in Corpus Christi. Both would mean a large number of jobs for the area, and would be a boon for our control over the region.\n\nThe problem is that word of the contract has gotten out, and whichever city we *don't* choose will likely be enraged, giving strength to the Longists or the SPA in the region."
 united_states_events.514.a: "Give the contract to New York City."
 united_states_events.514.b: "Give the contract to Corpus Christi."

 united_states_events.515.t: "America Demands Port Fees"
 united_states_events.515.d: "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the port fees incurred by us in the years following the British Revolution. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has, to an extent, avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the fees... not all at once, at least.\n\nSince the retreat of the Royal Navy, there has been a tacit agreement that the fees wouldn't be fully repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."
 united_states_events.515.a: "Whatever the reason, we cannot do as they demand."

 united_states_events.516.t: "Canada Refuses"
 united_states_events.516.d: "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The fees, they say, were never meant to be fully repaid until the Home Islands were retaken.\n\nEven so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Smith's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."
 united_states_events.516.a: "So be it."

 united_states_events.517.t: "Compromise with America?"
 united_states_events.517.d: "There has been a break in the chilly relations with the American government since their demand for port fee repayment. They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the fees being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with.\n\nIt might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbours, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shovelling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."
 united_states_events.517.a: "We agree to the compromise."
 united_states_events.517.b: "They are on their own."

 united_states_events.518.t: "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
 united_states_events.518.d: "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what payment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all.\n\nThe main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the Longists and Farmer-Labor, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
 united_states_events.518.a: "We'll take what we can get."

 united_states_events.519.t: "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
 united_states_events.519.d: "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides. The chance of this escalating to war is slight, but the damage is done.\n\nWe'll have to be satisfied with the gains we've made, and the increased revenue from the tariffs."
 united_states_events.519.a: "It was worth a try."

 united_states_events.530.t: "An Envoy from the East"
 united_states_events.530.d: "Ever since word arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] regarding General MacArthur willingly stepping down from power out east, we have wondered if we would hear from the new government. The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government.\n\nThey wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Reed, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"
 united_states_events.530.a: "MacArthur did America a favour - we will rejoin, no questions asked."
 united_states_events.530.b: "Yes, let them know we demand MacArthur be imprisoned first."
 united_states_events.530.c: "We do not trust them, now or ever."

 united_states_events.531.t: "The West Refuses to Meet"
 united_states_events.531.d: "Sadly, [ACC.GetNameDef] has refused to meet with us.\n\nIn the word of their letter: they simply don't believe we have regained true democracy."
 united_states_events.531.a: "So be it."

 united_states_events.532.t: "On One Condition..."
 united_states_events.532.d: "[ACC.GetNameDefCap] seems amenable to rejoining [ROOT.GetNameDef]... on one condition: that MacArthur be imprisoned and put on trial as a traitor. According to [FROM.GetNameDef], he is as much responsible for the death and destruction of the civil war as Reed and Long, and so long as he is not held to the same example as those men they cannot trust that our return to democracy is real.\n\nIt could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us. To repay him this way seems almost unthinkable."
 united_states_events.532.a: "For the good of America, let it be done."
 united_states_events.532.b: "MacArthur is a goddamn hero - refuse."

 united_states_events.533.t: "There Will Be No Deal"
 united_states_events.533.d: "The American government has responded to our demand with abject refusal. General Douglas MacArthur, they say, is a hero, one they see as having saved the country from syndicalism and radicalism, and one who gave up power once his duty was done.\n\nThey would rather go to war than see his accomplishments denigrated."
 united_states_events.533.a: "Then war it is."

 united_states_events.534.t: "The Federal Government Agrees"
 united_states_events.534.d: "While they are reluctant, for the sake of America the Federal government has agreed to our demand.\n\nOther matters will need to be addressed over time, but for the time being the General has been arrested and will await trial once we have rejoined the country."
 united_states_events.534.a: "God Bless America!!"

 united_states_events.535.t: "Our Brothers Have Returned"
 united_states_events.535.d: "It seems [ACC.GetNameDef] has been awaiting our call, and they have answered it in the affirmative.\n\nDemocracy has been restored across America, safe from syndicalism and radicals, and together we shall walk into the future."
 united_states_events.535.a: "God Bless America!!"

 united_states_events.536.t: "America Reunited!"
 united_states_events.536.d.full: "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, [ACC.GetNameDef] has agreed to a full peace with the east and has rejoined the federation.\n\nCrowds have filled the streets of cities from one end of America to the other, jubilant at the news that there will be no war and the Second American Civil War is now truly over."
 united_states_events.536.d.arrest: "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, the West Coast's only condition was that General Douglas MacArthur be arrested and tried for treason, naming him as much a traitor as Huey Long and John Reed, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued.\n\nThe news of his arrest triggered as many angry demonstrations by his supporters as celebrations at the West Coast's agreement to rejoin. It will likely take years for MacArthur's case to go to trial, and without a doubt will be a sensation, but for now the American Civil War is truly over."

 united_states_events.538.d.1936: "America had a brief period of calm today with a mostly peaceful Independence Day celebration. Commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 by the Second Continental Congress on the eve of the American Revolutionary war, the holiday is one of great importance to the American people. While many were worried that the rising tensions in America would result in yet another bout of violence in the long and brutal election season, most sighed a breath of relief today as the news reported little brawling during the annual celebration.\n\nWhile all the major candidates made sure to be seen and photographed among the large crowds and delivered speeches connecting their respective causes to the situation in 1776, most Americans took the time to take a break from the intense politics plaguing America. Instead they decided to just spend time with their families and friends amidst picnics and fireworks. It would seem for a brief moment, that America had finally received something it had lacked for a very long time... unity."
 united_states_events.538.d.1937_USA_democratic: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President [Root.GetLeader] took to the air waves today in a widely-listened to broadcast in which he extolled American virtues and sacrifices while at war. He noted that July 4th was a day the disparate 13 colonies came together as one, and to found the great nation that Americans are now fighting for. To build a nation founded on democracy, prosperity, and unity.\n\nThat despite their many differences, the founders were willing to put that aside and work peacefully to not only defend against British oppression, but also build a project to last generations. The radicals, he says, have sought to topple that peace and unity, to curtail democratic expression and replace voting with violence when they didn't get their way. So, one more time, Americans must come together and fend off those who would destroy the American way of life."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war.\n\nToday, America celebrates the anniversary of America's founding in the middle of civil war. Seeking to emulate General Washington's July 9th reading of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Army gathered in New York City and rally the American people once again, President MacArthur has decided to deliver a speech before Federalist troops today. Noting that Washington had delivered his address even with British troops in the harbour, MacArthur reaffirmed that the United States military had always fought for American liberty and would continue to do so into the 20th century. Likening Congress's grant of emergency powers to him to Washington's commission as Commander-in-Chief, MacArthur concluded his speech by promising the American people to restore order to the Union."
 united_states_events.538.d.1937_WCA: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. While President Reed had hoped to make his address near Independence Hall in Philadelphia, his staff dissuaded him from the plan. Instead, Reed has elected to speak before assembled leaders at a local union chapter.\n\nDespite the relatively humble setting, the crowd watched with rapt attention. He noted that back in the day Americans had found themselves chafing under greed and neglect, and on this day they had formally organised for freedom from their chains. Noting that the first declaration had 27 points of grievances against the British, to roaring applause Reed pulled out a list of 27 grievances the modern worker had and declared that the WCA would continue to fight on for a new America!"
 united_states_events.538.d.1937_APG: "Since the start of hostilities this year, many Americans held onto the false hope that the violence would settle down quickly and the politicians would find a solution without war. However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President Huey Long made an address before a cheering crowd of supporters. While minutemen standing behind him scanned the rally for any would-be assassins, the crowd remained enthralled by the power of Long's voice. Long pointed out that in 1776, Americans were ruled by corrupt British oligarchs backed by the ruthless bayonets of the Redcoats.\n\nDespite the long odds however, American patriots rose up and drove out not only the British but their treacherous loyalists. Today he says, is no different. Americans must remain vigilant against the avaricious elite and their collaborators, and the modern minutemen stand ready to save America once again! Just as he finished, the fireworks show began behind him, much to the crowd's delight."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Today President [Root.GetLeader] has made an address before the provisional United States Congress. He said that in 1776, the Continental Congress declared war against tyranny and sought to preserve the rights of Americans, and soon became a beacon of liberty for many others. He emphasised that it was a democratically elected legislature, not a general or political strongman, who authorised the declaration of freedom.\n\nToday, he says, America finds itself once again at war against tyranny, fighting against forces willing to extinguish the flames of liberty. The President concluded by declaring that once America had vanquished the dictators in the East the restored constitutional government would once again live up to the Founder's dream of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, and moreover from Sea to Shining Sea."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. Some say New England was lucky to have avoided directly participating in the war. However, the atmosphere has remained tense and war looms on the horizon. While many detractors have pointed out the irony in celebrating the Fourth of July in the midst of a Canadian occupation, the provisional government in New England had sought to combat the perception of being a Canadian puppet by putting on a memorable Fourth of July celebration.\n\nSpeaking before Bunker Hill monument, President [Root.GetLeader] delivered his address by recalling the sacrifices Americans made in order to protect the liberty and prosperity of the nation, bravely waiting until they could see the whites in their enemies eyes before firing their limited ammunition. He went on to stress that Americans and Canadians were working now as equal partners and brothers, and that someday America would be free once more."

However, from their homes (or what is left of them), the American people continue to solemnly celebrate Independence day. President [Root.GetLeader], despite being clearly worn down from the stress of managing a civil war, took to the airwaves this year to commend Americans and thank them for continuing to believe in American democracy. He stressed that, although their soldiers may not be there to celebrate with them, they are fighting for the most sacred cause - that of liberty. Through the years, America has never stopped fighting for its democracy.\n\nNot in the highs and lows of the Revolution, not in 1812 when Washington fell, not in the Civil War.

General MacArthur proudly delivered another defiant speech to rally his men, noting that despite all the troubles and hardships, the Army of the Free always came out victorious.\n\nFrom Valley Forge, to Custer's ranks, to San Juan Hill and modern tanks. He recalled in the last civil war, that on July 4th was a turning point - the day Lee withdrew from Gettysburg and Grant took Vicksburg. The point is, he concluded, that so long as America and her army remains standing strong, the war is not over and neither is the American dream. Thanking the assembled troops and extolling their virtues, the Commander in Chief vowed that as dark as things may seem sometimes, order will be restored in America and normalcy will return."

President Reed, despite reports of ill health caused by the duration of the war, appeared in good spirits today as he addressed his people. He noted that in better days, the Fourth of July was a day to celebrate because it marked the start of the American Experiment. Although the revolution had caused much damage and suffering, Americans continued to fight on. And through the ashes were able to build a new society not seen before on Earth.\n\nThe President promised that although America is in the midst of a brutal civil war, the Second American revolution will once again build a new order out of the ashes, one that will spell both liberty and mutual prosperity for all.

President Long held a small rally today, a rare occasion these days due to the threat of bombing. Although the makeup did little to hide the bags under the President's eyes, Long spoke with as much fervour as always. The war is a time of troubles and strife no doubt, but it was that way back in the Revolution.\n\nThe Patriots have always come out on top in the end, and this time America's sons of liberty are fighting to rid America once and for all of those who would harm her - the unruly Socialists in Chicago, the decadent bankers on Wall Street, the imperious military men in Washington. The Fourth of July, the President noted, is a day patriots have always come together as one. And with God's help, he went on, when the war is over they will do so once again."

Speaking before the assembled congressmen, and knowing that his speech was being recorded for all to hear, the President noted that despite all chaos and turmoil, the democratic government in America continued to function.\n\nProof, he said, that America does not need dictatorships and tyrants in order to continue functioning. And although things could be pretty bleak, there was no shortage of people willing to continue fighting for liberty then, in 1776, and there is no shortage of people willing to fight for liberty now.

Despite the tension and the numerous refugees, the people of New England tried their best to celebrate the Fourth of July as usual.\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] delivered an address to the people, noting that New England has always been a leader in America, and is working to help ensure that America will emerge from the civil war free. In the meantime, his administration works to keep New England from invasion and to solve the lingering effects of the depression.

An uneasy ceasefire has been established between East and West in America as both sides work to stabilise their respective territories and consolidate power. Much of America on both sides remains ravaged by the bombings and fighting, and casualties have been high. Americans pray for a peaceful outcome to the standoff, hoping for a solution that sees their side come out on top while avoiding further conflict. Still, on July Fourth both sides of the border have seen their people turn out for celebration, initially muted before celebrating a Fourth of July finally free of war.\n\nThe sorrow and horror of the years before, between Depression and War, has receded for the day as people stop worrying for just a little bit. Indeed, some have speculated that maybe this peace could last with just a little bit of negotiations. Although the future remains uncertain, the politicians and generals continue to plot and plan, one thing is for certain - we are one people with a common history.

 united_states_events.538.d.post_war_NEE_exists: "The war has concluded with most of America united under one banner. However, the fate of New England is a question that remains in the air. New England is too much of an integral part of the USA for any American government to allow it to remain independent, however it remains to be seen whether or not reunification will be peaceful or not. Tensions remain in the air, however as the situation continues into July both sides of the border now celebrate the Fourth of July, a Fourth of July free of further civil war and killings (for now). While some of the more hawkish complain that, generations later Boston remains under British occupation and have tried to draw on the holiday to agitate for a violent liberation of New England, the vast majority of Americans on both sides have taken the holiday as a chance for a peaceful respite from all the troubles the last few years have caused.

With the Civil War behind them and the wounds in America's infrastructure and psyche slowly healing, America has slowly returned to a sense of normalcy. With barbecues and parades, streamers and fireworks, America commemorates their nation's founding. However, there is one part of the country where there have been no celebrations outside of military bases. Like Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold in 1775, the Americans have recently invaded their northern neighbour.\n\nUnlike their Revolutionary War predecessors however, they have successfully annexed Canada, an ambition many thought Americans had long dropped. Despite attempts to encourage the locals to participate in the festivities and the insistence of [Root.GetLeader] that America has liberated their Canada brethren from British rule at last, responses have been muted in the North. Mayors of major Canadian cities have made reticent official statements acknowledging the holiday, however it is clear that it will be many years before the Fourth of July is celebrated in Canada, if ever. For now, resistance (violent and peaceful) continues. Still, as the fireworks go off in the sky, the people living in North America look to the future, whatever is in store for the Continent."

As America moves forward with reconstruction and dealing with the politics of this new socialist American order, Americans have been allowed a respite to celebrate Independence Day. Much has changed since 1936, before the war. Buildings have been levelled, roads destroyed, people have been killed, and countless displaced. There is no shortage of reasons to grieve. Yet, today seems to be so very similar to the way things were. Americans still gather together with their friends and family (or what's left of them) and celebrate the day with music and singing.\n\nNeighbours, once bitterly divided with one another, have begun to slowly reconcile today as they celebrate not only independence but peace between men.

While there is still much to do, the United States remains a strong nation, and soon, the civil war will be a moment in the history books, a terrible fragment of the past. With this new independence day, the United States honours the restoration of the union and a new era of prosperity and freedom to come. And now, Independence Day reminds them, that once again the United States will be a beacon of democracy to the rest of the world."

 united_states_events.539.t: "MacArthur's Last Speech"
 united_states_events.539.d: "Sensing that he would soon be arrested, General Douglas MacArthur has elected to make one final speech before Congress, convincing several of his former allies to do him one last favour. Wearing his old Army uniform, the former Chief of Staff of the United States Army reflected upon the course of the war, his coming fate, and informed the audience that he would not resist arrest. Instead he said that he would accept imprisonment if it would bring the nation back together again without further bloodshed. He stated that he only did what he did in order to protect America, and was grateful for his many years in service as a \"fulfilment of his boyish hopes and dreams\".\n\nThough many in the audience clapped, critics have almost immediately lashed out, noting that MacArthur's coup helped trigger the civil war in the first place. Moreover, his speech seems to not only be a last ditch effort to gain pity (and possibly a pardon), but also appears to try taking credit for the reunification between [ACC.GetNameDef] and the Washington government, a success they argue is a credit to [Root.GetLeader] and diplomacy, not MacArthur. However, the public will probably remember MacArthur's iconic phrase he said in his speech's closing, before he turned himself into the custody of the waiting FBI..."

Both sides, exhausted of the horrendous conflict that had torn apart a nation - have indicated to one another regarding a potential unification by compromise and not arms.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, the commander in chief of the Federal Army during the civil war, shocked the American continent when he announced his resignation from the presidency. The general publicly announced his appointment of Senator Arthur Vandenberg as his successor and his subsequent withdrawal from presidential affairs. While MacArthur's retirement made him appear as a modern-day American Cincinnatus in the eyes of his followers, to some Americans, MacArthur's moves were viewed with the highest of suspicions.\n\nNonetheless, it would appear that [ACC.GetNameDef] has completely subverted MacArthur's gambit. With the American nation waiting anxiously for news of the eventual reunification, the government of [ACC.GetNameDef] sent a strongly worded note to the Federal Government - demanding that MacArthur be tried for his crimes against the American people in exchange for unification. After all, it was MacArthur's military coup of the American government in the bleak winter of 1937 that threw the nation into anarchy. But perhaps most surprising is that the general's choice, newly appointed President Arthur Vandenberg, has been one of the most vocal voices calling for MacArthur's arrest. President Vandenberg has taken to the national radio to denounce MacArthur as a Caesarean dictator, receiving praise and support from [ACC.GetNameDef].

 united_states_events.541.d: "In an ironic, perhaps fitting turn of event, the General who once deposed and imprisoned the President in a coup has now himself being arrested. With MacArthur now out of the way, the question looming in Washington is who should be President for the remainder of the 1936-1940 term. Constitutionally speaking, when the President dies or otherwise leaves office before the completion of their term, their Vice President takes up office. However, the MacArthur administration regarded both the presidency and vice presidency as vacant throughout the entire war, leaving him as acting president as secretary of state. This question has brought a new round of partisan bickering as Quentin Roosevelt and his supporters argue that he is the legitimate President of the United States and that the Sacramento Government was a continuation of the Constitutional government throughout the civil war.\n\nFor many former Federalists however, this question cuts deep into the heart of the question of the legitimacy of the Washington government during the Civil War and many argue that Roosevelt's challenge threatens to destabilise the peace and reconciliation process. It would be better to instead allow for Acting President [Root.GetLeader] to serve out the remainder of the term until new elections can be held. Thankfully, both sides have decided to resolve this question peacefully and it has quickly went before the Supreme Court.

 united_states_events.600.t: "Status of the US Army"
 united_states_events.600.d: "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago.\n\nPrevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with very few tanks and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."
 united_states_events.600.a: "They'll have to suffice."

 united_states_events.601.t: "Status of the US Navy"
 united_states_events.601.d: "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defence establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas.\n\nAll is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. The new dreadnoughts have been commissioned at the suggestion of senator Benjamin Tillman, along with many projects of the twenties converted to aircraft carriers due to the Great Depression, but the Navy is nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet.\n\nThe Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locales, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington, D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm on the horizon."

 united_states_events.602.t: "Army Doctrinal Debate"
 united_states_events.602.d: "With the Outbreak of the American Civil War, the Army High Command has been thrown into chaos. Now not only is a reform plan to deal with the imminent crisis necessary, but also urgent as the rebellious states threaten the unity of America. Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans.\n\nAfter a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilisation plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members applauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticised his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilisation didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the \"Thunderbolt\": Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorised and mechanised elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots.\n\nWhile both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Lesley McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front. After hours of discussion, a decision is made..."

 united_states_events.603.t: "Air Force Independence Debate"
 united_states_events.603.d: "The Air Force has remained as a mostly token part of the Army, with barely any investment going towards it during the 1920s and 1930s. However, air developments during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield.\n\nUnfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, sparks conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganise as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield.\n\nWith the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to decide on the matter."

 united_states_events.604.d: "After months of struggle in the hospital, Major General Adna R. Chaffee has unfortunately passed away due to cancer. Considered by many as the father of American Armored Corps, the mentor of many tank crews and officers and one of the main reformers of the US Army, his death has taken most of the High Command by surprise.\n\nLuckily, he had laid out his plans to High Command clearly, so while his death is a tragic turn of events, it won't hinder our army reforms."

 united_states_events.605.t: "Tank Competition"
 united_states_events.605.d: "While our tanks in the assembly line have proven useful, Chaffee considers that their role is too spread for them to be effective. Right now our tanks are too slow to be used to take advantage of breakthroughs, but not armoured enough to sustain anti-tank projectiles, let alone tank-to-tank combat.\n\nSince achieving both is simply unachievable with the current state of our nation, we can however focus on one aspect so that our tanks may serve a specific role."

 united_states_events.606.d: "After Chaffee announced his Motorisation program for the Army, a proposal was sent to the Secretary of Defense by the War Department to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight.\n\nWhile not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."

 united_states_events.607.d: "As the American industry hums along McNair's artillery designs, a new debacle has begun among members of the High Command. Front Line reports of complete squads being wiped out by enemy dive bombings have been a concern of the staff since the beginning of the American Civil War, but the quick development of armoured elements in the enemy forces are overwhelming our army of mostly barely-equipped grunts.\n\nAfter asking for extra resources to the War Department, extra investments have been authorised for the Army, but they'd need to be addressed to a particular type of countermeasures against the enemy tactics, and so the High Command must choose wisely what it shall invest it in..."

 united_states_events.608.t: "First Paradrop Exercise"
 united_states_events.608.d: "While technically speaking, the first paradropping exercises were practised in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training programme started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers.\n\nWhen the Douglas C-33 took off from Langley Airfield and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. \"Red\" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."

 united_states_events.609.d: "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General John C.H. Lee, the recently reopened Fort Eustis had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage.\n\nSoon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

 united_states_events.610.d: "With the decision from the Secretary of Defense to form the US Army Air Force, which in consequence granted huge autonomy to the Air Force Officers, many officers have spoken out against the reform.\n\nOne of the main points of contention is that, with the budget already pretty split between the Army and the Navy, the Army Air Force will now more than ever be a money sink that would be badly needed for the ground troops. Regardless of their heated complain letters to the war department, the decision has been made and reforms are ongoing, so there's no going back."

 united_states_events.611.t: "MacArthur Attacks the Navy"
 united_states_events.611.d: "With more and more government funding being diverted to the navy, Chief of Staff MacArthur has taken up a severe accusation to the Secretary of Defense: He believes the recent investments on the navy are part of a plot that he had discovered in the early 1930s where the Navy would dominate the Army in the field and just turn the Army into a subordinate garrison force.\n\nWhile the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation.\n\nWhile the relations between MacArthur and navy have been bad for years, this is yet another sad example of how the inter-service rivalry has done nothing but grow in the last few years."

 united_states_events.612.t: "McNair Releases Antimechanized Defense Combat Manual"
 united_states_events.612.d: "After nearly a decade of studies and compiling the analysis of recent conflicts both at home and abroad, General Lesley McNair has finally published the book Antimechanized Defense, where he explores the recent development on mechanised tactics and how to counter them.\n\nThe manual consists of seven chapters - the first titled \"General\" followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive manoeuvrers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterised by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilised front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armoured attacks.\n\nWhile officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."
 united_states_events.612.a: "Finally! A Book that will guide us to Victory!"

 united_states_events.613.t: "Chaffee Organises the Combat Commands"
 united_states_events.613.d: "The concept Chaffee first envisaged during his development mechanised tactics in the early 1930s was one where combined arms mechanised units would possess no formal structure. In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the \"Armored Force Tentative Table of Organisation\" where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organisation that should not have dedicated battalions.\n\nInstead, tank, armoured infantry, and armoured field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanised cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armoured division into the combat commands named \"A\" for the main force, \"B\" for flank defence, and \"R\" for reserve units.\n\nWhile his concept is clearly inspired in the German \"Kampfgruppe\" concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organisation system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."
 united_states_events.613.a: "It seems that studying the Germans has paid off."

 united_states_events.614.t: "Release of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet"
 united_states_events.614.d: "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the front line while not making our movements and organisation system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a commission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts.\n\nWith the publishing and distribution of the \"Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet\" manual, our new alphabet shall utilise the codewords: Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra.\n\nWhile similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standardising it means we are finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"
 united_states_events.614.a: "This will give us an Edge in Communications."

 united_states_events.615.t: "Adoption of the M1 Helmet"
 united_states_events.615.d: "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilised the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s.\n\nWhile these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford.\n\nThe original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favourable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."
 united_states_events.615.a: "Glad we finally got rid of the Brodies."

 united_states_events.616.t: "The Victory Book Campaign"
 united_states_events.616.d: "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognised an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books.\n\nThe ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organisations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organisations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval.\n\nWhile our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."
 united_states_events.616.a: "Let's hope our soldiers enjoy it."

 united_states_events.617.t: "Cancellation of the Victory Book Campaign"
 united_states_events.617.d: "While the Victory Book Campaign has paved the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw criticism from the Army. Unfortunately, the Campaign was not well suited for combat units, as soldiers found the bulky hardcovers unsuitable for use in the field.\n\nMany of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. Of the over 10 million books gathered last year, VBC staffers have discarded over half of them. While the goal of the VBC is still popular, the Army has ordered the VBC to close and has begun plans with the CBW to create a new programme to entertain our soldiers."
 united_states_events.617.a: "Something Ends, Something Begins."

 united_states_events.618.t: "Creation of the Armed Services Editions"
 united_states_events.618.d: "With the collaboration of the graphic artist H. Stanley Thompson and the publisher and CWB executive Malcolm Johnson, Army Chief Librarian Raymond Trautman proposed his idea of \"Armed Services Editions\": mass-produced paperbacks selected by a panel of literary experts from among classics, bestsellers, humour books and poetry. With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command.\n\nWhile the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with \"Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'\" should be discarded.\n\nRegardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."
 united_states_events.618.a: "Let's hope this time the Books Last."

 united_states_events.619.t: "Creation of a Sniper Program?"
 united_states_events.619.d: "With the harsh lessons in urban warfare we have been forced to learn, we've come to realise that our army is woefully unprepared to face a new danger of the battlefield: Enemy Snipers. While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe.\n\nHowever, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests has proved that not only they were wrong, but also costed us dearly, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canada put their snipers through in the Weltkrieg."
 united_states_events.619.a: "The Proposal Passes."
 united_states_events.619.b: "The Proposal is Shut Down."

 united_states_events.620.t: "Sniper Selection"
 united_states_events.620.d: "With the first test group of snipers having left basic training, the question has been brought up. While the first test group was drawn from volunteers from all the US Army, there has been a significant performance difference between the Marine and Ranger volunteers compared to the regular army volunteers.\n\nAs such, both branches are contesting for the funding of the War Department to continue the Sniper Program, and we can only pick one. Which branch shall we support?"
 united_states_events.620.a: "Favour the Army's Rangers."
 united_states_events.620.b: "Favour the Navy's Marines."

 united_states_events.621.t: "Creation of the Office for Emergency Management"
 united_states_events.621.d: "With the outbreak of the civil war, the President has dispatched the creation via executive order of an office that functioned to assist the President in clearing information on immediate defence measures. With it, the Office for Emergency Management has been born to maintain liaison with national defence agencies and to coordinate the national defence programme, as well as keep both the Army and Navy in direct contact with the President.\n\nHowever, the mess of agencies, offices and commissions we have generated in the last few decades continues to grow, and many agree that our government should start looking into ways of reducing the amount of offices and increase the efficiency of existing ones."
 united_states_events.621.a: "For now, this will do."

 united_states_events.622.t: "Creation of the United States Office of War Information"
 united_states_events.622.d: "Due to a lack of a centralised government agency to work as a distributor of wartime information, civilian newspapers present news as they discover and interpret it, with different outlets overlapping their stories with slight variations and the public hardly knowing what is true and what is propaganda.\n\nAs such, and with permission of both the War Department and the President, the Office of War Information has been created to work as a connection between the battlefront and civilian communities.

 united_states_events.627.d: "With the shortcomings of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, the search for a more fitting permanent office space for the War Department has been ongoing for months already. First the military turned to the head of the Army's Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell.\n\nHe, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cemetery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington, D.C. is really appropriate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction.\n\nUnfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accommodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

Although Anglo-Saxon ties have waned since the turn of the century, and the Monroe Doctrine is not what it once was, [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is in no wise prepared to let their northern border become a hostile one.

### New Intro Events
 united_states_leadup_events.0.t: "The Second Session of the 74th Congress"
 united_states_leadup_events.0.d: "The coming of January marks the return of the 74th Congress from its annual recess. As Senators and Representatives return to Washington from their home states, the narrow Democratic majority in both houses prepares the President's administrative agenda, in what will be Al Smith's final year in office.\n\nLast year, the administration racked up several important legislative accomplishments, such as the Costigan-Wagner Anti-Lynching Act and the National Labor Arbitration and Enforcement Act. One initiative which eluded passage however was the newest version of the Social Security bill. Denounced by the left as insufficient in the face of systemic depression, and the right as government overreach, we had immense difficulty cobbling together a majority for the bill last year, particularly with the Democratic losses of the 1934 midterms.\n\nThe President has made his desire to see through the passage of the Social Security bill in the new session abundantly clear. The creation of an old age benefits system would represent one last substantial victory for the administration, and would undercut the rhetoric of Smith's political opponents both within and outside of the Democratic Party. Both the Farmer-Labor Party and Huey Long have emphasised the need for a system of old-age pensions, so the passage of the act would go a long way towards disarming one of their key policy appeals."
 united_states_leadup_events.0.a: "Let's get this done."

 united_states_leadup_events.1.t: "Reed Denounces Congress"
 united_states_leadup_events.1.d: "The most vocal denunciations of Congress in its current state has not come from either the administration or the mainstream Republican opposition. Since his election to Congress in 1932, Socialist Party Chairman and congressional caucus leader John Reed has vociferously denounced the institution to which he is elected. Denouncing \"bourgeois parliamentarism\" as a mere facade for the rule of Wall Street and big business, Reed calls for government \"by the industrial unions and workers' councils\", on the lines of the European syndicalist states.\n\nReed's rhetoric is nothing new. Such phrasing has been commonly espoused by and associated with him since his first bid for the Presidency in 1924. The popularity of him and his party however has only grown through the hard years of the Depression, particularly with the recent stalling of initiatives such as the President's Social Security bill.\n\nReed however must walk a tightrope. Despite the public face of unity his leadership provides, his party is anything but homogenous. The ousting of the party's Executive Secretary, Reed ally James P. Cannon, and his replacement with factional centrist Will Weinstone in May 1932 is the most recent public example of this. Though Reed's rhetoric remains radical, it is the moderates in the party, such as Norman Thomas, who are key to maintaining the party's relationship with Farmer-Labor, with Thomas already being speculated as a potential candidate for President later this year.\n\nAs part of the conditions for the Socialist Party's affiliation with Farmer-Labor, though Socialist candidates are elected on the Farmer-Labor ballot line, they are only observers in the Farmer-Labor caucus in Congress. Instead, they sit in their own caucus, bound to the decisions of the party's national executive. The Socialists have complete freedom of action, even while benefiting from running under a more electable ballot line."
 united_states_leadup_events.1.a: "Can't he see we're trying?"

 united_states_leadup_events.2.t: "Long Speaks On the Social Security Bill"
 united_states_leadup_events.2.d: "With all the buzz surrounding the Social Security bill on Capitol Hill, it was inevitable that Louisiana Senator Huey Long would make his view on the proposed legislation widely known. A scathing critic of the President Smith since his entry into national politics four years ago, Senator Long has galvanised opposition to the administration within the Democratic Party from both the economically interventionist and isolationist western wing of the party, as well as, in recent months, the reactionary and populist southern elements, which were impressed by Long's opposition to the Costigan-Wagner Anti-Lynching Act.\n\nThough Long is known for his forceful opinions and colourful rhetoric, his response to the proposed legislation has been more muted than expected. A well known supporter of old-age pensions on the national level, Long has not come out in outright opposition to the bill. He has however criticised the scale of the proposed program, decrying the proposed payments as grossly inadequate, as well as its proposed administration by the states, which he denounces as prone to abuse - perhaps an attempt to appeal to African-Americans. Long has instead advocated for the adoption of the model proposed by Dr. Francis Townsend, as well as his own \"Share Our Wealth\" scheme.\n\nThe Townsend Plan proposes monthly payments of 200 dollars to all retired non-criminal Americans over the age of 60, conditional on the money being spent within 30 days to stimulate the economy. The proposed payments, substantially higher than those provided for by the Social Security bill, as well as the spending requirement, are thought to be likely to stimulate economic growth and inflation, both of which are desired by Long. The Share Our Wealth program would similarly hand 2000 dollars to all American families every year, a policy criticised as economically unfeasible but that has nonetheless gained widespread support in the struggling south and west.\n\nRegardless, Long's lack of outright opposition to the bill is a good sign for its prospects. The threat of an immediate split in the Democratic caucus over the issue has subsided, and we can focus on bringing Republicans and moderate Farmer-Laborites on board."
 united_states_leadup_events.2.a: "We'll take what we can get, I suppose."

 united_states_leadup_events.3.t: "Social Security Dies in Committee"
 united_states_leadup_events.3.d: "The recent crash on the New York Stock exchange has sent Washington into a panic. With Wall Street continuing to tumble, fears of a return to the darkest days of 1928 have aroused a deep sense of dread among lawmakers and allies of the administration. With conditions in Europe appearing far more severe than during the recession of 1931, and trade barriers flying up once more, it appears as if the period of recovery that has characterised Smith's second term has come to a sudden halt.\n\nAs lawmakers scramble to put together a response, the first major victim of the crash appears to be what was once meant to be the crowning jewel of the President's final year in office: the Social Security bill. As Congress' priorities have rapidly shifted elsewhere, the Senate has voted to table the bill, even as it appeared to be on the verge of passage in the House just a week ago, essentially killing it for the foreseeable future. With the main piece of the President's legislative agenda dead on arrival, the path forward for the administration seems unclear and tumultuous."

 united_states_leadup_events.4.t: "Modern Times"
 united_states_leadup_events.4.d: "Since the 1895 screening of the first ever motion picture in the United States at New York City's Koster & Bial's Theater, the cinema industry has exploded in popularity. This has particularly been the case since beginning of the 1920s, and the growth of the industry has, surprisingly, been almost entirely unaffected by America's economic woes since 1925. This morning, the headlines shout of the screening of yet another film directed by and starring Charlie Chaplain, Modern Times. As his final planned film including the \"Little Tramp\" character, the film has been interpreted differently depending on the commentator, particularly in such a divisive and hostile political environment. However, the central theme is clear for all to see. Chaplin, as the \"Little Tramp\", viciously satirizes modern life in the United States, particularly the banal and monotonous nature of day to day life, as well as the seeming powerlessness of the average American.\n\nWhile the film has largely been lauded by the press as a hit and advancement in the complexity of set-pieces and cinematography, there have been detractors, particularly among the American right, who have criticized the film as socialist and syndicalist propaganda. Meanwhile, the American left have embraced this narrative; that Chaplain has endorsed the socialist movement, and began to push this in their own propaganda. Overall, though, most people - critics, editors, and the general public - who have seen the film so far have treated it as largely apolitical, and used it as an excuse to, perhaps ironically, escape the constant strain, stress, and banality of the current national crisis."

 united_states_leadup_events.5.t: "The Blame Game"
 united_states_leadup_events.5.d: "The recent panic in Congress has greatly exacerbated the woes the Administration has faced in its second term. Ever since Smith's election in 1928, the Democratic Party has consistently declined in popularity, seeing its congressional majorities whittled down to threadbare margins. The flurry of stabilising legislation that stopped the bleeding in 1929 has slowed to a crawl, so the President has little to show for his second term. Worse still, the Democratic Party is on the verge of tearing itself apart. Huey Long has intensified attacks on President Smith, transparently plotting to find an angle with which to run for President later this year.\n\nWith Black Monday spreading across the Atlantic, Congress appears paralysed. Social Security is dead, and the major parties struggle to find consensus, as Farmer-Labor and the Longists reap the rewards of seven years of generally conservative government. The Hearst papers have continued their long running feud with the President as well, a rivalry active since Smith attacked Hearst in 1919. Hearst comes just short of openly calling for Douglas MacArthur to march on Washington and establish a dictatorship. Such words are finding receptive ears among men imminently about to lose their fortunes, as leading firms are seemingly destined for bankruptcy in the next few months, if not weeks.\n\nWith the progress of the past seven years seemingly falling apart around him, President Smith has met with his cabinet to discuss the steps that must be taken to save the nation's economy once more. Cordell Hull, the Secretary of State, called for the President to further lower trade barriers, while Vice President Joe T. Robinson proposed to push forward with emergency legislative action. Hull, as well as Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, among the more popular members of the administration, and finally Huey Long, an oft-mentioned name with regards to the Democratic nomination, seconded Robinson's proposal, which was then accepted by the President. With the aid of his Vice President, an experienced wheeler-and-dealer with enduring connections in the Senate, President Smith has called a special session of Congress to pass emergency relief legislation."

 united_states_leadup_events.6.t: "Rubber Workers on Strike"
 united_states_leadup_events.6.d: "As the economic situation has continued to deteriorate, labor militancy has skyrocketed across the United States. On the morning of the 14th, the city of Akron, Ohio came to a virtual standstill after approximately 10,000 workers and sympathetic citizens went on strike in the country's largest rubber plant: the Goodwin Tire Factory. This sudden action was in response to company plans to lay off hundreds of workers and slash the wages of the remainder by upwards of 50% in order to adjust for losses inflicted by Black Monday.\n\nBefore the city's citizens or the strikers were prepared, the local deputies and an associated organisation of thugs and paramilitaries, the so-called 'Law and Order League', fell on the lot. While hand-to-hand combat raged for the first half hour, the frustrated deputies began to draw their pistols, and fired into the crowd at point-blank range. Enraged, sympathetic citizens and unionists similarly armed themselves, and before either side knew it, a full-blown battle for the city had broken out.\n\nThough the scuffle was brief, it quickly sent shockwaves through the community. The people of Akron, some of whom were horrified at how quickly the situation had spiralled out of control, agreed with the local unionists to stand down, in exchange for blanket pardons for all those whom were involved. Nevertheless, unions nationwide, even those affiliated with the comparatively moderate AFL, have taken this outbreak of violence as a warning. Across the country, particularly in the steel belt, paramilitary activity led by local Red Guards and other socialist-led organisations has spiked as unions play host to military-style training. Calls among anti-socialist hardliners for decisive action to disarm and even dismantle unions have increased, but thus far have gone unheeded by either federal or state authorities."

 united_states_leadup_events.7.t: "West Virginia Abolishes Term Limits"
 united_states_leadup_events.7.d: "Since John Reed shocked the nation by winning the state in the election of 1928, West Virginia has been a stronghold of the Socialist Party. Though the party's hold on the state was tenuous (with them narrowly losing the Senate seat up in 1930), through the 1930s the party has gradually tightened its grasp over the red bastion. It has enacted pro-union policies, partnered with the IWW mining union to build up a reliable pro-SPA patronage system, and brought certain industries and utilities into state ownership. Since Socialist J.H. Snider was elected Governor in 1928, the SPA has gradually increased its share of both state houses, gaining a majority in the House of Delegates in 1930 and the Senate in 1932.\n\n1932 also marked a changing of the guard. Governor Snider, a moderate ally of Norman Thomas' faction of the party, was term-limited, and replaced as governor by radical Miles Stone, who hews closer to the line of party leadership. Under Stone, the party has further solidified its grip over the state, bringing itself into alignment with the IWW and winning a two-thirds majority in both houses of the state legislature in 1934. This enabled the Socialist Party to amend the state constitution, overriding the few remaining legal checks available to anti-socialist forces in the state.\n\nThe most recent amendment affects Governor Stone most directly. Under West Virginia's constitution, governors are limited to a single consecutive term. With a special session of the state legislature, however, that section has been rewritten to allow Governor Stone to run for re-election. The amendment represents a clear step towards further SPA dominance over the state, a process further exemplified by the decision of Congressman Robert L. Hogg, the last remaining non-Socialist in the state's house delegation, not to run for re-election. With Robert L. Hogg's imminent departure, and Senator Mathew M. Neely's re-election looking ever more unlikely, it appears as if the Socialists will soon have uncontested control over the state's congressional delegation."

 united_states_leadup_events.8.d: "When it rains, it pours - unfortunately for the United States, this is to be taken both metaphorically and literally. The winter of 1935-36 has seen extremely heavy snowfall, even by the standards of the northeast. Widespread melting has already clogged infrastructure and caused some limited flooding, although to date it was nothing that the locals couldn't handle.\n\nOver the past week, however, this situation has become catastrophic; unusually heavy rainstorms, starting on March 9th and continuing unabated, has triggered flooding from Maine to Maryland, and even sections of northern Virginia. This situation has been made even worse by the outdated nature of civilian infrastructure, as dams, bridges, and overpasses have been destroyed, while roads and entire cities have been inundated. In just one day, from 18-19 March, sections of the Northeast saw as much as 10 inches of rainfall. Approximately 300,000 people have been rendered homeless, and an estimated 100 million dollars in damages has been inflicted upon the populace.\n\nThe already-chaotic economic situation has worsened, and both leftist and rightist radicals have used this as another example of the callousness and “cold indifference” of the American government to the suffering of the people. To most Americans, it is simply another sign that the country will continue its spiral into depression and helplessness, as well as radicalism and violence."

 united_states_leadup_events.9.d: "Attacks on President Smith from the Republicans and the far left was to be expected, but perhaps the most damning evidence of the administration's unpopularity is the growing chorus of denunciation by his own party. Leading the charge is Huey Long, the fiery southern populist, who has whipped up many southern and western Democrats into a frenzy while gunning for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn one of his most memorable speeches, apparently given multiple times, he compares the Democratic and Republican parties to an old patent medicine drummer coming to town with a banjo and two bottles of medicine, one called High Popalorum and Low Popahirum:\n\n\"Finally somebody around there said is there any difference in these bottles of medicines? 'Oh,' [the drummer] said, 'considerable. They're both good but they're different,' he said. 'That High Popalorum is made from the bark off the tree that we take from the top down. And that Low Popahirum is made from the bark that we take from the root up.'\n\nAnd the only difference that I have found between the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership was that one of 'em was skinning you from the ankle up and the other from the ear down - when I got to Congress.\"\n\nThese open attacks on the political establishment have tapped into a growing disenchantment with the American political system, and spell ill-tidings for the 1936 Democratic Campaign as a whole. With the party fracturing and many already jumping ship, one has to wonder if the Democratic establishment will even be a political force by November."

 united_states_leadup_events.10.d: "For the third time since 1927, a grant request has been put forward in Congress to allocate federal funding to the long-stalled 'Shrine of Democracy' project: a plan to carve four collossal statues into the face of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. The brainchild of local historian Doane Robinson and famed sculptor Gutzon Borglum - the creator of Georgia's colossal 'Shrine to the Confederacy' - Robinson originally intended for the carvings to depict towering figures of the American West such as Lewis & Clark, Red Cloud, Sacagaewa, John C. Fremont, and Crazy Horse, but Borglum instead favoured commemorating four of America's most influential Presidents, settling on George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe two men and their supporters argue that the project will not only help the local economy, but also have a psychological impact on our flailing nation, revitalizing faith in the future. In addition to this, the Department of the Interior has received a letter from Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear, offering to turn over 900 acres of his own land in order to get a carving of Crazy Horse added to the project.\n\nAs such, we are faced with three possibilities: to finance the work at Mount Rushmore, to take up Henry Standing Bear's deal and include Crazy Horse alongside the Presidents, or to simply reject the proposal and allocate the funds elsewhere."

The Great Mississippi flood struck at the first height of the Great Depression, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless and partially resulting in the election of Huey Long as Governor of Louisiana. In a year featuring numerous severe weather events, the south has yet again found itself as a central victim.\n\nAcross the southeast an outbreak of 14 different tornadoes has wreaked havoc between Arkansas and South Carolina. The towns of Tupelo, Mississippi, and Gainesville, Georgia, have been the most severely affected locations: in total, over 200 people died in each town due to powerful tornadoes.\n\nIn Tupelo, a tornado swept through residential areas, tearing apart buildings and killing and injuring countless families. Gainesville meanwhile saw its tornado hit the Cooper Pants Factory, collapsing the building and causing a fire which killed as many as 125 workers trapped on the top floor.\n\nAll told, over 400 people have died in the outbreak (mainly concentrated in Tupelo and Gainesville), and the tornadoes have also caused over 10 million dollars in property damage. In the aftermath of the disaster, President Smith has announced his intention to visit the affected area, though it is unlikely that his presence will be warmly received. In any case, federal aid will be arriving shortly in the affected areas, which will hopefully begin the process of healing for these communities."

Comedies and light entertainment have maintained consistent popularity, remaining profitable in spite of the decreasing purchasing power of middle class and working Americans.\n\nWith the collapse in Berlin not yet having reached most Americans' pocketbooks, many are in the mood for a good time. Frank Capra's “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town”, starring Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, offers exactly that. A screwball romantic comedy about a Vermont eccentric who unexpectedly falls into possession of a massive fortune, the film is a morality tale, as Cooper's Longfellow Deeds character learns to give as he has gained.\n\nThough the simple moral message is seemingly uncontroversial, some critics have pondered the political implications of the message in our times. Deeds' plan to give homeless families 2000 free 10-acre farms has been noted as being in tune with the sort of idyllic pastoral populism that has commonly appeared in American political history, and now finds its champion in Louisiana Senator Huey Long.\n\nIn any case, the film has quickly become Capra's most successful film yet. In these troubled times, the simple eccentricity of a man such as Longfellow Deeds appeals to many Americans."

 united_states_leadup_events.13.d: "A miracle, some have called it; and others, a tragedy. Huey P. Long, a clear rival to President Smith for the Democratic nomination this year, has survived an assassination attempt in Baton Rouge just outside the Louisiana State Capitol Building. Fred Weiss, a disgruntled associate, opened fire at point-blank range as Long and his entourage exited the building down a corridor, but incredibly, the gun jammed. As a result Long's hand-picked bodyguards emptied their firearms into Weiss. He was struck more than 60 times, even after falling to the floor.\n\nAlmost immediately, conspiracy theories have spread like wildfire across the United States. Long himself has intentionally inflated the idea that his enemies among the dominant two-party system had arranged the attempt. As political violence becomes normalized, a worrying trend in American politics since Black Monday: a failure of faith in the fundamental soundness of civic institutions. Despite tough times in the past, a constant has always been a core belief that these civic institutions, such as the media, Congress, Courts, and others, genuinely worked for the people, albeit flawed. No longer. It seems now that people only want to believe in what they want to hear, making it impossible for the government to re-establish any degree of credibility among the population at large, creating a vicious feedback cycle of constant radicalization, distrust, and clashing narratives. Political hatred seems well on its way to be the norm, rather than the exception."

 united_states_leadup_events.14.d: "J. Edgar Hoover and his FBI have once again made the headlines with the capture of Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis in New Orleans. Hoover, who had led the transformation of the Bureau of Investigation into the modern Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), successfully secured federal jurisdiction over robberies conducted over state lines. With crime rates soaring amid the Great Depression, this allowed the FBI to be on the forefront of the \"War on Crime\", arresting or killing infamous criminals such as John Dillinger, Charles Arthur \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd, and George \"Machine Gun Kelly\" Barnes.\n\nAlvin Karpis is of Lithuanian descent, beginning his life of crime at age ten. While detained at Kansas State Penitentiary, he met Fred Barker of the \"Bloody Barkers\" family, and together they formed the Karpis-Barker gang. Karpis, said to have a photographic memory, was reported to be the mastermind behind the gang that achieved infamy for slaying a Sheriff, a string of high profile abductions, and several major shootouts with the law.\n\nKarpis became the fourth \"Public Enemy Number One\", after Dillinger, Floyd, and \"Baby Face Nelson\" (Lester Joseph Gillis) were killed by the FBI. Despite the public attention, he successfully pulled off a train robbery in Ohio last year, and rumors spread (possibly by Hoover himself) that he vowed to kill Hoover to avenge his fallen gang members. After many tips failed to materialise, one led to a successful ambush that has effectively made Hoover's name synonymous with law enforcement.\n\nThat is no accident. Hoover's greatest strength is manipulating public perception, firing agents that \"looked stupid like truck drivers\" and embracing modern forensic sciences to build a slick, modern image. It is said that becoming a \"G-Man\" is more difficult than being accepted into Harvard. Capricious and paranoid, with Karpis's arrest the age of the \"Big-Name\" criminal is over. Now, Hoover turns to the growing radical movements into the United States."

 united_states_leadup_events.15.d: "May Day is said to be the start of summer, and if so the Summer of 1936 is bound to be a difficult one. The Socialist Party of America and IWW organised International Workers' Day events on May 1st, drawing considerable anti-leftist attacks across the nation. Pro and anti-socialist mobs swarmed against each other in major cities, leaving many severely injured and several dead.\n\nNearly a week later, with the recent events in Harlan County having thrown yet more fuel onton the fire, tensions refuse to abate, as John Reed and the rest of the SPA leadership have refused to denounce the violence and vowed never to back down. They claim that Federal and local authorities have largely turned a blind eye to violence towards leftist activists, but have clamped down harshly on their peaceful attempts to organise.\n\nPerhaps more concerning however is Huey Long's statement actively calling for patriots around the country to take arms and be the new \"Minutemen\" against tyranny. Invoking the memories of the Revolutionary War militias that formed the bulk of the early Continental Army, so named for their ability to mobilise in under a minute, Long's words have given legitimacy to many disorganised but armed groups in America.\n\nWorse of all however, is that the spiral violence does not appear to be fully contained even as local national guards and police forces have been deployed. Harlan County remains in crisis, and small scale clashes continue around the country long after May Day itself."

 united_states_leadup_events.16.t: "The Farm Crisis"
 united_states_leadup_events.16.d: "Since the end of the European War, US agriculture has been in a state of perpetual economic crisis. During the war, there was an agricultural boom, as the global market tightened and global demand for US agricultural products boomed. The end of the war put a stop to this however, both because European agriculture began to once again meet domestic demands, as well as due to the new tariff walls erected by Mitteleuropa, which essentially closed off the German economic bloc to US agriculture. This crisis of overproduction severely reduced the price of US agricultural goods, cratering the profitability of farms and causing many farmers to go bankrupt.\n\nJust as recovery seemed to be near however, the Great Depression struck. Prices fell even further, and foreclosures and bank failures left many farmers penniless, wandering the American countryside. The institution of new tariffs under President Lowden and the subsequent reluctance to lower them again by President Smith further exacerbated the United States' isolation from global trade, cratering prices further. As if this was not bad enough, in recent years the Dust Bowl has seen many remaining farmers lose their livelihoods due to crop failure.\n\nThese cascading catastrophes have resulted in a growing radicalisation in rural America. Both Farmer-Labor and Huey Long's movement have sought to exploit the growing anger and fury coming from farmers and rural communities towards the establishment and economic elites. As banks and Wall Street speculators are blamed for the state of the Farm Crisis, radical rhetoric gains more and more traction, threatening to engulf the countryside. Already, incidents of violence and intimidation against perceived \"enemies of the People\", including bankers and state government officials, have become commonplace, and there seems to be no sign of tensions cooling any time soon."

Since its inception, the tension within its disparate coalition of progressives and socialists has been obvious. Now, with the Socialists having gained enough strength to put forward a viable candidate for the nomination, it has reached the forefront of discussion.\n\nIn the Progressive camp, Minnesota Senator and 1932 Presidential candidate Floyd Olson makes the case that he can lead Farmer-Labor to a historic victory, hoping to convince the delegates that the Smith years have vindicated Farmer-Labor in the eyes of the public, and that a broad base coalition with the backing of organised labour in the form of the CIO will build upon the successes of the 1932 campaign to secure the election for the young party.\n\nThe Socialist Party meanwhile has made the decision to openly put forward a candidate of their own for the nomination. New York Congressman Norman Thomas, the party's leading \"respectable\" moderate, has been given the endorsement of the party's Executive Committee. Calling for a bold and more explicitly socialist platform, The choice of Thomas would represent a shift of priorities for Farmer-Labor, away from middle class progressives and farm voters and towards the urban workers who allowed for Farmer-Labor breakthroughs in states such as Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan.\n\nThe delegates enter the convention under an atmosphere of uncertainty. The choice they make will invariably be decisive for the direction of Farmer-Labor in the years to come. In the end, the convention is swayed, and..."

Recounting a similar address he gave to them in 1934, this time to a much broader national audience, Floyd struck a balanced tone:\n\n\"Now I am frank to say that I am not a liberal. I enjoy working on a common basis with liberals for their platforms, but I am not a liberal. I am what I want to be - I am a radical. I am a radical in the sense that I want a definite change in the system. I am not satisfied with tinkering, I am not satisfied with patching, I am not satisfied with hanging a laurel wreath upon burglars and thieves and pirates and calling them code authorities or something else. I am not satisfied with that.\n\nI want, however, an orderly, a sane, and a constructive change. I don't want any visionary things any more than the hardest Tory or Conservative wants them. But I know the transition can take place and that, of course, it must be gradual. It can't come overnight, but I want to do all I can to set it in motion and keep it going steady, not in jerks, or jumps, or in spurts, but going steadily ahead.\"\n\nHe continued by highlighting how the party brought the passage of the first compulsory old-age pension law, and how the movement successfully passed an income tax law. He further promised a \"cooperative commonwealth wherein Government will stifle, as much as possible, the greed and avarice of the private profit system and will bring about more equitable distribution of the wealth produced by the hands and minds of the people.\"\n\nHe concluded his speech with an olive branch, stating his only great regret over the past decade is that he never had a majority in legislature that agreed with his principles, claiming if he had one the gratification would have been sufficient to have him retire from public life. In that spirit of unity, he has nominated Norman Thomas as his Vice President, something the FL power brokers are expected to accept."

Brookhart was chosen by F-L power brokers as his Vice President. Speaking to a broad national audience, with many tuning in to a third party for the first time, Thomas chose his words carefully:\n\n\"We Socialists are committed to the preservation and increase of civil liberty, to the absolute vindication of the rights of workers, employed and unemployed, to organise and bargain collectively in the cotton fields as well as in great industries. We are committed to protecting Federal anti-lynching legislation, and to an end of racial discrimination in respect to relief, work, education and justice.\"\n\nBalancing promises of egalitarianism and social progress, he resisted calls for moderation by continuing on with forceful words on capitalism:\n\n\"But we do not believe that liberty can be made secure until we end the tyranny implicit in the control of the few over the resources and the jobs necessary to the life of us all. For poverty in the midst of potential plenty, the profit system is even more obviously responsible than for war and tyranny. It is the amazing truth that in this campaign there has been no discussion of the conditions of true abundance from either of the major parties.\"\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, after in-depth criticisms of the two major parties, he directed his attention specifically to Huey Long and his budding movement, saving his harshest terms for them. Denouncing them as a \"curious combination of political messiahs and discredited politicians\", he warns that the economic and psychological conditions caused by the capitalist system will lead to the rise of a national populist demagogue, comparing the \"Long-Coughlin program, with its promises of good wages to workers, good profits to farmers and little business men, all within the confines of the capitalist system\" to similar movements in Europe."

The painful divorce of CIO from the AFL in 1929 over Industrial Unionism further spurred the CIO, the SPA, state Farmer-Labor and Non-Partisan League parties to join together to form one national Farmer-Labor party in 1930.\n\nIn its short lifespan, this has not been a very stable marriage. Though the SPA accepted Governor Floyd Olson of Minnesota's nomination for the 1932 Presidential Election, in spite of Olson's terrific first-time performace that year, a general feeling that it would be the SPA's \"turn\" at the wheel, so to speak, in 1936, grew within the party, which began to expect the moderates to give way for their candidate, Norman Thomas.\n\nNot particularly mollified by the selection of Thomas the Vice Presidential candidate, SPA campaigning has been notably less enthusiastic and more guarded. The Farmer-Labor leadership have kept any disagreements between the Olson and SPA camps behind closed doors, however speculation has already begun to swirl that the SPA will refuse to enter the cabinet even if Olson wins, as important SPA figures such as Jay Lovestone previously predicated their support for Farmer-Labor on the SPA capturing the party within a few years. Olson for his part has been courting Republican, Democratic, and Union party defectors, and some on the left have already accused him of selling out the movement.\n\nWhatever happens, Floyd Olson will not have an easy time in office. Many of the SPA rank and file are disgruntled about the perceived weakness of Farmer-Labor in face of violence on the campaign trail, losing what little faith they had in the system.

Optimism abounds at this year's Republican National Convention, as the people generally appear tired of the Democrats, and change seems to be in the air.\n\nMuch as things change however, much they stay the same. Primary elections have been a feature of major party presidential politics since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. Though generally non-binding, they provide an astute indication of the mood of the public. This year, progressive Republican and Idaho Senator William Borah, among the last of the Roosevelt breed of Republican, has almost completely swept the GOP primaries. With the winds behind his back, Borah's advocacy of a return to Roosevelt-style progressivism, and his left-criticism of the Smith Administration have made him few friends among the conservative wing of the party.\n\nThe Conservatives however realise the precariousness of their position. Borah has momentum, and the country is in a generally progressive mood after the disappointments of the Smith years. Conservatives, most prominently Michigan's Arthur Vandenberg, are therefore reluctant to throw their hat in the ring in their own right.\n\nAs such the Conservative wing of the party has rallied behind Moderate Kansas Governor Alf Landon.

He expressed his belief that the people will do the same in November.\n\nHis speech quickly turned to a very different elephant in the room - the worsening Great Depression. Castigating the Smith administration for \"sucking the very life-blood of the nation\" with their mismanagement, Borah said that \"if we keep on the way we are going, every farmer will be carrying another on his shoulders as he plows his corn\". Government relief efforts have enriched politicians while failing to feed the hungry - he compared Washington's bureaucrats to the biblical \"locusts pouring into Egypt.\" He lamented that \"we haven't many farmers in Washington, even in the department of agriculture\" and compared the present situation to the eve of the French Revolution.\n\nWith regards to Social Security, Borah attempted to stake out his own position. He declared that he had been an advocate of such pensions for people over sixty, but rejected the Townsend plan (which he had previously endorsed) for compelling them to spend it all in a month. Instead, he argued that the money should simply be given to individuals and allowed to spend or save it as they see fit.\n\nA sometimes combative reformer in the past, he spent some time criticising both mainstream parties, but saved the bulk of it to lash out against the growing far left and right. Some of it was ideological, but plenty of it was practical too - he is competing against both for the populist vote.

Too frequently recovery has been hindered, if not defeated, by political considerations.\"\n\nUnder Smith, \"the nation has not made the durable progress, either in reform or recovery, that we had the right to expect\" and Landon said that true economic recovery should not be measured by stock market prices but rather the ability for Americans to find a job and be self-supporting and self-respecting member of the community.\n\nDespite Black Monday, Landon declared that \"America is ripe for recovery,\" and cycled through the GOP platform of promoting small businesses and farmers, taxation and monetary policy reforms, efficient and nondiscriminatory unemployment relief, the reduction of debt, and the workers' right to unionise. In labour issues, the government should serve as an umpire, protecting public interests and promoting conciliation.\n\nLandon closed by invoking America's founding principles of \"life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness\" and the Constitution's checks and balances. He warned that \"the great safeguards against tyranny and oppression must not be cast away and lost\", and promised along with his newly selected running mate Quentin Roosevelt, to do his part bringing the America that is to be."

Republican campaigners have been knocking on doors, soliciting funds from businesses large and small, blasting the Smith administration for its incompetence, blasting Long for corruption, and stoking fears of a socialist revolution.\n\nThis is hardly Borah's first campaign of course - an experienced political operator, Borah has made himself a major powerbroker in Republican elections across the 1920s despite his hatred of both intrigue and tobacco (making him a poor fit for the literal smoke-filled back rooms). An energetic campaigner and seeking to recast the Republican party as a progressive one, he has worked to expand his reach from beyond the Great Plains - shoring up GOP strongholds in the North and West.\n\nStill, with competition intense and violence escalating, one has to wonder if this will be enough. The establishment may have locked ranks behind him on a national scale, however many local political machines have locked out aligned candidates on the down ballot. His attempts at winning over Farmer-Labor and Union Party voters, and his party's attempts to woo disaffected Democrats have only had limited success.

Republican campaigners have been knocking on doors, soliciting funds from businesses large and small, blasting the Smith administration for its incompetence, blasting Long for corruption, and stoking fears of a socialist revolution.\n\nDespite these efforts, one crucial member appears to be not pulling his weight. Alf Landon for whatever the reason largely refuses to travel in his campaign or speak out much, leading to conservative columnist Westbrook Pegler to jab: \"Considerable mystery surrounds the disappearance of Alfred M. Landon of Topeka, Kansas, who has been missing from his regular haunts for some time. The Missing Persons Bureau has sent out an alarm bulletin bearing Mr. Landon's photograph and other particulars, and anyone having information of his whereabouts is asked to communicate direct (sic) with the Republican National Committee.\"\n\nBut this year's election is simply too important to lose for the Republican Party. With competition intense and violence escalating, there is no going back.

While in better days these words would be dismissed as fear-mongering or typical plea for more funding, the fact that organised political violence is on the rise is unmistakable.\n\nEmboldened by Huey Long's call for \"New Minutemen\" weeks ago, various far-right militias of different sizes and radicalism have coalesced around the term and in support of Long. Groups such as the Silver Legion, the Khaki Shirts, Mankind United, Knights of the Camarilla, Crusader White Shirts, the Black Legion, the Ku Klux Klan, have all grown in numbers and launched vicious attacks on anything perceived as socialist or unpatriotic. While some have resisted the moniker and others embraced it, the media has effectively lumped them all together as \"Minutemen\".\n\nThe grassroots are not the only source of armed paramilitaries. Henry Ford and other industrialists, have also cast their strikebreakers as \"Minutemen\", heroically defending loyal workers from foreign subversives and socialist rabble-rousers. Co-operative local law enforcement, sometimes even with state approval, are said to have been sympathetic to the \"Minutemen Movement.\" Not directly affiliated, but commonly referred to as Minutemen by the media, are Huey Long's heavily armed \"Cossack\" personal bodyguards.\n\nThe proliferation of armed groups has led to cycles of violence in the cities and countryside, leading to an arms-race that has challenged the American government's monopoly on power.

 united_states_leadup_events.29.d: "The Democratic Party enters the election of 1936 in a sorry state. Beset by division and turmoil, and weighed down by an unpopular incumbent who has presided over a period of general malaise that refuses to abate, few are confident of the party's chances of coming back from behind to win the Presidency once again.\n\nPerhaps the only man who enters the convention with a smile and an optimistic tune is the man who is determined to be nominated as a rebuke to the entirety of Smith's term. Huey Long needs no introduction, and his crusade for the Presidency has brought him to Philadelphia with numerous primary victories in hand. Among the general public, Long's \"Share Our Wealth\" platform has strong appeal as a decisive break from the economic conservatism of the Smith years, and as such Long makes the case that he alone is capable of retaining the presidency for the Democrats.\n\nThe very radicalism that is his greatest asset has made a large section of the party determined to prevent his nomination however. An \"Anybody But Long\" movement has emerged at the convention, comprising the sum of many anti-Long forces, including liberals, conservatives, progressives, and everyone in-between. United only by their opposition to Long, various faces have been posited and entered into nomination as alternative candidates. Vice President Joe T. Robinson, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull are among the most prominent names listed.\n\nIt is clear that the confrontation between Long and the anti-Longs will define this year's convention. Its resolution uncertain, unease grows among all factions, as the party appears to reach its breaking point."

 united_states_leadup_events.30.d: "It started as a simple dispute over procedure. Two different state delegations from Mississippi demanded to be seated: one pro-Long and one anti-Long. The ruling by the convention's credentials committee in favour of the anti-Long delegation started a wave of boos and jeers from Long's supporters. Successive challenges to other pro-Long delegations intensified the situation. Long demanded a chance to speak, hoping to sway the convention as Bryan had in 1896, but was denied.\n\nThe mood among the Long crowd went from bad to worse. The final straw was an attempt to revoke the credentials of the Louisiana delegation, in favour of an anti-Long alternative slate. At this, the Long crowd rose. Long's brother, Earl, swore at Vice President Robinson, before being caught up in a brief fist-fight with him, a brawl that left the younger man worse off before he was restrained by other attendees. The incident ultimately proved the last straw for Long's supporters, who proceeded to leave the convention en masse.\n\nAfter a short round of voting, the convention, now much friendlier to the administration, rallied behind Robinson, after Hoover withdrew his name from consideration. After Robinson was nominated for the presidency, Hoover was offered the second spot on the ticket, but again declined, obviously seeing it as a futile effort, and looking towards a run in 1940. An alternative was found in Indiana Governor Paul V. McNutt, a photogenic northerner with strong electoral credentials. The new Democratic ticket now seems to stare towards electoral oblivion, as Long openly prepares his forces for a parallel convention."

 united_states_leadup_events.31.d: "The dramatic walkout from the Democratic National Convention by supporters of Senator Huey Long just over a week ago has led to feverous speculation as to Long's next political move. Few are so foolish as to believe that the events in Philadelphia have seriously stunted Long's presidential ambitions. Instead, he is widely expected to launch a third-party bid for President of some kind, an expectation that has seemingly been confirmed by his declaration calling for a convention \"against the hoot owls and scrootch owls of the bankers' Democratic and Republican parties\". With the convention opening on the Fourth of July to much fanfare, enthusiasm behind Long's bid appears to remain strong. Though the mood on the floor is overwhelmingly behind the man of the hour, one question remains unanswered: that of Long's Vice President.\n\nOn the one hand, there is Long's personal choice: his close Senate colleague and friend, Montana's Burton K. Wheeler. Wheeler would reinforce Long's progressive bona fides, drawing the campaign in a more populist direction in line with Long's Share Our Wealth platform. However, he would alienate the southern bloc that almost gave Long the Democratic nomination, as well as the conservatives increasingly driven to Long out of fear of the Socialist Party.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the right-wing populist Governor of Georgia, Eugene Talmadge. Long promised Talmadge either the Vice Presidency or the position of Secretary of Agriculture last year, when he formed a political pact with him against Al Smith. Talmadge is favoured by northern business interests, and is accepted by, if not the first choice of, the southern Bourbons. However, the gap between his politics and those of Long is wide, and the two have grown to silently disdain one another since the formation of their alliance. Additionally, it is unlikely that Talmadge has enough sway in the wider south to seriously damage the Long campaign if the pact between him and Long is broken.\n\nUltimately, the choice of Vice President will determine the direction of Long's campaign: will it be a populist, western focused campaign, or a nationalist, southern focused one?"

 united_states_leadup_events.32.d: "For days, Huey Long has stoked anticipation of a third-party run for President. Few expected his rejection by the Democrats to end his presidential ambitions, and now Long has taken the stage to confirm just that. Denouncing the Democratic Party as irrevocably corrupt, he and his allies have founded the Union Party, an alliance of convenience between populists such as Charles Couglin, Francis Townsend, and William Lemke, more reactionary Democratic politicians such as Eugene Talmadge and Theodore Bilbo, as well as a host of fringe figures such as Gerald K. Smith. Drifting adjacent to the Union Party orbit are several leading corporate executives such as Henry Ford, John Henry Kirby, Alfred P. Sloan, and Robert E. Wood.\n\nAlong with the new party, Long has announced that Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler, his longtime friend and partner in the Senate, will be joining him as his Vice Presidential nominee. Wheeler is a progressive who was elected to a Senate seat in 1922, becoming a well known populist legislator with ties across the political spectrum. As a Senator, Wheeler is popular due to his leadership in several anti-corruption inquiries, and his willingness to challenge the establishment and even the White House. In addition to having many allies among the progressive movement and organised labour, Wheeler is also known for his isolationist and nativist views - voting for legislation clamping down on immigration and also for diplomatic non-intervention.\n\nLong's choice of Wheeler has helped to give the Union Party a more cohesive identity as a Western populist party, but some have criticized it as being too narrow in scope to actually win in November. Many conservative Democrats who expressed some interest in the party have now begun to distance themselves, threatening the inroads the Union Party has made in the south. Still, a shared vision can do wonders for a party's image, especially as the other major parties struggle with their own internal divisions."

Talmadge appeals to white farmers with his worldview of rugged individualism and calls for small government and racial segregation. He has also made frequent use of martial law to crush strikes, silence critics of his government, and quash corruption inquiries, even as he retains popularity as a \"defender of the common man.\".\n\nWith allies such as lumber magnate John Henry Kirby, and General Motors executive Alfred P. Sloan, he also brings considerable money to the campaign. Reverend Gerald K. Smith and white supremacist novelist Thomas Dixon Jr. have also advocated for his selection. His economic conservatism and his segregationist views have dimmed progressive support for the party however.\n\nLong and Talmadge are also poor match, with rather different political agendas, competing egos and independent political machines. Long is rumored to have said \"that Talmadge ain't got the brains to match his ambition,\" and even his speech announcing Talmadge has been called lukewarm at best. Media coverage has also been unfavorable, with many mocking Talmadge for having political views better fit for the last century."

 united_states_leadup_events.34.d: "With Huey Long's selection of Burton K. Wheeler as his Vice Presidential running mate, the question of the direction of the Long campaign was seemingly settled. Long's rhetoric against the bankers, elites, and big business would not be toned down, and the radical measures of Share Our Wealth would be placed at the forefront. Several groups within the Long camp have found themselves dissatisfied with these developments however. Though the very northern businesses which Long attacks have taken to financing his campaign as a bulwark against socialism, they have grown increasingly uncomfortable with Long's radical rhetoric, with some commenting that he is little different from the socialists who they support him against.\n\nElectorally however, it is not this group that most concerns Long. For most of his career on the national stage, Long has sought to ride a coalition of western and southern states to the White House. Though Wheeler has secured the west for Long more strongly than ever before, the south appears to be the weak link. Never comfortable with Long to begin with, several southern Bourbons have distanced themselves from the campaign, emboldening anti-Long liberal and conservative elements in the region.\n\nPerhaps more notable however has been the opposition of Governor Eugene Talmadge. Talmadge, spurned by Long in the Vice Presidential selection process, has attempted to assemble a \"Grass Roots\" convention in Georgia to nominate him for President on yet another Democratic breakaway ticket. Despite the tepid backing of the DuPonts and other northern industrialists, these plans have fallen through, and Talmadge has given up his effort due to a lack of support outside of Georgia.\n\nNevertheless, despite Talmadge's failure, the campaign's position in the south remains tenuous. The rejection of Talmadge has had an unintended side effect however: northern African-American voters have expressed increased interest in Long's campaign, a small but crucial bloc that may help in the north. The south however has turned into a hotly contested battleground, as the children of the Democratic Party tear one another apart."

 united_states_leadup_events.35.d.body: "In 1912, African-American voters were, after decades of failure on civil rights issues, disillusioned with the Republican Party. When Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson appeared receptive to the concerns of African-Americans, in spite of his southern background, many African-Americans flocked to his campaign. When in office however, Wilson proceeded to segregate the federal government, deny appointments to African-Americans, and increase the severity of segregation in the armed forces, setting back progress on civil rights by decades.\n\nThe African-American community is familiar with such betrayals and disappointments. The Republican Party has taken a largely passive stance on civil rights issues, while the Democratic Party, still with a powerful southern interest, has provided little more hope for change. Perhaps the brightest hope in recent years however has been the Presidency of Al Smith. Smith, traditionally seen as a defender of civil rights, again energised black support for the Democrats. Instead of reneging on his promises like Wilson however, Smith has overseen some notable successes in civil rights policy, most notably the passage of the Costigan-Wagner Anti-Lynching Act in 1935.\n\nWith the entry of Huey Long onto the national scene, African-American voters in the north have looked on the Louisiana upstart with reserved optimism. Long is known for having avoided racial vitriol and demagoguery in his statewide campaigns in Louisiana, and some of his statements surrounding the administration of social security as well as his national approach to racial issues gave rise to a hope that he would be a different kind of southerner. That optimism was shattered however by Long's selection of Eugene Talmadge as his running mate. Talmadge, one of the most infamous race-baiting Governors in the south, has marked a change in direction for the Long campaign. Talmadge frequently espouses racist rhetoric on the campaign trail, seeing no pushback from Long on the matter, who is now silent regarding the concerns of his black constituents."

As opposed to the lower South, whose inhabitants are generally acclimated to extreme heat, midwestern Americans have almost no frame of reference for such intense waves.\n\nOn July 9th and 10th, a season that has already seen record-breaking heat saw records broken once again: on average, a triangle of states from New York to the Dakotas to Tennessee faced temperatures upwards of 105-115 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as excruciatingly high humidity. Some towns had quite literally never seen temperatures over 95 degrees, not to mention over 115, leaving citizens completely unprepared. In the last week alone, approximately 5,000 American citizens have been killed by the heat directly or through conditions aggravated by the heat.\n\nWhile it seems the worst is over for now, the wave will hardly go away quickly, and it seems to be just another sign that times are not good for the United States of America.

It must be admitted, however, as many progressives, socialists, and liberals, reviewers and not, have pointed out - both North and South - the tale is filled with default assumptions of the loyalty of both the enslaved and freed peoples, endorsement of white supremacy, and the idea that women are content in a subordinate role to men.

Having stayed out of the European War, the U.S. military severely lacks on-the-ground experience, with post-1919 reforms having relied on a distant analysis of the war in Europe. With the Great Depression having led to several significant cuts in military funding under successive administrations, this has left our military forces in a rather sorry state, with more “experimental” sections of the armed forces such as armour and airpower suffering the brunt of austerity.\n\nChief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur has faced much backlash for his implementation of Washington's budget cuts. His cuts to armoured development in particular have gone down poorly with innovative officers such as Ralph E. Jones, who support a focus on armour similar to that of the British Army.\n\nAnother group increasingly dissatisfied with MacArthur's leadership is the U.S. Army Air Corps. USAAC innovators have called for an independent air force, a call unlikely to be heeded under an austerity regime. Additionally, USAAC radicals have raised eyebrows with their notoriously progressive politics and radical educational program. At the Air Corps Tactical School, Marxist economics are taught in conjunction with the radicals' own industrial network theory, and progressive theories of “humanitarian bombing” hold much sway.\n\nThe navy meanwhile wrestles with an increasingly aging fleet. With little money for new shipbuilding projects, the navy is left mainly focusing on doctrinal reforms, reforms which underline the service's importance in any potential war with Germany, Britain, or, most likely, Japan.\n\nFaced with demand for reform in the military, MacArthur has announced a plan to overhaul the old Corps Area system in the wake of a War Department study. Though this is unlikely to be completed before next year, jockeying for key postings has already begun. Progressive allies of Generals James K. Parsons and Smedley Butler have been concentrated in the north and midwest, while more conservative and reactionary officers, including the infamous “Butcher of Mingo”, General George Van Horn Moseley, have taken more southern postings. Though this division would preferably have been avoided, it is difficult to avoid the growing cliquism that has underlain military politics."

He soon proved them wrong - polling extremely well in Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Washington, and other Great Plains states and even notching several outright wins.\n\nThe Farmer-Labor party is determined to maintain that momentum. This time however, he is competing with Huey Long for disaffected, anti-establishment rural voters, making his quest much harder as the two candidates enter into direct competition. Both have attempted to shore up their populist credentials while showing their ability to work within establishment structures as Governors, and while seeking to avoid being implicated in the various scandals dogging their campaigns - whether it be their radical allies or their own histories of alleged corruption and political violence.\n\nOlson seems to be doing fairly well holding his own over Long, who had the initial advantage in peeling off voters from the Republicans and especially disillusioned fellow democrats. Making inroads among progressive Republicans in the north with the help of the Nonpartisan League and making his way into the Democratic scene, things seem to be swinging his way.\n\nThere are of course plenty of more weeks left to go however, and some within the Farmer-Labor Party have criticised Olson's strategy, arguing that the Great Plains has considerably fewer electoral votes in contention. They bemoan the relative lack of attention in the grand prize of New York, and question whether or not Olson's time is being well spent. However, Olson and his allies have defended their decisions, arguing that flipping the Great Plains would go a long way in ultimately winning the election, trusting that Farmer-Labor has sufficient votes to win the Steel Belt."

He soon proved them wrong - polling extremely well in Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Washington, and other Great Plains states and even notching several outright wins.\n\nTo actually win the election however, the Farmer-Labor Party will need to capture states with much larger electoral votes rather than the sparsely populated Great Plains. Consequently, Norman Thomas and the Farmer-Labor Party has been putting much more attention in the Midwest and East, solidifying their hold on areas of growing SPA strength in the Steel Belt.\n\nThis has surprisingly put the extremely valuable state of New York, the largest state in the Union, into play. Norman Thomas has a long history of campaigning in New York, both for himself and his allies, and this has worked to his advantage in 1936. The incumbent New York Republican Party has been thrown into panic about the prospect of losing the state and has been scrambling to consolidate the establishment vote there. A win in New York would go a long way, especially if the Farmer-Labor Party can secure their expected wins in the Midwest, however they will need to survive the GOP counter-attack first.\n\nThomas has however effectively sacrificed the Great Plains in this quest, and many within the party have complained that Farmer-Labor is effectively fighting a rear-guard action there against the Longist surge.

Without any means to cool themselves, thousands died throughout the summer, which peaked in intensity in mid-July.\n\nThe scorching heat however was not the only thing ailing the plains. A resulting drought has ruined harvests already impacted by the Dust Bowl and the depression, pressing farmers in the southern plains even harder than they had previously imagined possible.

Though Robinson was not injured, a bullet struck Lieutenant Governor M. Clifford Townsend, the Democratic nominee for the governorship, sending him to the hospital, where he is in a critical but stable condition.\n\nThe assailant, local man Daniel Wares, was shot on the spot by Secret Service agents. Though Wares was seemingly a supporter of Huey Long, he is not believed to have had organisational links to any radical or extremist political groups, having seemingly been rejected from joining a local Minutemen chapter. The investigation into the matter has come to the conclusion that Wares was a lone actor with eclectic political views, motivated to shoot the Vice President due to a general dissatisfaction with the Smith Administration.\n\nAll of Robinson's fellow candidates for the presidency have issued statements denouncing the attack, and expressing relief at the vice president's escape from harm. This includes Long himself, who not long ago clashed violently with Robinson for the Democratic nomination. Nevertheless, the radicalising effect of the rhetoric of figures like Long is clearly to some degree at fault for the growing militarisation of American political life.

The strip's titular protagonist is a costumed crime-fighter who wears a mask and purple spandex, who relies on his wits, skill at gunslinging, and the myth of his own immortality to battle evildoers. Beginning as a daily strip in February, The Phantom has quickly grown popular enough to be serialised overseas, with the Australian Woman's Mirror picking up the series.\n\nRegardless of what anyone might think of such silly stories, it can't be denied that the country could do with something to look forward to these days. Perhaps we could all do with a little cartoon fun."

 united_states_leadup_events.44.t: "Charles Lindbergh Endorses Long"
 united_states_leadup_events.44.d: "Charles Lindbergh, the famed aviator, has suddenly endorsed Huey Long's campaign. Born to his father Charles August Lindbergh, an immigrant from Sweden who later became a politician noted for his activism against an American entry in the Great War, Charles was fascinated by motor transportation from a young age.\n\nAfter quitting college, he became an aviator and barnstormed around the American countryside, a pioneer in this new age of flight. He worked as an air-mail pilot before quitting to begin designing the \"Spirit of St. Louis.\" Despite having considerably fewer resources than his rivals, Lindbergh became the first to make a nonstop flight from New York to Paris in 1927, a massive milestone in aviation. Even as he landed in Paris, circling the Eiffel Tower, a huge crowd of over a hundred thousand people came to greet him, dragging him out of his plane in jubilation. Lindbergh became an international sensation, with hundreds of songs written about him, and he received a hero's homecoming when he returned to New York.\n\nHe spent the next few years making some contributions to science and aviation, but struggled against the strain of publicity. Hounded by the press both during and after his world-wide tour, Lindbergh and his family underwent further trauma in 1932 when his infant son Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. was abducted and held for ransom. While his son was successfully retrieved and the kidnapper, a German immigrant, was apprehended, the publicity from the incident became known as the \"Crime of the Century \", adding further attention to the intensely private Lindbergh.\n\nLindbergh has spent the past year or so in Europe to avoid the spotlight, but his return and endorsement of Long has thrown him back in the public eye. A close friend of Henry Ford, a staunch anti-socialist, an isolationist like his father, and a white supremacist, his political views have drawn controversy but he remains popular among many Americans."

 united_states_leadup_events.45.t: "The Jobless Party"
 united_states_leadup_events.45.d: "From start to finish, the Democratic campaign for the presidency in 1936 has been a general and complete catastrophe. Having suffered a nearly fatal party split after Huey Long failed to win the nomination in a contested convention, the Democrats were left to run an unpopular holdover of an unpopular administration in Vice President Joe T. Robinson. Tied to the hip to Al Smith's record, Robinson has consistently failed to separate himself from the unpopular incumbent president, leaving the Democrats scrambling to recover any ground at all.\n\nThe floundering Democratic effort has made room for all other significant candidates competing in this election. Long very blatantly hopes to cannibalise the Democratic base, and to render himself the de facto Democratic nominee. The Republicans meanwhile seek to take the votes of non-socialist progressives and liberals, while Farmer-Labor hopes to tear away the Democrats' working class constituents.\n\nThe failure of the Democrats has also made room for other efforts however. In Pennsylvania, Father James R. Cox, a Smith-supporting labour priest with ties to the local AFL and CIO, has launched his own “Jobless Party”, on who's ticket he intends to run for president. The ticket has appealed to some Smith-supporting Pennsylvania Catholics, as well as the unemployed, but it is not likely to be a strong effort. It is far from the only crow picking at the Democratic carcass however. Instead, it is just another example of how much the Democrats have failed."

 united_states_leadup_events.46.d: "While militias have existed before even the American Revolution and played a major role in its history, the United States has not seen this degree of polarisation and organisation of its militias since the American Civil War over seven decades ago.\n\nWhen Huey Long first called for new \"Minutemen\", he might have simply been speaking rhetorically. However, the rapid proliferation of paramilitaries under this umbrella has seen them become the armed wing of his movement. Brandishing converted weapons and stockpiling ammunition, they have become increasingly visible at Long's rallies. Some wonder if they have become such a force in their own right that even Long is unable to fully control them. If that is indeed the case he has made no indication of it or any regret for their formation, frequently praising them in his recent speeches.\n\nTheir evolution has been rapid. The initial paramilitaries were loosely organised (often rival) bands begrudgingly sharing a label led by unstable radicals with dubious pasts engaging in small-scale skirmishes. Though still not quite a single unified entity, Minutemen closer to the Union Party centre have developed a more formal hierarchy. Their commanders, often respected military veterans, have turned the Minutemen into a dangerous fighting force (albeit still unable to contend with a conventional army): terrorising leftist gatherings, violently breaking up strikes and protests, and staging increasingly well-planned raids on the Red Guard.\n\nThere have been political consequences for Long however - while some moderates accept the violence as a necessary bulwark against a socialist revolution, many others have been turned off by the militarisation of the Union Party. As the worst atrocities of the Minutemen make it into the papers, Long is faced with a reckoning. Continuing to allow them to operate autonomously would leave some plausible deniability for Long but be a liability in the long term, but some doubt if he can even tighten the leash at all."

 united_states_leadup_events.47.t: "The Young Bullmoose"
 united_states_leadup_events.47.d: "The Vice President rarely receives much attention on the campaign trail, but Quentin Roosevelt might be an exception. The youngest son of President Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin grew up in the White House where he was a notorious troublemaker. He soon grew into an intelligent, thoughtful young man, attending Harvard University and becoming a noted writer. He also married prominent socialite Flora Payne Whitney, a descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Trained in the ROTC in 1916, Quentin largely disliked the experience but even after graduation spent some time in the military and helped them develop a new military air wing.\n\nQuentin inherits his father's political legacy. Theodore Roosevelt Sr. was a prominent liberal Republican at the turn of the century, famous for embracing progressive movement policies at home and adopting an interventionist foreign policy abroad. Disgruntled with his successor William Taft's conservative policies, he attempted to run for a third term in 1912 at the helm of the Progressive Party, dubbed the \"Bull Moose Party\" after Roosevelt boasted he felt \"strong as a bull moose\" despite his loss at the 1912 Republican Convention. While the Bull Moose Party has long since disintegrated, the Roosevelt political legacy has not.\n\nQuentin leveraged his father's fame to help him win the 1932 New York Gubernatorial election, bringing the Republicans back into power in Albany. His implementation of progressive policies has made him a young standard-bearer for the liberal wing of the Republican party, helping shore up the party's support from the left."

 united_states_leadup_events.48.t: "Closing Arguments"
 united_states_leadup_events.48.d: "When elections come to a close, they end as an orchestral crescendo. Every candidate seeks to make their core message as widely known as possible, to capture every last undecided voter, to consolidate in the state where they are expected to do well and make a final push in the states which are still up for grabs.\n\nThis year of course is different only in scale. Four viable candidates campaign for the presidency, each with interweaving regional and political bases. The chaos of the four-horse race has allowed voters to cast their ballots without much regard for spoilage or strategic voting. As such, both the Democrats and Republicans have been forced to fight tooth and nail to keep their voters in line.\n\nAs the campaign nears its conclusion, the Republicans have put their young, bright face, Quentin Roosevelt, front and centre. A nationwide tour has seen the GOP recover some of its slippage in the polls, as Roosevelt's charisma and boyish charms make up for any shortcomings at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn recent months meanwhile, the Farmer-Labor campaign has increasingly been staffed by Socialist Party cadres, who have pushed the party's messaging in a more radical direction in spite of the wishes of the convention. Similarly, Huey Long's campaign has also become more and more militant, as the Minutemen briefly lay down their pistols and rifles to go pamphleteering for the Kingfish.\n\nWhere the other three parties are rising, the Democrats are stalling and falling. Though Vice President Robinson is an impassioned speaker, eight years of unpopular Democratic rule has made that party's brand poison, especially for a man so closely tied to Al Smith.\n\nClausewitz says that war is politics by other means. On the campaign trail, the opposite might be said to be true: as in war, each campaign seeks a decisive blow, a through-line, a winning message. As things stand, no breakthrough seems likely in the closing days of the campaign. We await the people's decision with bated breath."

 united_states_leadup_events.49.d: "As the nationwide strike wave precipitated by worsening economic conditions continues to spread, militant labour organisations have been further emboldened to strike in key industries. The turn from October to November has seen a substantial up flare in industrial struggle in the maritime industry on both coasts.\n\nIn the west, CIO heavyweight Harry Bridges has sought to maintain the gains and replicate the success of the massive 1934 West Coast Longshoremen Strike, which culminated in a general strike in San Francisco. Bridges has united his International Longshoremen's Association with Harry Lundeberg's Sailors' Union of the Pacific, under the banner of the Maritime Federation of the Pacific, which has now brought all shipping on the West Coast to a halt, with both longshoremen and sailors refusing to work.\n\nOn the gulf coast, parallel developments have led to the emergence of the Maritime Federation of the Gulf Coast, a union inspired by Bridges and Lundeberg's organisation. Rejecting the AFL's International Seamen's Union, the SPA-influenced unionists have initiated a wildcat strike. Compared to their West Coast counterparts, the Gulf Coast strikers have struggled with law enforcement and maintaining racial solidarity, though both coasts have seen significant incidences of violence against police and “yellow” union officials.\n\nThe total shutdown of West Coast shipping is certainly the most concerning impact of this latest strike. The potential impact on food supply chains in particular is of grave consequence. Though any impact is unlikely to be felt before voters go to the polls, the same cannot be said of the industrial conflict that has been brewing throughout the past year."

 united_states_leadup_events.50.d: "Throughout the year, the American people have been waiting for the election with bated breath. Some have been eager to finally be able to express their full dissatisfaction with the current state of the country, to tear down the current administration and bring about a new dawn by electing their preferred candidate of change. Others have fearfully awaited the likely consequences of a contested and violent election, likely to be the peak of growing radical political activity, which has dominated the headlines this year.\n\nAmericans this year have come to the polls in droves. Turnout has increased compared to 1932 by over 7 percent, driven by increased participation of women and working class voters. Incidents of violence at polling stations, both towards political opponents and poll workers, have been reported in numerous locations, particularly in socialist-dominated northern municipalities (where the Red Guards and Minutemen compete with ferocity), however it has not been as overwhelming an issue as we might have feared. With most states using the secret “Australian ballot”, the effects of voter intimidation has been reflectively limited.\n\nIn any case, as Americans go to the polls, we await the results with a great deal of anticipation. While it is quite likely that the election will end without a winner on election day, just as it did four years ago, we can hope beyond hope that the election provides some resolution to the country's political ills."
 united_states_leadup_events.50.a: "And the results are in..."

 united_states_leadup_events.51.t: "No Winner!"
 united_states_leadup_events.51.d.intro: "As the votes came in, it quickly became clear that none of the four major candidates had a decisive advantage. Long, the Republicans, and Farmer-Labor each captured their “safe” states: the Republicans won upper New England and Indiana decisively, Long swept the deep south, and Farmer-Labor won a stretch of states from West Virginia to North Dakota.\n\nThe real story of the night was the complete collapse of the Democratic vote. Appearing to fall to fourth place both in the popular and electoral vote, the Democrats struggled to win beyond their safest states, such as Virginia and Texas. Dragged down by eight years of unpopular Democratic government, the incumbent party has collapsed in a manner scarcely predicted by even the most pessimistic observers.\n\nAs the final votes come in, it is now clear that no party will win a majority of the electoral vote. With the Republicans and Farmer-Labor contesting the top two places, Long and the Union Party in third, and the Democrats in fourth, a contingent election will now have to be held in Congress. The complete collapse of the Democrats however throws a wrench in the process: since the Democrats fell below third place, Joe T. Robinson will not be a candidate in the contingent election.\n\nInstead, the House of Representatives will be faced with a choice of the Republicans, Farmer-Labor, and Long. The continued strength of the Democratic delegation however means that the clearest losers of this election will still play a decisive role in electing the next president."

 united_states_leadup_events.52.t: "Accusations of Fraud"
 united_states_leadup_events.52.d: "The indecisive election results have left no parties satisfied. With many devoted partisans (particularly from the radical parties) fuming at their candidate's failure to win decisively, allegations of foul play and systemic rigging of election results have entered the public discourse. Across the nation, claims that local or state or even federal authorities have manipulated the results of the election have grown louder and louder, yet another symptom of collapsing faith in America's institutions.\n\nThe Socialist Party has used reports from their poll watchers of numerous instances of attempted discarding of Socialist and Farmer-Labor ballots to claim a systemic nationwide undercount of Farmer-Labor votes. They have also denounced the suppression of the African-American vote in the south, a fact of life since the end of Reconstruction, and claimed that, had southern blacks been able to vote, they would have delivered several states to the Farmer-Labor column.\n\nHuey Long meanwhile has thrown around numerous claims regarding vote manipulation. Claiming Republican and Socialist municipal politicians cost him hundreds of thousands of city votes, Long has sued numerous states for recounts of their ballots. Such claims seem rather hypocritical however, when accounting for the infamous practices of his own machine, as well as the Democratic machines allied with him, such as the Pendergast Machine in Kansas City.\n\nThough lawsuits surrounding most claims of fraud are unlikely to hold up in court, the very fact that such claims are so commonplace is a dire sign for the legitimacy of American elections. If millions of voters will not accept their candidate's defeat, how can we have a stable and civil political culture?"

 united_states_leadup_events.53.d: "As the aftermath of the election continues to unfold, the myriad disputes and contestations surrounding the results have grown in intensity and stakes. What has emerged as by far the most significant electoral dispute has been that surrounding the election for the governorship of New York. In a tight three-way race, the Democrats, Republicans, and Farmer-Labor have all claimed victory, demanding recounts of various batches of votes they suspect to be fraudulent.\n\nIncumbent Governor Quentin Roosevelt was, at the beginning of the year, widely expected to win re-election handedly. His selection as the GOP's nominee for Vice President however ended his bid for re-election, resulting in an open race for the Republican nomination and the governorship. The new Republican nominee, famed urban planner Robert Moses, holds more conservative positions than Roosevelt. His comparative conservatism allowed the Democratic nominee, Former Governor Herbert Lehman, to make a play for the non-socialist progressive vote.\n\nThe race was rounded out by the Farmer-Labor candidate, SPA official Benjamin Gitlow. Though the New York Farmer-Labor Party includes many non-socialist progressives, its largest component by far is the New York Socialist Party. Gitlow, a protege and close ally of John Reed, has, in spite of his radicalism compared to figures such as the Farmer-Labor mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, cornered the labour vote, and effectively mounted a competitive bid for the governorship.\n\nThough few could predict how the close race would turn out, fewer still would have expected a three-way tie. All three parties have claimed victory, and numerous recounts in key counties have been ordered. As things stand, our advisors expect Lehman to pull ahead based on the numbers available to us, however it appears likely that the Socialists will refuse to concede no matter what any court orders."

 united_states_leadup_events.54.t: "The Conservative Coalition"
 united_states_leadup_events.54.d: "If anything can be gleaned from the election results in November, it is that the conservative politics of the Smith Administration have been utterly repudiated by the American voting public. All three candidates who are eligible to be elected in the contingent election campaigned on a platform of change, be it moderate (in the case of the GOP), progressive (in the case of Farmer-Labor), or populist (in the case of Long). Robinson, the candidate most representative of continuity, was soundly crushed both in the popular vote and the electoral college.\n\nNevertheless, conservatives in Congress have not taken this setback lying down. Bracing for a political environment that, in any case, is likely to see substantial attempts to affect change in American politics, conservatives in both the Democratic and Republican parties have met informally to discuss shared tactics going forward.\n\nThe result has now been dubbed the “Conservative Coalition”, an unofficial alliance united behind general conservative principles. The “conservative manifesto”, released by Democratic Senator from North Carolina Josiah Bailey and co-signed by several conservatives of both parties as a framework for the alliance, endorses sound financing, limited government intervention in the economy, and a conservative labour policy as its core tenets.\n\nBoth Farmer-Labor and Long have denounced the new alliance as a haven for vested interests. Nevertheless, the new bloc is sizable, and is already preparing to make life hell for any overly radical incoming president. The bloc has also taken the liberty of meeting with several figures of national importance, such as General Douglas MacArthur and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, to better assess the growing radical violence taking place nationwide."

 united_states_leadup_events.55.d: "For over a year now, since even before the economic downturn of February, militant labour action has steadily grown both in intensity and scale across the country. The lack of any certainty of policy following the election has only intensified this trend, as SPA and CIO rabble-rousers proclaim that the contested election will be used as an excuse for government inaction on the economy and on protecting the right to organise.\n\nOn both coasts, the maritime strike launched by Harry Bridges continues into its second month. Though the federal government has once again offered to mediate, both the companies and the union have sought a decisive victory: with both sides being more militarised than in 1934, Minutemen and Red Guards clash in San Francisco and other port cities, egged on by both sides.\n\nIn the east, tensions in the industrial core of the nation have once again flared up. William Z. Foster, the CIO's leading ultrasyndicalist and architect of the 1931 Great Steel Strike, has turned his attention to “little steel”, which escaped unionisation in 1931 while U.S. Steel was forced to the table. Now, after his near fatal heart attack, Foster has re-emerged onto the scene with a bang, hoping to impose a similar deal on its minor competitors. The strike has quickly turned violent, with several workers and paramilitaries dead.\n\nNearby in Detroit, the UAW, accepted by the motor industry as a fait accompli after the success of the steel strike, has launched another round of industrial action against General Motors, after GM announced plans to close down several factories. Intending to protect their members' employment, the union has rallied around leading figure Walter Reuther, who, in spite of his injuries earlier this year, has managed an energetic organising and picketing effort.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the election, the labour train appears to be headed on a collision course with every established authority in this nation. We can only hope it can be halted by peaceful means."

 united_states_leadup_events.56.d: "Today, the various presidential electors from all 48 states have met to cast their ballots for the presidency. In the United States, votes in presidential elections are technically not cast for the presidential candidates themselves, but rather for slates of electors pledged to vote on behalf of their candidates in the legally binding election. Though usually a mere formality, the electoral college has sometimes had significance beyond mere civic ritual: though electors are generally loyal party men, they, on occasion, break with their pledges to vote for alternative candidates, becoming “faithless” electors.\n\nThe careful vetting of candidates in this high-stakes election has precluded the possibility of any faithless electors this year. The electoral college has voted in lockstep with what was expected of it. As such, we can now know with absolute certainty that there will be no outright winner in the election. Instead, there will now have to be a contingent election in Congress to separately elect a president and vice president, just as there was four years ago in 1932.\n\nThough Al Smith and Joe Robinson rode relatively easily to re-election in the House and Senate that year, due to continued Democratic strength, this year things are much less certain. Though the Senate (which elects the vice president and is still dominated by the establishment parties) is likely to elect Quentin Roosevelt to the no.2 spot, the House (which elects the president) is a general mess, and few can predict the direction in which the wind will blow."

With little left in his career but to preside over the certification of the results of the election he disastrously lost, few have expected much of Robinson before his presumed post-vice presidential retirement, especially as the attention of the nation is focused on other, more pressing matters.\n\nNow however, Robinson has been spared the ignominy of presiding over his own defeat. Today, news has come from Washington of the vice president's passing. After complaining of chest pains two days ago, he died of heart failure, probably brought about by the stress of campaigning. The decisive loss of his home state in the election to his enemy, Huey Long, also weighed heavily on the vice president in his last days.\n\nWith Robinson's death, the duty of certifying the results of the election will pass to the president pro tempore of the Senate. Both President Smith and numerous members of both the House and Senate paid their respects to Robinson, a veteran legislator as Senator from Arkansas. Both the Republican and Farmer-Labor nominees sent their condolences, while Huey Long gave a brief acknowledgement of Robinson's death."

Walter Reuther, still sporting bandages from the so-called Battle of the Overpass from months ago, was seen shaking the hands of many an auto-worker after the UAW led the effort with a series of wildcat strikes and direct actions increasingly bordering on the revolutionary. Organising the workers into elected committees based on factory as well as overall Union affiliation (be it IWW, CIO, or in some cases sparse AFL radicals or previously unaffiliated workers), the SPA have essentially began the direct formation of dual-power structures within the nation's industrial heartland. The state government has completely crumbled in response to the workers' demands, and has immediately agreed to pay markedly increased wages using federal funds, de-facto nationalizing the plants without compensation to a furious GM.\n\nA flurry of furious legal suits is nothing new for the times, especially at this point, but the scale is almost unprecedented. The government's panicked concession sent the most worrying message to business leaders across the country, too paralyzed to do anything about the disruption of normal commerce. As the CIO organises the self-defence and armament of the newly socialized factories, a dreadful question once thought unthinkable began to bubble onto the lips of worker and boss alike."

This leaves the Democratic representatives as de facto kingmakers, as they cannot vote for their own candidate, and must therefore support the nominee of another party.\n\nOn the one hand, most simply, they can form an establishment oriented coalition to elect the Republican nominee. The Democrats and Republicans together have a thin majority, so finding the votes for this should be fairly simple. As the Republicans have indicated a willingness to allow John Nance Garner to remain as Speaker if their candidate is elected, it should be easy to bring most Democrats on board with the idea.\n\nAlternatively, the Democrats could cobble together a coalition of Democrats, Progressive Republicans, and moderate Farmer-Laborites to elect Huey Long President.

With pressure mounting however, a breakthrough occurred on the second day of voting. A deal was struck between a majority of the Democratic caucus and Farmer-Labor, as well as a handful of progressive Republicans.\n\nIn exchange for Farmer-Labor votes for John Nance Garner for speaker, a majority of Democrats agreed to vote for Floyd Olson for President, contingent on the nomination of several Democrats to the cabinet. With Garner in the speakership, the contingent election went ahead without much incident: after a couple of false starts, the main key Democratic holdouts gave way for Olson in the third round of voting. With that, Floyd Olson was formally elected the 32nd President of the United States.\n\nOlson's election immediately brought about significant protests from the conservative contingent in Congress. Several southern reactionary Democrats walked out upon the election of a “socialist” to the nation's highest office. News of Olson's election travelled quickly, and the new president-elect has now quickly begun to assemble his multi-party cabinet. The loss of two months of preparation time between the election and the inauguration has resulted in a rush in Washington, as federal officials only have two weeks to prepare for Olson to take office.\n\nNevertheless, the firm election of a president comes as a relief across the nation.

A deal was struck between the Democratic and Republican contingents in the House, as well as a handful of non-socialist Farmer-Laborites.\n\nIn exchange for Republican votes for John Nance Garner for speaker, most Democrats agreed to vote for William Borah for President, contingent on the nomination of several Democrats to the cabinet. With Garner in the speakership, the contingent election went ahead without much incident: only a single round of voting was required to confirm the election of Borah, as the combined Democratic-Republican majority held more than enough state delegations to push him through on the first ballot. With that, William Borah was formally elected the 32nd President of the United States.\n\nBorah's election, widely regarded as the most likely outcome going into the new Congress, went by with little protest from the congressional centre. The Socialists walked out in protest, but broadly the election has been received positively. News of Borah's election travelled quickly, and the new president-elect has now quickly begun to assemble his two-party cabinet. The loss of two months of preparation time between the election and the inauguration has resulted in a rush in Washington, as federal officials only have two weeks to prepare for Borah to take office.\n\nNevertheless, the firm election of a president comes as a relief across the nation.

 united_states_leadup_events.64.t: "The Popular Vote Controversy"
 united_states_leadup_events.64.d.intro: "In our constitution, there is no requirement that the winner of the most votes in the nationwide presidential election is necessarily the winner. On five prior occasions (in 1824, 1876, 1888, 1920, and 1932), the winner of the popular vote did not end up winning the presidency, either because of a divide between the Electoral College and the popular vote, or because a contingent election in the house selected a candidate other than the popular vote winner.\n\nNow, 1936 has become the sixth such occasion, and the third in a space of 17 years. The House has, for the second time in a row, selected a less popular candidate for the presidency. Though this does not have any legal bearing on the president's legitimacy, it is obviously a less than ideal situation for the legitimacy of our democratic institutions: in the wake of the contingent election, small protests popped up across the nation denouncing Congress' choice to “ignore the people's will”."
 united_states_leadup_events.64.d.republican: "$united_states_leadup_events.64.d.intro$\n\nThe Republican Party, whose candidate won the popular vote, has entered into a series of factional scuffles over their failure to force the election of their nominee. Various congressional Republican factions are blaming one another for the loss of cohesion that resulted in the Democrats settling on an alternative political course. Nevertheless, most Republicans have, reluctantly, accepted the results."
 united_states_leadup_events.64.d.olson: "$united_states_leadup_events.64.d.intro$\n\nSince the contingent election, popular vote winner Floyd Olson has mostly retreated from public view. That has left other forces within Farmer-Labor to take hold of the protest movement, namely the Socialist Party. The Socialists have seized on the House's choice of a less popular candidate, denouncing American democracy as a sham and calling for a complete revision of the constitution. The fact that such a platform has any mainstream appeal at all is a dire sign of the times."

Despite hopes to the contrary, it's likely that Long will remain a thorn in the side of the incoming administration."

 united_states_leadup_events.65.t: "Quentin Roosevelt Elected Vice President"
 united_states_leadup_events.65.d.intro: "The election of a president in the House of Representatives has broadly come as a relief in Washington. Regardless of the differences of political opinion surrounding the election, the end of the uncertainty that lasted for two months between the voting in November and the contingent election in the House has come as a great relief to the nation.\n\nThe House election however has not resolved all of the loose ends of the election. There remains the question of the vice presidency: in a contingent election, instead of being elected in the House like the president, the vice president is elected in the Senate in a separate vote. Due to the greater hurdles required to be elected to the Senate, the chamber remains dominated by the establishment parties, which, between them, still hold a supermajority.\n\nToday, that supermajority has met to elect the new Vice President. Between the top two candidates in the electoral college, the Senate has elected the Republican nominee, Quentin Roosevelt, to the vice presidency. Roosevelt, the widely popular son of the late Former President Theodore Roosevelt, had little trouble assembling a Senate majority behind him, especially when placed up against the more radical Farmer-Labor candidate."
 united_states_leadup_events.65.d.republican: "$united_states_leadup_events.65.d.intro$\n\nRoosevelt's election comes as a boon to the newly elected Republican president-elect. The election of the entire Republican ticket represents a seemingly small but important victory for the GOP. With Roosevelt expected to take a key role in the administration, it seems likely that the new president will lean on his youth and popularity to support his administration in these troubled times."
 united_states_leadup_events.65.d.olson: "$united_states_leadup_events.65.d.intro$\n\nRoosevelt's election is a point of inconvenience to President-Elect Floyd Olson. Olson had hoped the entire Farmer-Labor ticket would enter the White House, however it was always regarded as likely that Norman Thomas would fail to be elected by the Senate. Nevertheless, Olson has indicated his desire to have a functioning relationship with the vice president he has had foisted upon him. We can only hope they can work together in these troubled times."
 united_states_leadup_events.65.d.long: "$united_states_leadup_events.65.d.intro$\n\nRoosevelt's election is a point of inconvenience to President-Elect Huey Long. Since Long came third in the Electoral College, his running mate was not available in the contingent election in the Senate. As such, Long's supporters (including himself) reluctantly voted for Roosevelt as the lesser of two evils. Nevertheless, Long has reached out to Roosevelt, hoping to have a productive relationship with his new vice president. Some have even hoped that an influential Roosevelt may serve to moderate Long's more radical tendencies. In any case, we can only hope Roosevelt's election heralds better days in these troubled times."

 united_states_leadup_events.66.d: "Several days of frantic balloting have made a mess of the house floor. Frantic negotiation, horse trading, demands, threats, every card in the politician's playbook. And yet, after days of fighting (approaching very literal levels), the House is still no closer to electing a speaker.\n\nWith the time for the certification of the presidential election results fast approaching, previous Speaker John Nance Garner made one last desperate push to win the speakership. He failed, by an even larger margin than he had previously. With no speaker, the House is in no state to negotiate for the election of a president. Though preliminary legal advice has indicated that the house should be able to participate in the joint session of Congress which will certify the results of the election, there is little hope of putting together a coalition to actually elect a president after the results are certified.\n\nWorse still, the Senate is feeling the effects of the deadlock in the house. Even though the composition of the Senate should make a compromise much easier, Democrats thus far have failed to reach a deal with the Republicans to elect Quentin Roosevelt vice president, as some Republicans have even gone so far as to accuse Democratic leadership of obstructing the election so Cordell Hull will become acting president on the 20th.\n\nWith it quickly becoming a distinct possibility that, come January 20th there will be no President of the United States, Washington has gone into panic mode. Preparations for any incoming administration are impossible when there is no certainty that there will be any new administration at all. The nationwide strike wave has picked up further steam, and President Smith has been briefed about the army's ability to contain a nationwide insurrection.\n\nWith only two weeks to go, we can only hope that the House can resolve this situation before it is too late."

Despite this, America was willing to stop for a day to listen to their new President speak. With all eyes upon him, he began his speech with the usual boilerplate statements calling for unity, promising a smooth transition, and also vowing to work with Vice President Roosevelt.\n\nBut Olson quickly took a more argumentative tone, saying that \"a nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is retrenching, reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, and throwing more and more men and women on the streets to shift for themselves. Just how that is going to solve our economic problems is beyond understanding!\".\n\nAll the while, the hapless establishment has done little. \"Never have the Republican and Democratic parties, both nationally and locally, been quite so low in morale and so bankrupt in ideas as today. They have stood like men dazed, watching the parade go by, and not knowing what it is all about.\" To him, only decisive action could save the republic, decisive action was what he was elected to do, and therefore decisive action he will take.\n\nTo those accusing him of trampling on civil liberties in the process, Olson roared with questions of his own: \"Whose liberty? Liberty for what purpose? Liberty of the Citizens' Alliance to arm thugs to shoot defenceless strikers in the back? Liberty of promoters of spurious stocks to fleece widows and orphans? Liberty of millionaires to escape taxation? Liberty to make slaves of workers and serfs of farmers? These are the individual liberties that these people mean!\"\n\nPresident Olson has a long, difficult road ahead of him, but it is clear that America is ready to chart a new path."

Nicknamed the \"Great Opposer\" for his outspoken stances in Congress, he is a famed orator compared to the great American statesmen Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John Calhoun.\n\nWith the nation in the midst of a crisis, Borah spoke for over two hours without notes - addressing topics ranging from political gridlock, the economic depression, social justice, domestic violence and even touching slightly on international affairs. Invoking American patriotism, he said that \"if we have erred we have erred out of too much love for those things which from childhood you and we together were taught to revere,\" calling for a united effort towards change.\n\nDespite this, he took a harder line on radicalism, quoting Lincoln's warning to \"entertain no compromise; have none of it.\" He stated that \"there is nothing that dies so hard and rallies so often as intolerance. The vices and passions which it summons to its support are the most ruthless and the most persistent harbored in the human breast. They sometimes sleep but they never seem to die. Anything, any extraordinary situation, any unnecessary controversy, may light those fires again and plant in our republic that which has destroyed every republic which undertook to nurse it.\"\n\nTo some, Borah's impassioned speech moved them to tears.

It is true that most of them were small. Altogether, however, they provided work for many millions of people.\" The current depression has seen few new ventures however because \"the small business man, the working man who would like to become his own boss - the average American - has hesitated to start out for himself.

 united_states_leadup_events.71.d: "For the past two weeks, Congress has been locked in an endless gridlock. No party or group has been willing or able to compromise in order to create a majority needed to elect a president or a vice president. As the country descends into rioting, mass strikes, and political violence, the election continues to be uncertified, preventing the election of either a president or a vice president.\n\nYesterday, previous Speaker John Nance Garner made one last desperate push to form a working coalition. With his own party conference unwilling to agree to commit their support to any presidential ticket however, his attempt failed just as all his previous ones had. It was now certain that, come the 20th, there would be no elected president to take office.\n\nPresident Smith has had two weeks to prepare his administration for this eventuality. His solution has been to ask his cabinet not to hand in their resignations (conventionally done upon the inauguration of a new president), and to instead stay in their current positions until a new president is elected. As a result, at 12:00 noon, January 20th, 1937, when Smith was to leave office, Cordell Hull, the incumbent Secretary of State, would become acting president, as per the Presidential Succession Act of 1886.\n\nToday that time has come.

 united_states_leadup_events.80.d: "Unless you were a farmer, 1925 was, for the most part, a fine year if you weren't a businessman. The collapse in trade with Britain which began the Great Depression did not initially lead to mass unemployment. It was only late in the year that the walloping of business trickled down to the workers, and mass layoffs began. The depression began in the boardroom, but ultimately, it could never have stayed there.\n\nThe relapse in the depression brought about by Black Monday has gone through a similar cycle. February saw the New York Stock Exchange once again plummet, but that did not have an immediate effect on production. Well accustomed to the “bust” part of the “boom and bust” cycle however, American businesses have not taken long to determine just how much meat they must cleave off of themselves in order to survive the expected conditions of the next quarter.\n\nThus, the process of mass layoffs has once again begun in earnest. Hundreds of thousands have been laid off without notice, left to fend for themselves in an increasingly hostile economy. A wave of strikes in response to imminent layoffs has done little to stop the bleeding, though it has further pushed radicalised unemployed workers towards the SPA and CIO. Left to rely on charity or mutual aid, instances of vengeful workers killing their former employers have become common news items, a dire sign of the times."

 united_states_leadup_events.81.d: "When people do not have jobs, they do not have money. When they do not have money, they do not spend it. Such is the vicious cycle of recession and depression. With the spending power of consumers plummeting, businesses become less and less able to turn a profit. A weak decade during the depression means that few smaller businesses have the reserves to maintain operations while in the red, and banks are understandably reluctant to loan money while massive lines of people wait outside their doors to withdraw their savings.\n\nBusiness failure has been an endemic part of the depression. Black Monday has once again brought it about in full force. Small businesses are the worst hit, with many closing their doors or even going bankrupt. In turn, their employees have been returned to the great and growing mass of the unemployed, further fueling the vicious cycle of today's economy.\n\nAs unemployment shockingly begins to return to the nadir of 1929, the depression has further fuelled political radicalisation. Unemployed workers flock to the SPA, as well as the unemployed unions of the IWW. Small business owners seeking lower labour costs to stay afloat have militarised into far-right paramilitaries, openly battling strikers in the streets. Farmers riot and smash up banks, who, desperate to keep their finances in order, have foreclosed on widows' farmsteads for a quick buck."

 united_states_leadup_events.82.d: "Under Al Smith, the American economy has had its ups and downs. The narrow avoidance of a total collapse of the U.S. banking sector in 1929 facilitated a few years of modest recovery, before the Creditanstalt collapse of 1931 sent the country back into recession. As Smith won re-election, a slow and arduous climb back to relative normality followed in his second term. For a moment, it appeared as if something resembling recovery might be at hand.\n\nThe American people knew better than to believe.\n\nThe dark days of 1929 have returned. Unemployment, inching towards a low of 13 percent at the beginning of the year, has surged back to 20 percent, and is now rising at a faster rate than at any previous point in the depression. Bankruptcies and business failures have skyrocketed, foreign trade has collapsed (again), and the progress of the Smith years has turned to dust in his last days in office.\n\nIn these days, hope has become the rarest commodity of all. Anger, however, is ubiquitous. Over a decade of failure has crushed confidence in America's political establishment: right and left, radical political forces have transformed politics from an elite and gentlemanly affair into the domain of the mob and mass movements. Paramilitaries roam the streets of major American cities, clashing over partisan allegiances. Decency dies an anonymous death.\n\nGeneral MacArthur has assured the president that the army is well equipped to handle any paramilitary insurrection.

In the age of the wagon, the space between November and March was necessary for the old administration to get its affairs in order, and for the new to prepare for office.\n\nIn the age of the Great Depression, such a gap was an anachronism. In the five months between President Lowden's defeat and President Smith's inauguration, Lowden was forced to act without any popular mandate. His trouble doing so almost led to a complete collapse in the U.S. banking system, narrowly averted by Smith in his first days.\n\nIn 1933 therefore, the 20th Amendment was adopted, shortening the period between election and inauguration to 2 and a half months. The contingent election of that year was viewed as an aberration, and a shortened “lame duck” period had long been viewed as a necessity."

####Harlan County War
 united_states_leadup_events.101.t: "Violence in Harlan County"
 united_states_leadup_events.101.d: "Since 1931, Harlan County, Kentucky, has been embroiled in a protracted period of labour unrest. In response to sharp wage cuts, the United Mine Workers attempted to organise the mineworkers of Harlan. As was typical for the declining UMW, they failed, under pressure from both county authorities and company goons. Their failure pushed the workers into the arms of the IWW, quickly expanding from its new strongholds in West Virginia and Colorado, which began to set up soup kitchens and other aid organisations to support striking miners. This too however failed, as the National Labor Relations Act had few enforcement mechanisms to protect the miners, leaving them defenceless against the \"gun thugs\" of Harlan Sheriff J.H. Blair.\n\nWith the passage of the National Labor Arbitration and Enforcement Act, hopes for a renewed organising effort in Harlan rose. In December, the IWW sent a letter to Sheriff Theodore R. Middleton, informing him of the union's intention to organise the miners of Harlan. Though the letter was returned unsent, a veritable army of IWW organisers has descended into Kentucky from West Virginia, and violence has once again flared in Harlan. Governor Chandler has dismissed the charges laid against Sheriff Middleton last year, empowering him to recruit a new slate of anti-union deputies. Already, an attempt by the unionists to organise in the New Harlan Hotel has ended in a siege of the building by men linked to Middleton, with several dead as a result.\n\nFew doubt that the violence in Harlan will continue if left unchecked, as several retaliation killings have already taken place."
 united_states_leadup_events.101.a: "Alarming."

 united_states_leadup_events.102.t: "Escalation of Violence in Harlan"
 united_states_leadup_events.102.d: "The deterioration of economic conditions nationwide in the aftermath of Black Monday has further intensified the IWW's recent unionisation drive in Harlan County. The result has been a further escalation of violence; murders and retaliatory killings are commonplace, and armed assaults on union meetings are increasingly being met with proportionate gunfire. With Harlan being in the state it is, demands for an intervention of some sort to prevent the county from turning into a total warzone have grown louder in Washington.\n\nOn the one hand, many blame Middleton's actions and the local authorities' hardline anti-union stance for the escalation of violence, and suggest a congressional committee look into matters in Harlan. On the other, anti-socialists have pointed the finger at the IWW, which has always been a militant and radical organisation, blaming them for the escalation into two-sided shooting. Ultimately, some sort of statement about the situation in Harlan must be made."

 united_states_leadup_events.103.d: "The Committee on Education and Labor, Subcommittee Investigating Violations of Free Speech and the Rights of Labor, better known as the La Follette Committee, was formed with the passage of the National Labor Arbitration and Enforcement Act to investigate methods utilised by employers to avoid collective bargaining with unions. Specifically targeting the use of industrial espionage, private police, strikebreaking services, and other tactics in industrial warfare, the committee has now turned its eyes towards the upsurge of violence in Harlan County, where many common anti-union practices take place.\n\nWith the support of the administration, an investigation into the conditions in Harlan has begun to take shape. Already the evidence is damning: union members have testified regarding violence against themselves and their families, and the escalating use of force coming from the strikebreakers. Progressives hope that the committee's findings will galvanise the push for change, and facilitate an end to the violence in Harlan, which claimed four lives this week."

 united_states_leadup_events.104.t: "Martial Law Declared in Harlan"
 united_states_leadup_events.104.d: "With violence in Harlan County reaching new heights, calls for intervention have reached a fever pitch. Continued killings and acts of violence on both sides have necessitated a declaration of martial law by the state government, spurred on by the administration's statement on the Harlan issue. The IWW has already vigorously attacked the declaration, denouncing Governor Chandler as a puppet of big business and a tyrant-enforcer of the bosses' law. Though we hope Governor Chandler will be even-handed with his enforcement of the law in Harlan, there already reports of asymmetric warfare between state forces and organised unionist militias. Nevertheless, our first priority is now to maintain order in Harlan, a goal which should be made much easier with the state's declaration.\n\nIn the meantime, violence in Harlan has claimed four lives this week."

 united_states_leadup_events.105.d.regular: "Concerning reports are coming in from the counties surrounding Harlan. State troopers encountered several armed bands carrying assorted shipments through the Cumberland River Valley. When ordered to halt for questioning, firefights have broken out, in some instances forcing the state troopers to retreat. When the bands have been forced to retreat, the state troopers have found crates of rifles, explosives, and other weapons in their abandoned cargo. The primary suspicion of both state, local, and federal forces has been that these are shipments intended for the IWW's organisers, a theory seemingly confirmed by the testimony of the few prisoners captured after these shootouts.\n\nThe arming of IWW organisers has raised the spectre of the Mingo County War of 1923, when an army of 10,000 miners rose up in southern West Virginia and rooted itself in Mingo and Longan counties. The aftermath of that conflict turned West Virginia into a socialist stronghold, so there is great fear in Kentucky surrounding the possibility of a similar uprising. Thus, a response has been demanded of either state or local forces. The local militias have demanded we deputise them in their fight against the IWW. Though they are strongly against the IWW, they are poorly disciplined, and are closer to the company than they are to the government. Alternatively, we could reinforce the area with more state troopers, including potential National Guard volunteers from Virginia. Both of these options would however escalate the situation. Our final course of action would be to simply reinforce the road patrols. This would do little to inflame things, however there are rumours that the IWW is also running weapons through the mountains, meaning such an action could have limited effectiveness."

 united_states_leadup_events.106.d: "Since the La Follette Committee began investigating the ongoing practices of employers and police in Harlan County, numerous cases of abuse and lawbreaking have been uncovered. Extrajudical killings, flagrant denial of the right to assemble, and the recruitment of illegal police and paramilitary forces on the behalf of the mine operators are only some of the abuses discovered by the committee.\n\nThough the committee's report is far from complete, as currently it stands to pin much of the blame for the situation in Harlan squarely on Sheriff Middleton, who has been found as flagrantly violating the law by recruiting disreputable anti-union elements to help suppress union organisers. This finding, and its scapegoating of Middleton, is admittedly politically convenient for us, as calling for his removal is an actionable recommendation that does not require systemic reform. Alternatively however, we could direct the committee to take a more borad approach, looking at the systemic problems in Harlan to reconstruct labour arbitration policy more broadly."
 united_states_leadup_events.106.a: "Middleton is ultimately responsible, make him a scapegoat."
 united_states_leadup_events.106.b: "This is a systemic issue. We must change our approach to labour conflicts."

 united_states_leadup_events.107.t: "Federal Forces in Harlan?"
 united_states_leadup_events.107.d: "Since the declaration of Martial Law in Harlan County, violence between unionists and their opponents has not subsided. Though open violence in the town of Harlan itself has been suppressed, incidents elsewhere in the Cumberland valley have continued, as have disapearances across the county. Unionists in particular have taken to effective banditry against the mine operators and their \"scabs\", striking from several hideouts in the hills and mountains.\n\nWith concerns that the violence could soon escalate even further, some figures in the Kentucky state government have suggested the federal government deploy soldiers to the area in order to maintain control. This is opposed by Governor Chandler, who insists the situation is under control, and will not spread beyond Harlan. However, some within the administration have suggested that the situation is more volatile that Chandler has indicated, and that the deployment of federal forces is the only way to guarantee order and enforce the Governor's declaration."
 united_states_leadup_events.107.a: "Governor Chandler can handle the situation."
 united_states_leadup_events.107.b: "A Federal intervention is needed."

 united_states_leadup_events.harlanintro.d: "For years, a low-intensity war has simmered in Harlan County. Fighting between IWW unionists and company and police forces took many lives before 1936, as the IWW tried and failed to maintain a union foothold in the county. This year however has seen the violence escalate dramatically, with over a hundred dead or missing in the first months of the year.\n\nThe intensified period of conflict has now come to a head. Having prepared for a final confrontation in Harlan over the past few months, the IWW assembled an army of over 12,000 men, larger than the force that marched on Blair Mountain in 1923. The army was divided between two groups: a larger force that was to march from West Virginia through the Cumberland valley, capturing settlements until it reached the town of Harlan itself, and a smaller force deeper in the county that would dislodge the Sheriff's forces from the southern half of Harlan town."

 united_states_leadup_events.108.d: "$united_states_leadup_events.harlanintro.d$\n\nThough things initially seemed to go to plan, a well prepared defence in the valley halfway to Harlan itself stopped the first \"Red\" force in its tracks. As an inexperienced militia, they were routed after taking significant casualties by the more professional anti-union militia, armed with machine guns and, concerningly, dubiously procured artillery pieces. After a brief pursuit where the militia dispersed the Reds with heavy fire, the Red formation crumbled, with many being captured and others being forced into the hills and mountains.\n\nThe northern advance having failed, the southern attack was doomed from the beginning. Though they managed to capture the union stronghold of the New Harlan Hotel, they were unable to reach the courthouse, let alone the National Guard Depot where they were meant to meet up with the northern force. Having boxed in the local force, the anti-union militia squeezed ever harder on the boxed in Reds before forcing them to surrender.\n\nIn the aftermath, a state of white terror has emerged in Harlan. Retreated Reds found in the hills have been hunted and killed by the militia, and known union sympathisers have been murdered in their homes. Extrajudicial anti-union violence now reigns in Harlan."

 united_states_leadup_events.109.d: "The suppression of the Red uprising in Harlan has quickly drawn a strong reaction from the northern public. After the defeat of the Reds, and subsequent extrajudicial violence against them and their associates in Harlan, numerous protests have broken out in large northern cities, such as New York, Chicago, and others. Supported by both the SPA and IWW, they have extolled the heroism and virtue of the \"Harlan Martyrs\", denounced the government's supposed complicity in the death of unionists, and called for the release of any Red militiamen taken prisoner in Harlan.\n\nIt did not take long for these protests to descend into rioting. One by one, northern cities have been captured by incidents of violence and looting. In response, we have put out a statement calling for calm, but this has had little effectiveness. Paramilitaries of all stripes, both left and right, have used the opportunity to expand their recruitment and influence, as nearly two dozen lie dead across the nation."

 united_states_leadup_events.110.d: "The recent white terror in Harlan County has brought about a swift response from the federal government. Soon after the defeat of the Red militia, martial law was declared in Harlan, and federal forces moved in to restore order.

Others in his ragtag anti-union militia have fled, avoiding capture and arrest. Though the Socialist Party still denounces the government as partially responsible for the incidents in Harlan, our actions have calmed the national mood somewhat: after several days, and numerous instances of rioting, protests surrounding the \"Harlan Martyrs\" have died down. Meanwhile, federal forces will remain in Harlan until order is fully restored, something that could take a very long time..."

Instead, the presence of paramilitaries, both left and right, has become the norm in many areas. The SPA and IWW meanwhile have ignored the violence of their own supporters to denounce government suppression, both of the rioters and the Red militia in Harlan (ignoring the fact that we were not the ones to suppress the militia)."

Though the left has been angered into violence by the suppression of the Harlan Reds, the right has seen Harlan as a vindication of both their fears and preferred responses towards socialism. Already, the anti-union militias which took part in the fighting in Harlan County have been lionised and held up as heroes, and violence against unions across the nation has seen a measurable spike.\n\nThe activities of growing far-right and anti-union militias have long caught the eye of the state, but their growth this year has been extremely concerning. Many take the view that the federal government has already been captured by socialists, so even in instances of Red uprising such as Harlan, they cannot be reliable allies of the government."

 united_states_leadup_events.113.d: "$united_states_leadup_events.harlanintro.d$\n\nInitially, the \"Red\" force achieved many key objectives, successfully capturing much of the Cumberland valley. Though the anti-union militia was more professional and relatively well armed, with machine guns and, concerningly, dubiously procured artillery pieces, it was forced to retreat due to the numerical advantage of the Reds, who advanced through the valley, capturing it to both sides of the entrance to Martin's fork, which leads to the town of Harlan itself. It was on the fork however that the first Red force was halted, due both to it having split in two in order to capture the western section of the valley, as well as due to the reinforcement of the anti-union militia.\n\nThat reinforcement however came at the expense of the anti-unionists in Harlan itself. Sheriff Middleton's men were pushed north of clover fork, with the southern Reds capturing both the courthouse and the hospital. In western Harlan, the anti-unionists formed a redoubt surrounding the National Guard Depot, locked in a stalemate with a larger but less well-armed Red force.\n\nHarlan county, now in a state of outright war, is locked in a stalemate. The Reds in the city cannot move north to reinforce their comrades, lest they lose the town itself. Similarly, Middleton's contingent cannot move north, lest the depot and its small arsenal fall into the hands of the Reds."

Federal forces entered the county much as the Reds had, through the Cumberland valley, this time both from the west and the east (much to the protestations of the West Virginia state government). No doubt West Virginia's warnings to the Reds aside, they were no match for an actual army. The remaining Reds in the valley itself were quickly dispatched, and when federal forces attacked the northern Red militia from behind, the stalemate in Harlan collapsed.\n\nThe Reds in Harlan town soon realised what was imminent, and retreated south of Clover fork to make their stand. The courthouse and hospital were reoccupied by Middleton's enthusiastic militia, which, eager for victory, crossed Clover fork, upon which they engaged in brutal and desperate fighting with the Reds. Upon the arrival of federal forces, many of the Reds attempted to surrender, but were ignored by Middleton's militia, until the army restored order and ended the fighting. Others retreated up into the hills, where they have subsequently been hunted, and in many instances killed, by Middleton's men.\n\nThe events in Harlan have overall been highly reminiscent of the Mingo County War of 1923. That conflict turned West Virginia into a stronghold of socialism. The outcome of Harlan remains to be seen."

Though many were captured (and in many instances murdered) after order was restored in Harlan, some have slipped through the grasp of the authorities, and escaped.\n\nThe primary refuge of these fugitives is of course the state of West Virginia. The red bastion has a long history with labour conflicts such as the one recently fought in Harlan, including most prominently the similar Mingo County War of 1923. With many government officials in the state being \"veterans\" of such conflicts, attempts by both Kentucky and the federal government to push for extradition of the escaped militiamen have been bluntly rebuffed. Concerningly, many have reportedly stockpiled their weapons in caches in the Appalachians, ready to return to them to arm themselves should the time to rise come yet again."

They include the following:\n - Federal protection of their right to organise\n - Company recognition of the IWW as their union\n - The arrest of Sheriff Middleton and other members of the anti-union militia\n - The disarming and disbanding of said militia and its component private forces\n\nThough these demands are generally regarded as reasonable, they would represent a concession to a violent insurgency. Many in the administration would therefore prefer for the military to immediately restore order in Harlan, and to suppress the Reds without negotiating."

 united_states_leadup_events.117.d: "The successful negotiation of a deal between the federal government and the Harlan unionists came as a shock to many of the factions involved in the conflict. The anti-union militia, for instance, was highly dismayed at the \"betrayal\" of the federal government, and initially refused to lay down arms. As such, direct federal intervention became necessary: the tone of the anti-unionists changed dramatically when faced with the incursion of the US Army into Harlan County, and soon they lay down their arms, just as the unionists did.\n\nIn the aftermath of the de facto occupation of Harlan County, most of the unionists' demands were fulfilled: both sides were disarmed, the right of the IWW to organise the county was reluctantly enforced at bayonet point, and Sheriff Middleton and his accomplices were arrested. Still, not all is good in Harlan however: small acts of terrorism and violence, such as tit-for-tat killing, remain commonplace, and rumours abound that both sides have merely hidden their weapons away in caches in the hills and mountains, rather than properly disarming."

Assorted, aimless protests in Socialist-dominated cities were initially commonplace, but without a coherent grievance or set of demands they quickly fizzled out without incident. The right meanwhile has been largely demoralised by the government's forceful application of the unionists' demands: no large growth in right-wing militia activity has been noted, and labour conflicts elsewhere in the nation have been relatively quiet in the past few weeks.\n\nIn spite of this however, analysts have been careful about suggesting that Harlan has brought about anything more than a brief reprieve. Political and labour violence is still at the all-time high it has been at since Black Monday, and certainly does not seem to be falling. Meanwhile, in Harlan itself, several weapons caches have been discovered by federal forces, obviously created by the militias in case they ever needed to re-arm themselves.\n\nAs the old myth goes, if you try to boil a living frog, you cannot increase the temperature too rapidly, lest it jump out of the pot. Instead, you must slowly increase the temperature, and it will die without protest. Perhaps by slowing the boil of Harlan, we have made ourselves into frogs."

The further through the valley they pushed, the more the anti-union resistance crumbled, leaving behind their equipment as they retreated, including machine guns and dubiously procured artillery pieces. Even as the Reds split to capture both Martin's fork and the western Cumberland, they faced little resistance on either front, holding both sides of the valley in Harlan County.\n\nWith their northern flank having been compromised, the defence of the town of Harlan itself was a lost cause from the beginning. Though Sheriff Middleton's forces were able to create a perimeter surrounding the National Guard Depot, the Reds quickly captured the rest of the town, including both the courthouse and the hospital. Once the northern contingent met up with the Reds in the town itself, the anti-union militia's resistance became untenable. Surrounded and outgunned, they surrendered.\n\nNow, the entirety of Harlan County is under union rule. Unlike in the Mingo County War, the union's militia has not dispersed: instead, it has become the primary law enforcement body in the county, while guarding the entrances to the county with its newly acquired heavy weapons. What comes next is uncertain, but it is clear that this is the most significant insurrection in the United States since the Civil War."

 united_states_leadup_events.120.t: "Proclaimation of the Harlan Commune"
 united_states_leadup_events.120.d: "The triumphant capture of Harlan County by the Red militia assembled by the IWW and its allies has created a revolutionary atmosphere in Harlan. The anti-union militia of the now-former Sheriff Middleton has almost entirely dissolved, save for a few ragged elements in the hills and mountains surrounding the populated areas of the county. The IWW meanwhile has rapidly expanded among the county's miners, spreading its literature and propaganda freely for the first time.\n\nThe fate of the county government meanwhile was left ambiguous for a few days. The Reds ruled the county under de facto martial law, as most of the local government had either fled or been imprisoned on charges of collaboration with Middleton. This situation was finally resolved today with a proclamation by \"the Workers and Farmers of Harlan County\" of the \"Harlan Commune\", the new revolutionary government in Harlan.\n\nThe new revolutionary commune is largely a partnership between the IWW and the Socialist Party. Though he is not a local, the dual-carding organiser Harry Simms has become the most influential man in the new government, answering both to John Reed and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. Based on the model of the French communes, the commune in Harlan has dispensed with the separation of powers. Instead, it has granted itself control both over the local courts and the \"Communal\" Militia, and has begun trying local officials of the old government, including Middleton.\n\nNeedless to say, the proclamation of this \"commune\" represents a major crisis. It is the first rebel government established on American soil since the Civil War, and some whisper that it may be but the first stage of a nationwide revolution."

Harlan's total fall to the communal militia came as a shock to even the most pessimistic of our observers. The declaration of the Harlan Commune has resulted in cries of red revolution across the country, as the nation stands on edge awaiting the outcome of the present crisis.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to send the army into Harlan and wipe out this so-called commune for good. Such an operation is bound to succeed, due to the enormous disparity between our two forces. However, the potential casualty list of such an action is likely to be extreme: not only is the communal militia entrenched in the passages into the county, it is also armed with the captured heavy weaponry it obtained from the defeated anti-unionists. It has also been reinforced by out-of-county volunteers, eager to fight for the \"Harlan Revolution\", increasing the risk of outrage in other areas of the country.\n\nWith a mind to avoiding a repeat of the killings and violence that ended the Mingo County War in 1923, some in the administration have entertained the suggestion of negotiating with the commune, to try and resolve things without bloodshed. Though legitimising the commune as a negotiating partner is obviously extremely undesirable, it may be the only option if we seek a non-violent solution to the crisis."

After retreating up Martin's fork, the militia made its last stand in Harlan town itself. Ultimately, after a brief siege and heavy casualties, the militia was defeated, and Harlan placed under martial law.\n\nThe response from union-sympathising elements has been predictable: already protesters are gathering to denounce the \"massacre\" of the Harlan communards, and the civil situation is expected to deteriorate in the coming days. Perhaps the more unexpected and concerning response came from within the army itself. Reports of several army units mutinying and refusing to fight the communards, including officers having to be disciplined, have raised alarms both in the army and in the administration. Though we have been assured these are only a few isolated incidents, even the possibility of the far-left capturing the sympathies of parts of the army is a cause for great concern."
 united_states_leadup_events.122.a: "It is done."

 united_states_leadup_events.123.t: "Mass Riots Across the North"
 united_states_leadup_events.123.d: "The destruction of the Harlan Commune has brought up a groundswell of rage across the north. In every northern, Socialist-dominated city, massive demonstrations have turned to city-wide rioting in the wake of the commune's demise. Violence against police, local \"reactionary\" politicians, and known enemies of the IWW and Socialist Party has become commonplace, as, just weeks after the rioting surrounding May Day, \"Bloody Harlan\" has turned into Bloody America.\n\nThe Socialist Party has been quick to skewer the government for any actions it takes in quelling the violence. After extolling the \"Harlan Martyrs\" as heroes of the coming revolution, they denounce police intervention and call for the formation of communes throughout the United States. All told, the violence has left dozens dead, and millions of dollars in property damage for us to repair."
 united_states_leadup_events.123.a: "We're never going to have peace at this rate."

 united_states_leadup_events.124.t: "The Demands of the Commune"
 united_states_leadup_events.124.d: "The decision to negotiate with the Harlan Commune has not been an easy one. Should they fail, we open ourselves to accusations of having been too soft on the syndicalists. Should we succeed, that will apply even more so. Regardless, our envoy was received by the commune without incident, and has reported the situation on the ground, describing the townsfolk as generally enthusiastic about the project, while having reservations about many of the plans of the commune's leaders, as well as the immediate army threat bearing down on them all.\n\nIn any case, our envoy's talks with the leadership was productive, and he received a clear list of demands:\n - The abolition of the county government and its replacement with that of the commune\n - The dissolution of Harlan's police, as well as any associated private militias, and their replacement with the communal militia\n - The recognition of the commune's legal judgements, including the prosecutions of Sheriff Middleton and other local officials\n\nTo many, these demands are clear non-starters. The demand that the rebel militia take over as law enforcement is unpalatable to the extreme to many administration officials. As such, there are demands that we simply tell the commune to go back to the drawing board and put forward more reasonable demands.\n\nAlternatively, some have suggested revising the conditions ourselves, and trying to accomplish as many as reasonably possible. The militia demand, for instance, could perhaps be accommodated if it were to be substantially downsized, stripped of its heavy weapons, and limited only to local volunteers. Additionally, though we cannot undermine the rule of law by granting it solely to the commune, we can promise to prosecute Middleton and others in federal court, so they will not escape justice.\n\nUltimately, we have been given the initiative in negotiations, and have the responsibility to reply to their demands."
 united_states_leadup_events.124.a: "They have to be more reasonable."
 united_states_leadup_events.124.b: "Put forward our revised list of concessions."

 united_states_leadup_events.125.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
 united_states_leadup_events.125.d: "Perhaps inevitably, the gap between the positions of the Harlan Commune and the federal government has proven too far to bridge. The commune made clear that its demands were final, and that it would not accept a deal where it was forced to cede power back to the county government. With negotiations at an impasse, the window for a peaceful settlement to the Harlan crisis closed.\n\nNow, both sides mobilise for a final armed confrontation. Makeshift defences now line parts of the county, as the communal militia digs in to try and hold off the army for as long as possible. The army meanwhile moves into position on both the east and west ends of Harlan County, preparing to march in and end the ill-begotten experiment in communal government that Harlan has become."
 united_states_leadup_events.125.a: "It was inevitable."

 united_states_leadup_events.126.t: "The Commune Comes to an Agreement"
 united_states_leadup_events.126.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the Harlan Commune has agreed to our revision of their initial list of demands. Though many within the administration viewed a deal as an impossibility, the communal government has proven less intransigent than initially expected. As part of the arrangement, certain figures in Harlan's pre-communal government have been handed over to federal authorities, and the Harlan communal militia has handed over all of its artillery and all but two of its machine guns, as well as expelling all of its members from outside of Harlan County.\n\nThough these concessions both leave a local independent judiciary and leave the communal militia as a force no more powerful than most local police forces, it still means that the commune has now successfully overthrown the legitimate government of an American municipality. Already, polarised reactions from both the left and the right have emerged, as the Socialists and IWW celebrate the commune's \"heroic triumph\" while the right denounces a \"red takeover\" of Harlan."
 united_states_leadup_events.126.a: "Was it worth it?"

 united_states_leadup_events.127.t: "Socialists Celebrate \"Harlan Revolution\""
 united_states_leadup_events.127.d: "The Socialist reaction to the agreement with the Harlan Commune was swift and dramatic. Spontaneous celebrations of the commune's survival and \"heroic victory\" broke out in most large northern cities soon after the agreement was announced. John Reed spoke to a crowd of a hundred thousand in Chicago, announcing that Harlan had \"led the way for all American workers\" towards a workers' government. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn was similarly enthusiastic, announcing that the IWW would, on a case-by-case basis, form alliances with the SPA in any future communal governments.\n\nSuch opportunities may be coming sooner than anticipated. In West Virginia, a bill recommending and enabling the replacement of county governments with communal ones has already passed the lower house, supported by Governor Stone. In Michigan meanwhile, Governor Al Renner, associated with the most radical elements of the Socialist Party, has similarly called for the formation of a commune in Detroit, where his party is now the dominant political force.\n\nThis so-called \"commune movement\" has spread like wildfire in the aftermath of the end of the Harlan crisis. With its outrageous demands for class government, it appears the resolution of the Harlan issue has done little to alleviate tensions across the country."

 united_states_leadup_events.128.t: "Unions Stockpile Weapons"
 united_states_leadup_events.128.d: "The effective victory of the Harlan communal militia has had yet more knock-on effects. Since the end of the Harlan crisis, reports of unions collecting and stockpiling increasingly heavy armaments have reached the administration. With Harlan's vindication of the power of physical force, and its apparent demonstration that there is an actual path to victory for armed organised labour and physical force unionism, many other unions, including those belonging to the CIO rather than the IWW, have begun to stockpile weapons.\n\nWhile this is obviously not a new phenomenon, the scale and severity of it is. Not only has it increased fears of a general labour uprising, it has also resulted in more immediate violence, as incidents by armed unionists against union enemies have increased dramatically over the past few weeks. With several dead, Harlan seems more and more to be only the beginning of our trouble with labour armies."

 united_states_leadup_events.129.t: "Anti-Union Paramilitaries Mobilise"
 united_states_leadup_events.129.d: "The increasing militarisation of unions has inevitably brought about a harsh response from those opposed to organised labour. Anti-union businessmen and employers, as well as other right-wing elements, have lost faith in the government's ability and willingness to protect them and their property from revolutionary militias. The agreement with the Harlan Commune has revealed to them that the administration is either unable or unwilling to stand with them against union radicals.\n\nAs such, they have taken matters into their own hands. Already, employers' militias have taken to the streets to contest the dominance of the Red Guards, the Socialist Vanguard, and the IWW's assorted paramilitary squads. Now however recruitment and expansion for these groups has exploded, with many employers viewing them, even with their often undisciplined and violent tactics, as the only groups capable of protecting their property.\n\nOne supporter of these groups has emerged in the Senate: never one to miss a chance to skewer President Smith, Huey Long has voiced support for these paramilitaries' efforts to protect private property against socialists and radicals."

#### Crisis
#Olson
 united_states_crisis_events.2.t: "Executive Order 7029"
 united_states_crisis_events.2.d: "The first priority of the new administration is to alleviate the state of chronic unemployment in the United States. Exasperated by Black Monday, unemployment has continually risen for the past year, up from Smith's low of 15% now to nearly 25%, approaching the dark nadir of the later Lowden years.\n\nTo this effect, President Olson has promulgated Executive Order 7029. The order provides for the emergency reappropriation of funds from certain federal departments, particularly the military, towards public works and employment programs. Though this unilateral exercise of executive power is controversial, it is hoped that quick relief will help stop the economic bleeding of the past year."
 united_states_crisis_events.2.a: "Let's hope it's enough."

 united_states_crisis_events.3.t: "Military Grumbles Over Reappropriations"
 united_states_crisis_events.3.d: "The President's unilateral reappropriation of federal funds away from the military has been controversial in many circles. Though the outcry from conservatives has been the most prominent, also notable has been the response of the military itself, which has, privately but strenuously, protested the reallocation of its funds towards other projects.\n\nChief of Staff Douglas MacArthur in particular has been vocal to administration officials about his disapproval of the President's scheme. In a strongly worded letter to President Olson, he outlined both the constitutional dubiousness of the measure, as well as the need to maintain the separation between military and civilian affairs. Though MacArthur has little recourse but to comply with our orders, it is perhaps an inauspicious beginning for the administration's relationship with the armed forces."
 united_states_crisis_events.3.a: "We should keep an eye on him."

 united_states_crisis_events.4.t: "Congress Protests Executive Fiat"
 united_states_crisis_events.4.d: "Our recent executive order to reappropriate federal funds towards public works projects has found itself in hot water in Congress. The conservative bloc is in an uproar about the president's \"unconstitutional\" use of executive authority, arguing that the President has no right to appropriate funds in such a matter without the consent of Congress\n\nThough the conservatives do not command a majority in Congress, they are not the only ones with apprehensions regarding EO 7029. Numerous progressives and liberals have also criticised the administration, either in private or in public, for bypassing Congress to push public works forward.\n\nThough we are obviously committed to the program, Farmer-Labor is not even close to a majority in Congress, and when taking into account the intransigence of the Socialists, we must rely upon Democratic and Republican progressives. Ultimately, our decision regarding how to move the next part of our agenda must take this into account, one way or another."
 united_states_crisis_events.4.a: "Ignore them."
 united_states_crisis_events.4.b: "Placate them by putting forward a bill."

 united_states_crisis_events.5.t: "Suit Launched Against Our Administration"
 united_states_crisis_events.5.d: "Our snubbing of Congress has seemingly resulted in quick blowback. Today, numerous conservatives, moderates, and even some progressives have joined a lawsuit arguing that Executive Order 7029 is unconstitutional, and that the president cannot appropriate funds in such a manner without the consent of Congress.\n\nThough the opposition of conservatives was expected, more concerning is the attachment of names such as those of Senators William Borah and Burton K. Wheeler to the suit. This open sleight against the administration by non-Farmer-Labor progressives is an indication of a growing rift on the centre-left regarding the use of government powers by the administration. Having chosen our course on the matter, the only thing left to do is see this fight to its conclusion."
 united_states_crisis_events.5.a: "They show their true colours."

 united_states_crisis_events.6.t: "Funding Legislation Stalls"
 united_states_crisis_events.6.d: "In response to congressional condemnation of Executive Order 7029, we have chosen to throw Congress a bone. Our allies in both the House and Senate have put forward new bills both legitimising the reappropriation of funds featured in EO 7029, as well as authorising funding for further public works projects.\n\nIntended to ameliorate concerns that we are overstepping the constitutional bounds of the presidency, the bills have instead not quite had their intended effect: their introduction, while placating the progressives in our congressional coalition, has been seen as an admission of guilt by conservatives. Many conservative members of congress have now attached themselves to a suit declaring EO 7029 unconstitutional, a suit which now appears to be headed straight to the conservative-leaning Supreme Court."
 united_states_crisis_events.6.a: "We did what we could."

 united_states_crisis_events.7.t: "Supreme Court Rules Against Us"
 united_states_crisis_events.7.d: "The administration has suffered a significant setback. The Supreme Court today has ruled that Executive Order 7029 is an unconstitutional exercise of presidential power, and that the president does not have the ability to reappropriate funds in such a manner. Though two members of the court's progressive wing dissented, most sided with the majority against the administration.\n\nThis defeat has substantial implications for the future of our administration. Being forced to push our agenda through Congress will slow our recovery efforts substantially, and lose us precious time in dealing with growling labour and farm unrest. As such, some members of the administration have suggested an alternative approach: ignoring the court.\n\nAn option with some precedent, we could simply declare that the present national state of economic emergency warrants the bypassing of the court's order. This will have significant ramifications however: if Congress was souring on us before, they will have even more to say now."

 united_states_crisis_events.8.d: "Shocking news has come in today of an act of political violence in the heart of Washington itself. Associate Justice James R. McReynolds, a vociferous conservative voice on the Supreme Court, was murdered outside his apartment while leaving for the Supreme Court building this morning.\n\nMcReynolds, a key vote against the administration in the recent Supreme Court case regarding Executive Order 7029, was no friend of the administration. His assassination however seems set to spell headaches for us, as the assassin was an unemployed man who was a known supporter of the Farmer-Labor Party. Though no link between him and the administration itself exists, the assassination reflects poorly on the president, and whispers of conspiracy abound on the right.\n\nMcReynolds' assassination was not the first major act of political violence this year, and is unlikely to be the last. Political violence has continually grown over the past decade, both on the left and the right, with McReynolds being merely the highest profile casualty yet."

 united_states_crisis_events.9.t: "The Socialists Storm Out"
 united_states_crisis_events.9.d: "Our acquiescence to the ruling of the Supreme Court has resulted in some unexpected blowback. Smelling blood within the big-tent Farmer-Labor united front, Socialist Party Chairman John Reed has denounced President Olson's concession to the \"bourgeois obstructionists\" on the Supreme Court. Reed, on many occasions a tacit critic of the Socialists' participation in Farmer-Labor, has now called for an emergency referendum within the party, where the party's relationship with Farmer-Labor moving forward will be decided.\n\nThe exodus of the Socialists will have decisive ramifications for our coalition. Where once they were unreliable partners in Congress, now they are likely to be steadfastly opposed to our administration from an ultra-left standpoint. As such, our position becomes even more tenuous, as the domestic political situation further polarises."
 united_states_crisis_events.9.a: "We don't need them anyways."

 united_states_crisis_events.10.t: "Impeachment Proceedings Begin"
 united_states_crisis_events.10.d: "Though the administration's decision to flagrantly violate the ruling of the Supreme Court may have won it praise from the left, it has only deepened the divide between the president and Congress. Today, the ongoing rift between the executive and the legislature has come to a head, with the introduction of articles of impeachment by Congressman Dewey Jackson Short. Short charges President Olson with abuse of power, firmly listing the refusal to comply with the court's ruling as an example of the president overstepping his bounds.\n\nAs relations with even the progressives in Congress have dramatically deteriorated over the past weeks, we cannot guarantee that these proceedings will not garner enough votes to pass the House. Though impeachment will be a drawn out process, House Speaker John Nance Garner has already voiced his openness towards putting it forward for a House vote."

 united_states_crisis_events.11.t: "Olson Falls Into a Coma"
 united_states_crisis_events.11.d: "For several years now, President Olson has known that his time on Earth is limited. Always plagued with pain and health issues, Olson was finally diagnosed with stomach cancer, a fact which was carefully hidden from the public both during his time in the Senate and in the White House. Though he was in immense pain in the later stages of his career, Olson powered on through, acting as a workaholic both on the campaign trail and in office.\n\nOlson's health has finally caught up to him however. As his cancer has taken a turn for the worse, Olson has been hospitalized, and has now fallen into a coma, from which his doctors doubt he will ever wake.\n\nThe sudden absence of the president due to previously unknown health issues has thrown the government into chaos: with no legal mechanism to replace a living but incapacitated president, the executive has been rendered headless for the time being. Meanwhile, speculation as to potential conspiracies have spread like wildfire, with many socialists speculating that the president has been poisoned by the capitalists."
 united_states_crisis_events.11.a: "Oh god."

 united_states_crisis_events.12.t: "Quentin Roosevelt Assumes Acting Presidency"
 united_states_crisis_events.12.d: "Olson's rapid and unforeseen withdrawal from public life has drawn the functions of the highest levels of the executive branch to a halt. With the White House in chaos, communications with Congress have totally broken down, and public relations have turned to radio silence. With the power vacuum in Washington impeding the normal functions of government, many have called upon Vice President Roosevelt to assume the presidency in an acting capacity.\n\nToday, Roosevelt has answered those calls. With the support of Olson's relatively moderate cabinet, Roosevelt has declared that he is assuming the functions and duties of the presidency, while clarifying that Olson remains president on a formal basis for the time being.\n\nThough the establishment is relieved that there is now someone in charge again in Washington, others are dismayed at Roosevelt's assumption of power. Both the Socialists and Huey Long have denounced the \"Business-Republican coup\" which has supposedly taken place, and many supporters of Olson in Farmer-Labor are receptive to such rhetoric, angered by the installation of a Republican acting president after Olson's hard-fought victory in January."
 united_states_crisis_events.12.a: "Let's get back to business."

 united_states_crisis_events.13.t: "Farmer-Labor Collapses"
 united_states_crisis_events.13.d: "The fragile united front of the Farmer-Labor Party has always been held together by a thread. The marriage between Progressives and Socialists mediated by the CIO was predicated on diametrically opposed assumptions and goals held by both sides. The Progressives sought the Socialists' votes and organising for their own campaigns, while the Socialists wanted to capture Farmer-Labor much as the Syndicalist Party of Great Britain captured the Labour Party.\n\nWith both sides only partnered in an alliance of convenience, the eventual end of Socialist affiliation was inevitable. Today, the Socialist Party's Executive Committee has formally and unilaterally severed ties with Farmer-Labor. Specifically citing Olson's cabinet's acquiescence to the ascension of Quentin Roosevelt to the acting presidency, the Socialists have denounced Farmer-Labor as a \"petty-bourgeois reformist organisation\".\n\nWorse still, when asked to comment on the matter, CIO President Sidney Hillman stated that his organisation would \"reconsider\" its relationship with Farmer-Labor. The potential exit of the CIO would likely deal a death blow to the party, which has a symbiotic relationship with the union and collects a large affiliation fee from it.\n\nWith this exodus of the far-left from the party, the future of Farmer-Labor is in serious jeopardy."
 united_states_crisis_events.13.a: "The centre cannot hold..."

 united_states_crisis_events.14.t: "Farmer-Laborites Defect to the SPA"
 united_states_crisis_events.14.d: "The recent collapse of the Farmer-Labor Party has left several political forces scrambling to pick up the pieces. As the national situation grows more inflamed and radical, both the Longists and the Socialist Party have made inroads into the former support base of the now hollowed-out party.\n\nIt has been the latter that has had the most success in doing so however. The disappointment of the Olson administration combined with sour feelings over the ascension of Roosevelt has driven many Farmer-Laborites into the arms of the party of Debs and Reed. Additionally, the Socialists have scored a recent coup with the defection of the CIO, which has ended its affiliation with Farmer-Labor and entered into a tripartite agreement with the IWW and the SPA. Overall, it seems that history has vindicated the idea originally posited by the Socialists when they entered Farmer-Labor: that progressives would become labourists, and labourists would become socialists."
 united_states_crisis_events.14.a: "They have fallen far from grace."

 united_states_crisis_events.15.t: "Socialist Party Walks Out of Congress"
 united_states_crisis_events.15.d: "The recent chaos in the Farmer-Labor Party has seen attention on the left refocused on the Socialist Party, which has escaped mostly unscathed from the debacles surrounding the (seemingly brief) Olson presidency. With the national situation growing ever more radical and inflamed, the Socialists have denounced recent police actions against strikers, as well as Roosevelt's supposed unilateral usurpation of power.\n\nToday, the Socialists have taken a radical new step. Denouncing \"bourgeois parliamentarianism\" as having served its purpose for the party, the Socialists have walked out of Congress, pulling with them several Farmer-Labor representatives. Intending to crater the legitimacy of the government through abstention, the Socialists have received only a muted response from the establishment parties so far. However, it is clear that this action, as well as the formation of a tripartite alliance with the CIO and IWW, indicates a more confrontational approach from the Socialists in the near future."
 united_states_crisis_events.15.a: "Concerning."

 united_states_crisis_events.16.t: "Executive Order 7011"
 united_states_crisis_events.16.d: "One of the key points of the first Farmer-Labor platform was the appropriation of idle and abandoned factories and works to facilitate employment by the government and alleviate chronic unemployment. A key demand of the Socialists in exchange for their participation, it was a key plank in both of Olson's presidential campaigns, in both 1932 and 1936.\n\nNow, with Olson in office, it is time to fulfil that promise. A question of scope arises however: how broad should the power to expropriate be, and what condition must a factory be in in order to be considered abandoned. Though a stricter definition may lessen the impact of this program, it would likely help it survive an immediate court challenge, a key consideration in any case."
 united_states_crisis_events.16.a: "Outline specific conditions for abandonment."

 united_states_crisis_events.17.t: "GM Sues Michigan"
 united_states_crisis_events.17.d: "It has not taken long for Executive Order 7011 to ruffle many feathers. As the order enables state governments to undertake expropriations of idle properties, it has been used by the radical Socialist administration in Michigan to legitimize the seizure of General Motors property undertaken by workers late last year.\n\nWith GM obviously disinclined to take this lying down, they have sued both the federal government and the government of Michigan over the infringement of their property rights. They are seeking to have EO 7011 ruled unconstitutional, and their factories returned to them with compensation. Governor Al Renner however has stated that even if the courts rule in GM's favour, his administration will not comply with court orders."
 united_states_crisis_events.17.a: "Looks like a showdown."

 united_states_crisis_events.18.t: "GM Suit Caught Up in Courts"
 united_states_crisis_events.18.d: "The suit brought by General Motors has, thanks to the efforts of Socialist Party lawyers in Michigan, faced numerous initial hurdles that have brought its progress to a standstill. Using procedural tactics, as well as the ongoing restructuring of the Michigan court system being undertaken by the new Socialist majority, GM's suit has been obstructed and halted in its tracks.\n\nThough GM is attempting to escalate its federal suit, it too is only slowly making its way through the federal court system. Our efforts at protecting EO 7011 have thus far been successful, a fact which has further emboldened Socialist governors in the midwest to conduct factory seizures."
 united_states_crisis_events.18.a: "Excellent."

 united_states_crisis_events.19.d: "General Motors' suit against the federal government has quickly found its way through the federal court system. The dubious legality of EO 7011, specifically in its broadness and lack of protection for private property rights, has allowed ample openings for GM lawyers to hack away at it in federal court.\n\nThis has culminated today in a ruling by the Supreme Court against the administration. Admonishing the administration for its flagrant disregard for property rights, the court has ordered Michigan to return GM's factories, and rendered EO 7011 a dead letter.\n\nIn Michigan, Governor Renner is not taking the court order lying down. With his continued intransigence, we have two options: either we abide by the court's decision, damaging our relationship with the Socialists, or we leave GM out to dry and let Michigan have their way."

Having been faced with the choice between either waiting out Michigan's growing budget deficit (albeit one alleviated by worker management of the plants), or a direct confrontation, they have chosen the latter.\n\nReports have reached Washington of an agreement between GM and the local Minutemen paramilitaries in Detroit. It appears the Minutemen have been hired as mercenaries of sorts to take the plants back, with the prerogative to seize them by force if need be. Already, Governor Renner has mobilised the National Guard to deal with this \"reactionary menace\", but concerns of an imminent fight in Detroit abound."

Expecting only a motley resistance, the Minutemen attempted to secure the surrender of plant workers in the targets designated by General Motors. When the workers fired back in response, fighting simultaneously broke out across the city, as Minutemen and workers' militias battled both near the factories and in the streets.\n\nA day of drawn out fighting ensued. In certain areas, brutal house-to-house combat saw enormous property damage, as the governor mobilised the National Guard and ordered them to suppress the \"reactionary uprising\". As the National Guard brought heavier weaponry into the city, the Minutemen soon found their manpower disadvantage supplemented by a firepower one. One by one, Minutemen brigades retreated, with many fleeing to the right-wing bastion of Dearborn.\n\nAs the sun set, the new reality in Detroit set in. The workers now ruled the city."

Together, they have initiated a program of total syndicalisation of heavy industry, and have seized the property of reputed reactionary politicians and businessmen.\n\nThe political situation in the city having suddenly radicalised from even its previous Socialist-dominated state, the new state of affairs has been formalised with the formation of the Detroit Commune. A new government based on the model of the French communes has been installed with the backing of the state government under the Renner Administration, now totally bereft of non-socialist influence.\n\nAs a result of the crisis, we have been forced to declare martial law in the state.

Contrary to our decision to comply with the court's verdict, Michigan has continued to occupy General Motors property, and has refused to vacate the factories which it has essentially turned into worker-managed cooperatives.\n\nWith GM and Michigan seemingly irreconcilably opposed on this issue, it seems federal intervention to return the factories will be needed to resolve the crisis. Though this will undoubtedly be extremely unpopular with the Socialist Party, it is the only way we can comply with our promise to uphold the Supreme Court's ruling."

With them and the National Guard placed in key points in the city, they quickly seized important infrastructure, including the General Motors factories not yet occupied by the workers. With the element of surprise on their side, they neutralised the potential threat of the local Minutemen, arresting much of their leadership and forcing those on the outskirts of the city centre to retreat to the suburbs after brief skirmishes, and then beyond.\n\nAfter the relatively clean coup, Governor Renner announced the formation of the Detroit Commune, A new government based on the model of the French communes. The new commune, made up of the Socialist Party, the CIO, and the IWW, has announced its intention to further nationalise GM factories, and drive reactionary forces out of the city.\n\nThose reactionaries have not stood idly by however.

Governor Renner, now running an administration bereft of \"reactionary\" influence, has declared that reactionaries and capitalists must be rooted out of Michigan in order for the workers to maintain control. Our declaration of martial law in the state has had little effect, as a local civil war brews.\n\nThe first offensive action of such a civil war has just taken place. With the aid of the National Guard (itself a concerning sign) the workers' militias and Red Guards marched on Dearborn, easily capturing the city from disorganised and disoriented Minutemen. Once there, they initiated several rounds of arrests, including of Congressman Clare Hoffman and former assistant state Attorney-General Orville L. Hubbard. The decisive action has been celebrated by the supporters of the \"Michigan Revolution\", mainly socialists, but it has caused panic among conservatives across the nation, as cries of \"red terror\" abound."
 united_states_crisis_events.25.a: "This is all out of control."

 united_states_crisis_events.26.t: "Setting Up a Special Commission"
 united_states_crisis_events.26.d: "As the first priority of our administration, we have elected to establish the \"Presidential Commission on Labor and Civil Rights\" to finally enforce the progressive but weak laws passed under President Smith. This special commission will serve as a fact-finding agency on our behalf, intended to hammer out actionable and decisive recommendations which we can put into effect through legislation.\n\nThough the commission will have a broad prerogative, it is important that we make clear what it is to prioritise in the first months of Olson's presidency. On the one hand, our allies in organised labour are pushing for us to further the work of the La Follette Committee, so as to investigate the duplicitous actions of anti-union agencies. On the other hand, perhaps the more immediate concern is the enforcement of the 1935 anti-lynching law, which has faced roadblocks in its application in the south despite efforts at federal enforcement. Ultimately, we must choose how we spend our limited focus carefully."
 united_states_crisis_events.26.a: "Focus on defending labour rights."
 united_states_crisis_events.26.b: "Hit them where it hurts, establish an anti-lynching commission."

 united_states_crisis_events.27.t: "Shootout in Toledo"
 united_states_crisis_events.27.d: "Unfortunately, it appears our attempts to further enforce the 1935 National Labor Arbitration and Enforcement Act have had some unintended consequences. Some misunderstandings surrounding the prerogatives of federal arbitrators in a Toledo labour dispute have resulted in an escalation of violence on both sides. What has ensued is a shootout where our people were forced to retreat, as workers and local Minutemen hired as goons by the company bosses fired at one another.\n\nWith three workers and two Minutemen dead, tensions in northern Ohio have inflamed dramatically. Already, Governor Sharts, a Socialist reliant on Farmer-Labor support, has declared that the Minutemen involved will be captured and brought to justice, without making any effort to coordinate a response with our administration."
 united_states_crisis_events.27.a: "Damnit."

 united_states_crisis_events.28.t: "Ohio State Government Moves To Arrest Minutemen"
 united_states_crisis_events.28.d: "Governor Sharts' declaration calling for the arrest of the Minutemen involved in the recent shooting in Toledo has resulted in a state-wide manhunt being launched to find and detain them. After a few days on the run, a group of National Guardsmen tracked the fugitives to a location near the Ohio-Indiana border. Seeing clearly that the fugitives were attempting to escape the state for Indiana, the guardsmen resolved to capture them then and there.\n\nThough the Minutemen were outnumbered, they were able to spot the National Guardsmen as they approached. Soon after, the Minutemen, more well armed than the guardsmen anticipated, opened fire. Only now has the firefight been resolved, as..."

 united_states_crisis_events.29.t: "Ohio Minutemen Arrested En Masse"
 united_states_crisis_events.29.d: "With the successful capture of the Toledo Minutemen, an alleged conspiracy by the Minutemen in Ohio to take the state capitol and overthrow the duly elected government has been discovered. This plan, allegedly financed by big business and various industrial interests, was to involve the arrest and even murder of high ranking Socialist and Farmer-Labor politicians, including Governor Joseph Sharts, Attorney-General John Marshall, as well as of prominent union leaders in the state.\n\nIn response, the governor has declared a general state of emergency, ordering the arrest of dozens of prominent Minutemen and announcing a curfew. In several instances, Socialist Vanguards and Red Guards have been deputised in the fight to root out the Minutemen, which has turned into a state-wide campaign."
 united_states_crisis_events.29.a: "Better them than us I suppose..."

 united_states_crisis_events.30.t: "Workers' Militias Deputised in Ohio"
 united_states_crisis_events.30.d: "With the bungling of the arrest of the Toledo Minutemen, a state of panic among leftists in Ohio has seen calls for drastic measures amplified and reach the political mainstream. This has been compounded by recent allegations of a Minutemen plot to occupy the state capitol and overthrow Ohio's Farmer-Labor and Socialist government, and to arrest and kill key socialist leaders.\n\nIn response, Governor Sharts has authorised the emergency deputization of several workers' militias forming in northern Ohio. In a recent statement, the governor has proclaimed the need for the workers' to defend themselves from \"reactionary insurgency\", and that only with an expanded popular-based policing force will Ohioans be safe."
 united_states_crisis_events.30.a: "What are we? Communards?"

 united_states_crisis_events.31.t: "Workers' Militias Occupy Ohio State Capitol"
 united_states_crisis_events.31.d: "With the recent coup scare in Ohio, political violence in the state has escalated substantially. Open battles between the Minutemen and their opponents have become commonplace, as local police become more and more incapable of stopping the tide of violence.\n\nIn response to the recent coup scare, at the behest of Socialist Party Attorney-General John Marshall, groups of deputized workers' militias have mobilised in the state capital of Columbus, so as to \"defend\" the state government from \"reactionary insurgency\". Though Columbus has fared relatively well through the depression due to its diversified economy, it has not been spared the upsurge in worker militancy that has spread across the north in the wake of Black Monday.\n\nThe actions of the workers' militias have culminated today in their occupation of the state capitol. Sanctioned by the administration, as well as the Socialist contingent in the state legislature, they have declared their intention to \"protect\" the government from the reactionary threat. This has obviously been denounced as a Socialist coup by non-Farmer-Laborites in the state government, and it remains to be seen how much blowback Marshall will face."
 united_states_crisis_events.31.a: "Concerning."

 united_states_crisis_events.32.t: "Governor Sharts Granted Emergency Powers"
 united_states_crisis_events.32.d: "In an emergency session of the Ohio state legislature, both houses have voted to grant Governor Sharts emergency powers to combat \"Minutemen terrorists\", and ensure the security of the government of Ohio. Taken under the watch of the workers' militias occupying the state capitol, the vote was boycotted by all non-Farmer-Labor or Socialist members, who denounced the \"naked intimidation\" of the Governor's actions.\n\nFarmer-Labor itself was divided, with many members being swayed to the Socialists' side due to the rapidly escalating national situation, as well as the recent coup scare in Ohio itself. Though the governor, a relative moderate in his party, was reluctant to seize power so blatently, Attorney-General John Marshall has been noted as applying a leftward pressure within the administration, with many regarding him as the power behind the throne. In any case, this represents a key victory for the radicals, as, in effect, the Socialists have taken full control of the security of the state."
 united_states_crisis_events.32.a: "They're falling further to radicalism."

 united_states_crisis_events.33.t: "National Guard Placed Under Militia Command"
 united_states_crisis_events.33.d: "With the recent explosive growth of workers' militias in Ohio, the socialist and union forces have been emboldened by the decision of Governor Sharts to deputise them in the fight against the Minutemen. The recent occupation of the state capitol in particular has resulted in a further expansion of the militias, as well as of the Red Guards associated with the SPA.\n\nWith the increasing role of the militias becoming clearer and clearer, Governor Sharts and Attorney-General Marshall have taken the dramatic step of creating a unified militia command. Further still, they have placed the Ohio National Guard under that command structure, essentially subordinating it to the workers' militias. This has been loudly denounced by non-socialist politicians both in and out of the state legislature, as well as the army, which is meant to share command over the guard with the state. However, as the local army corps area has been hesitant to intervene, and with the Socialists taking de facto control over the state's policing and paramilitary forces, these denunciations have seemingly had little impact."

 united_states_crisis_events.34.d: "Several days ago, two Socialist Party organisers sent to organise sharecroppers in North Carolina, as well as two local sharecroppers, were shot and killed by unknown assailants, and hastily dumped in a river east of Charlotte. Their bodies were only just now discovered, by employees of the Presidential Commission on Labor and Civil Rights, sent to investigate reports of a lynching in the area.\n\nThe discovery of these four victims has generated national headlines, as both civil rights groups and the Socialist Party have demanded justice. As an intersection of the commission's areas of responsibility, it is both an important and an opportune case for us to pursue, as federal investigators have been sent to the area to uncover any clues as to the identity of the assailants."
 united_states_crisis_events.34.a: "We must find them."

 united_states_crisis_events.35.t: "Arresting the Perpetrators"
 united_states_crisis_events.35.d: "As luck would have it, the perpetrators of the murders in North Carolina worked rather sloppily. Leaving abundant evidence for federal investigators, they have been identified and tracked to a nearby town, where we now intend to bring them to justice.\n\nThe particular logistics of their arrest remains an important question however: though we obviously want to set an example that activists are safe even in the south, at the same time it would be unwise to needlessly inflame tensions by taking provocative action. Thus, we must decide whether to try to cajole unreliable local police to make the arrest (which they may well refuse to do), or to federalise the National Guard, an action that would provoke resistance in the south."
 united_states_crisis_events.35.a: "Order the state to do it."
 united_states_crisis_events.35.b: "Federalise the National Guard."

 united_states_crisis_events.36.t: "Local North Carolina Police Refuse to Comply"
 united_states_crisis_events.36.d: "Our attempts to minimize the backlash to the arrests of the alleged perpetrators of the recent killings in North Carolina have taken a turn for the worse. Local police have steadfastly refused to take the men into custody, let alone release them to us. Local law enforcement has been generally sympathetic to the men, and opposed to our attempts to reign in their communities.\n\nAs such, we are forced to escalate the situation by federalising the national guard, an action we had initially wished to avoid taking. Hopefully the blowback is minimal."
 united_states_crisis_events.36.a: "Federalise the National Guard."

 united_states_crisis_events.37.t: "Retaliatory Killings in Chicago"
 united_states_crisis_events.37.d: "Though the arrests of the alleged perpetrators of the recent North Carolina murders has gone off without a hitch (besides initial rumours of a defensive militia that caused us to increase the involved number of guardsmen), the delay in the arrest of the men has invited significant condemnation and backlash across the nation. Just one day before the men were arrested, two Share Our Wealth organisers were killed outside of a Chicago hotel, seemingly in a retaliatory attack.\n\nThough Share Our Wealth is antagonistic to our administration, the uptick in political violence is obviously gravely concerning no matter which side it is coming from. Already, police are investigating the murder, but with the Socialists holding a strong grip on the city it is unknown if local police can be trusted with the investigation..."
 united_states_crisis_events.37.a: "Very troubling."

 united_states_crisis_events.38.t: "National Guard Attacked in NC Shootout"
 united_states_crisis_events.38.d: "Our attempts to arrest the alleged perpetrators of the recent killings in North Carolina have taken a turn for the worse. Though we were correct in assuming only the National Guard would be reliable enough to bring the men to justice, we had not correctly anticipated the level of resistance they would face in fulfilling their duty.\n\nThe small and lightly armed contingent of guardsmen arrived at the town the killers had taken refuge in, only to be met with an armed ambush. A local militia, comprised of volunteers including local law enforcement, repelled the guardsmen from the town, allowing the fugitives to escape.\n\nThough a larger guard force was later sent in, the damage has been done. The men have escaped, and North Carolina has been set aflame, with anti-government rioting and racial violence having exploded into the open."
 united_states_crisis_events.38.a: "So much for the most liberal state in the south."

 united_states_crisis_events.39.t: "Martial Law in North Carolina"
 united_states_crisis_events.39.d: "The recent events in North Carolina have mandated a strong federal response. Today, the President declared martial law across the state, authorising the federalised national guard to take whatever measures necessary to protect the wellbeing and property of all its inhabitants.\n\nThough this is a necessary measure, it has not necessarily had the desired effectiveness as of yet. In many parts of the state, it is still unenforceable, as local militias and police still hold a monopoly on force. The reliability of the National Guard itself has also come into question, with numerous personnel leaving their posts in response to our attempts to enforce the state of martial law."
 united_states_crisis_events.39.a: "We don't have many other options."

 united_states_crisis_events.40.t: "Southern States Deputise Minutemen"
 united_states_crisis_events.40.d: "Citing the increase in disorder and political violence nationwide, several southern states, including Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, have authorised the deputisation of civilian paramilitaries in law enforcement. Effectively, this means the deputisation of the Minutemen, and the further strengthening of Huey Long's growing hold over the south.\n\nThough these states have loudly proclaimed that they are primarily concerned with maintaining order against \"political radicals\", the deputisation of the minutemen has indicated that this is a rather one-sided and targeted approach. Already, reports of increased violence against unionists, particularly those organising predominantly black industries such as sharecropping, have made national headlines, inviting outrage and condemnation from the left."
 united_states_crisis_events.40.a: "Is this ever going to end?"

 united_states_crisis_events.51.t: "Borah Introduces Fair Deal Legislation"
 united_states_crisis_events.51.d: "The inauguration of a new President briefly instilled renewed confidence on Wall Street, as the shadow of the Smith Administration passed. Though President Borah is a progressive maverick, the markets rebounded with the news that new public works and federal funding projects were likely to come into fruition as a result of the new administration.\n\nThis brief rebound seems to be quickly fizzling out however: though the president signed a swath of executive orders upon taking office, he has deferred large-scale spending to Congress, as is its prerogative. Thus, the announcement of a new legislative package supported by the administration has been hotly anticipated.\n\nToday, the president has put the speculation to rest. Announcing what he calls the \"Fair Deal\" (named for Theodore Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\"), Borah has, in an address to the nation, called for the passage of a slate of spending measures, as well as a new Revenue Act that will levy an income tax to fund these expenditures. Though raising taxes will doubtlessly be less than popular, the president insists on the necessity of returning the nation to fiscal health while dealing with the depression.\n\nAlready, the plan has drawn sharp responses from Congress. Liberals and Progressives are broadly supportive, while conservatives are more sceptical. The Socialists have denounced the plan unconditionally, leaving the moderate Farmer-Laborites and the Long camp as the main swing votes that will decide the fate of Borah's agenda."
 united_states_crisis_events.51.a: "We must get this through."

 united_states_crisis_events.52.t: "Liberal Democrats in Congress Announce Support"
 united_states_crisis_events.52.d: "President Borah has been the recipient of good news today, as several important liberal and progressive Democrats have announced their support for the president's proposed income tax bill. Senator Robert Wagner of New York has pledged to support the president's efforts to institute a federal income tax to fund public works and other projects, noting his hope that the president would revive the failed Social Security push of last year. Additionally, progressive Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana has announced his support as well.\n\nThe consolidation of a moderate liberal-progressive bloc including both Democrats and Republicans in Congress in support of Borah's program has been viewed as an important step for the new administration. Senator Wheeler's support has also increased hopes that Huey Long and his supporters will come around to the president's proposals. As Long's closest friend in Congress, it is hoped that Wheeler's influence will further bridge the gap between the president and Long."
 united_states_crisis_events.52.a: "We can only hope."

 united_states_crisis_events.53.t: "Long Voices Scepticism"
 united_states_crisis_events.53.d: "Prior to last year's election, Huey Long and William Borah had an amicable relationship in the Senate as loose members of the broad-tent progressive bloc. Though Borah was not nearly as critical of President Smith as Long was, their shared support of more interventionist measures fostered a cooperative attitude, one which manifested on the campaign trail when they avoided attacking one another by name.\n\nUpon Borah's election, it was hoped that this previous collaboration would allow Borah to accommodate Long, and fold him into his coalition. Though Long at first appeared to show interest in the president's overtures, it appears that relations between the men have cooled since the inauguration.\n\nToday, Long has criticised Borah's \"Fair Deal\" in the Senate. Criticising the proposed measures as insufficient compared to the calamity of the depression, Long stopped just short of announcing outright opposition to Borah's income tax bill. Long's apparent opposition has thrown a wrench into efforts to pass Borah's program. With both the Socialists and Longists hypothetically opposed, the margin against them and conservative intransigents becomes far narrower than we would have hoped."
 united_states_crisis_events.53.a: "Nothing but a troublemaker."

 united_states_crisis_events.54.t: "Farmer-Labor Splits On the Fair Deal"
 united_states_crisis_events.54.d: "The recent news of Huey Long's split with President Borah has sent pro-administration forces into a panic. Though there is clearly a majority in Congress for change of some kind, it is now far from certain whether there is a majority for the president's proposed \"Fair Deal\", given the opposition of both the far-left and the right.\n\nWith the administration on the backfoot, any good news is welcome. Thus, the news that several moderate members of the Farmer-Labor Party in Congress are looking to break with their Socialist allies in order to back the president's agenda has been greeted with enthusiasm by establishment liberals and progressives. President Borah in particular has praised their decision to place country over party, and has invited them to joint discussions surrounding his agenda.\n\nThe Socialists however have not taken this lying down. Smelling blood among their \"allies\", they have accused the Farmer-Laborites of betraying the working class and their voters, words which have seen them make inroads among radicalised Farmer-Labor voters, who appear to have drifted to the left of their representatives."
 united_states_crisis_events.54.a: "Still, a welcome sign."

 united_states_crisis_events.55.t: "Income Tax Bill Dies in Committee"
 united_states_crisis_events.55.d: "Since the inauguration of President Borah, the high hopes that surrounded his election have continually declined, as the national situation has failed to improve in the first month of his tenure. As political violence escalates further and further, the president's legislative agenda has faced ever greater setbacks. Now, it appears dead in the water, as the income tax bill touted as the first step in Borah's \"Fair Deal\" has died in committee.\n\nOnly a week ago it seemed as if Borah's agenda might recover from Huey Long's decision to oppose the president, as dissident Farmer-Laborites rallied to the president's coalition in Congress. This however was not enough to save the bill from being tabled, de facto stopping it in its tracks. The bill's defeat in committee has thoroughly squashed the momentum behind the president's legislative project, and now the administration drifts listlessly, being attacked on all sides by radicals in the SPA and Long's cohort, who smell blood in the water."
 united_states_crisis_events.55.a: "Damn."

 united_states_crisis_events.56.t: "Fair Deal Efforts collapse"
 united_states_crisis_events.56.d: "What initially appeared likely has now become, for all intents and purposes, fact. Though the president has made no formal admission of legislative defeat, the comparative quietness from the White House regarding Borah's \"Fair Deal\" has indicated that the president's core legislative agenda is now dead in the water. Beset from both the left and the right since its announcement, the failure of the income tax bill, as well as growing political violence has forced the president to turn his administration's policies elsewhere for now.\n\nSmelling blood, both radical factions have pounced on the President's failure. Huey Long, perhaps the greatest architect of the Fair Deal's downfall, has denounced Borah for giving up on domestic reform, seemingly revelling in his rank hypocrisy surrounding the matter. The Socialist Party meanwhile has gone on as they usually do, proclaiming the need for immediate socialisation of industry in the name of the working class.\n\nIn any case, public confidence in Borah has plummeted since the Fair Deal's failure. The belief that this administration can fix the economy through legislation has evaporated into thin air, further radicalising the public and intensifying the present crisis of political violence."
 united_states_crisis_events.56.a: "We tried..."

 united_states_crisis_events.57.t: "Approaching Negotiations"
 united_states_crisis_events.57.d: "It is abundantly clear that a coalition of establishment progressives and liberals will not be enough to carry our ambitious legislative agenda into being. Clear-headed negotiations will be necessary if we want to have any serious hope of passing even the most basic of Borah's \"Fair Deal\" proposals. Though the left remains hostile to this administration, the opportunity to make new allies has seemingly presented itself on the other end of radical politics.\n\nSince Huey Long's entry into the Senate in 1932, he and President Borah have had a strong working relationship. Both members of the broad western progressive grouping in the Senate, Long and Borah have historically been aligned on important progressive issues, including many proposals finding their way into the Fair Deal, such as an income tax. With Borah's election, Long has been uncharacteristically quiet, sending overtures to us that he is willing to talk.\n\nTaking advantage of Long's openness will be key, not only so we can win him over, but also for winning over his southern allies. Firstly however, we must decide what our approach to negotiations will be: will we leverage the presidency to force the other side to come to terms, or will we appeal to their better nature and call for national unity?"
 united_states_crisis_events.57.a: "We don't want to alienate people here."
 united_states_crisis_events.57.b: "We need to press them hard."

 united_states_crisis_events.58.t: "Setting Up a Meeting"
 united_states_crisis_events.58.d: "The time has come for us to arrange our first set of negotiations to pull Long's coalition into the fold of our Fair Deal. Without either Long's personal bloc or his reluctant southern allies, the hopes of passing any substantial legislation are slim at best, making the next few decisions crucial.\n\nThe obvious first step would be to meet with Long personally. Taking advantage of the existing rapport between Long and the president is an obvious move, and Long is likely to be more receptive to interventionist economics and increased spending than his southern allies.\n\nAlternatively however, we could meet with a number of key southern senators. The conservative south has always been an odd fit for Long, settling on him as a figurehead mainly out of opposition to the other major political forces. Though our ties to them are not as strong as those with Long, Borah has incurred praise from them due to his defence of states' rights, particularly with regards to the debate surrounding the Costigan-Wagner Anti-Lynching Act, which Borah opposed. Splitting them from Long could be an unorthodox but ingenious manoeuvre."
 united_states_crisis_events.58.a: "Long is at the head of all of this."
 united_states_crisis_events.58.b: "Gather the southern senators, they'll be reasonable."

 united_states_crisis_events.59.t: "First Meeting With Long"
 united_states_crisis_events.59.d: "The agenda of our first meeting with Long has been broadly decided. The main feature is to be the first stages of the Fair Deal agenda, including a request for Long's support on the income tax bill which is intended to levy a federal income tax to pay for the proposed programs. Though we expect Long shouldn't have many problems with this, we must decide what we are willing to give him in exchange for his support.\n\nOn the one hand, by finding common ground we may be able to convince him that the Fair Deal itself is a reward. For eight years under Smith, Long criticised the president's reluctance to intervene economically. Now, with Borah in the White House, Long has the chance to put his money where his mouth is.\n\nAlternatively, we can focus on more...material impacts that the Fair Deal may have. With Borah's insistence on respecting states' rights, many of the new initiatives will be administered by the states. With poor states like Louisiana to be particular beneficiaries, we may find the good old fashioned pork may bring Long along with our program."
 united_states_crisis_events.59.a: "Find common ground - we're both progressives at the end of the day, right?"
 united_states_crisis_events.59.b: "Long strikes a hard bargain, but some good pork will loosen him up."

 united_states_crisis_events.60.t: "Southern Senators Grumble"
 united_states_crisis_events.60.d: "The president's recent meeting with Huey Long was productive and encouraging. With Long affirming his openness to supporting the Fair Deal, we have made important progress in securing a majority for it in Congress. Many of Long's southern allies however have been more reluctant to go along with their nominal leader's plans. Far less radical than Long, they have tacitly criticised the president from the right, breaking ranks with Long.\n\nIt is important to remember this division in the Long camp's ranks, and to deal with this problem on its own terms. Appealing to these southerners is a necessary step in bringing Long's faction into the fold. Though Borah's ties with them are weaker than with Long, perhaps they are enough to cool some heads surrounding this situation.\n\nAlternatively, Borah could forgo sort power and instead remind these conservatives of the stakes at play. If they do not allow Borah to push the Fair Deal through, perhaps the Socialists will seek to do so by other means than through Congress..."
 united_states_crisis_events.60.a: "They should know they have a friend in us."
 united_states_crisis_events.60.b: "They should be reminded of the strikers outside."

 united_states_crisis_events.61.t: "Meeting With the Southern Senators"
 united_states_crisis_events.61.d: "After the mild success of our meeting with Long, and the calming of tensions with the southern camp, the time has come to fully bring the southern senators on-side. Though their default conservative inclinations make them reluctant to support progressive economic intervention, the president hopes that necessity and common sense will bring them to support his Fair Deal.\n\nIn any case, we have every intention of meeting with a larger number of southern senators to hash out a deal. An important question has hung over such a meeting however: that of Huey Long. Though Long is obviously a senator from the south, many more orthodox senators wish to meet with the president without him, believing that he will simply support Borah's line.\n\nEither way, we can play the decision to our advantage: by bringing Long in, we can pressure the other senators to \"get with the program\", so to speak, and browbeat them into following Long's lead. Alternatively, by accommodating them, we can win their trust and flip the script on Long, breaking up their tenuous coalition."
 united_states_crisis_events.61.a: "There's an opening here. Wedge them by accepting their terms."
 united_states_crisis_events.61.b: "Long is their leader, why shouldn't he be in the room?"

 united_states_crisis_events.62.t: "First Meeting With the Southern Senators"
 united_states_crisis_events.62.d: "Our decision to first meet with the peripheral southern members of Long's coalition has been met with skepticism by some of the president's allies. On the surface, Long may seem to be the more immediately convincible figure in the coalition, due to his existing rapport with President Borah and his support for a more interventionist approach to the depression.\n\nLong's southern allies however present a key opportunity for us. While they have mostly been behind Long for the past year, they have always been reticent towards Long's distributionist policy positions, keeping their leader at arms length at all times. This ideological space, we believe, may give us the opportunity to split the Long bloc in two, neutralising them as a threat.\n\nTo get the southerners on board however, we must find the best strategy to get them to sign on to the Fair Deal. Though these conservatives are usually reticent to federal economic intervention, we could attempt to assuage their fears by presenting ourselves as more moderate than their nominal leader. Alternatively, we could offer key incentives in the form of patronage, which could swing the more pragmatic members of their faction."
 united_states_crisis_events.62.a: "We hear them, we listen. There's no radicalism in this administration."
 united_states_crisis_events.62.b: "I think we all understand the language of commerce..."

 united_states_crisis_events.63.t: "Long Criticises Borah"
 united_states_crisis_events.63.d: "Our decision to meet with Long's southern allies has not gone unnoticed among the public. Whispers of a potential split within the Long camp have abounded around Washington for the past week, as the southern senators who backed Long's bid for president last year appear to be receptive to the president's Fair Deal initiative.\n\nOne particular figure for whom this turn of events has set off alarm bells is Huey Long himself. Considering himself a friend and amicable colleague of the president up until this point, Long has changed his tone in his latest public speeches. Ramping up criticism of President Borah, Long accuses him of being more interested in the opinions of establishment Democrats (by which he means his own nominal allies) than of the \"Share Our Wealth\" movement which has supposedly galvanised the nation.\n\nThough Long's speech initially seems to be a setback, it could be interpreted as a success for our hardline strategy. Our meeting with the southerners has certainly caught Long on the backfoot, and he appears to be scrambling to regain the initiative in negotiations. One option of course would be to try to smooth things over with him in the leadup to an anticipated meeting, by privately apologising for the snub. Alternatively, we could ramp up the pressure, perhaps even by holding another meeting with Senate liberals before meeting him."
 united_states_crisis_events.63.a: "Privately apologise before this gets out of hand."
 united_states_crisis_events.63.b: "Keep him on the backfoot. Set up a meeting with Senate liberals."

 united_states_crisis_events.64.t: "Our Friend Long"
 united_states_crisis_events.64.d: "Since President Borah's inauguration, hopes have abounded that the new president will be able to finally reach an accord with Huey Long and his movement, and re-integrate them into mainstream politics. After weeks with seemingly little progress with Long himself (though some more substantial progress with his more recent allies), the time has finally come to meet Long face-to-face, and hammer out a deal to pass the first stages of the Fair Deal.\n\nThough Long reacted negatively to our snubbing of him when we met with the southern senators before him, he has responded with enthusiasm with regards to our plans for a one-on-one meeting with President Borah. This has been taken as an encouraging sign that Long will be willing to engage in good faith, however it remains to be seen if we can convince him to do so.\n\nAppealing to Long's desire for stronger economic action is a simple and easy path. While we cannot guarantee that he will be won over by words, Borah's previous rapport with him will help substantially. Alternatively, some of our advisors have suggested that Long's outbursts a week or so ago were an indication of desperation. If that is so, perhaps it will be better to corner Long, and force him to concede to our demands, lest we rip his coalition apart entirely."
 united_states_crisis_events.64.a: "Appeal to our common values."

 united_states_crisis_events.65.t: "Our Final Offer"
 united_states_crisis_events.65.d: "With the progress made in negotiations with the Long faction over the past week, many in the administration feel encouraged that we will secure the necessary votes to get the Fair Deal rolling in Congress. To seal the deal, a second meeting with Huey Long has been scheduled before the income tax bill is put up to a vote, one which represents our last chance to get Long on board.\n\nWith this in mind, the president must decide what he is willing to concede to Long in exchange for the votes necessary to pass the bill. The minimum demand Long can be expected to make is the incorporation of elements of the \"Share Our Wealth\" platform into the Fair Deal. While many of Long's ideas are economically unfeasible, elements such as a system of social security could fit in well with our program.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Long could be convinced to join us in a more literal sense. Our current nominee for Attorney-General has not yet faced a vote in the Senate, so there is still time to offer the prestigious position to Long instead, a possibility that has been in the public imagination for months. Such an offer could well be enough to convince Long.\n\nFinally, there is the obvious but drastic option of offering support for a prospective second Long presidential campaign. Borah is an old man, and unlikely to run for a second term. The promise of an endorsement is likely to bring Long to our side no matter what, though if news of such a bargain leaked it could spell disaster for everything we have worked towards for the past month."
 united_states_crisis_events.65.a: "We will consider the Share Our Wealth platform, and adopt its best parts."

 united_states_crisis_events.66.t: "Long-Borah \"Pact\" Leaked"
 united_states_crisis_events.66.d: "Just as it appeared that we had a deal with Long, disaster has struck. Somehow, through some act of subterfuge or other, Borah's offer of an endorsement for Long for president in 1940 has leaked to the press. Facing accusations of a \"corrupt bargain\", Long has been forced to deny these claims, severing any chances of seeing our prospective alliance through.\n\nThough the news has battered Long's alliance with his southern partners (who we have not been on good terms with lately), the alliance seems to be holding, with Long being forced by circumstance to direct his ire back at us. In any case, this represents a fatal blow to the project we have been working towards since day 1 of our administration."

 united_states_crisis_events.67.d: "Today, in a public meeting in the White House, Senator Huey Long of Louisiana announced his support for President Borah's \"Fair Deal\". Proclaiming that the President is the right man to lead the country to recovery, Long praised Borah's efforts at bringing together a diverse array of political forces in the name of national recovery. In turn, the President thanked Long's efforts at building a coalition of reform-minded interests, both inside and outside of Congress, and stated his hope for a continuing partnership.\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the nation's capital, southern senators gave the green light for the income tax bill to move past committee for a vote on the floor of the House, set to occur in the next week or so. With conservative opposition to the first part of the Fair Deal neutralised, it is expected that much of the rest of Borah's immediate legislative agenda will follow.\n\nThe success of our negotiations with Long comes as a great relief, both to the administration and the American people. With one faction of radicals placated and re-integrated into the political mainstream, only the Socialist Party remains outside the bounds of normal politics. Unfortunately, convincing them may be a far trickier task..."

Proclaiming that the President is the right man to lead the country to recovery, Long praised Borah's efforts at bringing together a diverse array of political forces in the name of national recovery.\n\nThe president, in turn, announced that Long would be nominated for the position of Attorney-General, further cementing the budding alliance. Though Long's confirmation vote is expected to be hotly contested, and many liberals and conservatives object to the appointment of a known demagogue to such a high office, Long's appointment means a surefire solidification of the alliance between him and Borah.\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the nation's capital, southern senators have reacted with scorn at the new partnership between Long and Borah. Long's abandonment of their interests has left them to the wayside, with little recourse other than to futilely obstruct the incoming wave of Fair Deal legislation. Though they will continue to be a thorn in our side, the splintering of their alliance with Long means that neither is an immediate threat any longer.

 united_states_crisis_events.69.d: "Today, in a public meeting in the White House, several southern allies of Huey Long announced their support for President Borah's \"Fair Deal\". Though they emphasised their reservations surrounding issues of states' rights and overspending, they have agreed in principle that some modest measures are needed to revive the nation's economic fortunes. The president, in turn, thanked the group for their cooperation in the productive and insightful negotiations of the past month, emphasising his commitment to unity between all mainstream political forces.\n\nFor Huey Long however, the deal between Borah and the conservative wing of his coalition comes as a slap in the face. Long has vociferously denounced Borah's \"corrupt bargain\" with his former allies, and has called upon the Share Our Wealth movement to oppose Borah at every turn.\n\nEven without the support of southern conservatives, Long commands a strong nationwide presence. However, the withdrawal of support by those southern elements has seriously hampered Long's ability to challenge the government, and in the grand scheme of things he is now but a nuisance, rather than a serious threat to the republic. In that category, only the Socialist Party remains strong enough to challenge our power in such a way. Unfortunately, dealing with them may be a far trickier task..."

 united_states_crisis_events.70.d: "Though the negotiations of the past month initially seemed headed for success, for a variety of reasons our efforts failed to bear fruit. With several blunders we alienated and angered both elements within Long's faction, pushing them back into each other's arms and failing to bring them closer to our position. Ultimately, we have failed in our task of bringing Long and his supporters into the Fair Deal fold.\n\nThis has been confirmed outright by the opposition of both Long and his southern allies to the income tax bill, the first element of the Fair Deal platform. Though their criticisms oscillate between denouncing the bill as alternatively \"socialism\" and \"a half-measure\", without either Long or his conservative allies the bill is destined for a drawn out and painful death.\n\nIn any case, public confidence in Borah has plummeted since the Fair Deal's failure. The belief that this administration can fix the economy through legislation has evaporated into thin air, further radicalising the public and intensifying the present crisis of political violence."

 united_states_crisis_events.101.t: "Landon Proposes Business Relief"
 united_states_crisis_events.101.d: "The election of a new president provided a much needed reprieve for Wall Street. The moderate liberalism promised by Alf Landon's incoming administration fit the attitudes of traders well, as the markets rallied in the lame duck period and in the immediate aftermath of the inauguration. Such a limited bounceback relied on the promise of relief legislation however: without it, the markets have once again begun to waver.\n\nAs his first major initiative as president, Alf Landon has therefore promised a straightforward relief bill. Aimed at businesses of all sizes, the proposed “Federal Emergency Relief Act” aims to halt the growing wave of bankruptcies, and inject enough capital into businesses to end the slouch in unemployment. Though on its own it will not be enough to halt the depression, it is hoped that the bill, if passed, will at least stop the bleeding, and prevent a total economic collapse.\n\nResponses to the bill have been polarised. Both establishment parties have reacted favourably to the proposal: though conservatives and progressives have some reservations regarding its scope, it is generally regarded as a necessary and positive measure. The radicals in both chambers however have firmly denounced the bill as a handout to Wall Street, and both the SPA and Long have vowed to fight Landon on the issue.\n\nStuck in the middle are the moderate Farmer-Laborites, who have not yet staked a decisive position. Convincing them may be the key to ensuring a speedy passage of the bill."
 united_states_crisis_events.101.a: "As expected."

 united_states_crisis_events.102.t: "Liberal Democrats in Congress Announce Support"
 united_states_crisis_events.102.d: "President Landon has been the recipient of good news today, as several important liberal and progressive Democrats have announced their support for the president's proposed relief bill. Senator Robert Wagner of New York has pledged to support the president's efforts to provide emergency relief to employers across the nation, though he has maintained his hope for a more comprehensive legislative recovery program in the future.\n\nThe consolidation of a moderate liberal-progressive bloc including both Democrats and Republicans in Congress in support of Landon's agenda has been viewed as an important step for the new administration. This however has not been an unqualified success. Though mainstream liberals and progressives have drawn closer to the administration, conservatives have begun to waver in their support, running the risk of our coalition crumbling from within.\n\nAdditionally, both Long and the far-left have remained intransigent towards our administration. Long has again reiterated his opposition to a bill which funnels money to big businesses, and the Socialists have been as uncompromising as ever. It appears our struggles to pass this legislation have only begun."
 united_states_crisis_events.102.a: "It's a start at least."

 united_states_crisis_events.103.t: "Radical Farmer-Labor Members Demand Further Measures"
 united_states_crisis_events.103.d: "In a blow to our chances of passing the president's emergency relief bill, the mood in the Farmer-Labor caucus in Congress has shifted in a manner not to our advantage. In a letter signed by a dozen or so members of the House, the Farmer-Laborites criticised the relief bill's focus on business relief, and demanded legislation more geared towards workers and poor farmers before they would lend their support to large-scale business relief.\n\nThough the Socialist Party has been as intransigent as ever in the debate surrounding the president's recovery plan, it was hoped that we would be able to win over a substantial number of non-socialist Farmer-Laborites. With this shift to the left however, it appears that this will be more difficult than we anticipated.\n\nThe consequences of our setback surrounding Farmer-Labor have already reverberated in our own caucus: already, we have received concerned letters from several liberal and progressive congressmen within our own coalition requesting the inclusion of additional aid provisions, something which risks alienating the conservatives in our ranks. If we do not act quickly to rally our coalition in the face of this setback, our legislative efforts may falter."

 united_states_crisis_events.104.d: "As expected, the response of Senator Huey Long to the president's recovery plan has not been positive. In the Senate this week, Long mocked the plan as a plain handout to big business, denouncing the provisioning of aid to Wall Street while the American people suffer in poverty. Once again promoting his “Share Our Wealth” plan as a superior alternative, Long has promised to leverage all of his support in Congress against the administration's plan.\n\nThough we had hoped to be rid of Long as a substantial political influence with his final defeat in the presidential election in January, Long's influence runs deeper than we had hoped would be the case. Far from strangling his movement in the crib, Long's coalition has merely become emboldened by the supposed “corrupt bargain” behind Landon's election.\n\nLong's remaining allies in Congress meanwhile have remained by his side, further complicating our efforts at building a coalition behind the relief bill. Long's alliance with the southern reactionaries has lasted longer than anticipated, cutting off the option of a coalition with the south, and Long's continuing ties to western progressives such as Burton K. Wheeler has made even the support of the congressional centre-left far from a sure thing."
 united_states_crisis_events.104.a: "Expected, but a bad sign."

 united_states_crisis_events.105.t: "Recovery Bill Fails"
 united_states_crisis_events.105.d: "The sense of hope surrounding the election of Alf Landon in January has been gradually dissipating over the course of the president's first weeks in office. Optimism both within establishment circles and among the American people that the new president would be able to turn a new leaf and lead the nation to recovery has been met with the harsh reality of a sharply polarised Congress and ever growing political violence, with intransigent radicals growing bolder by the day.\n\nThough it was hoped that the passage of the president's relief bill could break the stalemate which exists in the nation's capital today, any such optimism has been dashed by the emergence of a clear congressional majority against the bill. With moderate Farmer-Laborites joining the Socialists, Long, and southern conservatives in opposition to the bill, the possibility of Landon's moderate backers passing it on their own approaches zero.\n\nThe relief bill was widely viewed as the administration's main chance at a substantial victory in its first 100 days. With its death on the house floor, confidence in mainstream politics, after years of malaise, has begun to shatter entirely. What comes next is unclear, but as violence continues to consume the nation, nothing good will come of our failure."

 united_states_crisis_events.106.t: "Rallying the Establishment"
 united_states_crisis_events.106.d: "With President Landon only having been elected a few weeks prior to his inauguration, he has not been afforded nearly the amount of time conventionally allocated to incoming presidents in the lame duck period to prepare to assume the highest office in the land. As such, the new administration has scrambled to gather allies in Congress to support its incoming legislative agenda.\n\nThe first item on that list is a comprehensive business relief package, dryly named the Federal Emergency Relief Act. Aiming to support businesses of all sizes to halt the bleeding in employment, it is a stopgap compromise designed to prevent a further collapse in economic conditions. Though we are confident that we can, in time, get it passed, we will need to bring not only our own Republican Party in line, but also the Democrats.\n\nWithout a unified establishment bloc, there is no hope of passing any legislation through such a divided Congress. The myriad Democratic factions each have conflicting reservations surrounding the proposed bill however: liberals and progressives are sceptical of aid to big businesses, while conservatives gawk at such a high price tag.\n\nIn order to bridge these gaps, it would be prudent to meet with one of the leading figures from each of these respective blocs. Our first choice of meeting, either with liberal Senator Robert F. Wagner, or conservative House Speaker John Nance Garner, will set much of the tone for negotiations surrounding the bill to come."

 united_states_crisis_events.107.d: "From the outset, it has been clear that the first priority of the Landon Administration must be to create a united bloc of establishment Democrats and Republicans, as a bulwark against radicals of both the left and right. With the growing prevalence of political violence and contempt for constitutional and democratic norms, unity of those forces still committed to the rule of law and good government is crucial if our republic is to survive this period of turmoil.\n\nToday, we have scored a breakthrough in negotiations with the Democratic contingent in Congress. Citing the need for an urgent improvement in economic conditions, Senator Robert F. Wagner has pledged his support for the president's legislative program in full, representing an important breakthrough in bringing other like-minded liberal Democrats on side.\n\nThough more conservative Democrats remain sceptical of the scale of the relief bill, the early breakthrough with one element of the party suggests that the Democrats as a whole are receptive to the needs of the moment."

Citing the need for the immediate revitalisation of the economy, House Speaker John Nance Garner has pledged his support for the president's relief bill, promising to leverage his power as speaker to push the bill through the lower house.\n\nThough this was perhaps expected given that Ganer relies on GOP votes to retain his office, this is nevertheless a good sign that we will be able to assemble a coalition with the mainstream Democrats. With the support of the liberals expected in the coming days, it is hoped that we will be able to press the relief bill through in relatively short order."

Though the Socialists and Long have, expectedly, denounced the bill, reception among the more moderate members of the Farmer-Labor Party in Congress has been more positive. Many members of the party outside of the SPA have always held reservations surrounding their alliance with the Socialists, and have now refused to align with them in their revolutionary intransigence.\n\nNow, members of both the Wisconsin Progressive Party and the North Dakota Nonpartisan League have approached the administration seeking a meeting with the president surrounding the relief proposal. On the one hand, this provides us an opportunity to decisively win over these groups to our program. However, this runs the risk of alienating the conservatives who we have won over so far. Thus, some administration officials have suggested a joint meeting of both these Farmer-Laborites and the other establishment parties, as an alternative to a meeting just with Farmer-Labor."

Our confidence that a sufficient number of Farmer-Laborites will defect to our side has increased substantially, as we have been able to win over several key members of their congressional caucus through minor concessions on farm relief and other topics.\n\nThough we are pleased by this outcome, the result of the meeting has resulted in blowback from the more conservative elements of our impromptu coalition. Conservative Democrats and Republicans have privately protested the increased price tag of the bill, with some threatening to recant their support if their concerns are not addressed.\n\nWhile House Speaker Garner has remained on our side for now, he has seconded many of these concerns to us, commenting that he cannot guarantee the integrity of the conservative element if the bill is put up for a vote. With the national situation deteriorating however, the president fears that the time for passage is now or never. Thus, we must decide whether to spend more time consolidating a coalition with Farmer-Labor, or to push ahead now, with all the risks that entails."

Though there was significant receptiveness to our proposed program among the Farmer-Laborites, there were also concerns that the bill did not include sufficient relief for farmers. While we made efforts to alleviate these concerns, the conservatives present in the discussion prevented us from issuing any large concessions to the left.\n\nRegardless, we are optimistic that the Farmer-Laborites will pull through in the end. Our meeting gave us confidence that they are acting in good faith, and now that they have entered into negotiations with us they have much to lose if they fail to help bring about relief. As things stand, our current congressional coalition may, just barely, have the necessary numbers in the house to push the bill through.\n\nGoing forward now however brings certain risks. Our support among the Farmer-Laborites is far from fully consolidated, and defections on our leftmost flank are expected. With the national situation deteriorating however, the president fears that the time for passage is now or never. Thus, we must decide whether to spend more time consolidating our coalition, or to push ahead now, with all the risks that entails."

Still, a win is a win, and the president hopes that, within the next month, a bill shoring up the jobs of millions of Americans will land on his desk.\n\nThe response of the intransigent radicals has been predictable. The Socialists have denounced the “betrayal” of their erstwhile Farmer-Labor comrades, who they fear may prove that reform remains the best option for American workers. Huey Long meanwhile accuses the administration of selling the nation to the socialists, and has leveraged both reactionary fears of a “socialist” government as well as populist anger towards a supposed handout to big business.\n\nIn any case, we can only hope that eventual relief will politically disarm these radicals."

Already, violent attacks by paramilitary or militia actors have continued to climb after the election, as socialists refuse to take Long's ascendency lying down, and Longists are determined to protect their recent gains.\n\nAmong the most notable instances of violence in the early days of the Long Administration have been a spate of attacks on Share Our Wealth clubs in northern, socialist-dominated cities. Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and New York have all seen significant violent acts against the clubs, with the most recent attack in Chicago resulting in the death of two Share Our Wealth members.\n\nDetermined not to let such acts of violence against his supporters go unpunished, the president has ordered a federal investigation into these acts of violence. We have however run into the problem of generally uncooperative state and municipal authorities, unsympathetic to the president's politics."
 united_states_crisis_events.151.a: "The bastards!"

 united_states_crisis_events.152.t: "Minutemen Murder Striking Workers"
 united_states_crisis_events.152.d: "The most recent spate of political violence has devolved into a nationwide tit-for-tat. The recent attacks on Share Our Wealth members in northern cities have spurred on retaliatory action from the similarly Long-aligned Minutemen. Yesterday, a group of Minutemen in Gary, Indiana, attacked a number of striking workers with knives and even pistols, killing three and severely wounding two more.\n\nThough these strikers were members of the IWW's railroad union, the consequences of this attack have already reverberated beyond the most radical sections of the left. Reports of unionists, even from the CIO and even AFL, arming themselves similarly with everything from clubs to submachine guns has spurred fears of further violence, particularly of a revolutionary nature. Additionally, the violence complicates Long's project to reconcile the AFL and moderate element in the CIO to his movement, spurred on by the progressive element in his coalition."
 united_states_crisis_events.152.a: "More of this?"

 united_states_crisis_events.153.t: "Open Battle in Toledo"
 united_states_crisis_events.153.d: "The nationwide paramilitary tit-for-tat between Minutemen and strikers has further escalated. In Toledo, a Socialist stronghold, clashes between the two groups have escalated in scale and intensity for the past week. Though they originally started with clubs, metal bars, and knives, now the situation has escalated to an all-out shooting spree, as several clashes in the city have turned into shootouts.\n\nAlready, martial law has been declared in several northwestern Ohio counties, to prevent the violence from spreading. This has done little to alleviate the situation however, as federal forces have not yet arrived to shut off the bloodletting. Regardless, even once the violence quietens somewhat, the reports from Toledo have already inspired copycat acts of violence across the nation."
 united_states_crisis_events.153.a: "Everyone seems to love fighting these days..."

 united_states_crisis_events.154.t: "Executive Order 7010"
 united_states_crisis_events.154.d: "The restoration of order throughout the United States is one of President Long's first and foremost priorities upon taking office. Across the nation, under resourced and overwhelmed local police and militias have been unable to contain the flood of oftentimes violent labour agitation. Though the president supports the right to organise, the radical and socialist unionists have abused that right to promote criminal anarchy, and must be stopped by the means at hand.\n\nTo this end, the president wishes to sign an executive order that will give certain paramilitary organisations such as the Minutemen police powers under certain circumstances. This will undoubtedly be controversial, as socialists denounce any attempts to pacify violent strikers and the establishment decries it as a power grab.\n\nRegardless, we must decide on the specifics of this executive order. Though we could deputise all Minutemen nationwide as federal law enforcement, this would undoubtedly cause enormous uproar. Instead, a more moderate solution may be to, more symbolically, merely encourage local municipalities to deputise them in such a manner."
 united_states_crisis_events.154.a: "The Minutemen must be deputised nationwide."
 united_states_crisis_events.154.b: "The municipalities themselves can decide."

 united_states_crisis_events.155.t: "Establishment Liberals Denounce Long"
 united_states_crisis_events.155.d: "Our decision to deputise all Minutemen nationwide as federal law enforcement officers has faced rather steep blowback. Though the right has been cautiously optimistic about the plan, establishment liberals have fervently denounced the scheme, decrying it as nothing but a bare faced power grab by President Long.\n\nThough we would generally not be too concerned by the denunciations of members of the Washington establishment we have fought so fervently against, it is important to note that many of these concerns have come from the people who helped elect the president, and indeed from those within his own circle. Burton K. Wheeler for instance has personally expressed concern about the potential abuses of power enabled by the executive order."
 united_states_crisis_events.155.a: "I'm sure it'll be fine."

 united_states_crisis_events.156.t: "Socialists Arrested in Philadelphia"
 united_states_crisis_events.156.d: "As hoped, many municipalities have bought into our scheme to deputise the Minutemen as official law enforcement. Various conservative municipalities in both the north and south have taken to signing on the Minutemen as additional law enforcement, particularly those afflicted by radical and socialist agitation.\n\nThe largest and most notable example so far is that of Philadelphia. One of the largest northern cities outside of New England not controlled by the SPA, Philadelphia still remains under the control of the old conservative Penrose machine, which has endured the depression to guarantee a continuing GOP majority in the city, and indeed, the state.\n\nWith the Socialists gaining on the city establishment however, the Minutemen have been called in to set things straight. Already, numerous socialists have been arrested and charged with a variety of petty and not-so-petty crimes, hopefully clipping the wings of the SPA in the city."
 united_states_crisis_events.156.a: "I'm sure they're guilty."

 united_states_crisis_events.157.t: "Minutemen Assault IWW Gathering"
 united_states_crisis_events.157.d: "The recent deputisation of members of the Minutemen has instilled a new boldness in many of the organisation's chapters. Where they initially were faced with the threat of law enforcement, now they are capable of acting with more impunity in many areas, encouraging them to take bolder action against socialists, radical unionists, and other perceived enemies of the president.\n\nThe latest example of this has been a particularly violent Minutemen assault on an IWW gathering in Cincinnati. Though the clash resulted in the retreat of the unionists and only resulted in one death, it is emblematic of the result the deputisation program has brought.\n\nAs a result however, even CIO and AFL unionists are beginning to lose faith in the ability and willingness of the government to protect them, a development with many concerning implications."
 united_states_crisis_events.157.a: "It'll be fine."

 united_states_crisis_events.158.t: "Minutemen Hall in Chicago Burned Down"
 united_states_crisis_events.158.d: "The Minutemen's growing boldness has heralded a response from the opposing centre of non-government political violence in the country. Just last night, a medium-sized office building used by the Minutemen as a headquarters in Chicago was burned down in an arson attack. Though no one was killed, the assailants escaped, after also having burgled many of the local's files and records.\n\nIt appears as though the socialists, syndicalists, and anarchists which have rooted themselves in American society will not go down without a fight. Though the Minutemen have had several recent successes in their fight against criminal syndicalism, they will have to continue to be vigilant, and it remains to be seen if they are up to the task ahead of them."
 united_states_crisis_events.158.a: "Concerning."

 united_states_crisis_events.159.t: "Ohio Police Arrest Minutemen"
 united_states_crisis_events.159.d: "Our deputisation program has resulted in a newfangled conflict of authority in Ohio. Yesterday, Ohio police arrested a number of deputised minutemen on charges of conspiracy and sedition, alleging a plan to occupy the state capitol and overthrow the government of Farmer-Labor and Socialist Governor Sharts. Though the Minutemen legally had the authority of law enforcement officers, this was not enough to prevent their arrest.\n\nThe Ohio case is emblematic of other attempts by socialist-dominated state and local governments to subvert deputised Minutemen. Already, \"deputies\" have been arrested or otherwise neutralised by local police, or even deputised Red Guards or other socialist militias. Though the deputisation initiative has done much good for us, it appears to be reaching the limits of its utility."
 united_states_crisis_events.159.a: "It was good while it lasted."

 united_states_crisis_events.160.t: "Michigan National Guard Arrest Minutemen"
 united_states_crisis_events.160.d: "The backlash against the deputisation of the Minutemen continues in Michigan, as across the state the National Guard has moved to arrest large numbers of Minutemen, on charges of conspiracy and sedition, similar to the recent case in Ohio. The round of arrests in Michigan however have been far broader in scope, reaching across the state in a coordinated roundup effort.\n\nThough some attempted to resist arrest, including through violent means, the operation was overall successful. Presidential attempts to federalise the national guard have been rebuffed due to the ongoing crisis in the state, as the SPA consolidates its grasp on the crucial economic centre."
 united_states_crisis_events.160.a: "Damnit."

 united_states_crisis_events.161.t: "Ohio State Government Deputises Workers' Militia"
 united_states_crisis_events.161.d: "The arrest of several Minutemen in Ohio following allegations of an impending coup has not been the end of growing political violence in the state. Open battles between the Minutemen and their opponents have become commonplace, as local police become more and more incapable of stopping the tide of violence.\n\nIn response to the recent coup scare, Governor Sharts has authorised the deputisation of a number of workers' militias, formed by radical workers and unionists to defend the state government from “reactionary insurgency”. Though Columbus has fared relatively well through the depression due to its diversified economy, it has not been spared the upsurge in worker militancy that has spread across the north in the wake of Black Monday.\n\nWith both the militias and the Minutemen technically being deputised as law enforcement in many jurisdictions, the conflict between the two groups has reached an uglier phase. Both groups have attempted to arrest members and leaders of the others, often leading to gunfights. The resulting situation resembles a simmering civil war, as we attempt to use the minutemen to reign in a radical state government."
 united_states_crisis_events.161.a: "It's getting hotter and hotter."

 united_states_crisis_events.162.t: "Minutemen Retreat to Dearborn"
 united_states_crisis_events.162.d: "The recent takeover of Detroit by the Socialist-aligned National Guard has not been without significant pushback. The Minutemen presence in the city, having grown substantially over the past year in response to growing socialist militancy and agitation, attempted, though failed, to resist the SPA's total takeover of the city.\n\nHaving been pushed out of the city proper, the Minutemen have retreated to the reactionary suburb of Dearborn, a community largely insulated from the influence of the Socialist Party. There, they have begun to set up defences in preparation for an expected socialist onslaught, and have recuperated their numbers with local volunteers. Many locals have been recruited after hearing that the workers' militias include several African-Americans, a fact which has sent the whites-only community into a frenzy.\n\nThe city's expectation of an imminent attack by the Reds in Detroit seems to be well founded. Hoping to take over the entire state, reports abound that the workers' militia is preparing to take Dearborn by force, and expel the Minutemen from Michigan. Only time will tell if they will succeed."
 united_states_crisis_events.162.a: "Best of luck to the defenders."

 united_states_crisis_events.163.t: "Minuteman Coup in Ohio Fails"
 united_states_crisis_events.163.d: "Growing political violence in Ohio has reached a fever pitch today as the Minutemen have attempted to seize the state capital. After weeks of intermittent fighting between them and the emerging workers' militias, the Minutemen have been faced with the prospect of complete suppression by the state government, in spite of their status as deputised law enforcement.\n\nIn a last ditch attempt to overturn the state government, hundreds of Minutemen marched in Columbus, attempting to seize key state institutions such as the state capitol. In most cases however, they were repelled by militias loyal to the Farmer-Labor/Socialist state government, and after failing in several key objectives they have been forced to retreat on pain of immediate arrest.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attempted coup, an emergency session of the Ohio state legislature was held, in which both houses voted to grant Governor Sharts emergency powers to combat “Minutemen terrorists”, and ensure the security of the government of Ohio. Taken under the watch of the workers' militias now occupying the state capitol, the vote was boycotted by all non-Farmer-Labor or Socialist members, who denounced the “naked intimidation” of the Governor's actions. Though the governor, a relative moderate in his party, was reluctant to seize power so blatently, Attorney-General John Marshall has been noted as applying a leftward pressure within the administration, with many regarding him as the power behind the throne. In any case, this represents a key victory for the governor, as, in effect, the Socialists have taken full control of the security of the state."
 united_states_crisis_events.163.a: "Another domino falls."

 united_states_crisis_events.164.t: "Impeachment Proceedings Begin"
 united_states_crisis_events.164.d: "For weeks now, the nation has been gripped by the turmoil in the midwest which has followed the president's executive order deputising the Minutemen. Though the order was always expected to cause blowback, the violence unleashed by the president's actions has been well beyond what was expected, as the Minutemen have acted with impunity when granted the powers of law enforcement and local forces have pressed back with open displays of force.\n\nWith the executive order having always been of dubious legality, the expected pushback has occurred. Today, articles of impeachment were introduced by Socialist Congressman Vito Marcantonio, accusing President Long of abusing his powers. Though we would not normally be worried about articles of impeachment introduced by a Socialist, many even in the mainstream parties have now indicated their willingness to seriously consider impeachment.\n\nThis is of course just the latest in a long line of actions by the establishment intended to stop the president in his tracks. Despite the growing opposition in Congress, we have every intention of fighting to the last to hold on to the power to which the president was duly elected."
 united_states_crisis_events.164.a: "Bring it on."

 united_states_crisis_events.165.t: "The President Speaks"
 united_states_crisis_events.165.d: "President Long was elected by a broad coalition of elements dissatisfied with the status quo, and equally opposed to the menace of socialism. Western and southern farmers, small business owners, and anti-socialist workers have all combined to bring Long into the White House. Squeezed between conventional big business capitalism and radical socialism, They have, in Long's view, appointed him as their tribune to stand up to established interests and forge an economy that works for all.\n\nOn his first day in office therefore, President Long has chosen to give an address over the radio emphasizing his immediate aims in terms of economic policy. For too long, the fat cats of Wall Street have run roughshod over farmers and working people through predatory banking practices. Long therefore has demanded that Congress pass Father Charles Coughlin's proposed banking reform, which will create a Bank of the United States of America under the control of elected officers.\n\nPredictably, there have been immediate objections to this proposed reform. Though Al Smith also pursued banking reform in his first term, none of the measures implemented then are as radical as this. Additionally, there have been concerns surrounding the constitutionality of the plan. Nevertheless, the president has defended the plan as having neither of the primary drawbacks of a private or “political” banking system.\n\nIn any case, a protracted battle surrounding the bill in Congress is expected in the coming months."
 united_states_crisis_events.165.a: "Purely superficial objections..."

 united_states_crisis_events.166.t: "Banking Bill Faces Steep Obstacles"
 united_states_crisis_events.166.d: "Our efforts to make the Nye-Sweeney Banking Bill the centrepiece of our domestic agenda has been received warmly by our base. Already, the administration has been inundated with thankful letters from supportive farmers, who expect a democratised banking system to be friendlier to their needs and interests. In Washington however, it has gone over slightly less smoothly: many groups opposed to us in Congress have voiced their skepticism, and as things stand it appears unlikely that the bill will pass in its current form.\n\nCompromise will likely be needed in order to allow us any hope of passing the bill. The most simple and obvious proposal for compromise would be to simply water down the bill and make the recommendations of the elected directors advisory, as well as removing provisions requiring local banks have 100 percent of demand deposits in reserve. Though this would be a substantial reduction in its scope, it is likely to pass through Congress and give us an early victory. Additionally, when our position is more secure, we could make further reforms to add power to an already established institution.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to again levy the support of the large northern businesses who we were in a surprising marriage with during the campaign. Though european-style state corporatism has previously been anathema to the president, granting corporate representation on the board of directors (which we may try to remove later) could help us get buy-in from capital.\n\nFinally, the more uncompromising and unscrupulous members of our administration have recalled the old tactics we used back in Louisiana. As Governor, Long was not above...lubricating the opposition with pork to get his bills passed. Though we should be wary of treating D.C. as an enlarged Baton Rouge, perhaps the same principle can be applied?"
 united_states_crisis_events.166.a: "We can cool some heads by moderating the bill's more radical notions."
 united_states_crisis_events.166.b: "Much as we disdain corporate power, we have to negotiate with the beast."

 united_states_crisis_events.167.d: "Our compromise regarding the banking bill has had its intended effect. Congressional moderates, satisfied that the bill does not substantially violate the rights of the existing stakeholders in America's banks, gave their tepid support to the president's proposal, giving us a significant legislative win in the first weeks of the administration.\n\nThough the proposal is a significantly watered down version of Father Coughlin's original plan, we still find cause for celebration. The interests of the American people will now be seen and heard in the halls of the highest financial decision making in this country, a stark change of pace from the smoke-filled rooms of Wall Street.\n\nNevertheless, our victory is not absolute. The new elected banking board is sorely lacking in teeth. In time, we aim to grant it stronger powers of enforcement, however for now we will have to temper the expectations of our supporters, who demand an immediate transformation in our country's financial system which is not possible at this moment."

The interests of the American people will now be seen and heard in the halls of the highest financial decision making in this country, a stark change of pace from the smoke-filled rooms of Wall Street.\n\nNevertheless, our victory is not absolute. The new elected banking board is not solely comprised of representatives of the American people. Instead, it also includes representatives from business, and even the stakeholders of the banks themselves. Though we have inserted the interests of the people into banking governance, for now we will have to temper the expectations of our supporters, who demand an immediate transformation in our country's financial system which is not possible at this moment."

 united_states_crisis_events.169.t: "Socialists Riddicule Banking Reform"
 united_states_crisis_events.169.d: "As expected, our reforms to the banking system in the United States have generated a wide array of opposition. Though initially Congressional conservatives were up in arms about the Nye-Sweeney Act, our accommodations towards their concerns have somewhat quietened their criticisms. Where they have gone quiet however, the Socialist Party has grown louder, raining on our hoped for honeymoon.\n\nThe Socialists have mocked and ridiculed our accomplishment. Denouncing the Nye-Sweeney Act as a powerless sham, they have emphasised the continued role of private interests in the banking system to denounce Long as just another puppet of big business. They have instead demanded that the banking system immediately be nationalised and centralised without compensation, vowing to crush the capitalists who have had their boots on the necks of the workers and farmers.\n\nThe Socialists' response has elicited a divided reaction. Some of the Farmer-Laborites who at one point or another supported Long have been won over by the view of the SPA. On the other hand, their intransigence and radicalism has further pushed certain northern industrialists into our camp, now viewing us and our willingness to compromise as a viable and acceptable alternative to revolution.\n\nIn any case, it appears our brief honeymoon with the broader public will soon come to a close. Now we must consolidate and maintain our strength for the battles to come."

 united_states_crisis_events.170.d: "We had initially hoped that the establishment of an elected Board of Directors, even if its powers were only to give recommendations, would rein in the banking system in this country, and align it better with the needs and interests of the people. Though the current members of the board have only been provisionally appointed, we hoped that their bully pulpit would compensate for their lack of formal authority.\n\nUnfortunately however, the large banks have instead elected to ignore some of the first recommendations of the board. Though the board has recommended a freeze on farm foreclosures, this has gone largely ignored by the big banks, giving us a significant black eye.\n\nNow, having failed a key promise to many farmers, the words of the SPA are becoming more appealing by the day. As radicalism across the country grows, we will need to more directly confront the vested interests strangling the common folk of this country."

 united_states_crisis_events.171.t: "Bank of the USA Board of Directors Meets"
 united_states_crisis_events.171.d: "With the passage of the Nye-Sweeney Act, a provisional Board of Directors for the new Bank of the United States of America has been hastily assembled. With the demand for banking reform coming from our base a key rallying point in last year's campaign, President Long has been determined to be seen as delivering on one of his key promises. Though the elected element of the board has not yet been properly elected, Long has provisionally filled the vacancies with officials loyal to him, and amicable to the goals of the reform program.\n\nThe corporate section of the board however has been somewhat more reluctant to go ahead fully with any disruptive measures. A freeze on farm foreclosures was tabled for now, representing a setback for many Long-supporting farmers. Nevertheless, the president remains optimistic that the new national bank will facilitate a return of monetary power to the people, in due course."
 united_states_crisis_events.171.a: "You don't get everything instantly."

 united_states_crisis_events.172.t: "Farmers Seize Rural Banks"
 united_states_crisis_events.172.d: "Though we were successful in passing the Nye-Sweeney Act in the first weeks of the new administration, the compromises we made in doing so have ruffled more than a few feathers among our base. The news that there would not be an effective freeze on farm foreclosures in particular sent many small and poorer farmers into a frenzy. Having voted for Long to put an end to usury and financial exploitation, they have increasingly seen the need to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThough rural unrest and attacks on banks occurred relatively frequently last year, the past week has seen an unprecedented wave of seizures of rural banks by farm militants in the Great Plains and elsewhere. Demanding the full implementation of Father Coughlin's banking program, the decentralised movement has engaged in several serious acts of violence against bank management, including several cases of murder.\n\nThough this movement is broadly aligned with our aims (many farmers within it have reiterated their support for President Long), it represents a potentially dangerous militant tendency that may endanger our fragile political coalition. We will have to tread carefully in dealing with it."
 united_states_crisis_events.172.a: "Concerning."

 united_states_crisis_events.173.t: "Division in the Long Movement"
 united_states_crisis_events.173.d: "The newest wave of rural bank seizures has now continued unabated for weeks. Increasing both in frequency and intensity, many bankers in rural communities have sheltered in their homes, for fear of growing lynch mobs which have gathered to impose a primitive “justice” for foreclosures and usury. For some, even this has not been enough: bank officials have been attacked and even killed in their own homes.\n\nThough the bank seizures themselves had increased tensions within our coalition, the recent outbursts of violence, often in the president's name, have taken things to the breaking point. The conservative elements of Long's coalition, including both southern Democrats and northern industrial interests, have now called on the president to denounce the bank seizures. The most recent figure of significance to meet with Long on the issue has been Henry Ford, a surprising financial backer of last year's campaign who has now asked the president to reaffirm his commitment to bank property.\n\nOn the other side of the Long camp however, figures such as Father Charles Coughlin have asked the president to remain silent on the issue. Denouncing the seizures could, in their view, demoralise our supporters, and lose us valuable political momentum. Either way, we will have to consider the value of alienating one portion of our coalition over another..."

 united_states_crisis_events.174.t: "Southern Conservatives Denounce Long"
 united_states_crisis_events.174.d: "With violent bank seizures continuing and even expanding across the nation, President Long's silence on the issue has been deafening. Having come to view the militant farmers' movement as a component of his own coalition, the president has thus far refused to condemn their actions or violent methods, instead continuing to focus on his proposals for banking reform. As the feeling both in Congress and the business sphere becomes more and more antagonistic both to Long and the farmers however, pressure is mounting from within Long's own house.\n\nToday, several conservative congressional southern Democrats aligned with Long have signed a letter denouncing the administration's inaction on the issue. Though it stops short of holding the president responsible for the rise in violence, it does state that order and public tranquility must come before any future banking reform.\n\nThis breakage with the southern conservatives is undoubtedly concerning, however the president is confident that it will not last. In any case, we have, for better or worse, implicitly confirmed that our sympathies lie with the farmers, rather than with the business puppets in Washington."
 united_states_crisis_events.174.a: "We have the people on our side."

 united_states_crisis_events.175.t: "Long Denounces Violent Bank Seizures"
 united_states_crisis_events.175.d: "With violent bank seizures continuing and even expanding across the nation, President Long has finally been compelled to make a decisive public statement on the matter. In a speech broadcast on the radio across the nation, Long first acknowledged the legitimate grievances of many Americans against the banking system. However, he also denounced acts of violence and asserted that only peaceable reform could bring about social and economic justice.\n\nThe reaction to the president's speech has been mixed, but swift in all cases. Members of Congress, including those of the establishment parties usually opposed to Long, have praised the speech as befitting a national leader. Conservative and business members of Long's own coalition have similarly been reassured of Long's continuing commitment to protecting private property.\n\nThe farmers however have had more mixed feelings towards the speech. With many having considered themselves as loyal supporters of Long, some have felt betrayed or abandoned by the president's explicit denunciation of their methods. Though we have certainly cooled heads in Washington, one wonders whether we may have alienated the most important part of our coalition."

 united_states_crisis_events.176.d: "Our determination to pass an unaltered version of the Nye-Sweeney Bill has led us down a less than scrupulous road. In Louisiana, corruption is a fact of life. Bribes are a part of the political process, which, while not necessarily accepted, has characterised much of the state's patronage system both before and under Long.\n\nIt has not taken the president very long to discover the folly of treating Washington like Baton Rouge however. Our attempt to “lubricate” opposition to the Nye-Sweeney Bill has exploded onto the front pages of every paper of record in the country. Several members of Congress have reported being offered patronage appointments or even bribses for their support for the bill, including several whom we had considered generally amicable to our political project. Others have reported being threatened, and essentially held to ransom for their votes through patronage.\n\nThe backlash has been swift. Numerous members of Congress and the media have denounced the president and the administration, specifically the “infection of Louisiana graft” in the halls of the national capitol. What we had hoped would be a strong start has now turned into an unprecedented debacle, as we now must turn to damage control."

 united_states_crisis_events.177.d: "The growing fire in Congress over our attempts to illicitly gather support for the Nye-Sweeney Bill has proven difficult to contain, let alone put out. The establishment conservatives of both parties, previously dejected by Long's victory in January. Have been galvanised and energised by this early misstep by the administration. Today, they have delivered a letter cosigned by several dozen House and Senate members calling for impeachment proceedings to begin, to determine the extent of the president's role in the scandal.\n\nMost concerning of all has been the presence of several liberal and progressive names on the list of signatures. Farmer-Laborites and progressive Democrats who were key to our victory have now begun to quickly turn on us, accusing Long of bringing Louisiana's corruption to the sacred halls of Congress. With the Socialists obviously always opposed to our administration, the defection of the centre-left has all but destroyed our prospect at holding together an anti-socialist reformist majority in Congress.\n\nThe prospect of impeachment is cause for more immediate concern however. Though no president has ever been caught up in such a scandal so early into their term, recent months have seen many conventions trod over as the national situation radicalises. Soon, we may find ourselves defending the president from removal from office."

 united_states_crisis_events.178.d: "The appointment of Republican stalwart William Borah as Secretary of State was an important olive branch to the political establishment in the days immediately after Long's election. Though Borah is a famous maverick, his well respected reputation and comparative normality as opposed to the president endeared the voice to the Senate, which easily voted to confirm him.\n\nHis maverick nature which made him acceptable both to Long and the Senate have now backfired on us however. As the president's role in the corruption scandal becomes ever clearer, Borah has distanced himself further and further from the administration. Now, he has publicly announced his resignation, denouncing the corruption and graft that has quickly become endemic in the Long Administration.\n\nInitially, the establishment had hoped that Borah would act as a stabilising agent in Long's administration. Now however, he serves their interests in a different way. Borah's resignation has been a serious blow to the standing of the administration, and has emboldened anti-Long progressives to more clearly stand against the president.

 united_states_crisis_events.179.t: "Congress Begins Impeachment Proceedings"
 united_states_crisis_events.179.d: "The past few weeks have seen resignations, congressional defections, and other substantial setbacks for our administration. The blowback from the congressional corruption scandal has been far harsher than we could have possibly imagined, as the dubious methods of Louisiana have been shown to be anathema to the “respectable” establishment (even if Washington wasn't exactly clean even before we arrived).\n\nToday, this has culminated in what we should probably have expected as a likely outcome. Republican Congressman Robert A. Taft of Ohio has introduced articles of impeachment against President Long. Cosponsored by over a dozen fellow congressmen from both major parties and Farmer-Labor, impeachment has been received favourably by House Speaker John Nance Garner, who, after a brief partnership with Long in January to gain re-election to his post, has now returned to his previous intransigent opposition to Long over the scandal.\n\nThe threat of impeachment obviously warrants a clear response from our end. Many within the administration have advocated that we apply pressure on our remaining congressional allies to try and slow the process and gain more time. An alternative view however holds that this may result in yet more blowback against us, and that simply supporting ourselves publicly is the best course of action."
 united_states_crisis_events.179.a: "We need to push back on this nonsense."
 united_states_crisis_events.179.b: "Maybe we need to pull ourselves out of the congressional grinder."

 united_states_crisis_events.180.t: "Impeachment Brought Forward"
 united_states_crisis_events.180.d: "Our latest efforts to stave off impeachment have seemingly backfired. In a press conference today, House Speaker John Nance Garner has committed to bringing the impeachment resolution introduced by Congressman Taft to a vote within the next fortnight. With momentum and congressional support at their back, it appears likely that the resolution will succeed, and the impeachment resolution will move forward to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIt appears that our attempts to rally our supporters in Congress against impeachment have, rather than helping our position, instead worsened it. Some of our supporters, put off by our fairly blatant pandering, have been reluctant to come to our aid. Our opponents on the other hand have been emboldened by seeing our efforts be rebuffed. With pressure mounting on Garner to take the opportunity to push hard for impeachment, it has quickly become a question of “when” rather than “if” impeachment will go ahead.\n\nAt this rate, it is quite probable that articles of impeachment will pass in the house. As things stand, the divided nature of Congress makes determining our position in the senate rather difficult. Though a 2/3rds majority is needed in the Senate for conviction and removal, the establishment parties have a strong stranglehold on the body. If they vote in lockstep, we may well lose."

 united_states_crisis_events.181.t: "More Cabinet Members Resign"
 united_states_crisis_events.181.d: "The growing calls for impeachment in Washington haven't just been coming from Congress. Within our own camp, disaffection with Long has grown far more quickly than expected. Among appointees not personally loyal to Long or his political project, particularly those liberal or progressive Democrats who supported him as a reform candidate, discontent has turned into a slew of resignations, as government officials protest against the now well-established corruption of the Long Administration.\n\nThough impeachment does not seem to have progressed substantially compared to last week, our internal troubles have meant that the tides against our administration have not let up yet. House Speaker John Nance Garner has confirmed that he will bring Congressman Taft's impeachment resolution to a vote in due course, and it is likely that there is little we can do to stop it from passing.\n\nEven disaster has the ability to bring opportunity however. While we were initially pressured to appoint moderates and establishment-friendly candidates to important government positions, the resignation of many of these early appointees has allowed for the ascension of loyalist deputies or new pro-Long appointees (at least in positions that don't require Senate confirmation). This has had the effect of strengthening our influence over the federal bureaucracy, something which is no small gain at all."

 united_states_crisis_events.182.t: "The Farmers' Revolt"
 united_states_crisis_events.182.d: "Impeachment has quickly become a very popular buzzword in Washington. President Long has never been a popular figure in the nation's capital, being regarded as a conniving, dishonest, provincial populist. The corruption scandal was hardly unexpected on Capitol Hill: it fit every preconceived notion of who and what Long was to a tee, and as such the establishment jumped on the impeachment bandwagon in an instant, wanting to finally be rid of the troublesome president.\n\nInstead, Long has always found his friends among the people. Poorer farmers joined Long's campaign in droves, and cheered his victory as the salvation of the common folk of America. Now with their president under attack by the elite, city-dwelling establishment which has always kept them down, they have become determined to show the true will of the people.\n\nRural militias associated with but not necessarily part of the Minutemen have engaged in a growing series of bank seizures and displays of force against federal authorities. Proclaiming their support for President Long, these farm militias have demanded that Congress halt the impeachment process and pass the president's proposed banking reforms. Several of these militias have gotten into firefights with state militias, or even national guards, as rural unrest grows along with political extremist action in both the north and south.\n\nThough these militias are hardly a threat to government authority, they serve as a reminder that Long still has allies willing to fight for him. Though Congress appears undeterred for now, we would do well to keep tabs on these militias and see how they may be used in future..."

 united_states_crisis_events.201.d: "The continuing failure of Congress to elect a president has placed the nation in an unprecedented situation. For the first time since 1789, the office of President of the United States has become vacant, with no permanent successor to Al Smith in sight.\n\nAs the house has yet again failed to elect a speaker, Secretary of State Cordell Hull has taken to fulfilling the duties of the presidency. Signing official documents as the Acting President of the United States, Hull's decision not to resign with Smith's departure as is standard protocol, and to instead stay on to maintain continuity of government has maintained some small semblance of normality in Washington.\n\nThough he has been praised by his fellow Democrats, members of other parties have taken a more cynical view, with some even accusing the Democrats of prolonging the election so as to maintain power under Hull (since it is legally impossible for a Democrat to be elected president in the house). Though this dissent has not resulted in any significant violence as of yet, many state governments have thus far refused to acknowledge the acting president's authority, setting the stage for a dangerous confrontation between the states and a headless federal government."

 united_states_crisis_events.202.t: "Long Denounces Congress"
 united_states_crisis_events.202.d: "It has not taken long for the anti-establishment political forces to comment on the current situation in Washington. Though both Long and the Socialists bear central responsibility for the continuing failure of the House to elect a president, they have nonetheless been able to readily reap the rewards of congressional deadlock, as America's political class seems incapable of governing.\n\nThis week, it appears that Long has taken the spotlight. In the Senate (now the only vaguely functional chamber of Congress), Long has vociferously denounced Hull as a usurper, attacking the “unconstitutional assault on the American people” which he claims Hull is at the head of.\n\nHull and Long have long been at odds, as Hull's establishment-oriented liberalism conflicts with Long's radical populism. Notably, in response to Long's common denunciations of Congress, Hull once suggested that, after a mob had hanged the other “damned scoundrels” in the Senate, as Long suggested they would, Long should complete the justice by hanging himself.\n\nWhile this latest conflict is therefore unsurprising, what is concerning is the degree to which the general public agrees with Long. The Hull “administration” remains utterly bereft of legitimacy, and as the days go by more and more public figures have called for Hull to step down, even in the absence of an alternative."

 united_states_crisis_events.203.t: "Midwestern State Governments Assume Authority"
 united_states_crisis_events.203.d: "Since January 20th, numerous state governments across the country have refused to recognise Cordell Hull as the acting president. In spite of the lack of any legitimate alternative pole of power in the country, state governments aligned with Huey Long and the SPA have not acknowledged any executive orders or decisions signed by Acting President Hull. Instead, they have administratively almost cut themselves off from the federal government, and have even begun to give orders and directives to federal employees in their respective states in spite of their lack of legal authority over them.\n\nThe most notable instance of this has been in the aftermath of the growing steelworkers' strike in eastern Ohio. The situation has quickly grown incredibly violent, as open gunfights between Minutemen, Red Guards, and other militias have left over a dozen dead in the past week. Federal attempts to force the National Guard to intervene have gone unheeded however, as the National Guard in Ohio refuses to acknowledge Hull's legitimacy. Instead, the Socialist governor has ordered the guard to suppress the Minutemen, which they have begun to do.\n\nOur failure to control the National Guard is a substantial blow to our authority. Already, other state governments, particularly in the midwest, are taking more autonomous action either against or in support of striking workers in labour conflicts. As federal authority further diminishes, we have little expectation that the violence which is sweeping the nation will abate any time soon."

 united_states_crisis_events.204.t: "Detroit Commune Forms"
 united_states_crisis_events.204.d: "The spate of labour-related violence this week has culminated in Detroit. Michigan, under a particularly radical Socialist Party administration since 1935, has for years been a hotbed for labour violence. With the federal government unable to control the National Guard however, the state government has finally seen a chance to strike against their political opponents.\n\nIn a joint assault of the National Guard and the paramilitary Red Guards, the Minutemen and other anti-union militias were routed from key areas in the city. Spontaneous attacks on key strategic points secured the city for the Socialist Party, the CIO, and the IWW, who now have total control over the city.\n\nThe political situation in the city having suddenly radicalised from even its previous Socialist-dominated state, the new state of affairs has been formalised with the formation of the Detroit Commune. A new government based on the model of the French communes has been installed with the backing of the state government under the Renner Administration, now totally bereft of non-socialist influence.\n\nThe suddenness of this takeover has shaken the federal government to its core. With one of the most important states in the union being taken over by an openly revolutionary force, the calls for action from Washington have grown to a crescendo. Our impotence to heed them has all but shattered any remaining confidence in Hull's position, as southern and western state governments mobilise their own National Guards on their own accord to protect their own interests."

 united_states_crisis_events.205.t: "War Plan White Activated"
 united_states_crisis_events.205.d: "Over the past few weeks, it has become abundantly clear that Acting President Hull's caretaker administration is incapable of restoring order to the country. The federal government has all but lost control completely in both the midwest and deep south, as state governments loyal either to the Socialist Party or Huey Long assert control over federal employees and National Guard units. The continuing failure of Congress to elect either a speaker or a president has sent the federal government's position into a death spiral, as Hull's legitimacy falls further and further.\n\nWith the writing on the wall, Acting President Hull has reluctantly heeded the advice of General Douglas MacArthur. War Plan White, the military counterinsurgency plan intended for an eruption of overwhelming domestic unrest, has been activated, with some modifications.\n\nAdditionally, Hull has chosen to step down as acting president in favour of MacArthur: he has appointed MacArthur as Secretary of State and conditioned his own resignation from that post on his successor's confirmation. The Senate, increasingly dominated by conservative voices, approved MacArthur's appointment, making him acting president.\n\nFew have any illusions about MacArthur's new role. Open conflict between the federal government and radical political forces is now inevitable. Now, all we can do is brace ourselves for the coming storm."

 united_states_crisis_events.210.d: "The American south is no stranger to political violence. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, white “redeemers” used physical force and intimidation to strip power from African-American electorates and restore white rule after Reconstruction. Racial terror campaigns became a key method of establishing Jim Crow, as incidents such as the Wilmington Massacre stripped all remaining political power from African-Americans in the south, rendering them a permanently disenfranchised underclass.\n\nThe recent wave of political violence nationwide has taken this particularly ugly form in the south. Reports have now come in of a mass lynching of a half dozen organisers for the Sharecroppers Union, a labour organisation supported by the Afro-American Committee of the Socialist Party. Governor Talmadge, an infamous white supremacist aligned with Huey Long, has vocally supported the attack on the unionists, as several similar incidents of violence have followed.\n\nThough the Socialist Party's civil rights plank is weaker than many of its Black members wish, it has still vociferously denounced this most recent incident. Though the party is not in much of a position to retaliate, several civil rights groups, such as the Afro-American Unity Congress (often regarded as an SPA front), have grown closer to the party's own increasingly confrontational and violent methods, as the federal government fails to enforce the 1935 anti-lynching law."

 united_states_crisis_events.211.d: "The growing wave of political violence that has gripped the nation has now reached Wisconsin. Though the Badger State has been controlled by a relatively moderate Farmer-Labor coalition (including the local Wisconsin Progressive Party and the SDF) for some time now, the Red Guards and a radicalised local SPA have had substantial influence for some time.\n\nHaving grown increasingly dissatisfied with Governor Philip La Follette, and his perceived closeness to anti-socialist Republicans, the Red Guards have chosen to act to secure the state for the SPA. In a cleanly coordinated operation, the Red Guards seized control of key government buildings in Madison and Milwaukee, along with railway hubs elsewhere in the state.\n\nAfter occupying the state capitol, an emergency session of the state legislature was convened, which, under the watch of the Red Guards, declared Governor La Follette (who had fled out of state by this time) to have vacated his office, declaring Thomas Ryum Amlie acting governor in his wake. Amlie, a more SPA-friendly member of the Wisconsin Progressives, has, presumably under duress, appointed SPA-loyalists to key positions, and ordered the state's militia to stand down.\n\nThis successful coup d'etat in an American state has sent shockwaves. Governor La Follette has denounced the illegal usurpation from exile, as has Congress and the White House. With the state militia and National Guard having bowed to the new regime however, it will likely take a full federal intervention to restore the legitimate government, something which appears unlikely for the time being, as the country falls further into chaos."

President Long, visiting several southern states in a post-election tour, stopped by to meet with General Moseley and converse regarding key matters of national security.\n\nThough the contents of their meeting have not been made public, the two struck a cordial tone upon Long's departure. Long commented that the so-called “Butcher of Mingo”, known for his brutal suppression of the Mingo War in the early 1920s, was a strong leader with a keen awareness of the challenges facing the country. General Moseley in turn praised Long as a decisive leader, and as someone keenly aware of the dangers of socialism.\n\nThough General Moseley is known for his political outbursts, this most recent meeting is bold, even for him. His de facto endorsement of Long violates every principle of military neutrality in politics, demonstrating his particular reliability to the administration and its goals."

 united_states_crisis_events.213.d: "Though America's long history of racial violence is mainly associated with the south, the north is no stranger to it. The “Red Summer” of 1921 saw massive outbursts of racial violence in northern cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C. The continued strength of the Klan in northern states such as Indiana and Maine has further perpetuated such incidents, as the mobilisation of right-wing militias against the SPA, IWW, and other unionists has the knock-on effect of violence against Black communities (as well as vice-versa).\n\nOne recent incident has been in Gary, Indiana, where the Klan and its allies descended on the local African-American community. Having been discouraged from their initial goal of disrupting a steel strike by the local Red Guard, they have instead gone after their usual, less well defended prey.\n\nAfter several hours, and much pleading from African-American community leaders, an intervention against the Klan came. It was not from the police or National Guard however, but from the socialists. The Red Guard routed the poorly organised Klan, killing over a dozen both in and after the fighting. What was left was a devastated community, as the Klan had killed half a dozen people, and destroyed businesses, homes and livelihoods.\n\nThough the reluctance of the Red Guards to intervene in several similar instances of violence has resulted in a reticent among African-American communities to rely upon them for protection, they have nonetheless been seen as more reliable than the police or official authorities. As African-American support for the SPA grows, the racial aspect of the growing civil conflict in America grows even more dangerously."

 united_states_crisis_events.250.d: "The 1936 election represented a disappointment for the Farmer-Labor Party in several respects. Not only did it fail to win the presidency, but it narrowly missed out on many seats both in Congress and in state legislatures which it was hoping to win. As hoped for majorities failed to materialise, the knives came out within the disparate party coalition.\n\nAs one may expect, the party's more mainstream elements have blamed the toxic image of the Socialist Party for their election defeat. Criticising the intransigence and extremism of the Socialists and their contributions to the party platform, they have increasingly questioned the wisdom of the inclusion of the SPA in Farmer-Labor, as well as the generous number of party nominations SPA candidates have historically received.\n\nThe party base however has seemingly shown a different view. Increasingly, the weight of grassroots support has swung behind the party's more leftist elements. One demonstration of this has been the recent show of support for the so-called “socialist governors' conference”, a newly minted alliance of the SPA governors of Michigan, Illinois, West Virginia, and Ohio.\n\nThis alliance of governors has pledged to “defend the interests of the workers of our states from a reactionary federal government”. Denouncing the new president and the circumstances in which he was elected, they have drawn the support of a radicalising Farmer-Labor base in taking a classic SPA class war posture."

With the state-supported seizure of idle GM plants in December, the conflict between labour and capital has taken on an existential character: the workers, no longer content with mere concessions, now appear to be aiming for full control of the city's industrial heart. In turn, the companies have fought a brutal retreat, aiming to bleed the unions and hopefully suppress them through federal force.\n\nIn the latest escalation, the violence is now characterised by open gunfights in the city's industrial and commercial sectors. It is not uncommon to see Red Guards or impromptu workers' militias barricaded in the streets, shooting at hired goons or Minutemen, or even the police. With the state thoroughly in the hands of the SPA, companies such as GM have ceased to rely on the state government to protect their property rights, bringing the class war further into the open.\n\nA state of open war in a major American city is obviously unacceptable. In this administration's early days, we cannot be seen as weak or to be standing on the sidelines. As such, an immediate federalisation and mobilisation of the Michigan National Guard is recommended."

The Michigan Socialists, controlled by the particularly radical tendency of the “proletarian universities”, were once so radical they refused to take part in elections at all. Having won an election they only ran in because the national party ordered them to do so, it was hoped that the Michigan Socialists would burn themselves out and quickly lose office.\n\nThis has not turned out to be the case. Worse still, Governor Al Renner's administration has more effectively captured the state's institutions than we could have possibly expected. Not only are local governments and the state bureaucracy now loyal to the SPA, but so is the National Guard, which has refused our orders to put an end to the violence in Detroit.\n\nWith the guard out of federal control, we are faced with an unfortunate predicament. Either we back down, lose massive face, and concede the guard to the SPA, or we attempt to force a change in the guard's leadership, a taxing endeavour which may not be successful for some time."

Amidst a nearly warlike atmosphere, the Michigan Socialists have taken the next step in their nationalisation program: whereas previously nationalisation was targeted at idle and unused factories, now it has grown to encompass properties currently used by GM. Several factories have been seized, either by impromptu workers' militias or the organised paramilitaries of the SPA and IWW, with the state passing a law allowing for the expropriation of factories by their workers.\n\nThough this law is obviously unconstitutional and violates every principle of private property imaginable, it is quite obvious that the government of Michigan simply does not care. The Michigan SPA, as well as the SPA nationwide, seemingly believes that the opening salvos of an open class war have been fired. As GM demands that federal forces intervene to protect their property, it is difficult to say that they are wrong in Detroit, at least."

The danger of having a state national guard in the pocket of a radical political party is obvious: with control over the guard, the state government is capable of enforcing its radical agenda even on an unwilling state populace, or worse, attempting to leverage the guard against the federal government in some way.\n\nFortunately, the guard's refusal to follow federal orders has given the perfect pretexts for the removal of its leadership. Not only have several leading officers been dismissed, the Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army (TJAG), Arthur W. Brown, has court martialed them in absentia.\n\nUnfortunately, we are in Washington, and they are in Michigan. The officers in question have simply ignored both their dismissal and court martial, and the guard has therefore remained firmly in the grip of the SPA. General MacArthur has also briefed us on the possibility that other state national guards, including those of Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, and especially West Virginia, have also been compromised politically.\n\nFor now, the Michigan leadership will be staying put, a severe loss of face for the administration.

The Minutemen and other far-right militias, seeing clearly that the National Guard will not protect the interests of non-socialists, have become ever more proactive in their attacks on the Red Guards and other allies of the SPA. Many in the administration now fear that the situation in Michigan is on the verge of spiraling out of control, if it hasn't already.\n\nAmidst this, the National Guard is standing by, refusing our orders to restore order to the state. Worse still, it has been reported that several National Guard units are actively participating in the actions of the Red Guards, with the guard leadership refusing to intervene to prevent this.

The National Guard is, at this point, an obviously unreliable institution, due to the SPA's subversion of it in their two years in office. If we wish to militarily intervene therefore, it will have to be through the army itself. That however presents other difficulties, as General MacArthur has noted that much of the army is already holed up preparing for other counterinsurgency measures, as the nationwide situation is not expected to abate by the summer.\n\nAnd so, for now, we sit by and watch as the industrial heart of America burns.

Where previously smaller tit-for-tat battles had been commonplace, now pitched firefights spanning multiple city blocs have become a relatively frequent occurrence. The level of violence has reached such an extent that the Canadian government has increased their military presence on the border near Detroit by 150% in the past week.\n\nWith the conflict now definitively out of control, General MacArthur has recommended the activation of War Plan White in the state. Concerns have grown however that even regular army units in Michigan are insufficiently loyal to undertake this operation.

Conventionally a productive time for legislation, the new president's honeymoon period has nevertheless been marked by fears that an intransigent and conservative-leaning Senate may hamper the passage of any radical recovery legislation. Thus, many have already taken to the streets in support of legislation to support the poor and the unemployed.\n\nOne such figure has been Father James Renshaw Cox. A populist labour priest and minor presidential candidate last year, Cox has conventionally been a strong supporter of Former President Al Smith. With Smith now out of office however, Cox has revived an idea he had previously floated: a march of the poor, jobless, and otherwise left-behind on the halls of power in Washington.\n\nThough few count Cox as any sort of revolutionary, the assembly of “Cox's Army”, set to march on the capital in about a month or so, has caused unease in some circles. Fears that the protest may be used as cover for more radical actors, or that the crowd may turn into a riotous mob if they are not accommodated, have been noted among military planners in Washington, who by now are very familiar with counterinsurgency planning.\n\nRegardless, we have little reason to fear this protest. On the contrary, a demonstration of public support for interventionist measures may well be to our advantage. In any case, we wish the father well."

 united_states_crisis_events.300.t: "Army Deployed in Washington"
 united_states_crisis_events.300.d: "The growing nationwide unrest has sparked growing concerns in Washington. In the halls of power in Congress and the White House, fears that rioting or armed paramilitary activity could spread to the nation's capital are growing louder and louder, as conflicts elsewhere in the country have grown more and more intense.\n\nAs extremist activity on both the left and right grows, General Douglas MacArthur has recommended the mobilisation of nearby military reserves, including elements of the Maryland and Virginia national guards, in Washington, D.C., in order to maintain order in an emergency or counterinsurgency situation. General MacArthur assures us that the Virginia and Maryland national guards are reliable for the federal government, and with many members of Congress increasingly concerned about the spread of unrest, we are under substantial pressure to heed his advice.\n\nNevertheless, some have expressed concerns that the mobilisation of a substantial military contingent in the capital could increase tensions. Father James R. Cox, the leader of a band of protesters likely to arrive in D.C. in a week or so, has denounced rumours of a military buildup as an overreaction to his peaceful protest movement. Though we recognise the reasons why some may be concerned, the safety of the capital is paramount. We can only hope this serves to cool tensions rather than intensify them."

 united_states_crisis_events.301.t: "\"Cox's Army\" Arrives"
 united_states_crisis_events.301.d: "After spending well over a month gathering and marching in Pennsylvania, Father James R. Cox's “army” of unemployed and destitute protesters have finally arrived in force in Washington. Over 70,000 marchers in what has been dubbed “Cox's Army” have taken to the national mall, demanding public works and unemployment relief. A number of speakers including Cox have addressed the crowd: from both left and right, men of public stature such as Charles Coughlin, Norman Thomas, and others have ramped up the pressure on the administration to take action against unemployment and poverty.\n\nThe scale of the protest has surprised many in the capital. The largest protest in D.C.'s history, the size of the march has generated substantial worry in the administration. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover has briefed members of Congress on the potential that a significant number of socialist agitators have infiltrated the protest movement. He has advised us to keep newly mobilised military forces on high alert, lest the socialists attempt to launch an insurrection.\n\nCox, meanwhile, has seen his profile rise substantially due to his protest movement. With a strong bully pulpit, Cox has gained a far more significant national profile than he held during last year's election campaign. With the protest so far a success, many are now wondering what comes next."

 united_states_crisis_events.302.t: "The Washington Massacre"
 united_states_crisis_events.302.d: "For the first day or so, Father Cox's march on Washington proceeded without significant incident. The marchers gathered in the national mall, listened to speeches by politicians, activists, and other public figures, Peacefully, Pennsylvania's jobless and destitute made their voices heard, and some began to discuss the trek back home.\n\nOthers however were agitated by an apparent lack of progress. Having come all this way, only to hear platitudes and the same empty promises as before, a group of perhaps 10-15,000 marched to Capitol Hill to bring the message a little closer to home for Congress, so to speak.\n\nUnbeknownst to them however, a little over 40 miles away in Baltimore, a maritime strike had turned deadly just four hours before. With strikers engaged in a shootout with the Maryland National Guard, and with rumours that a few Marines had even broken ranks to join them, the feeling among the Army units in the capital itself was tense. With rumours of a nationwide uprising swirling, they faced down the angry protesters approaching the halls of government.\n\nWhat began the shooting is still uncertain. General MacArthur has claimed agitators in the crowd fired at his men. Other parties have claimed that the soldiers fired unprovoked. Some reports have suggested something in-between, perhaps a loud bang in the crowd that prompted a lethal response. What we do know is that nearly a hundred died by the soldiers' bullets, and fifty more were killed in the ensuing stampede as the crowd of thousands fled.\n\nAlready, a nation that was previously on the precipice has been set ablaze. Sympathy strikes and protests have turned riotous in the north, as what appears to be an unprecedented wildcat general strike brews among the IWW, CIO, and even AFL. D.C. itself is now under martial law, with the remaining protesters being herded out, but the rest of the nation has erupted in fury."

 united_states_crisis_events.303.t: "General Strike!"
 united_states_crisis_events.303.d: "The Washington Massacre has, in a matter of days, completely transformed the magnitude of industrial conflict in the United States. More workers went on strike last year than in any previous year in US history. That was projected to be beaten by this year had the trends of January and February continued. None however could conceive of so many workers striking that it would be beaten by March.\n\nThe massacre of the supporters of the moderate Father Cox, a man who is distinctly not a socialist, has all but shattered faith in the existing political system among the strongly labour-oriented left. With the CIO and even certain AFL unions joining IWW workers in sympathy strikes, workers across the country have been pushed to radical action. For the first time in recorded history, a wildcat general strike seemed to be on the cards.\n\nNaturally, the now definitively revolutionised unions filled the vacuum in leadership, taking the reins of the growing movement. Surprisingly, the CIO beat the IWW to the punch in formally calling for a general strike, with CIO President Sidney Hillman inviting his IWW counterpart Elizabeth Gurley Flynn to take part in a joint strike committee. A day later, the IWW accepted, and the SPA unanimously voted to endorse the strike.\n\nThe aim of the strike remains vague, but in general themes of mass nationalisation and union representation in government, as well as the resignation of [USA_Pre_War_President] and his cabinet have been the most coherent demands commonly placed forwards. Of course, neither side now is of the illusion that these are serious demands. Instead, it is clear to all parties involved that the tripartite alliance of the SPA, CIO, and IWW is pushing for nothing short of revolution."

 united_states_crisis_events.304.d: "With the snowballing of the general strike, the nation has quickly been brought to an economic standstill. The industrial heart of the union has either stopped beating or has been turned solely to the purposes of the socialist-dominated de facto dual government which now exists in the states of the Steel Belt. The reaction among other segments of the population has been equally swift: attempts to spread the strike south or west have been met with unceasing violence, both from employers, police, and right-wing militias.\n\nThe nation is on the precipice. Once again, it appears that our house is divided, and civil war appears to be on the horizon. Faced with the prospect of a national calamity, the [USA_Pre_War_President] has decided to take a bold gambit. Declaring his intention to travel on a tour of the midwest to negotiate and talk the strikers down, the President has boarded a train that will take him over the Appalachians, through Kentucky, and into Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois.\n\nReactions from the public at-large have been skeptical, to say the least. Some regard this attempt at negotiation to be the dying gasps of a failed administration. With rumours flying of a mobilisation of national guards in both the north and south however, [USA_Pre_War_President] feels that a gambit such as this is perhaps the only way to prevent a full descent into civil war."

 united_states_crisis_events.305.t: "Disaster on the Railroad"
 united_states_crisis_events.305.d: "Few expected [USA_Pre_War_President]'s goodwill tour to solve the national crisis.\n\nFewer still expected it to end as badly as this.\n\nSomewhere in eastern Kentucky, a bomb went off on the railroad, derailing the [USA_Pre_War_President]'s train. The commander-in-chief's whereabouts are, as of yet, unknown, as though we know the train has been derailed, we have lost any immediate contact with it. Many in Washington have begun to presume the worst however: with [USA_Pre_War_President] potentially dead, the question of whether anyone at all is capable of governing the country has very suddenly emerged.\n\nWith the worst likely having come to pass, General Douglas MacArthur has unilaterally activated War Plan White in Washington D.C. With the support of the conservative plurality in the rump Congress (now lacking Socialists and Farmer-Laborites, among others), MacArthur has assumed a kind of emergency executive authority in the capital.\n\nThis has been denounced vociferously by several groups across the political playing field. Socialists, Longists, and even moderate liberals have all denounced MacArthur's actions as a blatant seizure of power, with many implicating MacArthur in [USA_Pre_War_President]'s disappearance. As the north braces for revolution and the south awaits its Kingfish however, many in Washington see MacArthur as the only figure strong enough to hold the country together."
 united_states_crisis_events.305.a: "Is this the crossing of the Rubicon?"

 united_states_crisis_events.306.t: "The President Lives!"
 united_states_crisis_events.306.d: "A day ago, the nation was rocked by the apparent death of [USA_Pre_War_President], seemingly killed by an explosion on the railroad track on which he was travelling. Today however, a markedly different picture has emerged. [USA_Pre_War_President] lives, and, from a Kentucky radio station, has announced his survival to the world.\n\nWhile it was initially thought that he had perished with the train he was travelling in, in fact he had survived the derailment and fled the scene with his Secret Service entourage, so as to avoid encountering those who had planted the bomb to begin with. After finding refuge in an isolated town without a telephone or telegraph, he requisitioned a few cars and made his way to a larger town with contact with the outside world.\n\nIn the days since he announced his plan to visit the midwest, the national situation has deteriorated further. The general strike thunders on, and militias pop up like pustules in the south. As such, it is likely that [USA_Pre_War_President] will attempt to return to Washington to see the crisis through.\n\nThe question of General MacArthur remains however: having seized de facto power in Washington unilaterally, many now wonder whether MacArthur will relinquish what he has taken. The potential for a confrontation between the Army in D.C. and their legal commander-in-chief looms, adding yet another dimension to the brewing national catastrophe."

 united_states_crisis_events.307.d: "For once, we have had a break of good luck. As the president travels back to Washington, General MacArthur has informed us that the capital has been secured, and that the Army can guarantee the safety of the federal government. Though the words state nothing explicitly, MacArthur's communique is a de facto acknowledgement of the president's authority, and paves the way for his return to day-to-day governance.\n\nRegardless of MacArthur's motivations for unilaterally activating War Plan White in D.C., once the president was revealed to be alive, it soon became apparent that he could not hold on to the power he had briefly gained. Congress' confidence, though shaken, still lies with the legitimate president, and without allies in government willing to back him any potential putsch by MacArthur was dead on arrival.\n\nNevertheless, MacArthur's brief seizure of power has had drastic consequences even outside of Washington. Several prominent military officers have already denounced his actions, while others inclined towards the rapidly militarising radical opposition have taken MacArthur's intervention in civil affairs as licence to use their own forces for political purposes. We may have been spared an American Caesar, but a split army would be the final step towards all out civil war."

 united_states_crisis_events.309.d: "The pushback on General MacArthur's unilateral activation of War Plan White has been swift. Shockingly however, it has come from within MacArthur's own house. In the early hours of the morning, a contingent of Marines, led by General Smedley Butler, marched out of Annapolis towards D.C. This sent the capital into a panic, as Butler's well known socialist sympathies led to rumours that he was planning on seizing power for the Socialist Party. The quick mobilisation of forces in Washington however put paid to Butler's plans. \"Old Gimlet Eye\" apparently anticipated an uncontested seizure of the city. At the prospect of resistance, he instead turned his forces north. By the end of the day, his marines had sailed to Philadelphia, putting the city under martial law and freeing local socialists jailed by the conservative municipal government.\n\nIn a public statement, Butler maintained that his intention was to free D.C. from MacArthur's grasp and to restore the constitution. His actions however have sparked a red scare within the ranks. From D.C., thousands of telegrams have been sent firing \"disloyal\" officers. Mechanized force advocates, the \"Bomber Mafia\" of the air corps, and other midwestern officers are among the most impacted groups. The biggest name of all in the firing line is the (now former) Chief of Naval Operations, Joseph Taussig. These officers however have refused to leave their posts, and many have taken their sacking as permission to openly consort with local socialists. Far from keeping the military in the federal camp, these haphazard purges may just have split it."

In Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio, the socialists have become more militant, overturned unfriendly elements in state and local government, and forced through wide-reaching emergency “reforms” which have undermined core elements of the American political order.\n\nWhere previously a veneer of legality was maintained in their takeover of various states, the past week has seen the socialists openly seize power by force in several states across the steel belt. In Illinois, Red Guards seized the state capital in Springfield, dragging out the legislative opposition and declaring martial law. A day later, a coordinated coup in Indianapolis seized key locations and overthrew the Republican-led state government, in a state where the socialists had not even had a strong statewide electoral showing.\n\nThe grand finale was just a day ago however, when Red Guards and other workers' militias seized key locations in both Harrisburg and Philadelphia, effectively winning the state of Pennsylvania for the Socialist Party. Scenes such as these, unimaginable only a year ago, have become common occurrences, as the hold of the federal government across the entire country shatters.\n\nWith many midwestern military units having openly declared for the socialist camp in recent days, we can only presume that the worse will now come to pass..."

As the president and Congress bicker and fail to come to any consensus, the federal government calcifies, and the states take up the most important tasks of administration.\n\nAcross the nation, forces mobilise against the stillborn administration. John Reed rallies socialist radicals in the north towards revolution, while in the south, the restive forces of reaction prepare to confront it head on. In Washington the threat is from within, as conservative forces begin to whisper that the republic may only be saved by military discipline, and General MacArthur sees himself in their words.\n\nCapitol hill may be deadlocked, but the nation is not inactive, and it will not be quiet."

Across the territories still held by the federal government, militias and bushwhackers clash, with many in the nation's periphery swearing allegiance to John Reed's rebel government. In the south, unrest among African-Americans has swelled. An explosion of racial violence as well as propaganda efforts by the Workers' Congress have compelled several groups of sharecroppers and tenant farmers to rise up in local revolts.\n\nWith Louisiana being a state deeply affected by such troubles, Huey Long has chosen to return home in order to help in restoring order. Sidelined by the recent developments in Washington, Long has, recognising his limited ability to have an important part in the war from the capital, determined that his presence would be more impactful in his home state. The unspoken aspect of his decision, of course, is that he also wishes to prepare the next steps for his political movement, so as to win the White House in 1940.

 united_states_crisis_events.501.d: "After a long and contentious hearing process, the Senate has finally voted to confirm the nomination of Huey Long as Attorney-General. Long's nomination some time ago came as the culmination of the deal made between himself and the President Borah, as in exchange for Long's backing on his domestic agenda, Borah appointed Long to one of the most prestigious positions in the cabinet. Though the Justice Department is not expected to play a huge role in wartime policy, it will importantly be tasked with advising on the legality of wartime policy, including framing important wartime legislation which the president may seek to pass, as well as with overseeing the prosecutions of many reds in federal territory.\n\nAs a controversial figure in the best of times, many conservative and anti-Long senators questioned the ability and suitability of Long to lead the Justice Department. They have called into question his qualifications for the position, (though Long is a decorated lawyer), as well as the circumstances of the \"corrupt bargain\", which supposedly occured between Long and Borah. Some critics also pointed out that Long would now have the ability to block federal investigations into his own party machine in Louisiana, which is infamous for corruption, graft, and even instances of forced labour. There have in turn been concerns that Long will use his position to prosecute political opponents under the guise of national security.\n\nNevertheless, with national unity a valuable commodity, the Senate has approved the nomination.

 united_states_crisis_events.502.t: "The End of the Union Party"
 united_states_crisis_events.502.d: "The beginning of the Civil War has seen the national political landscape shift decisively back in favour of establishment political forces. As the nation unites behind the president and his establishment allies, Huey Long has been forced to adapt to remain politically relevant. The civil war as well has limited the room for any domestic opposition within the “White” camp, as the establishment parties consolidate control over the war effort and suppress out-of-line right-wing radicals.\n\nAs the Union Party was initially a mere electoral vehicle for Long's 1936 presidential bid, it was neither a proper mass party or even a strong congressional one. Many Democrats who endorsed Long's bid for the White House, such as Burton K. Wheeler, declined to identify themselves with it in Congress, instead choosing to remain Long-aligned Democrats. Recognising this, Long has now chosen to fully return to the Democratic fold, once again identifying as a Democrat.\n\nWhat remains is the extra congressional element of the party, mainly consisting of Long's associates in the Share Our Wealth movement and other satellite groups. Most notable among these is Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, the former director of the Share Our Wealth clubs who Long fired just a few weeks ago, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". Since his firing, Smith has started a new organisation called the America First Committee with like-minded former Union Party rightists, such as Charles Lindbergh. Smith and Lindbergh have, as time goes on, increasingly dispensed with Long's economic program in favour of a national populist and laissez faire one, emphasising issues of race to an extent not embraced by Long.\n\nThough this ideological change has given the AFC initial momentum, and rendered it ideologically coherent and acceptable to far-right business interests, it has not succeeded in remaining in the public spotlight. Instead, Long's return to the Democrats has received more attention, as speculation about a presidential bid in 1940 ramps up."

For several months now, the men have been at loggerheads over policy and personality, with many speculating that the feud began long before Borah's death. Long has openly criticised the president's policies in his first months in office, and has been gathering supporters in Congress to voice similar positions. Having grown to see the danger of firing Long as preferable to his continued presence in the cabinet, Roosevelt decided to fire him.\n\nThis has obviously come as no surprise to Long. Anticipating this action, Long, in his first post-firing press conference, excoriated the president for his \"soft\" reconstruction policy and his weakness when dealing with the country's vested interests. Long's obvious posturing towards the presidential election later this year has fired the gun on the likely contest of this year several months early, as both Long and Roosevelt contest for votes among all voting blocs"

Just a few years after a previous assassination attempt at the state capitol, Long was attacked on the grounds outside the capitol building, as he was returning from a meeting of the state legislature.\n\nThe assailant was a man from the town of Bunkie, named David Haas, a Long opponent and the leader of the ironically named \"Minute Men\", a local conservative anti-Long paramilitary formed in 1935 with no relation to Long's own (far larger) Minutemen. After getting two shots out on Long, Haas was in turn shot over 70 times by Long's bodyguards, and he appears to be both dead and badly mutilated.\n\nQuickly, the bodyguards rushed to Long's aid, as he had fallen to the ground in the commotion. With Long's life, the fate of his political movement hangs in the balance, as in spite of the key role it has played in the federal coalition, it is likely to fall apart without its leader. Ultimately, the bodyguards approach Long, lying on the ground."

 united_states_crisis_events.506.t: "Collapse of the Long Movement"
 united_states_crisis_events.506.d: "With the death of Huey Long, the movement surrounding him has suffered a devastating blow. Long's central leadership and force of personality drew together a diverse range of political forces, but now his absence leaves the movement without a unifying figure. Without the link binding them together, the movement, arguably already cut down to size by the departure of its more extremist elements, has begun to fall apart entirely.\n\nThe Share Our Wealth clubs, once the backbone of a true mass movement, have gradually dissovled and withered away. Long's allies in Congress have gone their own way, either directionless or returning to the fold of their established parties. For the first time in years, the Long machine is being challenged in Louisiana, both by the old bourbons and newer reform candidates. No candidate from what remains of the Long faction has the sort of stature needed to make a bid for the presidency.\n\nThe administration has watched the events following the assassination with relief. Fears of an upsurge in retaliatory violence failed to materialise, and the closing of the possibility of another Long bid for the presidency comes as a relief to everyone on Capitol Hill. It appears that Longism is likely to be consigned to the dustbin of history, much to the pleasure of the establishment it ultimately failed to overcome."

 united_states_events.1001.d: "After nearly two months of uncertainty, there is finally a winner in the drawn-out US election. A dark horse candidate in an age on uncertainty, Floyd Olson has won the Presidency in the House of Representatives, with the support of his Farmer-Labor Party, as well as progressive Democrats and Republicans. The Farmer-Labor campaign leaned heavily the party's controversial coalition with the Socialist Party of America, an alliance which has paid off with the groundswell of activist support it has provided.\n\nOlson boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from the establishment hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, protecting the rights of organised labour, and establishing a "cooperative commonwealth" in the United States."

In a stunning victory from behind, Huey Long of the Union Party is the 31st President of the United States, the second in a row elected in the House of Representatives, this time with the support of the Democrats, his own party, progressive Republicans, and moderate Farmer-Laborites.\n\nHuey Long is famous for his successful Governorship of Louisiana, but he has received much criticism for his authoritarian tendencies, pie-in-the-sky \"Share Our Wealth\" agenda, and his association with the violently anti-socialist \"Minutemen\" paramilitaries. Nonetheless, he enters office with a mandate to radically transform America."

 united_states_events.1003.d: "With the political and economic situation in the United States deteriorating throughout the past year, it was widely expected that this year's presidential election would not result in a decisive winner in November. Indeed, with the vote split between four significant parties, no candidate was able to reach an Electoral College majority, just as was the case four years ago.\n\nWhat was not expected was the disasterous performance of the Democratic Party: coming in fourth place, they will be excluded from January's contingent election, leaving the Republican and Farmer-Labor candidates to compete with Huey Long for the support of Congress to decide who will be elected the next President. The nation, and the world, awaits that decision with bated breath."

With the support of an establishment coalition in Congress, Republican Senator William Borah has clinced the Presidency for the GOP.\n\nA venerable political titan, Borah is one of the last progressive Republicans of Theodore Roosevelt's generation. Remaining true to his maverick progressive principles, Borah overcame a substantial challenge from the GOP establishment to win the nomination, promising government relief without radicalism.

American newspapers report that Huey Long's car and all of his bodyguards disappeared after a late night dinner in the new capital city. From what we can gather from the papers, an unidentified group of professional syndicalist assassins were behind this attack. This comes after the high profile slaying of industrialist Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, by an anarchist.\n\nAmerican Legion commander George Van Horn Moseley addressed the public's concerns, saying that he will occupy the Presidential Mansion in order to uproot any potential conspirators and has mobilised the Legion to defend venerable Congressmen in this dangerous time."

Such an outcome was not to be however: the House failed even to elect a Speaker, resulting in a state of complete deadlock in both houses which has prevented the election of either a president or vice president.\n\nWith neither a president nor vice president having been elected, it appears as if the Presidency will, for the first time, become vacant on January 20th.

 united_states_events.1014.d: "Since the beginning of the decade, Harlan County, Kentucky, has been embroiled in conflict. The IWW and other unions have attempted to organise the miners of the country, facing steep, and often armed resistance from local authorities and company forces. This week, fighting in the county came to a head, with a pitched battle in the town of Harlan. The result was the routing of the union militia, with the massacre of over 600 miners by anti-union forces. With this, the town has been fully cleansed of the IWW for the time being.\n\nAlready, the massacre has caused an increase in civil disturbances in the United States, with many northern industrial cities seeing rioting in solidarity with the martyred miners."

The IWW and other unions have attempted to organise the miners of the country, facing steep, and often armed resistance from local authorities and company forces.\n\nThis week, fighting in the county has escalated, as the union militia seized control of much of the town of Harlan east of the Cumberland river. Anti-union forces have retreated to the town's National Guard depot. Though the unionists have not fully captured the town, the escalation in fighting, which has left dozens dead in the past month, is reminiscent of the brutal Mingo County War of 1923, and has already resulted in unrest across the United States."

Having routed anti-union forces from Harlan, they moved to capture other parts of Harlan County, taking up positions in the Cumberland River Valley before proclaiming a local commune. Already, the crisis in Harlan is shaping up to be even worse than the Mingo County War of 1923, as socialists in large northern cities march in solidarity with the \"Harlan Communards\"."

With the end of the crisis, however, came an erosion of support as democrats and hardliners argued over whether the President ought to step down.\n\nToday, these arguments have been decisively settled as Douglas MacArthur has announced his intent to resign the Presidency and allow free elections immediately. Already, celebrations have been held in major cities across the country as many rejoice at the return of American democracy, though others worry what precedent the General's actions might set for the future."

 USA_floyd_olson_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 13th, 1891, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America§!\n§YBackground:§! §LFloyd B. Olson was never supposed to become President of the United States. Born to a Norwegian father and a Swedish mother, Olson grew up serving as a shabbos goy for the local Jewish community on the north side of Minneapolis, then briefly working for the Northern Pacific Railway. This was before dropping out of university and heading west to work odd jobs in Canada and Alaska, and then Seattle where he joined the Industrial Workers of the World for a time, picking up a quasi-socialist ideology he would hold throughout his life. In 1913 he returned to Minnesota to study law, and became the Hennepin Country attorney by 1920. He became known as a tough prosecutor, taking on corrupt businessmen, the Ku Klux Klan, and the conservative Minnesota Citizens Alliance after the latter hired a hitman to blow up the home of a union leader. During this time, Olson aligned as a Progressive, a Democrat, and eventually as a nominee for what was then called the Working People's Nonpartisan League - and was rewarded when he became that party's first governor of Minnesota.\n\nWhen his party became the state section of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1930, Olson immediately became a leading figure of the non-socialist wing of that party, and was nominated in 1932 as its first presidential nominee. A historic first-time showing under Olson allowed him to win a Senate seat in 1934, and allowed him to remain a credible option for the presidency in 1936.\n\nAfter much hand wringing, on the back of a coalition of the congressional left, Olson has now become the first president elected from neither of the major parties since Zachary Taylor in 1848. His election was the least of his struggles however: now Olson must manage a fractious coalition that includes both moderates and a radical Socialist Party which remains committed to revolution. With rumours of ill health swirling around him, it remains to be seen if Olson can walk the tightrope...§!"

 USA_al_smith_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 30th, 1873, in New York City, New York, United States of America§!\n§YBackground:§! §LAlfred Emanuel Smith began his career as a climber. A working class Irish-American with little formal education, he clawed his way up the ranks of municipal and state politics, relying on his wits and oratory skills to push himself forward. Though he emerged as a creature of Tammany Hall, he was never connected to the notorious corruption of the machine. After years of steady climbing as a progressive reformer, he was elected Governor of New York in 1918.\n\nThroughout his tenure, he fought for civil service reform and workers' protections, and his ambitions soon turned to national politics. With the nation in the midst of depression, the lane was wide open for Smith to take the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 1928.\n\nWhile his presidency initially brought about widespread optimism that better days were ahead, such feelings were short-lived. Though Smith succeeded in preventing a total collapse in the nation's banking system in 1929, the Creditanstalt collapse and subsequent recession in 1931 put a halt to the limited progress towards recovery made in Smith's first term.\n\nAs the depression continued, and Smith's administration failed to construct a strong narrative of recovery, discontent with mainstream politics grew ever stronger. The Democrats' hold over congress became weaker with every election, as Smith was only barely re-elected in the House of Representatives. His once strong popularity has fallen greatly, as he comes to represent the malaise that has consumed the nation since 1925.\n\nNow Smith is but a lame duck. Challenged both from within and outside his own party by radical forces, he is resigned to ensuring his exit from office is as successful and dignified as possible. With the crows circling the Democratic Party however, the American people wait with trepidation to see what comes next...§!"

After a stint in New York, Vandenberg settled home to edit and publish the Grand Rapids Herald, aligning the paper's editorials with Theodore Roosevelt-style progressivism, even as he supported Roosevelt's opponent, incumbent William Howard Taft, in the GOP primary of 1912.\n\nAfter gaining for himself a substantial profile, Vandenberg was often touted as a potential Republican candidate for high office. In 1928, he was appointed to fill a vacancy to one of Michigan's US senate seats. In spite of the general GOP drubbing that year, Vandenberg survived the special election to retain his seat, in part thanks to Socialist vote-splitting.\n\nIn the senate, he gained a reputation as a conservative, though a moderate one. He agreed with many of the measures President Smith took to restore economic confidence, as well as his reluctance to resort to any radical spending measures. Though he was touted as a potential candidate for President in 1936, he declined to throw his hat in the ring, fearing that, as a conservative, he might throw the nomination to the progressive William Borah.\n\nIt was in the months following the election that Vandenberg attached himself to Douglas MacArthur's cause, helping to rally congressional legitimacy to the federal government during the Civil War. Allied to MacArthur on the basis of a democratic restoration after the war, Vandenberg has now been rewarded for his loyalty both with that promised restoration, and with the presidency.\n\nWith the country still in ruins, Vandenberg must now manage a more arduous reconstruction than that after the first civil war.

It was Lucas' brother Thurman, however, who pushed the young man into politics. Working various odd jobs to get himself through college, Wike graduated in 1914, opening a law practice in Havana, Illinois. In a few years, he had established himself as a \"first rate\" country lawyer, serving as a state's attorney for five years in the 1920s.\n\nWhen his political idol, Democratic congressman Henry T. Rainey, passed away in 1934, Lucas won the following election to his seat. In Congress, he supported President Smith's agenda, opposing the rising Farmer-Labor and Socialist parties while pushing for government relief for workers and farmers. With the outbreak of civil war, Lucas remained loyal to the Federal Government, and soon was elevated to the Senate.\n\nThough the Democrats were not lacking in candidates, their liberal wing was weakened both by the Smith years and the Civil War. With the election of Lucas, they hope for a revival. A prominent leader from the formerly radical midwest, Lucas hopes to bring the region back into the fold of a moderate and sensible liberal Democratic Party, on a platform of labour rights, government supports, and civil rights for African-Americans.§!"

Overcoming a tumultuous early childhood, Douglas earned a PhD in economics in 1921 from Columbia University, beginning a career in academia. With his wife, a fellow PhD holder, Douglas moved six times between 1915 and 1920. After spending much of the 1920s back in Massachusetts, Douglas divorced his wife and returned to Chicago, where he became increasingly involved in politics.\n\nIn 1933 he was a supporter of the \"Chicago Plan\", which proposed to eliminate private bank money creation through fractional reserve lending in order to prevent another lending induced depression.Associated with the Farmer-Labor Party, Douglas became one of their leading non-Socialist figures in municipal politics, serving on the last pre-war city council. As the provisional Workers' Congress dissolved the municipal government and installed the Chicago Commune in its place, Douglas spent the war as a private citizen in Red territory.\n\nThough he was a leftist, he soon became critical of many of the policies of the Socialist Party and IWW, leading to him being quickly reconstructed after the end of the war. Douglas served as an important link in post-war Chicago between the formerly Socialist masses and the resurrected Democratic Party, which he joined. After a few years as an alderman, Douglas won the Democratic primary for the Senate. After a campaign in which many a bloody shirt was waved, Douglas won in an upset.\n\nNow a mainstream liberal, Douglas emphasised both government supports and fiscal discipline. An opponent of pork barrel spending and a supporter of civil rights legislation, Douglas was soon regarded as a potential candidate for the presidency. Now, on the back of an eclectic coalition of ex-Socialists, ex-Longists, good government liberals and progressives, Douglas is in the White House, perhaps a sign that the divides of the Civil War have finally healed.§!"

It was the outbreak of the European War which made Hoover famous however. His success as chairman of a committee organised to ensure the safe return of 100,000 Americans stranded in Europe in 1914 allowed him to establish the Commission for Relief in Belgium. From 1914-1920, through entirely voluntary efforts, nearly 10 million people in occupied Belgium and northern France were fed by his organisation.\n\nHoover's sterling reputation as a humanitarian set him up well for a potential political career. Though his name was floated as a potential cabinet pick, Hoover was preoccupied with further aid projects in Europe. With the onset of the Great Depression, Hoover turned his focus back home, organising charitable aid to Americans facing food insecurity. Such actions raised his profile further, and in 1928 his name was placed into nomination at the Democratic convention.\n\nThough Al Smith was ultimately nominated and elected, he appointed the popular Hoover as his Secretary of Commerce. Hoover leveraged his department for disaster relief and other regulatory initiatives intended to mitigate the depression. Though Smith's popularity fell, Hoover's remained strong, and he was perceived as a strong potential candidate in the 1936 election, though he refused to run under his unpopular party's banner.\n\nHaving exited office with Smith, and spent the Civil War in numerous humanitarian positions, Hoover's election as President represents the turning of a new leaf. The main member of the Smith Administration to keep his reputation in-tact, Hoover was elected with the expectation that his years of humanitarian experience would make him an able president during reconstruction.

Raised in Marietta, Ohio, and finally studying and settling down in Kansas, Landon eventually acquired substantial personal wealth as an oil producer, and became a major figure of the national oil lobby - a group attacked by both the left and right. A supporter of Teddy Roosevelt's Progressive Party and his 1912 election bid, Landon eventually became the leader of the Kansas liberal Republican caucus. In 1932, he was elected as the Kansas state governor in an exceptionally tight race, and narrowly won re-election 2 years later, building a reputation as a soft-spoken reformist Republican in a time where they are becoming an increasingly rare sight.\n\nLandon was backed by the Republican party machinery as a centrist against party insurgent William Borah. Though he was not as radical as Borah, it was expected that he would be able to appeal both to the national mood for reform and the natural conservatism of Americans. Though the Republican Party had not gained substantial popularity during the Smith years, Landon was still considered a favourite for election. Such expectations have now finally been confirmed in the House, as, Landon was elected by an establishment coalition to serve as Smith's successor. In the White House, the President carries a unique political position, a man who is fiscally conservative yet receptive to government intervention: a figure of business interests who is still a supporter of labour unions.\n\nFor the second time, a Republican stands before a house deeply divided - and President Landon has some very large shoes to fill.§!"

Moving west, initially to Kansas and then to the boom town of Boise, Idaho, he settled and became an attorney, involving himself in state Republican politics. In 1896, Borah joined many of his fellow state party members in abandoning the GOP ticket in favour of William Jennings Bryan's platform of Free Silver, the first of many maverick acts towards the party leadership. Soon, he gained acclaim for his aggressive prosecution of union leaders Paul Corcoran and Bill Haywood, each in separate murder cases.\n\nAs a progressive insurgent in the Senate, Borah supported Roosevelt in 1912 over Taft, opposed US entry into the European War, and supported women's suffrage. Critical of the McAdoo, Lowden, and Smith administrations, Borah hoped to make a serious run for President in the 1920s and ‘30s, but only succeeded in 1936: With conservative Republicans in turmoil, and the nation in a radical mood, Borah was able to clinch the nomination, and win the presidency with the support of house and Senate Democrats.\n\nBorah represents the last great hurrah of Roosevelt-style progressivism. Though an opponent of Smith's economic policies, Borah favours a far more decentralised model of progressivism than either the Farmer-Laborites or Huey Long. His stringent support for states' rights has won him both praise and scorn, with his \"lily-white\" attitude towards civil rights earning him condemnation from the GOP's traditional African-American constituents. With the nation of the precipice, it remains to be seen whether the \"Lion of Idaho\" is the right man to lead the United States out of its current storm.§!"

Elected to the U.S. House in 1906 at 35, on the Ways and Means Committee Hull was a fighter for low tariffs and an income tax, aligning broadly with the policies of fellow southerners Woodrow Wilson and William Gibbs McAdoo.\n\nAfter a brief stint out of Congress and as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Hull was entered into nomination at the 1928 Democratic National Convention. It was that year however that he was elected to the Senate, where he gained a seat on the Committee on Foreign relations.\n\nHull's big break came upon the departure of President Al Smith's first Secretary of State, James A. Reed. Hull was nominated as Reed's replacement, and as Secretary of State pursued lower tariffs (in spite of Smith's reluctance), a relaxed policy in Latin America, and, controversially, recognition of the Union of Britain.\n\nThough his name was again put forward in 1936 for the presidency, the Democratic nomination instead went to Vice President Joe T. Robinson. Mainly focused on the American response to Black Monday and its domino effects, Hull was shocked when Congress fell into deadlock in early 1937. With no new president having been elected, Smith's term was to expire, and the Secretary of State was to become acting president.\n\nForgoing the convention that the president's cabinet departs from office with him, Hull has remained in office past January 20th to maintain some semblance of continuity of government. As acting-president, his position is widely recognised, even by himself, as untenable, and as the nation falls into further chaos it is likely that he will give way to a force more capable of restoring order.§!"

He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made him a possible dark horse candidate for the Democratic nomination, and he served well during the 1940 campaign and afterwards, when his easy mannerisms and propensity for a drink won him favour with the press.

He followed his father into a career in law, being admitted to the Ohio bar in 1913 with the best test scores in the state. Dedicating the next few years to his legal practice, Taft served a brief stint in Washington as part of the legal staff for the Food and Drug Administration where he met his idol, Herbert Hoover. While in Washington, Taft grew to despise government inefficiency, an attitude he carried into the Ohio House of Representatives in 1920. His time in Ohio saw him become a leading figure of the Ohio Republican Party's conservative faction and a vigorous opponent of the Ku Klux Klan, famously voting against a Klan-sponsored bill to ban dancing on Sundays and opposing another bill requiring Ohio public schools to read ten Bible verses daily. Throughout his career, Taft has ardently championed the superiority of private initiative over nearly every sphere, and became one of the greatest enemies of Ohio's socialists.\n\nDespite his lacklustre speaking ability, Taft's local notoriety and status as head of the political dynasty turned into national fame, then to the Republican nomination for President, and then to the White House. President Taft, now known as \"Mr. Republican\", wields great influence over the party machinery and country clubs across the country and marks himself as a supporter of small government, a sceptic of foreign adventurism, and a defender of individual rights.§!"

Soon after graduating from Indiana University and being admitted to the bar, Halleck became the prosecuting attorney for Indiana's 13th district court. Halleck's formal entry into politics only came in 1934, when he was chosen to take the seat of an incoming Republican representative who had died less than two weeks after that year's midterm elections. Halleck was only in Washington for two years before the Second Civil War broke out, but he saw enough to determine that compromise with the radicals was useless at best and un-American at worst. The young representative doggedly supported the Federal war effort, but eventually made waves by declaring that emergency price controls and rationing should be rolled back as soon as possible - he argued that Americans should \"live again as God meant them to live\", and not as some Washington bureaucrat did.\n\nThroughout his career, Halleck has defined himself as an ardently conservative Republican, scoffing at the party's Eastern establishment and their calls for moderation. To him, Americans didn't fight two civil wars just for the government to micromanage their lives - they fought for the freedom to live as they pleased, and their right to live under a government that holds this freedom sacred. Ushering a new generation of post-war politicians, President Halleck has made it clear that his sole mission is to ensure that America will be free for decades to come.§!"

After two terms at the state level, he was elected to national office in 1902 with the backing of the white landowners that control voting in South Texas. In the three decades since, Garner has marked himself as a supporter of a federal income tax, rural investment, a balanced budget, and the machinery that has, up to now, maintained Democratic dominance over the South, all combined with a larger-than-life personality that endears him to both farmers and Southern magnates alike.\n\nThis is the wave that has sent Garner to the presidency.

Stassen played a leading role in the creation of the Young Republicans committe in Minnesota in the years leading up to the Civil War, just as the Farmer-Labor Party was strengthening its grip over the state.\n\nThe outbreak of war however interrupted Stassen's career. Stassen, refusing to serve the Reds who took control of the state, fled to Federal territory, where he enlisted. Stassen served out the war with distinction, and when hostilities ended he returned to Minnesota to play a leading role in its reconstruction. Elected as the state's first post-war civilian governor, Stassen helped to rebuild the state while passing several important reforms. Civil service reforms helped dismantle the patronage system established by Floyd Olson, and he cooperated with other midwestern governors on farm issues. He also established the Interracial Commission, the first civil rights organisation of Minnesota.\n\nAs a result, Stassen's approval ratings skyrocketed, reaching as high as 91 percent in one poll. Stassen's ambitions soon turned towards the presidency, and many national GOP leaders regarded him as a serious contender in more than one election cycle.

By the 1920s, he was already the youngest Major General in the United States Army and the super-intendant of West Point, which he reformed to address the changes in modern warfare since the Weltkrieg. After service in his old academy, he returned to his second home, the Philippines - but his time there was brief, as deteriorating situation in the United States forced him to return in 1930.\n\nAs political battles raged in Congress and behind closed doors, MacArthur's name kept being mentioned as a blessing or as a curse - everyone knew of his persona, and everyone knew what it stood for. To imagine that the United States Army could intervene in civilian politics, undermine democracy, as if it was some tinpot Latin American dictatorship and not the birthplace of democracy... was a hard pill to swallow for many in the upper echelons of government. President Smith found himself relying upon MacArthur's strongarm control of the army more and more to prevent a collapse of order, and now that he's gone, the General made no surprises and did exactly what was foretold.\n\nWrapping himself in the corpse of American democracy, MacArthur now commands a junta of conservative politicians and business interests to defend the America they hold dear from everyone on the political spectrum.

Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911.
