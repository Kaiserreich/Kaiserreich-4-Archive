### Renaming Events ###

 gru.1.t: "Democratising Our Administration"
 gru.1.d: "In order to break with the old reactionary regime we must get rid of their influence in every corner of our new nation. The administration needs to be democratised, the teachers re-educated and the army restructured. A part of this process is to remove the honours they have awarded to jingoist slaughterers like Otto von Bismarck and Paul von Hindenburg, with the greatest examples being the countless Bismarck memorial towers all over our nation as well as the city of Hindenburg. Our president has come forward with the suggestion to name it in honour of Karl Marx, while the locals preferred to keep the preposterous name."
 gru.1.a: "Rename it in honour of Karl Marx."
 gru.1.b: "A name to represent its industrial background."

 gru.2.t: "Restoring the Old Order"
 gru.2.d: "After defeating our socialist foes it is time to restore order on the local level as well. Their regime changed the names of the places, streets and boulevards named after heroes of our nation, because they were deemed unrepresentative or counter-revolutionary. Their original names shall be restored."
 gru.2.a: "It shall be Hindenburg forever."

 gru.3.t: "German Request for Independence"
 gru.3.d: "The German government has spent a significant amount of time building itself up. For once, it seems like that it is no longer being regarded as a client state of ours. Perhaps it is finally time we fully grant them independence, free from our oversight."
 gru.3.a: "They have earned it."
 gru.3.b: "The Germans cannot be trusted."

 gru.4.t: "Operation: Bruder"
 gru.4.d: "Our client state in Germany has been attempting to foment a revolution in Austria lately. Their actions are sure to bring about a war between them and the Austrians. We should consider whether we are ready for such a war."
 gru.4.a: "Approve the operation."
 gru.4.b: "Tell them to stand down."

 gru.5.t: "Operation: Vetter"
 gru.5.d: "Our client state in Germany has been attempting to foment a revolution in Poland lately. Their actions are sure to bring about a war between them and the Polish. We should consider whether we are ready for such a war."
 gru.5.a: "Approve the operation."
 gru.5.b: "Tell them to stand down."

 gru.6.t: "Operation: Schwester"
 gru.6.d: "Our client state in Germany has been attempting to foment a revolution in Prussia lately, attempting to stoke the flames of German reunification. Their actions are sure to bring about a war between them and the Prussian government. We should consider whether we are ready for such a war."
 gru.6.a: "Approve the operation."
 gru.6.b: "Tell them to stand down."
