### Characters ###
 BAH_carlos_marighella: "Carlos Marighella"
 BAH_carlos_marighella_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 5th, 1911, in Salvador, Bahia, United States of Brazil\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gCarlos Marighella hails from a poor family of Italian father and Hausa mother, and since his early years he was a talented student, notorious in his school for his skills with verse and prose alike, but he soon turned into politics, becoming involved in the constant confrontations that occurred between syndicalists and integralists in downtown Salvador. While he was arrested a few times, he did manage to be elected a representative in 1936, albeit that was a relatively short lived state of affairs, as he grew frustrated with his inability to actually make a difference in the station. This certainly is not the case as head of state in Bahia, where he has received support from many of his former Brazilian comrades to step up and lead the newly established commune to prosperity and socialism. However, his already old enemies in the oligarchic families of the state must be dealt with before any of these dreams can be realised."

 BAH_aliomar_baleeiro: "Aliomar Baleeiro"
 BAH_aliomar_baleeiro_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 5th, 1905, in Salvador, Bahia, United States of Brazil\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gAliomar de Andrade Baleeiro graduated from university in 1921 with a degree in law, as is all too common in Bahian politics. Having worked on several different newspapers before starting his political career, he acted as both a state and federal representative in the old political order, never having reached the heights he seeked. Now, with the status quo completely destroyed by the conflict that ended Brazil, Aliomar has positioned himself not only to be the first president of an independent and free Bahia, but also to curtail the clout of many of his long standing political opponents while increasing his own. Many believe that this is but the first step towards the beginning of a brand new political dynasty in Bahia."

 BAH_luis_viana_filho: "Luís Viana Filho"
 BAH_luis_viana_filho_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 28th, 1908, in Paris, Seine, French Republic\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gHaving, like most politicians in his state, graduated in law school, he shifted his career towards journalism, working for multiple important newspapers in the area. Elected a representative in the 1930s, his career has steadily increased his clout, and he managed to place himself in a position to present himself as the leader of a stable, independent Bahia to the occupiers who then held Salvador. A man believing in aggressive and decisive action in politics, Luis plans to push an intense industrialisation programme in the newly independent republic."

 BAH_jurandir_bizarria_mamede: "Jurandyr Bizarria Mamede"
 BAH_jurandir_bizarria_mamede_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 27th, 1906, in Salvador, Bahia, United States of Brazil\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gFrom an early age prepared for a military career, gaining minor positions in the local infantry regiment by 1927; and such, he is a veteran officer of the interstate war. He then was transferred to several garrison and military police commands, always serving with distinction and climbing the ranks of the military by his own merits. While many defeated officers have chosen to shy away from public duty after the devastating that so recently ended, Jurandi has chosen to embark into the political arena, as he sees himself in the best position to re-establish the rule of law and order to the newly established Republic of Bahia. He takes a particular dislike of syndicalists, and this distance is by no means secret and quite a few of these politicians have pre-emptively left Bahia before he can decisively move against these traitors."

 BAH_artur_neiva: "Artur Neiva"
 BAH_artur_neiva_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 22nd, 1880, in Salvador, Bahia, Empire of Brazil\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gArtur Neiva is an extremely renowned and respected scientist, whose forays into politics are fairly recent, being appointed to administrative positions in the Bahian government of the early 1930s in the wake of the interstate war. While his experience in political matters is mostly practical in terms of bureaucracy, he is known worldwide for his studies and scientific expeditions in the US, Argentina and the hinterlands of Bahia and other Brazilian states, which helps with the international standing of the newly founded republic, seeking to improve its situation through proven science rather than poorly planned idealism. He shares many political beliefs with Monteiro Lobato, and while some call out the eagerness of the pair to work with foreign powers, they believe they do what must be done for the advancement and development of their new nations."
