### Parties ###
 MON_man_intro: "With Mongolia a fragile nation disconnected situated between an aggressive China which saw it as rightful territory, and a disinterested Russia that saw Mongolia as a pawn, various members of Mongolia's own intellectual and religious elite banded together to form two disparate resistance movements following Chinese occupation in 1919. Dubbed the \"Consular Hill Group\", founded by Dogsomyn Bodoo, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Darizavyn Losol and others, it took a stringent socialist bend towards revolution. Running in parallel was that of \"East Khüree\", founded by Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, Damdin Sükhbaatar and Soliin Danzan, which focused more on the nationalist strain of revolution.\n\nFighting a similar struggle and with mutual contacts, the two groups would merge in 1920 into the Mongolian People's Party. Seeing Ungern's autocratic rule, as he had recently deposed the Chinese Garrison, as the most vile display of European Imperialism, the MAN would launch an attempted full scale national revolt against the Mad Baron, only to fail. Inflamed further following the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, MAN would launch a second doomed uprising against Ungern."

 MON_totalist_party: "MAN (Militarists)"
 MON_totalist_party_long: "Mongolian People's Party - Militarists (Mongol Ardīn Nam - Tsergiin üzelten)\n§g$MON_man_intro$\n\nMost sincerely down but certainly not out, MAN has spent the period of time from 1924 onwards slowly amassing military strength and refining their tactics. Aided by clandestine International allies, the \"Militarists\" of the MAN are merely those with a career in the military or security fields of the party. Staffed by the likes of Choibalsan, Demid, and Bumtsend, much of their legacy can be attributed to that of Sükhbaatar, even if he remains distant from the faction.§!\n"

 MON_syndicalist_party: "MAN (Unionists)"
 MON_syndicalist_party_long: "Mongolian People's Party - Unionists (Mongol Ardīn Nam - Kholboony üzelten)\n§g$MON_man_intro$\n\nA most obscure outgrowth of the party following collaboration and proliferation of International readings and media, the \"Unionists\" of the party advocate for the adoption of Syndicalist methods inspired by that of Chinese Syndicalist Party. However with Mongolia's industrial base remaining small, and largely isolated to Urga alone, the \"Unionists\" remain docile, harkening towards Mongolia's own class struggle.§!\n"

 MON_radical_socialist_party: "MAN (Radicals)"
 MON_radical_socialist_party_long: "Mongolian People's Party - Radicals (Mongol Ardīn Nam - Ers üzel)\n§g$MON_man_intro$\n\nWhilst considered to be the \"Radicals\", the clique is perhaps the adopted mainstream of the party in socialist circles. Formed out of the younger, more incensed, party membership, the MAN Radicals call for a total revolution against the old order, and their ranks frequently flirt with that of the Militarists. Overzealous, the Radicals tend to call for a total advance towards Mongolian Socialism, remaining rather cosmopolitan in outlook.§!\n"

 MON_social_democrat_party: "MAN (Moderates)"
 MON_social_democrat_party_long: "Mongolian People's Party - Moderates (Mongol Ardīn Nam - Dundaj üzel)\n§g$MON_man_intro$\n\nThe main strain and dominant component of the MAN's party membership following the 1921 and 1924 Revolutions, the \"Moderates\" remain the faction within the party most capable of holding its disparate parts together. Stewarded by Losol, they have continued the revolutionary struggle for Mongolia's own revolution, and even for that of the cultivation of a democratic system. Undoubtedly not without detractors within the party itself, the MAN Moderates remain dominant purely upon mass appeal and seniority alone.§!\n"

A polite, kind, and respected man, Tseveen himself may not have been born in Mongolia, but he most certainly made his mark. Drafting the MAN's Ten Aspirations, Tseveen has consistently walked the middle road; neither outright social revolution nor a return to the old ways. Gaining much ire for his liberal stance from the leftists within the party, Tseveen's attachment to MAN has declined in recent times.§!\n"

 MON_social_conservative_party: "MAK"
 MON_social_conservative_party_long: "Mongolian Autonomous Federation (Mongolyn Avtonomit Kholboo)\n§gA fairly recent development in Mongolian politics (following the incorporation of Xilingol into the Mongolian State), the Mongolian Autonomous Federation nonetheless can owe its origins to the early 1910s. Following the Xinhai Revolution, the Beiyang Government made its best assurances towards the loyal Inner Mongolian Princes and Nobles (of which were the majority) that their rights, titles, and positions would remain the same. Further establishing three special districts in the western part of Inner Mongolia in 1914, being that of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, the Inner Mongolian Nobles enjoyed a sense of privilege within the Beiyang Government. Resisting the Bogd Khanate's attempts to incorporate Inner Mongolia in 1915, the Nobles of the region would see service in the Beiyang Government as senators, and otherwise played the disparate Northern Warlords against eachother.\n\nClosely following events within Outer Mongolia, the conflict there would soon reach the Inner Mongolian citizens, as Roman von Ungern-Sternberg advanced into Chahar, fighting first the Guominjun, and then the Fengtian Clique. In the destabilising situation, and with Ungern's brutal reprisals against Chinese surmounting, the various Inner Mongolian princes formed two bodies: the Noyodyn Zövlöl and the Mongolyn Avtonomit Kholboo. Aiming to preserve their special privileges and the safety of their citizens, the Mongolian Autonomous Federation is a uniquely Inner Mongolian outgrowth in national politics, led by the Kuomintang connected Wu Heling.§!\n"

 MON_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Noble Council (Noyodyn Zövlöl)\n§gFor many years in Mongolia, the upper classes have always held strong influence in Urga. Mongolia's aristocrats have always had their hand in the runnings of their country, and now is no different. However, ever since Ungern came to power in 1920, the wealth and influence of the aristocrats has been under threat. Ungern has proven in recent years that he does not fear seizing the wealth of these nobles, nor does he fear cracking down on their influence to keep control. Whilst ostensibly keen to feud with eachother and the Lamas over influence of the Outer Mongolian State, the various Nobles alongside their respective Leagues and Banners managed to dash their differences in light of a greater foe.\n\nIn 1927, the princes and aristocrats of Mongolia joined together in an organisation titled the Noyodyn Zövlöl. Bringing together the four major leagues of the Northern Desert; the Khan'alin League, the Qiqirlik League, the Chechen League, and the Zakbilaseqin Bidurnuoer League, it also brought together the Khovd Tribes, and the newly incorporated Inner Mongolian Leagues; Jirim, Josotu and Xilingol. Lead by young aristocratic figurehead Prince Demchugdongrub, the Noyodyn Zövlöl are content in their current position, but will be forced to take over should their assets and influence be threatened.§!\n"

 MON_national_populist_party_long: "Buddhist Council (Buddyn Zövlöl)\n§gThe Buddyn Zövlöl is a council of high up, influential Mongolian Buddhist figureheads. It is headed by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, one of the most important lamas in Mongolian and Tibetan Buddhism. Since the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu formed the group to secure Buddhist interests under the rule of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu has stated that the main point of the group is to make sure that when the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu (the spiritual leader of Mongolian Buddhism, the top ranking lama in Mongolia and the reincarnation of the Bogd Khan) is of age, Ungern will give up his role as regent and allow the true leader of Mongolia to take the reins.\n\nUnder the surface however, the Buddhist Council also serves as the most concentrated exertion of the influence of the Lamas within Mongolia. Having long feuded with the Nobles and Princes, and fearful of both the MAN and of Ungern, they nonetheless remain steadfast in their influence on the young 7th Changkya Khutukhtu. If Ungern does not willing relinquish his role as Mongolia's \"protector\", then the Buddhist Council are prepared to vanquish the White Russian, should thier action need it.§!\n"

 MON_mln_long: "Mongolian Liberal Party (Mongolyn Libyeral Nam)\n§gWhilst owing its origins similarly to Mongolia's foremost Revolutionary Party, the Mongolyn Ardīn Nam, the Mongolian Liberal Party could not be any further diverted from the mainstream of revolutionary thought. Carried forward by the respected and admirable Jamsrangiin Tseveen, the MLN is the youngest and first party to be born from Mongolia's democratic experiment. Developed after Tseveen consistent disillusionment with the more radical elements of his old party, Tseveen officially broke with his comrades following the success of MAN's revolution, seeing no need to maintain Party cohesiveness.

 MON_paternal_autocrat_party_sternberg_long: "Russian Military Clique (Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika)\n§gCentred around the enigmatic, polite, eccentric, and brutal dictator of Mongolia, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the stupendously dubbed \"Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika\", or Russian Military Clique, by native Mongolians is the direct circle of the \"Mad\" Baron. Having successfully gained control of Mongolia in 1920, after moving into Urga with his Asiatic Cavalry Division and brutally forcing out the Chinese with the blessing of the Bogd Khan, the Russian Military Clique became, insofar as observers are concerned, the dominant military force within Mongolia. Aiding in Ungern's callous and cruel eradication of Mongolia's Jewish population alongside the Chinese and putting down both of the Mongolian People's Party's revolts, the RVK has gained much ire amongst the Mongolian populace.\n\nEven as far as Russia is concerned, the RVK are but a useful pawn to ensure a compliant Mongolia, even it is unlikely Ungern is to ever return. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Ungern became permanent regent of Mongolia, waiting for the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu to be found. Having been found in Tibet in 1933, Ungern moved the boy to Mongolia, having him installed as Khan. Ungern continues to dominate as regent, as was stipulated by the Bogd Khan himsefl. He has utilised his tenure in Mongolia to strengthen the Khanate, its traditional values, and excise all enemies of the Khan from Mongolia. Egalitarian yet cruel, and harkening towards a bygone era, the Russian Military Clique is by far an extension of one man's lone romanticism in the modern age.§!\n"

### Ideas ###

 MON_scourge_of_the_steppes_idea: "Scourge of the Steppes"
 MON_scourge_of_the_steppes_idea_desc: "Mongolia as it is presently is a nation of very different elements. Fusing Western Political Institutions, Mongolian Theocracy, Qing Imperial Administrative and Political Traditions, Russian Military Training. It is an amalgamation of curious existence and dynamic historical currents. Yet it still remains true to the old ways, and its traditions. Under both the Bogd Khan and presently under the Regency, the usage of cavalry in warfare is extensively encouraged, and the Mongolian Army is mostly comprised of mobile cavalry divisions with supplemental ground forces.\n\nHaving managed to win great victories against the warlords in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, the Mongolian Army has also successfully beaten back Anhui's occupational forces in 1921. Modernised intensely under the auspices of the Russian Military Mission in 1931, and the Baron's own modernisation efforts, it has proven itself to be the most premier military force in the region. Lacking in heavy equipment, the army compensates through training, knowledge of the terrain, and steel-hearted tenacity."

 MON_nomadic_society: "Nomadic Society"
 MON_nomadic_society_desc: "As is traditional for much of Mongolian society, the majority of its population, the Arat, are nomadic, agrarian, pastoral herders and peasants that roam the steppe in disparate and separated bands, or tribes. Even with the increasing cosmopolitanism and urbanisation of the recent decades, many either pay more heed to their local monastery, or remain within their traditional dwellings, Gers. The few notable cities of Mongolia, Mörön, Uliastai, Khovd, Bayan Tümen, and Niĭslel Khüree, are comparable to that of towns or villages within Russia.\n\nCenturies of a nomadic lifestyle has led to a population that have remained mobile, traditional, and in-tune with the land. However it has also resulted in one that tends to resist government attempts to divert them towards the urban centres. Apathetic to politics unless incensed otherwise, they are a key sect of support for both the MAN revolutionaries and the Lamas, albeit they tentatively remain subjects of their local League, or Banner."

 MON_russo_mongolian_trade_agreements: "Russo-Mongolian Trade Agreements"
 MON_russo_mongolian_trade_agreements_desc: "Established following the closure of the Russian Civil War and the resumption of relations between the Bogd Khanate and the Provisional Government, the various economic agreements, trade deals, and resource rights exchanges dubbed colloquially as the \"Russo-Mongolian Trade Agreements\" are series of drafted papers from the Ministry of Finance in [MON.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with both state and private enterprises within Russia. Following the terms of the Kyakhta Treaty of 1915, and further expanded upon in the interwar following tentative \"recognition\" of the Bogd Khanate's independence, these various trade agreements have been a great mutual boon for both Russia and Mongolia.\n\nMaintaining, expanding, and furthering Mongolia's economic development, it has spurned on a series of new settlements, the paving of roads, and the financing of military arsenals, alongside burgeoning native industries. In return, Russia has seen premier privileges on the resources of the steppe, and the two-fold assurance of Mongolia's cooperation, alongside economic subjugation. Even culturally, they have had impact, as Mongolia's nascent Russian community has grown and flourished, both in the borders and within the capital's diplomatic community."

 MON_jebtsundamba_khutuktu_idea: "9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu"
 MON_jebtsundamba_khutuktu_idea_desc: "The 9th Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu, born Jampal Namdröl Chökyi Gyaltsen, is revered as the spiritual leader of Mongolia and is the highest figure of Mongolian Buddhism. Born in Tibet near the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa in 1933, he was recognised by Mongolian Lamas that same year, and transported to the Khanate. The reincarnation of the Bogd Khan, the \"Boy Khan\" is too young to lead the nation, but he still remains a unifying figure. Courted not only by the Baron, the Lamas, and the Princes, his word is ultimately law, even if he must be tutored by the Lamas of the capital at his present age."

 #Occurs to Signal Western Revolt
 MON_western_revolt_idea: "The Western Revolt"
 MON_western_revolt_idea_desc: "Due to the nature of Mongolia's shackling to Moscow, the influx of currency and investment from Russian finances has become practically the lifeline for many within the Khanate. Growing heavily dependent, the simultaneous pulling of both Russian aid and businessmen following Black Monday and the instability within their mother country has resulted in the fundamental collapse of the Western economy. Centred around Khovd, various lamas, warlords, and socialists have risen up in the region, garnering mass support.\n\nWith the allegiance of Uliastai and Khovd being declared for that of the rebels, a civil war has broken out on the steppe. Whilst the military strength of the Khanate and regency is nigh absolute, it is becoming increasingly clear that Ungern's hold on Mongolia — despite its long tenure — is far more capricious than believed. Many of his rivals are no doubt planning to seize the regency, and eject the Baron."

 #Occurs after Squashing it
 MON_western_banditry_idea: "Western Banditry"
 MON_western_banditry_idea_desc: "Despite the government's successes in squashing the main hubs of resistance against the Khanate, the Western holds of Mongolia still exhibit tentative periods of banditry and rabble-rousing. With the replacement of the officials in Uliastai and Khovd, they lack the experience that is custom to their pedigree in the region, and will take time to be able to effectively squash the remaining rebels. Similarly, the administration has been shaken, and the bandits continuously appear, strike, then disappear before either the caravans or Khanate's armies can reach them."

 MON_recovering_from_the_western_revolt: "Recovering from the Western Revolt"
 MON_recovering_from_the_western_revolt_desc: "The Western Revolt of bandits within the country has exacted a heavy toll onto the Khanate. Sweeping rounds of pillaging alongside the turmoil in the Capital and elsewhere has sundered government administrative infrastructure, and will undoubtedly constitute a costly rebuilding process. Depriving the Government of further funding, of which is already hard sought."

 MON_russian_military_mission: "The Russian Military Mission"
 MON_russian_military_mission_desc: "Stewarded by the likes of Nikolay Kazagrandi, the Russian Military Mission has made great efforts and strides in Mongolia since 1931. Modernising its armed forces, establishing armament deals, training officers, establish academies, and even financing some officers to be educated in Moscow, it has resulted in Mongolia's military being able to fight toe-to-toe with the likes of modern forces of the time. Now reignited following the doubling down of Russo-Mongol ties, the military mission hopes to continue its goals of maintaining Mongolian parity with the West, and allow Mongolia to protect Russian assets in the East."

 MON_history_of_conquerors: "History of Conquerors"
 MON_history_of_conquerors_desc: "For long have the Mongol people dominated the dry, flat, and pastoral lands of the steppe. Beginning with the establishment of the Xiongnu Empire two millennia ago, the Mongol people have long understood the quantitative qualities of the lands of which they roam. Utilising it as their greatest strength, they managed to maintain pressure onto various Chinese polities of the ancient era, and consistently stretch far into the lands of Central Asia. Broadly split unto tribes and confederations by that of the Medieval period, they would all be united under Mongolia's greatest, and most impactful, ruler: Temüjin.\n\nExacting his wrath and fury across the steppe, his disparate Mongol Empire would split into various polities after his death, and would fracture even further still. However the impact of Mongol expansion and domain over the steppe changed the trajectory of world history. It is to this legacy that the modern Mongolian state, and military, live up to."

 MON_solidarity_on_the_steppe_idea1: "Solidarity on the Steppe"
 MON_solidarity_on_the_steppe_idea1_desc: "Mongolia need not follow the path of the Russian bear, for it is not her's to take. The Mongolian State exists for the purpose of uniting all Mongol peoples, be it Oirats, Buryats, Khalkha, Inner Mongolians, or Kalymks. To pursue the \"Whole\" Mongolia, we must merely rely upon the strength of the Mongol heartland, for it is an assurance that Russia would not dare allow us to liberate the Mongols under their oppression free of hand. The united Greater Mongolia is but a dream for all Mongols, and has been, and will be, sought after for centuries."

 MON_the_new_mongol_renaissance: "The New Mongol Renaissance"
 MON_the_new_mongol_renaissance_desc: "Despite proclamations to the contrary, the Mongol state and culture is not a unified being. Whilst the Khanate remains the central hub of Mongolian history, it nonetheless must contend with the fact that numerous Mongols reside outwith its territorial constraints, and similarly, lacks the population comparable to these other cultural hubs. Disparately populated, Mongolia's land is more than enough for its people, and whilst we prepare to liberate the Mongols under oppression through force, we can at least begin a cultural renaissance in the meantime."

 MON_a_khanate_united_under_the_sun: "A Khaganate United Under the Sun"
 MON_a_khanate_united_under_the_sun_desc: "The Mongolian nation truly is that of one consistently dedicated and destined towards greatness! Having long been a distinct people, the Mongol people contended with the Manchu, the Russians, the Chinese, the Persians, and every civilisation in-between. Finally, after years of arduous struggle, the Pan-Mongolian project has been fulfilled, and all Mongols are united under the Emperor of the Sun. No longer is the Great Mongolian State that of a khanate, but now, that of a Khaganate. To follow is now a period of reconstruction, rebirth, integration, and tolerance of the many disparate peoples that now contribute that of Greater Mongolia."

 ## Ungern ##
 MON_army_of_the_white_chevalier: "Army of the White Chevalier"
 MON_army_of_the_white_chevalier_desc: "An undoubtedly skilled practitioner of the art of war, Baron Ungern has been instrumental in the modernisation of the Khanate's army. Owing his experience not only to his time on the frontline of the Great War, but similarly to his time in finishing of the Reds in the Russian Civil War, or ejecting the Chinese from Mongolia in 1921, he has developed a wide berth of expertise in strategy and tactics. Trained in and serving with Cossack units during his time in Russia, his Asiatic Cavalry Division won great fame for their exploits in the Civil War and Mongolia.\n\nDisciplined and honourable, he tolerates zero dissent within the army; soldiers and officers must be examples for society to follow. Under his auspices, the Khanate's forces will be the finest the world has to offer."

 MON_at_home_among_strangers_a_stranger_among_his_own_desc: "An eccentric to put it mildly, Ungern himself is that of a romantic knight of the ages. A man destined for the restoration of tradition, monarchy, and order, in an era sundered by progressivism, republic, and freedoms. Acting against the tides of history and the forces of change is but this lone knight, carrying his sabre, his steed, his rifle, and his spirit. Capable of great cruelty, but similarly that of great tolerance, Ungern's charisma and sheer force of willpower has made him an alluring figure for many.\n\nHowever, he is similarly an exile, a pariah. Ejected from the country of which he holds so dearly, Ungern could only watch as it fell into a descent of republicanism. Even now, Russia is not the country it once was, or the one that the Baron had hoped for; permanently scarred by godless socialists. Nonetheless, he has found a land of which he holds dear: Mongolia. A nation of tradition, of faith, and of conquest. Under his regency, the Boy Khan is sure to develop into a great unifying figure for all Mongols."

 MON_remind_them_of_steel: "Remind Them of Steel"
 MON_remind_them_of_steel_desc: "It is the unfortunate nature of politics that individuals are easily swayed; caring far more about personal satisfaction and aggrandizement than that of any servitude to a greater cause or ideal. The masses, they are capable of great force, of great change, of being charged with a mission and seeing it secured. But the elites, their leaders, they but fall to the curse of the human condition. To their own nature, to their fallibility. What is but the due recompense for such acts? For such behaviour? Only one great equalising punishment remains in charge of traitors. The Baron, Court, and Regency, all take no pride in such arrangements, but to secure the stability of the nation, it must be performed."

 MON_the_mongolian_stavka: "The Mongolian Stavka"
 MON_the_mongolian_stavka_desc: "Inspired by the Russian General Staff system, or more specifically Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-chief, the Mongolian military has undergone the introduction of a new high command council into the military structure. Consisting of various directorates, of which the most crucial and important for military matters are that of the Quartermaster General's department, General on Duty department, military transportations department, and the military communications department, it remains centred around Baron Ungern as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Mongolian Armed Forces.\n\nStaffed by the likes of the Russian Military Clique, alongside various notable Mongol commanders, and Princes, it exercises the supreme right to dictate any and all military affairs of the Khanate. Nonetheless, it remains eternally subservient to the primacy of the Monarch in Mongolia, but until the Boy Khan reaches the age of majority, that power of course remains within Ungern."

 ## MAN ##
 MON_the_mongolian_peoples_army: "The Mongolian People's Army"
 MON_the_mongolian_peoples_army_desc: "Born out of the guerilla campaign efforts of the Minister of Defence, and Commander-in-Chief, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the Mongolian People's Army owes much of its legacy to the Khanate's army. Both in serving as a direct continuation of its legacy, and as a result of its continued campaigns against its forces. Under his stewardship, the Mongolian People's Army turned from a mere band of partisans into an adept military force, capable of exercising complete dominion and control over its base areas in the steppe. Never settling down, it focused on mobility and encirclement tactics, almost nigh dwarfing the Khanate's army in responsiveness.\n\nMobilising not only the soldiers, but the people, in a common war against their oppressors, the MPA managed to successfully trump the Khanate's army. Following a directive from the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Party Army has been transitioned into that of the Nation's army. Reorganising the guerrilla units into contemporary formations, the army still maintains its politically motivated roots, with commissars advocating for defence of Mongolia's nascent statehood."

It is true that the Mongolian People's Party was founded on the basis of being a revolutionary movement, one that adopted democratic centralist policies to conduct its continued armed defiance of the Khanate's increasing autocracy, however that was precisely its mission.\n\nA revolt against autocrats and despots of all shades and colours. For the Khanate displayed the initial allure and the great progress that reformist democracy can achieve. So as to even consider falling to such dire, vile, and nefarious methods of the old government is paramount to the smothering of Mongolian democracy in its infancy, and we must exercise our full might to resist the temptation."

Whilst MAN was never a fully dedicated socialist revolutionary party, considering the presence of the Consular Hill group in its formation, it nonetheless pursued a purely revolutionary course. The Army was that of the Party Army, indoctrination to the principles of the Party was imperative to the utmost.\n\nFoolish moderation led to a system by which the common people were oppressed, one in which the Princes and Lamas exacted direct say on government policy, one in which the role of the Great Khural was hollowed out. And so who's to say that Mongolia's new striking modernity should be sundered by party turncoats and closet autocrats? MAN exists to further the people's national revolution and the advance towards the socialist ideal."

However, with the Upper house dominated by the elite and exercising nigh full rights to dictate state policy, the Lower House could naught do nothing but protest.

 MON_revenge_from_the_peoples_apparatus_desc: "Turning course is never an easy task, especially when one is fighting back against the tide of popular socialism. But the futility of struggle towards the socialist ideal is but inapplicable to the Mongolian situation: capitalism has hardly begun to set root, and the people still remain mostly attached to their agrarianism. Of course, some do not desire to hear the truth, and those within the upper echelons of government — the security apparatus, military high command, and elsewhere — most loyal to the nationalist cause of MAN have rallied against the government, decrying it of turning back the clock."

 MON_the_great_equalising: "The Great Equalising"
 MON_the_great_equalising_desc: "The nobility have run the people into the ground, utterly, and incongruously, heading their \"ancient rights\", they have oppressed the people through their monopoly on statecraft. Committing heinous acts not only against the people, but against each other, and the religious clergy, they need not reside upon their wealth any longer. They'll fight back of course, mobilise their Peace Preservation Corps, lambast in the Khural, but it is a necessary price to pay for Mongolia's modernisation."

 MON_releasing_the_torrential_whirlwind: "Releasing the Torrential Whirlwind"
 MON_releasing_the_torrential_whirlwind_desc: "MAN, and Mongolian popular democracy, has become something of the bogeyman in recent times. Declaring two failed revolutions within the span of five years, the Regency harshly cracked down on the revolutionaries, showing their true colours. Denying the people their right to freedom of expression, they were seen akin to bandits, renegades, stubborn fools unwilling to put down arms for the betterment of Mongolia. Similarly, they were seen as proponents of alien concepts from the West, vile, decadent, and unfit ideologies for the Khanate. It will take but a great effort to undo a decade of propaganda, but the people must no longer live in fear of their stewards."

 MON_the_modern_horde: "The Modern Horde"
 MON_the_modern_horde_desc: "Whilst horde is commonly seen as a derogatory term for the Mongolian historical successor states to the Mongol Khaganate, it nonetheless has staying power within the popular conception of Mongolia. An austere, romantic, and traditional land of steppe people, with a strong affinity for the wide expanses of their geography, and the horses that ferry them to, from, and alongside their herds. So as to say harkening towards such a traditional form of mobility, and by extension, warfare, is to secure the Bogd Khanate its military superiority. In conjunction with adopted Russian and Chinese artillery tactics, Mongolia shall rely upon its traditional preference for manoeuvre warfare."

 MON_peace_preservation_corps: "Peace Preservation Corps"
 MON_peace_preservation_corps_desc: "An institution derived from the Inner Mongolian modernisation efforts, and adoption of the Manchu Banner system, the \"Peace Preservation Corps\" is the legal military force of every League within the Mongolian cultural sphere. Led by their elected Jasaghs, they commonly lacked the funding, or equipment, to truly pose as any sizeable threat or foe to an invading power, and typically were wielded for garrison duty, and law enforcement. Now with the Princes having assumed direct control of the nation once more, such efforts are lauded, promoted, and receive additional funding to be on parity with the common army."

 MON_legacy_of_the_five_roads: "Legacy of the Five Roads"
 MON_legacy_of_the_five_roads_desc: "It was not Mongolia's own folly that ceased to realise the unification of the Whole Mongolia after 1911, for this would be a discount of the great heroes who dared dash against the Beiyang Government in 1912, and fought a harsh war of ceaseless victory until 1915. It was only due to the withdrawal of Russian Empire support, from the Tsar that looked down upon the common Mongol, that the heroes of the war were forced into retreat. The Inner Mongolians heeded the call to arms, for it was true that we are one nation from the root, and experience both common joy and sorrow together.\n\nUndeterred from military resistance by the Beiyang's garrison and armies, the five \"roads\", or routes of the Bogd Khanate's army would valiantly stride forward against a force outnumbering them in totality. Lacking modern equipment, the Mongolian forces made up for it in sheer tenacity and mobility, able to successfully divert and avoid the raining artillery shells of the Beiyang forces. Nonetheless, various betrayals by Inner Princes, lacking ammunition, and the adoption of static warfare would see the campaign cease by 1915, and peace negotiations begin.\n\nCombining their historical preference, and success, with mobile warfare, their modern, elite, Peace Preservation units, and the utilisation of heavy artillery practices, the Bogd Khanate's army has truly become that of an unbeatable force, a true terror upon the steppe."

 MON_landowners_rights_enshrined: "Landowners Rights Act"
 MON_landowners_rights_enshrined_desc: "Constituted by the Grand Khural as a priority peace of legislation, the Landowners Rights Act ensures the protection of property under state enforcement, and validates the primacy of the Mongolian landed gentry in their continued dominance of the steppe."

 MON_no_compromise_on_the_spirit_of_nineteen_eleven_idea_desc: "1911 was the grand birth year of the Bogd Khanate, were the shackles of the Qing dynasty were overthrown by the brave khans of Khalkha Mongolia, and wherein they vanquished the remaining Qing forces, and set their eyes upon the true unification of all Mongol people. Yet the state was naïve, lacking in the experience of modern statecraft. Believing in earnest of the Russian support for the Grand Mongolian state-building project. No matter the intentions or designs of Moscow, the Mongolian Khanate cannot allow the sacrifices of its great independence heroes to traverse unnoticed! For as long as there remains the land of Mongols outside the Mongolian state, we shall never compromise on the fiery independent spirit that won us our Independence!"

 MON_a_khanate_of_many_faces_idea1: "A Khanate of Many Faces"
 MON_a_khanate_of_many_faces_idea1_desc: "Mongolia is not a homogenous nations, and the Mongolian is not merely a homogenous people. Various cultural and ethnic groups habit the steppe, and exist in a relative force of harmony. Bound by similar history, tradition, and culture, the Khanate is a rather pluralistic scene wherein Russian, Kazakh, Mongol, Manchu and other cultures intermingle in the estranged nigh cosmopolitanism of the modern Bogd Khanate. Under state directive, such a unique melting pot is to be encouraged, nurtured, and protected."

 MON_defending_our_proud_nation_idea_desc: "The Mongolian nation state is beset on all sides by enemies who would see it torn asunder, or otherwise subjugated under \"greater\" powers. Valuing not its people, its tradition, or its culture, the geopolitical currents of the region have seen Mongolia not as kingmaker, or a valued player, but as a pawn on the broader chessboard. An asset to be negotiated between China and Russia. To truly value both our Independence, and the humble lives by which the Mongol people maintain, it is imperative that we bite, and we hold, and we never let up. For one thread of weakness, and it will be crucially exploited. Mongols must be united by patriotism, faith, and trust in each other, amongst the dark stormy skies of the modern era."

 MON_governance_of_the_spirited_idea: "Governance of the Spirited"
 MON_governance_of_the_spirited_idea_desc: "Mongolia is a deeply religious, trusting, and traditional nation by which the majority of the population practice the principles of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Introduced multiple times throughout history, monasteries are practically the singular building blocks of Mongol society, even in a period of increasing urbanisation and the influence of the modern world. A tradition and corner piece spanning over 400 years of continued presence, Buddhism was once used to cow and control the Mongolian people, however with the primacy of the religious clergy, it can be returned to a state of measured practice, both in private, and stately, affairs."

 MON_strength_in_the_buddha: "Strength in the Buddha"
 MON_strength_in_the_buddha_desc: "The People cannot lose faith, they cannot fall to the temptations of abstinence, or otherwise that of negative affects to their karma. Despite their contention, their belief in the corrupt, cynical nature of the Mongolian theocratic infrastructure and establishment, they nonetheless must believe in the principles of Buddhism. In the cultivation of one's own morality, and the practice of generosity unto others. Through that healthy cultivation, a strong Mongolian state may evolve."

 MON_primacy_of_monastery_teaching_idea: "Primacy of Monastery Teaching"
 MON_primacy_of_monastery_teaching_idea_desc: "Monasteries are the very building blocks of the modern Bogd Khanate. Without the extensive network, wealth, and control by which the monasteries exerted in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Modern Mongol state would be merely that of disparate, disconnected, and unruly Leagues and Aimags, fighting each other equally as hard as their mutual oppressor. The transcendent values of the church travel as far as to be the very birthplace of many of Mongolia's modern cities, and it is under this principle that monasteries must serve a role not only in the present Mongolian state, but in the cultivation of its future. Lamas, lay or otherwise, are wise individuals, learned and studious, it is imperative that they impart their wisdom unto the youth, faithless or otherwise."

Better that I be reborn a creature of hell than that this living being, having committed a deed of immediate retribution, should go straight to hell\". It is true that Buddhism has not stayed the course of incessant pacifism, and continued preservation of one's lands through cultivation of compassion amongst peoples. Finding justification in the scripture and texts for their acts of warfare, various Buddhist sects have utilised the concept of becoming the martyr of the broader people, saving them from condemnation. We must follow in their footsteps, protecting the Bogd Khanate, and saving the soul of others."

 MON_synthesising_the_gelukpa_school_idea: "Synthesising the Gelukpa School"
 MON_synthesising_the_gelukpa_school_idea_desc: "Introduced into the Mongolian lands since the Mongol Empire's first contact with various Buddhist sects in its conquest, Buddhism became an integral part of the Mongolian state through the successive conversions of various Yuan Dynasty emperors to that of Tibetan Buddhism in the 13th century. Starting under Kublai Khan, it furthered not only faith but the modernisation of state systems and infrastructure. Furthering the development and connection between Tibeto-Mongolian cultural exchange, the two countries have commonly been close allies of each other since the 16th century. Constantly changing and modernising with the times, let a new renaissance of Mongolian Buddhism commence!"

 MON_autonomy_for_the_tengri_idea: "Autonomy for the Tengri"
 MON_autonomy_for_the_tengri_idea_desc: "Tengrism (Tengerism), the Shamanistic folk religion of the traditional Mongolia, has long endured a continuous presence not only on the Mongolian steppe, but for all Turkic peoples of the Central Asian Steppe for centuries. Losing prominence, it never truly lost followers or believers. Intermingling heavily with Buddhism, it has become influenced by Buddhist practice, yet it never sought to rival, upend, or overthrow the established Buddhist establishment.\n\nRather unfortunately, it was the establishment itself that sought to eradicate Tengerism, resulting in the creation of \"Black Shamanism\" in opposition to the \"Yellow Shamanism\" that incorporated Buddhist practice. Granting the Tengri their autonomy will allow a flourish of both of our religions once more, cultivating a common identity for the Mongol people."

 MON_respect_for_the_old_mongolia_idea_desc: "The old Shamanistic folk religion of the \"Old Mongolia\" undoubtedly have a lot to teach the various Buddhists within the Khanate. Influenced by the cultivation of Buddhism within Mongolia, \"Yellow Shamanism\" has showcased the ability for the parallel beliefs to integrate, building off of each individual belief system. Through the adoption of mutual ritual practice and traditional customs, Buddhism in Mongolia shall become that of which represents the state in its totality. However we must be mindful, and respectful, of our roots in the Gelukpa School."

 MON_flourish_of_cho_yon: "Flourish of Cho-Yon"
 MON_flourish_of_cho_yon_desc: "Cho-Yon, meaning \"priest-patron\", was the long ancient and bygone relationship established between the descendants of Genghis Khan, and the clergy of Tibet. Guaranteeing their practice and protection from both external and internal threats alike, the Mongolian military would fight for the preservation of Tibet, whilst the Tibetan Lamas would instil within the Mongol elite a sense of legitimacy in both morality and spirituality to their continued rule.\n\nLong have the histories of Tibet and Mongolia been intertwined, stretching from the Mongol invasions, to the Khoshut Khanate, and finally towards the most recent display of mutual relations through the \"Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet\". Securing and recognising the independence of the newly formed polities from the dying Qing dynasty, it cemented their bond within the modern era.\n\nHaving long exercised a form of superiority over Mongolia due to the primacy of the Panchen and Dalai Lamas, Tibet and Mongolia have cooperated extensively, even under the Qing, and will undoubtedly continue to do so as long as the independence of both nations are assured."

 MON_imitating_the_new_army: "Imitating the New Army"
 MON_imitating_the_new_army_desc: "The New Army under the Qing Dynasty was the pinnacle of Qing modernisation efforts for its armed forces. Forming a professional, regular, fully trained and equipped force on par with Western standards, it combatted the incessant corruption that had festered in the old Qing military, and vanquished the inefficiencies and persistent malaise of the previous army's military capacity. However it too suffered under the immense weight of Qing bureaucracy, hesitancy, and incompetency, and whilst it would eventually become the most primary force in all of China, it but merely beget future Warlordism under the Zhili, Anhui, and Fengtian cliques.\n\nMongolia nonetheless has the benefit of hindsight, with decades of experience, understanding, and knowledge to avoid the pitfalls of the late Qing. Upholding the true virtues of the New Army, being that of its vast, rapid, and extensive military modernisation efforts, the old Khanate's army shall be transformed comparable to that of the finest divisions the Chinese army has to offer."

With the successful victory over the Ma Clique, the Chinese are sure to exact their retribution against our mutual gains. If we fight them alone, we could very well see a bleak future. Many of the Chinese polities, warlords, movements, and governments all view our governments as rightful territory, and will no doubt try to reintegrate us. Hoowever, standing together united in brotherhood, perhaps it will dissuade the Chinese from trying."
 MON_attack_the_mas_decision: "Intervene in the Northwest War"
 MON_attack_the_mas_decision_desc: "For many years, tensions have risen between the Ma Clique and Tibet. Skirmishes amongst and over the Kingdom of Nanchen have seen the Tibetans barely hold back the Ma's onslaught. With Tibet being our de-facto allies, and the Mas currently both having prior aggressions against the Khanate, and controlling quantities of Mongolian territory, it is time we helped our Buddhist brothers and secure Greater Mongolia."

 MON_chaos_in_capital_decisions_desc: "With the focus on the rebellion in the West, Urga has been thrown into chaos. The garrison, and the Khanate's army has been mobilised to put down the revolt. However, the long indentured political factions within the capital, and more importantly the court, have laboured heavily under the Baron's regency.

 MON_crack_on_MAN_decision_desc: "The MAN Revolutionaries truly do not understand when their fight is over. Having continuously resisted the Baron's regency since their first \"revolution\" in 1921, they persisted yet again in 1924, and finally, they are attempting their last hurrah to upend the \"autocracy\" that resides within the capital. Their forces may be reputable for their skill, will, and tenacity, but they underestimate the regency."
 MON_bribe_aristocrats_decision: "Bribe Aristocrats"
 MON_bribe_aristocrats_decision_desc: "The perennial and perfidious aristocrats that endure within Mongol society have never truly valued anything more than their own wealth and power.

A broadly fluid group that remained almost parallel in structure til the very last moment, they are the joining of numerous groups united merely by one virtue: nationalism. By tapping into intelligence operatives, we can sprout the seeds of dissent within MAN. Democracy? Socialism? Revolution? Tugged in all directions, they are sure to split apart."

 MON_cede_to_aristocrats_decision: "Cede Power to the Aristocrats"
 MON_cede_to_aristocrats_decision_desc: "Nobles within Mongolia traditionally have exerted power and influence through the control of the Khanate's ministries, government positions, and the military. With the Baron's ascension to the most primary role of the government, at least informally, they have seen their avenues for power reduced every so slowly and subtly. Clearly, they have caught onto the Baron's schemes, and word is amiss that they might lend their support to the opposition. Let us widen the door for them ever so slightly, to tide them over."

 MON_cede_to_monks_decision_desc: "The Lamas within Mongolia have in-fact perhaps been the most premier force for some semblance of normality and government infrastructure amongst the steppe. The monasteries act as a string of pearls, connecting the disparate settlements that have arisen around them. Long respected, revered, and increasingly irate at the reduction of their influence throughout the nation, the monasteries have seen their amassed wealth extracted towards industrialisation and military means.

 MON_contracts_with_tula_arms_desc: "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns. Due to this, the low population, and the harsh conditions, Mongolia's industry is very lacking. Tapping into the connections granted to us by the Russian Consulate, and through the Russian Clique's old circle of comrades, let us engage in diplomacy with Russia's own titans of industry. With their investment and expertise, we are sure to persevere."

 MON_warfare_as_a_way_of_life_desc: "Warfare was once the way of life on the steppe, Undisturbed for centuries under Qing rule, the people put down their force of arms, and integrated into a civil society. Whilst it would be a great sin to forever cast down pastoralism and the traditional lifestyle, we can nonetheless coax a modern esprit de corps within the military establishment; there's no greater guardian for the nation we hold dear."

 MON_grand_flourish_of_the_sabre_desc: "What a sight to behold! A twirl of the sabre, a hoisting of the arm, a call to arms. Such imagery should instigate overwhelming sense of patriotism within our people. For our military heroes! Their sacrifices, their willingness to defend their homeland, to defend all Mongols. It is a grand sight, one that must be captured, and used to further Mongolia's civil militarism. "

 MON_baron_of_the_steppes_desc: "Though wide in expanses, and having long lacked a dominant, uniting force for its people, the Steppe is a tameable beast. The Baron has showcased such a feat like no other. A humble servant, a humble Grand Duke even, of the Boy Khan, he has become akin to that of a Shogun. Serving in the monarch's best interests, Ungern decides the future of Mongolia in this time of great conflict."

 MON_riding_along_the_wide_steppe_desc: "The Russians have forever remained Mongolia's erstwhile allies. Whilst we are certainly no assortment of fools; it is clear they benefit immensely from Mongolia's status as a \"buffer state\", we nonetheless achieve similar dividends. In their protective embrace we have been granted forever Independence, and a bolstered economy. With a resurgent China fast approaching on the horizon, we would be fools to double-cross our ally."

 MON_overtures_to_the_consular_community_desc: "Ever since the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, and that of the First Kyakhta Treaty of 1727, Russia has had an ever increasing presence in Mongolia. Considered part of its sphere for a century, a moderately large Russian population has grown within Outer Mongolia. Centred around the Russian Consulate in the capital, it is time we pay heed to their increasing relevance within the nation."

 MON_heroes_of_the_great_ice_march_desc: "The Great Ice March is that of myth and legend, a heroic dash across the wastes of Russia to plunge valorous bayonets deep into the dark heart of demonic socialists. The heroes of such an escapade are a faltering, increasingly ageing class of brave souls. There is much to be gleamed from their conviction and military expertise, we must only ask such veterans to deposit their wisdom."

 MON_embellishment_of_the_economic_agreement_desc: "Economic aid from Russia was ended following the chaos resulting from the assassination of Chernov. With the Russian situation stabilising, and our own chaos far behind us, it is imperative that we reignite the flame of Russo-Mongolian economic cooperation. For them, it is assurances of our allegiance. And for Mongolia it is the very driving force of industrialisation."

Having imparted much during the Mongol Conquests, the Mongolian people have contributed to the solidification of the Russian cultural identity. Similarly, within their lands and are our own is that of our shared Mongol people. Ranging from Kalmyks to Buryats to Khalkha, we are all united under a shared history.

In a similar fashion, the Modern Russian state is undoubtedly a descendant of Batu, the first Khan of the Golden Horde, and his conquests.

 MON_the_khanate_unshackled_desc: "In light of the Russian abandonment for a third time in recent history, it has become evidently clear that they are not to be trusted. Truthfully, Mongolia's only really ally is that of Lhasa. But in any case our lands are split too far apart to provide meaningful assistance to each other. If we are to survive into the next century, Mongolia must carve out its own path of strength and vigour."

 MON_all_mongolians_made_equal_desc: "Despite what may appear on the surface, Mongolia is that of a multi-ethnic nation. Even deeper, Mongols themselves emerge from a series of various histories, cultures, and traditions. After all, each Banner is a little different, and each composite League is a little different. However under the White Shining Sun, all Mongols, are equal under the law and state. This is the truth with which we uphold."

 MON_harkening_towards_pan_mongolism_desc: "Some would decry Pan-Mongolism to be a failed endeavour, an untimely sacrifice on the altar of pragmatism and brokering between Great Powers. Yet it is an ever burning fire in the passions of the Outer Mongolian people. To unite our siblings in Buryatia, in Altay, in Inner Mongolia, in Manchuria and Dzungaria, it is imperative that we spurn on such bold sentiment. Conquests may grant us the land, but the people must be willing."

 MON_fulfilling_the_dream_of_mongolian_independence: "Fulfilling the Dream of Mongolian Independence"
 MON_fulfilling_the_dream_of_mongolian_independence_desc: "Mongolian Independence, born in the fires of 1911, meant Independence for all Mongolians. Not only those under dominion of the Chinese, now fractured into polities, but that of the Russians too. Unwilling to grant us brotherhood and unity through diplomatic means, it would appear that the remaining Mongolians must be united much akin to the first: through force of arms."

 MON_in_defence_of_a_free_mongolia: "In Defence of a Free Mongolia"
 MON_in_defence_of_a_free_mongolia_desc: "Mongolia cannot purely rely on the strength of its allies, for that is a fool's errand. At a sway of the hat, the nation could be sold out for a better bargain. Thus is the case in which every Mongolian must work and serve to better Mongolia, and to protect their freedoms. For what we all hold dear and cherish, could be reneged through no short order."

 MON_restore_pride_in_military_service: "Restore Pride in Military Service"
 MON_restore_pride_in_military_service_desc: "Through religious means and years of inaction, the people of Mongolia have grown much in contempt for the service of the military. It is their prerogative, that is true, service is not a light burden to bear, and one that cannot be forced. However there is a pride in it. Not in the slaughter, for that departs negative karma, an affront to the principles of Buddhism. But in the defence of a modern nation. That is where one will find hope and glory."

 MON_alone_between_a_bear_and_a_dragon_desc: "Abandoned by allies, and trapped by enemies. The Mongolian State of the modern age walks a delicate tightrope between its principle enemies of China and Russia. However through its own strength and willpower, it will stave off both Russian puppetry, and Chinese subjugation. A proud nation of a proud people is but an invincible fire, roaring ever loudly, and scorching all those that dare interfere with it."

 MON_a_khanate_and_its_regent: "A Khanate and Its Regent"
 MON_a_khanate_and_its_regent_desc: "The weakness of the regency was in that it was too forgiving, too swift to embrace the arms of those that would do it harm. Curried by words, curried by generosity, by practice and conviction, it was swayed to welcome traitors and rats into its ranks. Those who whisper sweet nothings into the ears of the Boy Khan, and plunge their daggers into the backs of the Baron's courtiers have no place in the new Mongolia."

 MON_mastery_of_the_intelligence_war_desc: "Whilst the myth and carnage wrought by the uttering of the \"Mad Baron\" conjures imagery of an unsettled, insane individual believing himself alone to wrought carnage as an aspect of war, it could be nothing more than fiction. Adept at intelligence work and correspondence, it is time that the regent reignite his network of contacts all across the nation. Always vigilant, and always acting to preserve peace."

 MON_exorcising_the_alluring_misgiving_desc: "MAN is but a rot that cannot be excised from one's body. An unforgiving cancer that festers in Mongolia's own weakness and fallibility. It speaks of socialism, of class struggle, of democracy, and of liberation. Yet it heeds very little to the fundamental incompatibilities of Mongolian culture and tradition with such alien concepts imported from the West. We must go to the people, and assure them that the Regency knows what is best."

 MON_mongolias_own_stavka: "Mongolia's Own Stavka"
 MON_mongolias_own_stavka_desc: "Russia's Stavka is a gathering of the nation's best and brightest military officers and generals. Akin to that of the Chiefs of Staff, it dictates the most efficient and prioritised military strategies in the face of any conflict for the nation. It is imperative that the lessons learned by Russia do not pass by the way side. Let us invite all those bright minds of the military, and heed their word in the efforts of national survival."

 MON_an_army_of_tact_and_order: "An Army of Tact and Order"
 MON_an_army_of_tact_and_order_desc: "There is by far no greater shame in the Baron's line of work than that of lacking discipline, of lacking honour. Of lacking respect in the role a serviceman is to play in the nation's morality and defence. Under the Baron and his military allies, such complacency, such ill-maintained order has no place. A nation dominated by bandits is one that Mongolia shall no longer be. They despoil the military tradition, and it is time to correct that course."

 MON_the_land_untainted_by_liberalism: "The Land Untainted by Liberalism"
 MON_the_land_untainted_by_liberalism_desc: "Mongolia is a land that has remained steadfast in the test of time. Try as they might, even MAN themselves still give into the words heeded by the Khanate, by Jamsaran, by their Lamas that dot their ranks. To the West, the Steppe is inhospitable, savage even, but they are blinded by their decadent modernity. One can simultaneously modernise, industrialise a great deal, without sacrificing or compromising on one's own beliefs or culture."

 MON_the_last_great_white_warlord: "The Last Great White Warlord"
 MON_the_last_great_white_warlord_desc: "Even Moscow would decry Baron, and Grand Duke, Roman Fyodorovich von Ungern-Sternberg as a \"warlord\". A title and attribution meant to demean and insult his achievements. To consider him unreliable, or selfish, serving only his own interests and maintaining his rule through force alone. But to the Mongolian people, he is a saviour, their defender. Perhaps both are true, but it is indubitable that Ungern lines the halls of history as that of the \"Greats\"."

 MON_culmination_of_the_peoples_revolution: "Culmination of the People's Revolution"
 MON_culmination_of_the_peoples_revolution_desc: "For too long have the people been trampled upon by Noble. For too long have they been forced to pay heed to the greedy Lamas and their monopolisation on practice. And for too long have they been denied their rights, their values, their capacity to enjoy not only their lives but their roles in modern society. We may have failed twice before, but as they say, third time's the charm."

 MON_stranglehold_on_the_information_apparatus: "Stranglehold on the Information Apparatus"
 MON_stranglehold_on_the_information_apparatus_desc: "In such a traditional and disconnected society that Mongolia is, many people do not heed the cause of socialism and democracy. For them, the ruler of the capital has no bearing on their way of life; except in the form of whom their lords owe loyalty towards, and whom they pay taxes and tithe. It will take a long while to inform the people of their civic duty, and to construct the democratic tradition. Until then, only MAN can cultivate what they seek."

 MON_exemplifying_the_misery_of_the_barons_regime: "Exemplifying the Misery of the Baron's Regime"
 MON_exemplifying_the_misery_of_the_barons_regime_desc: "Many in Mongolia still owe the Baron and his lackeys a great deal of respect. Despite their unconditioned brutality to those they deemed to be traitors or enemies, many see Ungern as the father of the modern nation. A man who ejected the Chinese, and restored the Bogd Khan. Whilst admittedly this is true, Ungern also contributed to untold misery, exacting revenge and bloodlust unto all those deemed to close to socialism."

 MON_salvo_of_the_oppressed_underclass: "Salvo of the Oppressed Underclass"
 MON_salvo_of_the_oppressed_underclass_desc: "The peasantry of Mongolia, all of which compromise the majority of the nation, have for too long been the mere subject and property of abhorrent Princes. Denied their voices, they have had to endure untold hardship for centuries. Let MAN and the Mongolian Revolution be the cannonade that obliterates the oppression of the aristocracy, and let us construct a New Mongolia from the ashes."

 MON_wealth_under_new_management: "Wealth Under New Management"
 MON_wealth_under_new_management_desc: "The Nobles extract much of their power from their, now dwindling, amassment of wealth. Neither conveying the virtues of Buddhism nor showing compassion for their fellow man, they sat upon their copious amounts of luxury, paying tribute to monasteries, and buttering up their armies. It is imperative that seizure of their ill-gotten century old gains occurs with great haste, and redistributed under state management."

 MON_an_accord_with_the_lamas: "An Accord with the Lamas"
 MON_an_accord_with_the_lamas_desc: "It would be uncouth to declare the Mongolian Revolution to be that of one against religion, for a number of Lamas, and trainee Monks, numerate the ranks of the party. We seek not a war with Buddhism, or its practitioners, but one with the decadent institutions that aided in the oppression of the Mongolian peasantry. Those neutral monasteries, they shall become our pillars in the new Mongolian society. As ultimately, we pursue the same end result."

 MON_the_cleansing_of_aristocracy: "The Cleansing of Aristocracy"
 MON_the_cleansing_of_aristocracy_desc: "What separates a peasant and his master? What inherent trait is unique to the Princes that the average Mongolian lacks? The time of feudal inheritance and noble dynasties dominating the Mongolian Government is but at an end. They will protest, and they will undoubtedly reply with force of arms, but for a free Mongolia no price is too small to pay."

 MON_breaking_the_vice_of_the_military_clique_desc: "Ungern's far reaching Military Intelligence network spans far across the Steppe and even beyond. Circulated amongst Russian and Mongol nationals alike, the Russian Military Clique still maintains considerable influence within the shadows. To break their grip we must pursue our own anti-intelligence operations, and flush out the rats from their covens."

 MON_fulfilling_the_duties_of_twenty_one_and_twenty_four_desc: "Such an inconceivable future for the Mongolian people only a decade ago has finally reared itself into the dazzling sun. Having failed against the Mad Baron and the Chinese in 1921, MAN steeled itself, and maintained its faith. Yet again it tried in 1924, trying to drive Ungern out before he could despoil Mongolia further. And yet it would take the third time, and the cost of many lives, to see that the dream of Free Mongolia fulfilled."

 MON_cultivating_class_sentiment_in_the_arat: "Cultivating Class Sentiment in the Arat"
 MON_cultivating_class_sentiment_in_the_arat_desc: "The Arats, or peasant class, are a massive majority of Mongolia. Before the MAN Revolution of 1921, they number 92.5% of Mongolia's population, and possessed 50.5% of its livestock. Yet what do they have to show for it? Holding next to no power against the nobles and their owners, it is imperative that they develop a sense of their value in the national economy, and their rights as peasantry."

 MON_from_feudalism_onto_capitalism: "From Feudalism Onto Capitalism"
 MON_from_feudalism_onto_capitalism_desc: "Lighting the flame of a socialist revolution within Mongolia cannot be achieved by force of arm or wit alone. For Mongolia is a pastoral, nomadic nation, draped with the sensibilities of a bygone era. Flooded with Banners, Leagues, Princes and Nobles, one would not be amiss to believe the Steppe to be a time capsule. Naturally of course, this is but a surface presumption, however the fostering of capitalism is imperative on the march towards socialism."

 MON_ending_monastic_preferential_treatment: "Ending Monastic Preferential Treatment"
 MON_ending_monastic_preferential_treatment_desc: "Owing to their invaluable presence in maintaining governmental authority, the monasteries of Mongolia received a large amount of preferential funding under the previous administrations. With such an institution such as the Buddhist Lamas particularly distant, sceptical, or even offended by MAN's intentions to modernise the nation, it is nonetheless prudent that the playing field be equalised, and re-evaluated."

 MON_equality_under_the_law: "Equality Under the Law"
 MON_equality_under_the_law_desc: "The rich nobles own most of the workable land in Mongolia, and similarly the capital neither has the capacity nor culture to serve as the base of a large working class. It is practically for a worker's revolution to truly seize Mongolia. However by granting certain noble assets to the populace, a sense of a restrained middle class is sure to emerge; class consciousness arriving hand-in-hand."

 MON_defanging_the_opportunists: "Defanging the Opportunists"
 MON_defanging_the_opportunists_desc: "The nobility of Mongolia have never truly had the best intentions for the nation or its people. Long have they curried favour with Mongolia's oppressors, paying heed to the Qing monarch, and participating in Beiyang's folly. Even in 1919, the Princes betrayed the nation, and sundered it to the Chinese. With their wealth depleting, their political force must vanish too."

 MON_mongolias_own_constitution: "Mongolia's Own Constitution"
 MON_mongolias_own_constitution_desc: "Whilst still remaining a rather controversial measure of doctrine adopted by the party, it is still one that has allowed MAN to finally fulfil its duties of a free Mongolia. Gathering together the nation's finest experts in constitutional law, ranging from those educated in the West, to those Lamas receptive to MAN's ideals, we shall institute a Constitutional Committee, selected from members of the Great Khural."

 MON_a_revolt_against_aristocracy: "A Revolt Against Aristocracy"
 MON_a_revolt_against_aristocracy_desc: "Much of the aristocracy and that of Old Mongolia are still willing to sell out their \"subjects\" and their people to maintain their wealth. There is no greater dishonour to such a proud nation than that of domination by the landed elites. The war against the Baron may have ended, but the war against the establishment has just begun."

 MON_undoing_decades_of_tarnish: "Undoing Decades of Tarnish"
 MON_undoing_decades_of_tarnish_desc: "Bearing fruitless and ineffectual revolutions from the 1920s, many of the politically adherent individuals within Mongolia view MAN with a sense of ephemeral disdain. Immersed in immediate instability, and lacking the successful policies of the previous administration, compounded by party fractures, it is evident that many believe the Party is unfit to rule. To showcase our competency in statecraft, we must implement immediate reforms of the inefficient old order."

 MON_allowing_the_people_to_bloom: "Allowing the People to Bloom"
 MON_allowing_the_people_to_bloom_desc: "For centuries the Mongolian people have lived a life of relative political apathy. For in their separated lifestyle the affairs of the capital did not concern them except for that in case of war. Yet within the capital all thought linked to dissent, such as that of socialism, was treated harshly and with disdain by the Baron's regency. Let us behold to the people the rights of the modern man, and their ability to speak on any issue, no matter its creed."

 MON_ashes_of_the_mongolian_peoples_army: "Ashes of the Mongolian People's Army"
 MON_ashes_of_the_mongolian_peoples_army_desc: "The Mongolian People's Army is, whilst the official fighting force of the Party, but a mere gathering of irregulars, cadres, and volunteers trained in the ways of guerrilla warfare and partisan campaigns. More used to fighting for a movement rather than a nation, we must adopt their successful model onto a national stage, and if there is one man capable of doing it, it is Damdin Sükhbaatar."

 MON_preservation_of_the_whole_desc: "Though many of Mongols remain outwith the borders of our humble nation, it is imperative that the State and army not merely march into its own grave. Undoubtedly the Chinese, or the Russians, will come for their part of the nation one day, and it is critical that the military is dedicated towards the preservation of the state, and not just the advance of it."

 MON_in_defence_of_mongolias_underclass: "In Defence of Mongolia's Underclass"
 MON_in_defence_of_mongolias_underclass_desc: "The Mongolian Peasantry's frontline heroes are none other than those brave souls of the Mongolian People's Army. Fighting not only for the advance of a Great Mongolia, but that of the people's revolution, we must extol and exalt the virtues of service. Once treated with disdain from the citizenry, it must become an object of pride in their developing sense of political revolution."

 MON_democracy_under_no_tall_order: "Democracy Under No Tall Order"
 MON_democracy_under_no_tall_order_desc: "In its final culmination, after decades of struggle, and years of heated debate, the Mongol Ardīn Nam has finally granted to the Mongolian people perhaps its greatest gift. Whilst it is undoubtedly a hard start, with very few Mongolians participating in the elections and the infrastructure being makeshift, Mongolia can nonetheless shine as a lone torch of liberty within Asia. After decades of unenviable struggle, this is our duty towards the Mongolian people."

 MON_victory_for_the_moderniser_princes_desc: "Owing to their natural eccentricities as the \"Good\" Princes of the Mongolian nobility, the Mongolyn Avtonomit Kholboo has managed to sweep the electoral campaign into their arms. Led by the capable and ostensible reformer Wu Heling, the organisation served as a sort of conduit for discussions with the Chinese, and the protection of the Inner Mongolian's interests. Under the Reluctant Revolutionary, Mongolia shall pursue its moderate course."

 MON_ending_noble_persecution: "Ending Noble Persecution"
 MON_ending_noble_persecution_desc: "Considering the circumstances it would be unfair to decry MAN's rather heavy handed treatment of the nobility during the provisional period as being that of unjust. For as long as the Nobles have dictated the path and policies of the Mongolian people, it is quite clear that their time in the captaincy chair was abused, and mistreated. But it would be overtly too harsh to merely decry them, and continue their mistreatment. They can be saved, like all Mongolians."

 MON_encourage_investment: "Encourage Outside Investment"
 MON_encourage_investment_desc: "Encouraged through the method of selective tax cuts for businesses and other economic incentives, the MAK's keen business minds have drafted a series of economic proposals and plans to triumphantly leap Mongolia into the industrial age. Incorporating that of both Chinese and Russian investment, let Mongolia prosper within its unique economic situation; a palatable conduit of trade from Moscow to Beijing. Then at least it does not languish due to the same geography."

 MAN_old_habits_die_hard: "Old Habits Die Hard"
 MAN_old_habits_die_hard_desc: "Though democracy is a rather revolutionary idea in Mongolia, tradition should not be abandoned and cast away to the dustbin of history. It is the cornerstone of society, and has protected Mongolian culture for centuries. Whilst it would be an abrogation of our earnest ideals to turn back the clock, we do not have to turn to senseless Westernisation to modernise the nation."

 MON_remembering_the_victims_of_radicalism: "Remembering the Victims of Radicalism"
 MON_remembering_the_victims_of_radicalism_desc: "The country is ultimately in no position whatsoever to pursue the course of socialism. It is but a great evil that has split movements, such as the Kuomintang, or otherwise plunged society into ruin and chaos in the all consuming effigy of class struggle. Even reformists are lost, having stayed the path of benevolence into that of idealism. Many good people were lost in the MAN revolutions, and their life, for all it encompasses, should be remembered."

 MON_walking_a_fine_line_between_titans_desc: "Dominated by the Russians and Chinese, Mongolia has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. Our predecessors, before that of Ungern, chose the path of Independence. And even they succumbed to the inherent nature that the nation has two choices: incorporation into the Russian sphere, or autonomy at very best under the Chinese. However MAK treads the centre path, neither subjugation, nor assimilation!"

 MON_rewarding_the_party_of_revolution_desc: "It was all but conceit to deceive oneself that the Party that stewarded the people into its new democracy would be one that would be cast away once it was over. Born as a revolutionary party under oath, the Mongol Ardīn Nam have continued their effervescent campaign against the people's solitude and subjugation! For who were the first to band together to resist the Chinese! And who were the first to strike against the Baron's despotism!"

Kazakhs, Chinese, Buryats, Khalkha Mongols, Chahar Mongols, Ordos Mongols, Oirats. The list is ever expansive, and ever increasing as Mongolia integrates itself into the international world. It is the duty of the party of state, whatever party, to protect the rights of all people within Mongolia, no matter their creed. Such a virtue must be enshrined into law."

 MON_forever_revolutionaries: "Forever Revolutionaries"
 MON_forever_revolutionaries_desc: "It is completely uncouth for the vile dogs and splitters of the MLN and MAK to dare distort MAN's gift to the Mongolian People. A hotly contested subject ever since the failure of the party in 1924, it has become evidently clear perhaps that the pursuit of the concept of liberal democracy is entirely unfit for the revolutionary party to pursue. It was Socialism, Nationalism, that brought the party together. Not the ballot."

 MON_elected_elites_guiding_the_flock_desc: "With the Great Khural functioning as the main legislative organ of the Mongolian state, having been instituted in 1911, and maintained throughout all administrations between then, it has become increasingly clear that such a body is dominated by the establishment and aristocracy of the past Mongolia. To truly revolutionise the Mongolian state, it is imperative that MAN, and MAN alone steward the principle of national policy."

 MON_the_only_truth_is_mongoliin_unen_desc: "The Party has long been championed in terms of national and international outreach by that of its party editorial, Mongoliin Ünen, or \"Mongolian Truth\". Established in Irkutsk in 1920, it was embellished with such slogans such as \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\". Exposing the feudal government and its misgivings, the blatant abuses of the Baron's regime, and the ideals of socialism, Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj's paper is to play a undeniably crucial role in the revolution."

 MON_providing_them_their_alms_desc: "The Party can make all of the grandstanding speeches and flagrant flourishes that is necessary to imbibe within the people a revolutionary sentiment, but it action itself that is sorely needed.

We seek not to trample upon their traditional livelihoods, but we cannot deny them their wants or their alms."

 MON_uplifting_the_industrial_society_desc: "To construct an industrial society under the direction of the state could perhaps be considered an artificial, and ultimately, wrong course of action to take. But we seek not the smog clouds to smother the steppe, nor the construction of a new aristocratic class blessed with wealth instead of lineage.

A fundamental building block of Western society is that of its literacy and educational institutions.

It is only natural that the burden of leadership, and the rule of the nation, befall unto their shoulders once more.

Paying their tribute to the monasteries, the relationship between Lama and Prince is perhaps that of a tense one.

However, in 1920, §PRoman von Ungern-Sternberg§!, a White Russian military leader, leading his §PAsiatic Cavalry Division§!, took Urga from the §lChinese§!, and restored the §PBogd Khan§!.\n\n§PUngern§! enforced his rule with an iron fist, crushing revolts and dissidents while making deals with the aristocratic §gMongol Princes§!. The §RMongol Ardīn Nam§!, a socialist party inspired by the Bolsheviks, was formed, and began a revolution in 1921 to overthrow §PUngern's§! regime.

Following the death of the §PBogd Khan§! in 1924, the §RMAN§! rebelled again, claiming §PUngern§! no longer held any legitimacy in the country. This revolution was harshly repressed, and the §RMAN§! were forced into hiding once more. In this time, §PUngern§! made deals with the §nRussian§! government, for economic and military support. §PUngern§! was also able to seize Xilingol from the §lChinese§! §gGuominjun§!. §PUngern's§! rule was still shaky, however, and following a series of peasant uprisings in 1930 led primarily by §nBuddhist lamas§!, §PUngern§! purged many high ranking §nlamas§! in his government, destroying much of the support he had accrued over the years.\n\nWith the death of the §PBogd Khan§!, the hunt began for the 9th reincarnation of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was eventually found in 1933 in Lhasa, Tibet.

### Events ###
 mon.2.t: "Ja Lama's Bandits Spotted In Western Mongolia"
 mon.2.d: "Our nation is regularly plagued by banditry and raiding. Due to its sheer size compared to its minimal population, it is difficult to find these bandits and bring them to justice. However, following Ungern's ascension to power in 1920, he clamped down hard, sending his forces out into the deepest areas of Mongolia to root out bandit groups. The brutality of Ungern's forces have become rather famous in Mongolia, mercilessly torturing and killing any bandits, criminals, or resistance fighters they found. Many outlaws went into hiding, for fear of being executed by what have become known as Ungern's \"Death Squads\".\n\nHowever, over the years, Ungern has been having more and more trouble in keeping Mongolia in his grip. MAN rebels still disrupt supply lines, and bandit activity has been growing more and more, especially in the west where troops are spread very thin. With Russian money we were able to put down bandit forces, through force and bribery. However, with Russia withdrawing their aid, many bandit groups seem to be coming out of their caves, most notably Ja Lama's Yum-Beise bandits. Ja Lama was an independence fighter, radical lama and warlord in the 1910s, who tried to establish an independent Oirat Empire. Though Ungern was an admirer of his, he murdered all the envoys we sent to him, and went into hiding. With Russian aid ending, and unrest growing in the west, it appears Ja Lama's followers are uniting again, even though it is assumed Ja Lama himself is dead."
 mon.2.a: "We will keep an eye on this."

 mon.4.t: "Bandits Raid Khovd Villages"
 mon.4.d: "It appears that the rumours of the Yum-Beise bandits uniting once again are true. There are reports that multiple small nomadic villages just north of Khovd have been raided by the group. By the time some government forces got there to evaluate, the villages were deserted, with most gers being either torn down or in ashes. The bandits could be seen far in the distance, but our forces did not give chase, primarily due to the immense size of the group. The party was reportedly an extremely large size, and worse still, in the rubble of the villages, flags and text of the banned Mongol Ardīn Nam were found. Perhaps this is not mere banditry."
 mon.4.a: "This is a one time thing, right?"

 mon.6.t: "Bandits Defeat Local Militia"
 mon.6.d: "Following the raids on nearby villages, a local tribal chief decided to act. He gathered a small force of militia from nearby tribes and villages, armed with whatever weapons they owned, mostly sword or archaic rifles, and travelled out to confront them. 100 men marched with him, and hopes were high. It was assumed there would be little proper resistance, and the bandit party would disperse at the first sign of a battle\n\nIt was a massacre. Only a few of the chief's men on horseback were able to make it out of the confrontation alive. These survivors told stories of how the group was massive, perhaps over a thousand men, armed with rifles smuggled in from Russia and China. One of the survivors even claims that he saw multiple figures, like MAN military leader Damdin Sükhbaatar, warlord Ja Lama and even Genghis Khan himself. Though some of these reports can be disregarded as simple madness, the fact that Damdin Sükhbaatar was even mentioned next to legendary figures like Genghis Khan is worrying."
 mon.6.a: "Are we blind? Deploy the Khovd garrison!"

 mon.7.t: "Khovd City Guard Lay Down Arms"
 mon.7.d: "After sending out an official command to the garrison in Khovd, we received a peculiar response. The leading officer stationed in Khovd has sent us a message, stating:\n\n\"My troops refuse to fight against their brothers. For too long, we have received nothing from Urga apart for demands that we kill our own countrymen. The only thing you, Ungern-Sternberg, have done for us, is murder our families in the name of \"securing the khanate\". It is time for change.\"\n\nSince this message, we have received nothing from either Khovd nor the nearby city of Uliastai, the administrative capital of the region. All we have received is letters from chiefs and village leaders in the west, either pleading for help from the \"revolutionary masses\", or declaring that they no longer align with our government."
 mon.7.a: "What is going on?"

 mon.8.t: "The Western Revolt"
 mon.8.d: "The situation in the west is far worse than we could have imagined. Over the past few years the western region of the country has grown heavily dependent on aid and investment from Russia. With Russian withdrawal of aid, and many Russian businessmen pulling out their investments, the economy of the west collapsed. With that, Lamas, power-hungry warlords, and the socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam swept in and gained mass support, and formed a loose anti-government coalition. Now, earlier today, the mayors of Uliastai and Khovd have declared their allegiance to the rebels, and have dismissed any pro-Ungern officials from their administrations.\n\nIt appears we have lost control of the west of the country, and though our military strength is far greater than that of the rebels, the chaos this revolt will cause gives Ungern's opponents in Urga the chance to dismantle his regime."
 mon.8.a: "These rebels must be crushed!"

 mon.9.t: "The Battle of Ulaangom"
 mon.9.d: "Following the start of the Western Revolt, the town of Ulaangom, north of Khovd and on the border with Tuva, declared their allegiance to the rebels. However, a government-owned military base was very nearby, and upon hearing of the revolt, began a march to Ulaangom to retake it for Ungern's government.\n\nAfter hearing of the march of pro-government troops, the local leader of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, the school teacher Banzarjavyn Baasanjav, hastily invigorated the peasants of the town to fight to defend it. They quickly put up makeshift barricades, and were supplied with weapons from a Tuvan merchant who was travelling through the town to deliver Russian weapons to Khovd. As the government forces began to approach, Baasanjav gave one last inspirational speech to the peasants, talking of how it was likely they would be defeated, but it was worth it for the greater cause. However, in a surprising twist, the peasants of Ulaangom were able to fend off the government forces, with much of the town being destroyed in the process. News of this surprise victory is travelling fast, with the MAN revolutionaries trying to push this as a Mongolian victory against its Russian oppressors, and with pro-government military commanders realising they cannot underestimate the strength of the rebels."
 mon.9.a: "Damn."

 mon.10.t: "Demchugdongrub meets with Noyodyn Zövlöl"
 mon.10.d: "An emergency meeting of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, fronted by the aristocratic prince Demchugdongrub, has taken place today. The Mongol prices play a large part in our government, and we received large amounts of wealth from taxes on their land and wealth. It is likely the princes are fearful of the Western Revolt, with it being a threat to their power. However, perhaps there is something more to this. Prince Demchugdongrub has not made it a secret that he believes Ungern's stewardship of the regency has caused numerous flagging issues. Whether he intends to push for Ungern's replacement, or continue to support him, insofar as the Baron is concerned, it is undecipherable at the present."
 mon.10.a: "This is suspicious..."

 mon.11.t: "The Buddyn Zövlöl demand we allocate funds to repair raided monasteries"
 mon.11.d: "The Buddyn Zövlöl, the buddhist council who are suspected of directly funding Lamas currently taking part in the Western Revolt, have sent our government an official demand that more funding is allocated to monastery repair and protection in the west. With that region of the country in chaos, they state that it is the government's duty to protect the institutions that are the key of Mongolian society. However, the amount of funding they demand is ridiculous, and it would be a massive burden to raise it by ourselves."
 mon.11.a: "We cannot spare the money."
 mon.11.b: "Set aside some funds to get it done."
 mon.11.c: "Tax the nobility to afford the cost."

 mon.12.t: "Bandits Burn Altai City, Hundreds Homeless"
 mon.12.d: "A group of bandits in the west have completely destroyed Altai City, raiding it for food and money, then razing the buildings to the ground. This has left hundreds of people without homes or food. It is our duty to try to help these people, but there are issues, primarily with securing the money for the aid and getting it to the people safely. Our main source of money currently is from the nobles and monasteries' treasuries, but continuing to take their money will lead to further disdain from them. There is another option, however. We could also secretly send the aid to the MAN rebels, who will reach Altai. Although it will make MAN look like the heroes, it will possibly save the lives of hundreds of people, or at least dissuade some of them from joining the rebellion."
 mon.12.a: "This isn't our problem."
 mon.12.b: "Seize nobles' money to pay for aid."
 mon.12.c: "Secretly cooperate with MAN to get the people aid."

 mon.13.t: "Chaos in the Capital!"
 mon.13.d: "With the Western Revolt in full swing, and rebels controlling key cities in the region, most of the army and senior military commanders have been forced to leave Urga. The modern Mongolian army is dominated at higher levels with Russian staff, who hold extreme loyalty to Ungern and are members of his informal RVK. The loyalty of these key army figures is one of the main reasons Ungern was able to remain influential, besides the consent from the 1st Bogd Khan.\n\nThe issue for Ungern is obvious. With most of the RVK leaving Urga to deal with the west, opposing political factions are finally seeing their chance to act. The Mongol Ardīn Nam have always had a strong presence in Urga, and there are rumours that many senior MAN officials like Darizavyn Losol and Anandyn Amar have travelled to the city. Both the Buddyn Zövlöl and the Mongol princes hold great influence in our government, and both stand ready to take over if given the chance. Ungern must walk a fine line between the factions if he is to survive the next few months..."
 mon.13.a: "The Baron has survived a Civil War, he can survive this!"

 mon.14.t: "Monastery destroyed in siege"
 mon.14.d: "After a minor skirmish just outside Khovd between government forces and some rebel peasants, a nearby lama gave them refuge in his monastery. Government troops demanded the lama relinquish the rebels, but he refused, and the peasants opened fire from inside the monastery. The government troops were able to defeat the rebels, but by the time the skirmish was over the lama was dead and the monastery had half collapsed. The Buddyn Zövlöl heard the news, and have requested we set aside funds to immediately begin the reconstruction of the monastery."
 mon.14.a: "We can't deal with that."
 mon.14.b: "Seize nobles' wealth to pay for repairs."
 mon.14.c: "We will find the funds somewhere..."

 mon.15.t: "Rebels take Ulaangom"
 mon.15.d: "After weeks of fighting and battles in the west, government troops are beginning to beat the rebels and bandits down. A couple of battalions have been laying siege to Khovd for a few days, their numbers bolstered by peasants tired of the chaos. Due to this, the road to the new centre of the rebellion, Uliastai, has been blocked, and some of the more organised rebels have been cut off. Instead of trying to defend Khovd, these rebels have instead moved into the lightly defended neighbouring village of Ulaangom, and have easily taken the village. It will have to be reclaimed before the rebellion is beaten."
 mon.15.a: "Damn."

 mon.16.t: "Uliastai Becomes the Epicentre"
 mon.16.d: "With Khovd falling back into government hands a few days ago, Uliastai has officially become the centre of the continued revolt. It has become clear the city will have to be soundly retaken before the rebellion is actually beaten, as it is necessary for the administration of the western region."
 mon.16.a: "We cannot let this stand."

 mon.17.t: "Chahars clash with settled Khalkha Mongols"
 mon.17.d: "Mongolia is a nation made up of many ethnicities who all fall under the title of Mongolian. Though Khalkha Mongols make up the majority of the overall population, the west is dominated by different tribes of Oirats, and in Xilingol in Inner Mongolia, society is dominated by the Chahar Mongols. There has been animosity between Khalkha and Chahar Mongols in the region for decades for many reasons, most recently because a majority of Xu Shuzheng's force that occupied Mongolia in 1919 were Chahar Mongols, who treated the Khalkha Mongols extremely poorly. With some of the peacekeeping military leaders of the region being forced to move to the west, tensions have flared in Xilingol once again, with Chahars and Khalkha groups clashing, and banditry from both sides increasing."
 mon.17.a: "Are we not all Mongolian?"

 mon.18.t: "The Rebels are Losing Ground"
 mon.18.d: "As expected, following a few months of open revolt in the west, the rebels are losing ground fast. With most of their forces moving to the cities and towns, government forces were easily able to crush any stragglers left behind. Victory against the rebels in the west could be only weeks away, so we must secure our position politically."
 mon.18.a: "Excellent."

 mon.19.t: "Bandits Crush Nomadic Village"
 mon.19.d: "With the rebels losing ground, many of the small rebel cells have begun to get more extreme. A large group of refugees have just reached the recently retaken Khovd, telling stories of how their nomadic village had been pillaged by bandits and outlaws. This has occurred multiple times now in Khovd, and it is becoming clear the city will need funding to be able to house and feed the influx of refugees from the steppes."
 mon.19.a: "We can spare the help."
 mon.19.b: "Khovd can handle itself."
 mon.19.c: "Pay assistance with nobles money."

 mon.20.t: "Hunger Riot in Urga"
 mon.20.d: "With government focus being on the Western Revolt and the political clashes in Urga, the people of the city have been forgotten. With shipments being raided by bandits and roads in disrepair, the poorest of the city are beginning to starve. Now, riots are beginning to break out in the poorest areas of the city, and if we are to remedy this we must send out some forces to protect food shipments, and distribute more expensive food to the lower classes."
 mon.20.a: "The princes will pay for it."
 mon.20.b: "Force the monks to deal with it."
 mon.20.c: "Put it down with force."
 mon.20.e: "Wait it out."

 mon.21.t: "Rezukhin in Mörön"
 mon.21.d: "Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right-hand man since the days of the Asiatic Cavalry Division, has been in the dark as to the happenings across the country for months. When revolt broke out in the west, Ungern sent him to Mörön to act as a bulwark against revolutionary activity spreading across the country. However, the roads between Mörön and Urga are poor at the best of times, and with bandit activity plaguing the nation, the government has been unable to communicate with him in weeks. We have finally learned what happened in the city, with some merchants travelling to Urga from Mörön, bringing stories of how the city became a hotbed for revolutionary activity, and Rezukhin implemented extremely brutal measures to crush it. Having long been a loose cannon, it would appear that his actions have hurt the regency's reputation."
 mon.21.a: "\"Why can't you be more like Mikhail Georgievich?\""

 mon.22.t: "Lamas Support the Buddyn Zövlöl"
 mon.22.d: "Though political chaos has engulfed Urga for months now, the lamas of the most notable monasteries have remained silent on which side they support. Though the Gandantegchinlen Monastery currently houses the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, the lamas there have so far refused to pledge their support for him. However, just this morning, many of the lamas of the main monasteries in Urga have declared their support for the Buddyn Zövlöl, stating that they should solely lead the country, to keep Mongolian Buddhism safe."
 mon.22.a: "So they have finally placed their lots?"

 mon.23.t: "Rebels bomb major buildings in Urga"
 mon.23.d: "With the government still locked in a political battle for Urga, many of the peasants in the city are suffering and feeling neglected. Crime has skyrocketed, and in response many peasants have begun taking part in terrorist activities. Early in the morning today, multiple bombs went off next to government buildings in Urga, including police stations, the Russian Consulate and a factory. The treasury remains low, but repairs for these buildings is urgently needed."
 mon.23.a: "The Nobles will pay."
 mon.23.b: "The lamas will pay."
 mon.23.c: "The peasants will pay."
 mon.23.e: "The army can provide free labour."

 mon.24.t: "Attacks on nobles in the streets of Urga"
 mon.24.d: "Peasants in Urga have also begun attacking some of the princes in the city, breaking into their estates, stealing their valuables and in some extreme examples even killing them. This is causing the aristocratic class to lose support in our government."
 mon.24.a: "It is callous, but one can hardly shed a tear."

 mon.25.t: "MAN Support Growing"
 mon.25.d: "With the peasantry in Urga suffering due to the chaos, many have decided to join the socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam, feeling like the MAN are the only group truly representing their needs. MAN recruiters travel the streets, conscripting peasants of the city to join their cause."
 mon.25.a: "They should understand their place."

 mon.26.t: "Scouts Around Uvs"
 mon.26.d: "Though Uvs province was taken by rebel troops, our scouts have been able to get a good idea of the rebels there, fortified in the town of Ulaangom. They are facing harsh resistance in the city from the population, who tend to have close connections with the Tuvans and the Kazakhs on the Russian side of the border. Therefore, the rebels are struggling to keep hold of the city as our troops approach from Khovd."
 mon.26.a: "March!"

 mon.27.t: "Siege of Ulaangom"
 mon.27.d: "The troops that were marching to Ulaangom from Khovd have arrived, and the situation for the rebels has improved, if only a little. To take advantage of the resistance against the rebel forces before it disappears, some officers are saying our troops should just charge the city, trust the chaos and swiftly take the city. Other officers, who are more wary and saw the success of a prolonged siege at Khovd, are saying a similar approach should be taken, and if troops surround the city and starve it out, the rebels will be forced to give up."
 mon.27.a: "Charge the city!"
 mon.27.b: "Prepare for a siege to starve them out."

 mon.28.t: "Government Troops Take Ulaangom"
 mon.28.d: "Government troops charged into the city, fighting off an initial wave of rebels and quickly arming the local resistance fighters. After that, it became a case of going street by street, house by house, clearing out any leftover rebels. Though the city has been retaken, many streets are more rubble than street, and the costs will be high to repair the broken city."
 mon.28.a: "At least it was taken."

 mon.29.t: "Siege of Ulaangom"
 mon.29.d: "After over a week of sieging Ulaangom, the situation has changed. The rebels that currently have the city have been able to crush the resistance from inside. However, they are just beginning to feel the pain of lacking supplies, after we were able to stop multiple food shipments are reinforcements. Some of our more impatient officers are claiming that it is taking too long, and that now is the time to push into the city. Others are saying that if we keep the siege going a few more weeks, the rebels will give up without a fight."
 mon.29.a: "Charge the city!"
 mon.29.b: "Continue the siege."

 mon.30.t: "Government Troops Take Ulaangom"
 mon.30.d: "Government troops charged into the city, fighting off an initial wave of rebels, who put up surprisingly decent resistance. After that, it became a case of going street by street, house by house, clearing out any leftover rebels. Government troops were spread very thin, and so they rebels were easily able to strike and take out troops. After the day, the city was taken, but much of it had become rubble throughout the day. Costs to repair the city will be high, and the state of the city will no doubt lose us support."
 mon.30.a: "At least it was taken."

 mon.31.t: "Rebels Give Up Ulaangom"
 mon.31.d: "After being trapped in the city of Ulaangom for almost a month by government troops, the rebels who had taken it today left the city without their weapons, conceding the city. Without any reinforcements or supplies, the rebels were unable to feed the city, and many even began to die of disease. Their weapons were broken and they lacked reinforcements, so they'd rather become our prisoners than try to hold the city any longer. Ulaangom has been taken without a fight."
 mon.31.a: "Excellent."

 mon.33.t: "Siege of Uliastai"
 mon.33.d: "Now that we have amassed a large force of troops a couple miles away from Uliastai, it is time to take back the city. The question remains, however, how it is to be done."
 mon.33.a: "Surround the city to starve out the enemy."
 mon.33.b: "Move the division into the city to attack head on."
 mon.33.c: "Send in a diplomat to try to discuss the issue."

 mon.34.t: "Rebels forced out of the city"
 mon.34.d: "What a success! With the city surrounded the bandits were forced to eventually try to escape, an escape that failed due to the strength of our force."
 mon.34.a: "Exactly as planned."

 mon.35.t: "Rebels escape Uliastai, leaving hundreds dead"
 mon.35.d: "With the city surrounded, the bandits were forced to try to escape the city, which they eventually did as they were attacked by our troops. However, the rebels found a weak spot in our lines, and pushed through it, leaving many dead and the rebels having escaped."
 mon.35.a: "At least we have the city back."

 mon.36.t: "Rebels wiped out in Uliastai"
 mon.36.d: "With our force moving head on into Uliastai, we were able to wipe the bandits out of Uliastai. However, in the crossfire, many civilians were killed."
 mon.36.a: "At least we have the city back."

 mon.37.t: "Rebels leave the city, but much of our force was lost"
 mon.37.d: "When we attacked head on into the city, we did not at all expect the resistance we were going to face. A massive battle ensued, with many civilians caught in the crossfire. The city is in ruins, over a thousand dead, but at least the city is ours."
 mon.37.a: "Good enough."

 mon.38.t: "Rebels execute diplomat in Uliastai"
 mon.38.d: "Earlier today, Urzhin Garmaev, leading the siege of Uliastai, received a package from the rebels in the city. It was expected this was to be a large sum of money with a request to leave them be and let them escape, or perhaps news of the success of our diplomat. Instead, when Urzhin opened the box, all he found was the bloodied head of the diplomat, its dead eyes staring right back at him. Now, it is clear these rebels do not want a peaceful resolution."
 mon.38.a: "Surround the city to starve out the enemy."
 mon.38.b: "Move the division into the city to attack head on."

 mon.42.t: "Buddyn Zövlöl Takes Power"
 mon.42.d: "The Buddyn Zövlöl, the colloquial council of Buddhist lamas, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de-jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
 mon.42.a: "To preserve sanctity!"

 mon.43.t: "Ungern Retakes Power"
 mon.43.d: "Ungern-Sternberg has retaken power in Urga. Though he now holds de-jure control of the nation, his influence outside Urga remains limited, and he will have to act fast if he are to keep his power"
 mon.43.a: "This will make for a wonderful ballad..."

 mon.44.t: "Noyodyn Zövlöl Take Power"
 mon.44.d: "The aristocratic Mongol Princes, under the leadership of Prince Demchugdongrub, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de-jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
 mon.44.a: "Primacy of the Nobility!"

 mon.45.t: "Mongol Ardīn Nam Takes Power"
 mon.45.d: "The socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de-jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
 mon.45.a: "Workers of Mongolia, Unite!"

 mon.49.t: "Ungern loyalists march toward Urga"
 mon.49.d: "After we were able to seize power of the government, Ungern and his loyal troops escaped. Now, after mustering his power in a village nearby, he and his troops are coming back to retake the city. His army, a mix of Mongols, Russians, and Chinese soldiers number over a thousand troops. With most of the national army in the west, and unwilling to recognise our authority, we only have the power of the civilians and the hastily established revolutionary militia to defend the city."
 mon.49.a: "Call on civilians to resist, and march in the militia."
 mon.49.b: "Call on the citizens to resist these traitors!"
 mon.49.c: "Lay down our arms, no need for a massacre."

 mon.50.t: "Ungern loyalists destroyed"
 mon.50.d: "Finally, after much fighting and many casualties, Ungern has been driven out, and his troops have been repulsed. Urga is ours, for now."
 mon.50.a: "The people of Urga want change!"

 mon.51.t: "Ungern loyalists have captured Urga!"
 mon.51.d: "After little fighting, Ungern and his troops were able to take back the city. Though most of our officials have escaped, we are unlikely to be seen as the real government without power in Urga."
 mon.51.a: "Power tips towards the Baron once more."

 mon.52.t: "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
 mon.52.d: "With the power now in the people's hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, are a very traditional aspect of the nation. Many lamas in recent times have begun to push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungern's regency or even supporting the now defunct Buddyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
 mon.52.a: "Keep the Monasteries on our side."
 mon.52.b: "Give the money to the people!"
 mon.52.c: "The lamas may be a good ally, let's give them more funding."

 mon.53.t: "The Palace Coup"
 mon.53.d: "Wu Heling was elected to government thanks to his moderate position, and ability to win over the people no matter their creed. Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many individuals in the aristocracy do not hold Wu in high regard, and mostly see him as a young upstart, the last remnant of Prince Gung's influence. Even worse, many radical figures in MAN, or the Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, have begun an onslaught of political campaigns against Wu's \"fallible\" nature.\n\nThe infighting has managed to rise to such tenuous levels that multiple princes such as Jodbajab have had to intervene and prevent an uproar from emerging between Wu and the rather ambitious Prince Demchugdongrub. Prince De has consistently and constantly harried that of Wu, insisting that he should be the one leading the nation, that Wu owes much of his position entirely to the Prince. De is a popular figure amongst the conservative elite, and has managed to string a motley crew of rather curious politicians and nobles to form a sort of \"Anti-Wu\" coalition. His popularity has reached perhaps its zenith, and it would appear he has made his move.\n\nArranging his Peace Preservation Corps, alongside Yondonwangchug's own, around the capital, the austere Prince marched into the Grand Khural, detained a series of sitting members of parliament, and threatened to detain Wu Heling for \"infractions and abuses of the regency\". Headstrong, and attempting to resist the blatant cowing of democracy, Wu rallied a call to arms from the other Princes within the Capital — Darijaya (Prince Ta) and deputy Prime Minister Altanochir (Prince A.) — to resist the coup, and fight back against Prince De and Yun's military forces."
 mon.53.a: "The Princes remain aloof amongst the power struggle."
 mon.53.b: "Princes Ta and A. fight back against the despots!"

 mon.54.t: "Review the Budget"
 mon.54.d: "Throughout Ungern's years as regent of the Bogd Khanate, spending increased massively. The country's economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."
 mon.54.a: "Cut military spending."
 mon.54.b: "Raise Arat tax."
 mon.54.c: "Implement Monastery tax."

 mon.55.t: "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
 mon.55.d: "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowd. A shot that echoed throughout the city, missing Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians were forced out of the centre of the city. After the carnage had calmed down, the assassin had been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by the government. Though the Baron survived, this attempt showed weakness, and the chaos that emerged as a result of can't be good for our popularity."
 mon.55.a: "At least the Baron survived."

 mon.56.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Wishes to Re-establish Relations"
 mon.56.d: "Russia and Mongolia have not been on the best terms in recent times. Regardless, the Mongolians have sent a diplomatic mission our way to renegotiate better relations. This could be an opportunity to retain our foothold in China, even if the new government likely won't be as subservient to our interests."
 mon.56.a: "Allies are always good."
 mon.56.b: "Who's to say they will not turn on us again?"

 mon.57.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Agrees"
 mon.57.d: "The Russian government has responded warmly to our offer, saying that they will offer us economic assistance as well as protection."
 mon.57.a: "Excellent."

 mon.58.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 mon.58.d: "The Russian government has denied our rapprochement, citing unnamed concerns of sincerity on our part. We will have to look elsewhere for allies."
 mon.58.a: "Unfortunate."

 mon.59.t: "Diplomatic Mission from Mongolia"
 mon.59.d: "Mongolia, lead by the religious clergyman, the [MON.GetLeader], has recently sent us a diplomatic mission. Due to both of our nations being major homes for Buddhism, the Mongolian diplomats have stated that they wish to see our nations grow closer, through guarantees and military access. They await our answer."
 mon.59.a: "We Buddhist nations must stick together!"
 mon.59.b: "We are better off alone."

 mon.60.t: "The Western Revolt has finally been crushed"
 mon.60.d: "After many months of fighting in the west of the nation, between bandits, rebels, and government troops, the revolt has been crushed. Most rebels have dispersed, gone into hiding or fled the country, fearing for their lives. Order has come out on top, and the country is secure. However, there are still some small bandit groups, taking advantage of the destruction. They will have to be dealt with."
 mon.60.a: "At last, the nation is safe."

 mon.61.t: "The Offer"
 mon.61.d: "Today, we received a letter from a few of the bandit leaders in the west. In the letter, it said that their groups do not have any stake in what has developed. They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."
 mon.61.a: "Use the nobles' money to pay the bribe."
 mon.61.b: "Sell off some of the monasteries' jewels to pay it."
 mon.61.c: "Raise taxes on the poor to pay the bribe."
 mon.61.e: "Reduce military funding to pay the bribe."
 mon.61.f: "We will not negotiate with these bandits!"

 mon.62.t: "The bandit leader takes the bribe"
 mon.62.d: "The bandit leaders have taken our offer, and have decided to end their operations in the west. In these times of brutal battle, good news like this should be celebrated, but a quiet drink is all [MON.GetLeader] had time for, before having to return to keeping Urga in his hands."
 mon.62.a: "That'll reduce their forces."

 mon.66.t: "Power Struggle in the Ma Clique"
 mon.66.d: "For many years, the Ma Clique has been led by family elder Ma Fuxiang. In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, is already embroiled in a power struggle with Lin. This could be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Ma Clique's weakened position."
 mon.66.a: "Good to know."

 mon.67.t: "Zhamyangiyn Lhagvasuren gathers force on the Ulanqab border"
 mon.67.d: "Mongolian general Zhamyangiyn Lhagvasuren has generally stayed uninvolved with the power struggles happening currently in Urga. For years, he has continued to serve the Mongolian military dutifully, having been educated in Russia. Ensuring a continued presence through the region of Inner Mongolia, he has managed to muster a large force on the border of the Ma Clique. With official permission, as he has inquired to, he will commit to a punitive expedition to test Ma defences."
 mon.67.a: "Let the border raids begin."

 mon.68.t: "Mongolian border raids from Suiyuan"
 mon.68.d: "Ever since the death of family patriarch Ma Fuxiang, tensions on both the northern and southern border have been getting worse and worse. Border Raids from Mongolia, primarily in the province of Suiyuan, have caused much chaos over the recent weeks. This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
 mon.68.a: "This is fine."

 mon.69.t: "Lhagvasuren makes his choice"
 mon.69.d: "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Lhagvasuren. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Mas struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."
 mon.69.a: "It's too risky."
 mon.69.b: "Lhagvasuren, do it."

 mon.70.t: "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
 mon.70.d: "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Suiyuan, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols. Ma Hongkui is currently in the region with his force, so he may be able to fight them off."
 mon.70.a: "The garrison will hold."
 mon.70.b: "Send a force under Ma Hongkui."

 mon.71.t: "Mongolian general Lhagvasuren takes Guisui"
 mon.71.d: "The Mongolian general Lhagvasuren, who led the large Mongol force through Suiyuan, has been able to defeat any Ma forces in the area and has taken Guisui. There, he declared it now under Mongolian control. However, we can still act. Ma Hongbin is also now in the area, and could move his own forces up to try to retake the city."
 mon.71.a: "We cannot act, leave Suiyuan."
 mon.71.b: "Send a force under Ma Hongbin."

 mon.72.t: "We have taken Ulanqab!"
 mon.72.d: "After Lhagvasuren began to move toward Guisui to take Ulanqab, he was met with surprisingly little resistance from the Ma Clique. Though he had to fight some small battles with border troops, and had to fight through the Guisui garrison, for now it seems the Ma Clique have retreated from Ulanqab. Finally, Mongolian families have been reunited, and Mongolian rule in the region has been restored."
 mon.72.a: "Good work Lhagvasuren."

 mon.73.t: "Ma Hongkui loses"
 mon.73.d: "Ma Hongkui's forces travelled for a day and a night to finally reach the Mongolian force. In the early hours of the morning, Ma Hongkui sent in his soldiers to attack the Mongolians, who looked like they were just camping. However, it was a trap! After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."
 mon.73.a: "A repeat of the Five Roads War?"

 mon.74.t: "Mongol raiders beaten in Suiyuan"
 mon.74.d: "After much fighting between our forces and theirs, in the end, our forces were able to beat the Mongolian force back to the border. For now, Suiyuan remains in our hands."
 mon.74.a: "This must be an omen for things to come."

 mon.75.t: "Lhagvasuren beaten"
 mon.75.d: "After almost being able to take Guisui from the Ma Clique, Lhagvasuren and his force have been beaten back to Xilingol. They fought hard, but were unable to beat the better trained and better armed Chinese troops. For now, Ulanqab remains in their hands."
 mon.75.a: "They're stronger than we fought."

 mon.76.t: "Ma Hongbin has lost, Mongolians take Guisui"
 mon.76.d: "Ma Hongbin decided to try to go for a full frontal attack against the Mongolian force with his own force, to avoid being scouted and routed by the Mongols. Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Lhagvasuren's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Suiyuan has now fallen into Mongol hands."
 mon.76.a: "How exactly could they best us? Again?"

 mon.77.t: "Peasant Rebellion in Urga"
 mon.77.d: "In Urga, many peasants, after learning of the sweeping laws implemented to massively increase the power of bosses and nobles, while also destroying their own rights, has decided to take up arms and join the Mongol Ardīn Nam. Battle continues to rage in the streets, and the poorer regions of the city are in MAN control."
 mon.77.a: "They needn't struggle."

 mon.80.t: "Ungern's Generals Escape to Russia"
 mon.80.d: "Following the overthrow of Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's government in Mongolia, he and many of his non-Mongolian associates were forced to flee the country. Ungern and his generals, Mikhail Tornovsky and Boris Rezukhin, were able to cross the border and escape to Irkutsk. Together with them is Nikolay Kazagrandi, who was sent as attaché to Mongolia in 1931 and serves as something of a liaison between Sternberg and us. They have written a letter to [RUS.GetLeader], offering their services to the Russian army."
 mon.80.a: "We welcome them in the army."
 mon.80.b: "Welcome back Kazagrandi, but the others will not be reinstated."

 mon.103.t: "Chaos in Moscow"
 mon.103.d: "News from Moscow: Viktor Chernov, current Leader of the Opposition, has been been shot dead in the Senate. During the tenure of his predecessors, we were able to broker many economic and military deals, allowing our extremely weak economy to grow - deals that were maintained by the current President Boris Savinkov out of pragmatism. Although regretfully Chernov and his ilk, the Socialist Revolutionaries, are closet Bolsheviks, they nonetheless kept the \"Vozhd\" contained insofar as to not cut Russia's benevolent agreements with Mongolia.\n\nHowever, the present situation has brought a lot of our position into question. A political assassination of such a high-ranking politician is likely to throw Russia's politics even further down the drain, perhaps cementing Savinkov's rule as the opposition collapses. With the Russian government now rather focused on its own political struggles, it seems we have been forgotten. There are worrying signs that we might lose the Russian support that our nation has become dependent on."
 mon.103.a: "Their assistance is vital."

 mon.104.t: "Economic and Military Assistance from Russia has been \"Temporarily Halted\""
 mon.104.d: "What we have feared has come true. We have just received word from the current Russian administration that they have decided to temporarily end their military and economic aid to our nation. Without it, we will only suffer."
 mon.104.a: "A disaster!"

 mon.107.t: "Jamsrangiin Tseveen Splits from MAN!"
 mon.107.d: "Jamsrangiin Tseveen has been a high ranking member of the MAN for many years, after working in universities in Siberia. He even organised and distributed the first newspaper in Mongolia. However, he has always ranked on the more right wing of the party. On multiple occasions he has argued with Darizavyn Losol, and other high ranking MAN members. It is, therefore, no surprise that Tseveen has decided to split from the party, citing the recent leadership struggle as evidence of the party's corruption. His popularity and intelligence cannot be underestimated."
 mon.107.a: "It is a loss for MAN."

 mon.108.t: "Wu Heling Pushes Forward!"
 mon.108.d: "Wu Heling, sometimes known by his Mongolian name Ünenbayan, is a young Inner Mongolian aristocrat, friends with Prince Demchugdongrub. During the Western Revolt he travelled to Urga to aid Demchugdongrub in trying to take power, but encourage a more peaceful and democratic solution. Following the Democratic Revolution, Wu Heling lobbied to end the discrimination against the nobles and tried to slow the peasants power rise. Now, seeing weakness in the MAN, he has decided to place his own association at the forefront, to bring a more conservative and noble democratic Mongolia."
 mon.108.a: "A democracy must have its parties."

 mon.110.t: "Concern about Upcoming Elections"
 mon.110.d: "Since completing the Constitution and fully transforming into a democratic nation, there has been one small stickler: elections. Though most people agree that elections should take place to fully become a democratic nation, some major figures in the party have spoken of how elections threaten our rule. With the creation of the MAK, people fear allowing elections will pull us back to a nation dominated by the aristocracy. Perhaps it might be best to, for now, postpone the elections so that something may be decided."
 mon.110.a: "Elections will go ahead as planned."
 mon.110.b: "Maybe we can postpone them for now."

 #mon.111.t: "Tseveen demands information about elections"
 #mon.111.d: "Jamsrangiin Tseveen, writing in his newspaper, the Niislel Khüreenii Sonin Bichig, this morning said this:\n\nWe, the people of Mongolia, demand information. For too long we have lived under a tyrant who refused to allow the democratic process. After the democratic revolution, we finally had the chance to express our views. However, the government is silent. The MAN have had power for a long time, and yet where are the elections? Therefore, we demand information about when the people will have the chance to express their views via the democratic process, as we deserve.''\n\nAlthough many people in Mongolia are not literate, words like this will spread through the intelligentsia, where we garner much of our support. Perhaps he is right, that elections should be planned soon."
 #mon.111.a: "Elections will go ahead."
 #mon.111.b: "Tseveen is a threat to Mongolia!"

 mon.112.t: "Tseveen and Wu Heling criticise the government"
 mon.112.d: "Due to our decision to postpone the elections, both Jamsrangiin Tseveen, leader of the MLN, and Wu Heling, leader of the MAK, have come out in direct opposition to us. Both of the men held speeches in different areas in Urga, generally speaking about the same things: the lack of elections when they had been planned, and no issued date as to when the postponing of the elections will end. Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Wu Heling's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people. It appears, though we were the most likely to win the election, it appears the people still wanted to be able to make the choice. For now, though, no dangerous resistance has begun, but we must stay vigilant."
 mon.112.a: "Who cares what these traitors have to say."

 mon.118.t: "[GetYear] Election"
 mon.118.d: "Finally it is time for the first election in Mongolia. Turnout was high in all the major cities, as people flocked to vote for the first time. The question of who has won has yet to be answered."
 mon.118.a: "MAN victory."
 mon.118.b: "MLN victory."
 mon.118.c: "MAK victory."

 mon.119.t: "[GetYear] Election"
 mon.119.d: "It is once more time for elections in Mongolia. Turnout was high in all the major cities, as people flocked to vote and keep Mongolian democracy alive. The question of who has won has yet to be answered."
 mon.119.a: "MAN victory."
 mon.119.b: "MLN victory."
 mon.119.c: "MAK victory."

 mon.121.t: "Elections scheduled"
 mon.121.d: "Following the creation of our great Constitution, elections are the next key step in proving our legitimacy. Therefore, [MON.GetLeader] has announced that elections have been scheduled in 90 days time, and already the parties have began campaigning. Due to the massive size of the nation compared to the population, the only area where turnout will be high is some of the main cities and Urga itself. Jamsrangiin Tseveen, leader of the MLN, has declared he will do a tour around the Urga area, meeting with the poor and suffering. In contrast, Wu Heling is instead holding meetings with many major nobles and aristocrats, as he is their main candidate."
 mon.121.a: "Democracy in action."

 mon.122.t: "Darizavyn Losol makes a speech in Urga"
 mon.122.d: "\"People of Mongolia. Finally, we are free! The dictatorship of the Russian dog Ungern-Sternberg has come to an end, and his death squads have been driven from the nation. No longer shall we live under a dictator, no longer shall we live under foreign control, no longer shall we be slaves!\"\n\nDarizavyn Losol's speech, held outside the State Great Khural in Urga, went on for almost an hour, talking in detail about the serious reforms the new government was going to make; he promised the redistribution of wealth, a real constitution, and democratic elections. Even though the speech went on for so long the audience was captivated all the way. Nearly every other sentence of Losol was met with cheers and thunderous applause from the crowd."
 mon.122.a: "Glory to Mongolia!"

 mon.123.t: "Teachings from the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu"
 mon.123.d: "\"For many months now, the ones who have struggled the most are the people. With bandits and rebels running rife throughout the nation, the people need security. The previous government, led by the butcher Ungern-Sternberg, focused too much on control through terror, when that is not what the people need. The beliefs of Buddhism, something that Ungern claimed to follow, were noticeably absent in the previous government. The 1930 purge is evidence that Ungern's Buddhist claims were little more than lies and deceptions. The Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu lived as little more than a prisoner, not receiving the proper training. Now that order has been restored here, things will change.\"\n\nThis speech, made outside the Gandantegchinlen Monastery, the new centre of the government, was met with great applause from the hundreds of onlookers."
 mon.123.a: "Glory to Mongolia!"

 mon.131.t: "Amar Questions Losol's Loyalty"
 mon.131.d: "In a speech in the recently empowered State Great Khural, Anandyn Amar, member of the MAN, held a speech questioning the current leadership. In this speech, he claimed that Darizavyn Losol has lead the MAN through nepotism, and that Darizavyn Losol is nothing more than a spy for the Japanese. Though these comments were very controversial, due to Amar's support in the party, we will have to let this slide for now."
 mon.131.a: "He is a poor judge of character."

 mon.132.t: "Radical ideas in the party"
 mon.132.d: "With our power recently elevated to the nation stage, the party has begun to split in terms of policy. In the past, the party's only goal had been gaining power. Now, the ideological divides of the party are beginning to show. The party is generally split between the more moderate members, lead by Darizavyn Losol, and the more radical members, lead by Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir and Ölziin Badrakh. Anandyn Amar commands his own clique in the party, made up of less radical leftists and the stronger Mongol nationalists. Though this group of radicals is still a minor force in the party, it destabilises our leadership in a time when we sorely need stability. They also have made it clear that they are willing to give their support to Anandyn Amar, if he should need it against Losol."
 mon.132.a: "Party debate is what democracy is about."

 mon.133.t: "Chagdarjav Begins Investigating Losol"
 mon.133.d: "Dambyn Chagdarjav was one of the men who founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam, with Darizavyn Losol and others. Though Chagdarjav and Losol have been colleagues for many years now, it did not stop the two from battling for power for control of the party, a battle Losol won. Chagdarjav was almost purged from the party, along with his co-conspirator Dogsomyn Bodoo, however, Losol decided to pardon the men, due to the extremely weak position the MAN were in after another failed revolution.\n\nHowever, it appears Chagdarjav is back to his old tricks. Today, he announced to the party that he was going to begin an investigation of Losol into any \"ties to foreign enemies\". Of course, this investigation will surely amount to nothing."
 mon.133.a: "There is nothing to find."

 mon.134.t: "Elbegdorj Argues with Losol"
 mon.134.d: "Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, a leader of the left wing of the party and friend of Anandyn Amar, recently got into an argument with Prime Minister Losol about socialism. Elbegdorj, in front of many other party members, openly stated that the transition to socialism was taking far too long under Losol, and that perhaps Losol is not entirely loyal to the Mongolian State. Losol, of course, argued back that the transition was happening as fast as was possible, and that the left wing policies of Elbegdorj were dangerous for the party. This seemed to stir much anger against Losol, with multiple other leftist party members joined in at arguing with Losol. It seems party unity is worse than imagined."
 mon.134.a: "Other opinions can be good."

 mon.135.t: "Anandyn Amar Discusses Investigation"
 mon.135.d: "Recently, thanks to one of our spies in Amar's clique, we discovered a meeting between Amar and Dambyn Chagdarjav, who is still currently investigating Losol over his foreign ties. Apparently, the meeting lasted for multiple hours, with Amar himself stating it was \"very productive\"."
 mon.135.a: "Just politicians politicking, I'm sure."

 mon.136.t: "Russian Businessman Approaches Losol"
 mon.136.d: "A Russian businessman, who recently travelled here on the Trans-Siberian Railway all the way from Moscow, has recently made contact with our government, stating his interest in opening a factory in Urga. With the large sum of money he brought with him, construction could start immediately. However, due to the nature of the request, it would have to go through the bureaucracy of Urga, through the many committees and groups created to regulate business like this, and the foreign affairs committee. The businessman has stated that he does not wish to wait possibly months for construction to start, so he has offered us a large bribe if we are able to sidestep these committees and begin construction immediately."
 mon.136.a: "The project will go ahead."
 mon.136.b: "It is illegal, and therefore it shall not happen."

 mon.137.t: "Chagdarjav comes out with evidence of Losol bypassing laws for Russian companies"
 mon.137.d: "Dambyn Chagdarjav has today concluded his investigation on Darizavyn Losol, finding that he in fact did have dangerous links to foreign business. In his report, he states that he recently discovered a deal between Losol and a Russian businessman, where Losol took a bribe to allow the immediate construction of a new factory in Urga, bypassing the rest of the government to fill his own coffers. His report was also filled with much evidence, showing that perhaps that Russian businessman was in fact working for Chagdarjav against Losol! Darizavyn Losol has made no response to the claims as of yet. The next meeting of the State Great Khural, scheduled for tomorrow, will definitely be an eventful one."
 mon.137.a: "It seems power is shifting..."

 mon.138.t: "Anandyn Amar and Elbegdorj coup Losol"
 mon.138.d: "In the Great State Khural today, Anandyn Amar, flanked either side by Rinchingiin Elbegdorj and Dambyn Chagdarjav, made a speech damning Darizavyn Losol, citing the report Chagdarjav released just yesterday. As his speech went on, members of the Great State Khural began to yell and shout about \"Losol the Traitor\" and \"Losol the Russian\". After many minutes of this, Losol attempted to leave, but upon standing was met by two armed guards, who seized Darizavyn Losol and put him in handcuffs. From there, Losol was taken into a private police room for \"questioning\". In the State Great Khural, with his coup a success, Anandyn Amar announced that a vote will be held to decide who in the party should become the next prime minister. No one other than Amar stood for the role, and so he won a unanimous victory."
 mon.138.a: "We must remain vigilant of future corruption."

 mon.139.t: "Chagdarjav Releases Evidence of Losol Corruption"
 mon.139.d: "Dambyn Chagdarjav has today concluded his investigation on Darizavyn Losol, finding that he in fact did have dangerous links to foreign business. In his report, he claims that he recently discovered a deal between Losol and a Russian businessman, where Losol took a bribe to allow the immediate construction of a new factory in Urga, bypassing the rest of the government to fill his own coffers. However, there is a serious lack of evidence in the report, with some party members suspicious whether this is all faked or not. Losol has come out against these claims, stating that though he was contacted by a Russian businessman recently, he declined the bribe and sent the man away. It has become obvious what this is: a grab for power against Losol. Though we can have Chagdarjav arrested for his fake claims, it will show us as dictators. What may be best is if we get Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, currently a neutral member of the MAN, to investigate these claims himself, to show that we are a just society."
 mon.139.a: "Dogsom can investigate these claims."
 mon.139.b: "These need no investigating, arrest Chagdarjav."

 mon.140.t: "Amar Meets with Dogsom"
 mon.140.d: "Just today, we have received information from one of our informants that Anandyn Amar had a secret meeting with Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. Though we do not know exactly what the meeting was about, it is clear this cannot be good. The next meeting of the State Great Khural, scheduled for tomorrow, is bound to be an eventful one."
 mon.140.a: "Dogsom may not be as helpful as first hoped..."

 mon.141.t: "Amar and Elbegdorj Flee the Capital"
 mon.141.d: "Following the successful arrest of Dambyn Chagdarjav, following his fake claims against Darizavyn Losol, Anandyn Amar and Rinchingiin Elbegdorj were seen this morning fleeing the capital, fearing their own arrest. From some of our reports, they plan to lay low for a few weeks in a small village nearby, while the heat around them dies down. With this, it seems Losol's power is secure."
 mon.141.a: "The leadership is safe."

 mon.142.t: "Wu Heling approaches nobles for support"
 mon.142.d: "Reports have just come in that Wu Heling has recently held a large meeting with many of the major aristocrats in the nation, including the likes of the traitor Prince Demchugdongrub. Though a warrant is still out for the princes arrest, he is still able to exert his influence through Wu Heling."
 mon.142.a: "Traitors discussing with traitors."

 mon.143.t: "Government buildings in Urga bombed in the night"
 mon.143.d: "In the middle of the night, multiple explosions were heard going off in the centre of Urga. Multiple buildings, including police stations and minor government offices, were damaged by bombs, set off by terrorists. Though no one died, multiple people were injured. These terrorists were sadly able to escape, hiding in the slums of Urga. Though opposition to our rule had begun to grow due to our recent postponing of the elections, nothing on this scale was expected. This was obviously an attack planned by one of the opposing party's, to try to pressure us to pursue elections. Perhaps they are right; before any more people are hurt, we could end the danger right now by planning elections. This may be our last chance to push for elections to safely. However, perhaps it is better to serve justice and discredit our opponents, and claim one of them planned it."
 mon.143.a: "Publicly blame Wu Heling and the MAK."
 mon.143.b: "Publicly blame Tseveen and the MLN."
 mon.143.c: "End the violence, set up elections."

 mon.144.t: "Wu Heling releases statement against claim"
 mon.144.d: "In a statement released by Wu Heling today, he states:\n\n\"The current government has proven they are unable to keep the peace and perform their democratic duty. In blaming me for the attacks, they have shown their true colours: dangerous, and willing to exploit human loss for political gain. I can confirm that I was in no way involved in the planning of this attack, and I pray for the swift recovery for anyone injured in the attack. Not only was I not involved in this, I declare now that this act of terror was committed by the government itself, to try to give legitimacy to their cancellation of elections. We must make sure the government who committed this crime pay for their actions.\""
 mon.144.a: "We stand by it."

 mon.145.t: "Tseveen publicly supports Wu Heling"
 mon.145.d: "In a statement by Jamsrangiin Tseveen, written in his Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig newspaper, he has stated that he fully supports Wu Heling's claims against our government, and says he is willing to fight side by side with Wu Heling to make sure we are brought to justice."
 mon.145.a: "Their support grows."

 mon.146.t: "Violent riot put down in Urga"
 mon.146.d: "With tensions growing in Urga over the past few weeks, they were bound to spill over, as they have today. Following the shooting of a man in Urga earlier today after he tried to fight a police officer, many people began talking of how the police were violently cracking down on dissent due to recent political problems. Though we never gave the police such orders, the rumours spread fast, and soon, riots had begun in the centre of Urga. Thousands of people took to the streets and began looting pro-government shops and buildings, while violently attacking any police officer or soldier who opposed them. Toward the end of the day, with the riot having no sign of stopping, a cavalry battalion was called into the city, to put down the riot by any means necessary. Though the use of batons and rifles, the riot eventually dispersed. However, a death count has now been completed, showing that 39 people were killed in the riots, with another 62 seriously injured."
 mon.146.a: "And so unfurls Mongolia's young democracy."

 mon.147.t: "Wu Heling and Tseveen unite forces"
 mon.147.d: "Wu Heling and Tseveen, speaking in Urga together today, both made a speech about temporarily uniting their party's, for the purpose of removing our government from power. They stated that the current government is dangerous, and rules through military force, and are traitors to the Democratic Revolution. Their calls for unity against the government were met with thunderous applause.\n\nOf course, we cannot let this stand. Really, we have two options. One, suggested by radical Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, is that we poison Wu Heling using one of our spies who is close to him. Another plan, as suggested by the more moderate Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, is to spread dissent between the two parties, in an attempt to split their hastily formed union."
 mon.147.a: "Have the spy attempt to poison Wu Heling."
 mon.147.b: "Spread dissent between the two."

 mon.148.t: "Party union between Wu Heling and Tseveen split"
 mon.148.d: "Earlier today, Wu Heling released a statement denouncing Tseveen and the MLN, and stating that the union of the two parties is at an end. This is because of some recently discovered evidence that apparently, Tseveen was working against the union, and was planning on betraying Wu Heling. Tseveen has come out against these claims, but it appears the union between the two parties is over."
 mon.148.a: "Divide and conquer."

 mon.149.t: "Assassination attempt on Wu Heling failed"
 mon.149.d: "Earlier today, reports came in that our assassination attempt on Wu Heling had failed. Apparently, while our spy attempted to plant the poison in Wu Heling's food during his dinner, he was caught in the act, and was shot by a guard when he reached for his own pistol. Wu Heling released a statement announcing the attempt on his life, and has once again denounced our government, for our \"evil, authoritarian tactics\"."
 mon.149.a: "Damn!"

 mon.150.t: "Wu Heling getting funding from Demchugdongrub"
 mon.150.d: "We have now discovered that Wu Heling has been receiving aid from many of his noble friends. This is of no surprise, for they are his main support base. However, recently it has been uncovered that Demchugdongrub is personally supplying Wu Heling with rifles, pistols, and even some artillery pieces, to fight against our government. Should we make the wrong move, we may face another revolution.\n\nTo try to gain back support from the people of Urga, Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir has approached us, stating that we should use the fact that they are both from Inner Mongolia against them, and claim it is a Chinese plot."
 mon.150.a: "Damn."
 mon.150.b: "Claim its a Chinese plot to take over."

 mon.151.t: "Wu Heling starts violent rebellion in Urga"
 mon.151.d: "Disaster! During a regular patrol through the city, as the sun was just rising, a band of soldiers were ambushed by a group of pro-democracy rebels. The soldiers were caught off guard, and were massacred. This triggered the beginning of a rebellion in Urga, led by Wu Heling. His rebels are well armed, thanks to funding he secured through the nobles. No doubt this is merely a plot for the nobles to try to take power once again. However, we must act fast, to put down the rebellion, or risk losing our power. However, putting it down would be disastrous for human life."
 mon.151.a: "Send in the troops."
 mon.151.b: "Put down our arms, let the violence end."

 mon.152.t: "[MON.GetLeader]'s power is secure"
 mon.152.d: "For multiple hours, Urga was under the control of Wu Heling's rebel forces. However, that changed when General Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren marched in with a large force, from the surrounding barracks'. After surrounding the city, Damdinsüren's troops moved in and went street to street, clearing out the remaining rebels.\n\nBy evening it was all over. The streets of Urga were stained crimson, with the blood of hundreds of rebels and civilians alike. However, though sadness reigned over most of the city, the State Great Khural was very different. There, [MON.GetLeader] held a speech to only MAN members, declaring their victory against the rebels and a start to true Mongolian Socialism. The whole hall erupted in applause."
 mon.152.a: "Power is Secure."

 mon.153.t: "Wu Heling takes power"
 mon.153.d: "With the last surrender of our troops, Wu Heling marched into the State Great Khural, and declared the fighting as over. As many in the MAN government were arrested, including [MON.GetLeader], Wu Heling made a speech, claiming this was once again a new beginning for Mongolia, a democratic one. For now, he and the MLN have made a power sharing deal, until elections can be held soon."
 mon.153.a: "Great."

 mon.154.t: "Tseveen holds speech about Wu Heling's nationality"
 mon.154.d: "\"Earlier today, the phony government who currently hide in the State Great Khural made a statement about the nationality of our fellow democrat Wu Heling. Though me and him disagree about many things, that does not change a simple fact: that we are both Mongolian. Wu Heling is as much Mongolian as I as is you. This government wishes to try to divide Mongolians in a weak attempt to weaken our resolve. However, we will not let this stand. It is time for us to march!\"This speech, held in the outskirts of Urga to a massive crowd, received much applause and cheers from the people watching. Immediately after this, the large group of people began to march into the city..."
 mon.154.a: "This won't be good..."

 mon.155.t: "Peaceful march in Urga"
 mon.155.d: "The streets of Urga today are packed with thousands of civilians, protesting against the actions of the current government. Lead by both Wu Heling and Tseveen, they call for the resignation of the current government, and for them to be temporarily put in power until elections can be organised."
 mon.155.a: "Put this down with bullets."
 mon.155.b: "Lay down our arms."

 mon.156.t: "Violent suppression leads to mass unrest"
 mon.156.d: "As government troops marched through the streets, gunning down anyone who showed resistance, it seems this had the opposite of the desired effect. As one man is shot, three men decide to join the rebellion against us. Wu Heling, using weapons he bought thanks to the nobles, has armed the rebels with guns, and they have began marching toward the State Great Khural now..."
 mon.156.a: "This won't be good."

 mon.157.t: "Tseveen releases statement against claim"
 mon.157.d: "In a statement released by Wu Heling today, he states:\n\n\"The current government has proven they are unable to keep the peace and perform their democratic duty. In blaming me for the attacks, they have shown their true colours: dangerous, and willing to exploit human loss for political gain. I can confirm that I was in no way involved in the planning of this attack, and I pray for the swift recovery for anyone injured in the attack. Not only was I not involved in this, I declare now that this act of terror was committed by the government itself, to try to give legitimacy to their cancellation of elections. We must make sure the government who committed this crime pay for their actions.\""
 mon.157.a: "We stand by it."

 mon.158.t: "Wu Heling states Tseveen is just as bad as [MON.GetLeader]"
 mon.158.d: "Rather controversially, Wu Heling, leader of the MAK and one of our main opponents, publicly released a statement about Tseveen's denial of the events prior:\n\n\"I fear today that I must partially agree with the government's statement about the bombings, that it was in fact Tseveen and his MLN who organised it. The acts of violence caused by the MLN are level with the pains the current MAN government have caused to all Mongolians. Both the MLN under Tseveen and the MAN under [MON.GetLeader] are evil groups, who seek to destroy any order and peace the nation has, and replace them with bloody syndicalist revolution.\"\n\nIronically, this statement has proven very unpopular, with government supporters claiming that Wu Heling only works for himself, and MLN supporters claiming Wu Heling has betrayed them. It seems Wu Heling's nobles will not be a problem in the coming future."
 mon.158.a: "Divide and conquer."

 mon.159.t: "Tseveen declares the government dead"
 mon.159.d: "In a speech today just on the outskirts of Urga to a large crowd of people, Tseveen declared:\n\n\"The current government is dead! They no longer have any mandate to rule, and have cast off democracy and justice in favour of nepotism and corruption. We Mongolians know revolution well; we fought against Chinese rule in 1911, and against Ungern-Sternberg in 1936. Therefore, I declare now the start of a new Revolution: The Liberal Revolution!\"\n\nMany cheers were heard from the crowd, and word of this new revolution spread around Urga quickly."
 mon.159.a: "Worrying."

 mon.160.t: "Arsenal raided by rebels"
 mon.160.d: "Early in the morning, a weapons arsenal was raided by revolutionaries. There is evidence that the men guarding the arsenal actively supported the rebels, allowing them to take the weapons without resistance. It seems now we will have to deal with the growth of militant violence."
 mon.160.a: "Damn."

 mon.161.t: "Tseveen travels out of Urga to gather support in nearby areas"
 mon.161.d: "Tseveen has recently made public that he intends to travel out to nearby villages and nomadic groups near Urga, to try and gain their support for the revolution. While doing this, he has only taken a small force of men with him, and has left the rest of his supporters in Urga. We must act on this, and this leaves us with a choice. Either we can try to root out the rebels in the city while Tseveen in away, or we can send out a group of men to attack Tseveen while his supporters remain in Urga. Without their leader, they will surely fail."
 mon.161.a: "Send out troops to attack Tseveen."
 mon.161.b: "Root out rebels in the city."

 mon.162.t: "The Attack on Tseveen"
 mon.162.d: "In the early evening of last night, Tseveen's group set up camp outside a small village a few miles outside Urga. His party was only 25 men strong, and when they were met with a group of 200 government troops, they were extremely unprepared. While most of Tseveen's men were sleeping, out troops took positions and fired as one, killing most of his men almost immediately. The rest, including Tseveen, surrendered before they were gunned down too. The men were arrested and brought back to Urga, where they will live in a prison cell for the rest of their lives."
 mon.162.a: "Perfect."

 mon.163.t: "Large riots spark in Urga after innocents get investigated"
 mon.163.d: "After giving the order for investigations, a large group of soldiers numbering around 200 were tasked with going through every person in Urga to root out the rebels. However, it seems this move was not exactly popular with the population. The soldiers did small investigations on many people in Urga, and if they deemed them to be rebels, either arrested them or lined them up and shot them without trial. After doing this through part of Urga, the people in the city began to resist them. Civilians began to throw rocks at the soldiers, and were met with bullets. This quickly led to massive riots throughout Urga, primarily lead by armed MLN insurgents."
 mon.163.a: "End the riot with bullets."
 mon.163.b: "Open talks with Tseveen and his rebels."

 mon.164.t: "Massacre in Urga"
 mon.164.d: "After organising the troops and gathering more, the battalion, now 500 soldiers strong, marched into Urga and declared that any resistance was to be met with bullets. Starting in upper Urga, the battalion battled hard with rioting civilians and MLN insurgents alike, and both sides took substantial losses. It wasn't until the battalion began to move that things turned for the worst. While travelling through the middle of Urga, the battalion were very quickly surrounded by armed MLN insurgents, who opened fire on the troops. Whenever a rebel was killed, another came in to take his place. Casualties for the rebels were very high, however, they had won the day. All the soldiers in the battalion were lost, and so the group, lead by the now returned Tseveen, moved in to take the State Great Khural."
 mon.164.a: "The rebellion has succeeded."

 mon.165.t: "Tseveen takes over the government"
 mon.165.d: "After fighting off the remaining guards of the State Great Khural, Tseveen took his place as Prime Minister. [MON.GetLeader] was arrested, along with multiple other major MAN players. While there, Tseveen declared that it was time for the people of Mongolia to experience true democracy, and that an election was already being scheduled."
 mon.165.a: "Freedom wins in Mongolia."

 mon.166.t: "Tseveen demands elections and arrests of many MAN members"
 mon.166.d: "After releasing a statement that we would be prepared for talks with the MLN rebels, Tseveen has released a new statement:\n\n\"We decline your offer for talks with us. It is not talks we need. Talks would lead to small concessions which allow you to subvert the democratic process. Instead, we have made a list of demands. If these demands are followed, then the revolution will end.\n\n1. Elections must be scheduled as soon as possible.\n\n2. The arrests of the perpetrators who lead to this situation, primarily [MON.GetLeader].\n\n3. The freedom for any rebels who have been arrested during the past few weeks.\n\n4. Justice served to those soldiers who carelessly killed innocent civilians.\n\n5. The acknowledgement by the MAN that this revolution was caused by their undemocratic actions.\""
 mon.166.a: "We can never agree to this."
 mon.166.b: "Elections are fine, but defend the MAN members."
 mon.166.c: "Agree entirely, elections will be scheduled for a months time."

 mon.167.t: "Tseveen raises his forces"
 mon.167.d: "Across Urga today, hundreds of armed MLN rebels have risen against us, after hearing of our refusal of their demands. The group organised and quickly defeated the garrison that was present in the city, with some of the soldiers even joining their side. Now, the rebels begin their march to the State Great Khural."
 mon.167.a: "This doesn't look good."

 mon.168.t: "Tseveen states MAN arrests are key to uphold democracy"
 mon.168.d: "Tseveen has released a response to our answer that elections can occur so long as MAN members like [MON.GetLeader] are not arrested. His response was that the arrests of these men is necessary to allow democracy to function, and to protect it for the future. The rebels demands remain unchanged."
 mon.168.a: "Then we refuse."
 mon.168.b: "We have to agree to this."

 mon.170.t: "The Constitution of [GetYear]"
 mon.170.d: "After finally securing control of Mongolia, [MON.GetLeader] made a speech outside the State Great Khural, promising many things, including the redistribution of wealth, a new constitution, and democratic elections. In the following months since, the government has worked hard to set right the injustices caused by the previous government. The peasants now finally feel like they truly have power, and do not work as slaves.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the government has been working on the second promise. Over the period of multiple weeks, full of long meetings and heated arguments, the new constitution has been drafted. This constitution sets out the government form, with the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu as the figurehead leader of the nation once he comes of age, with much power in the hands of the working class, through voting for the Prime Minister and his government. It also includes points about human and workers rights, and ensures universal suffrage.\n\nWith celebrations of the new constitution echoing through Urga, we must now focus on the last of [MON.GetLeader]'s promises: elections."
 mon.170.a: "Elections?"

 mon.171.t: "Restoring Order to the Regency"
 mon.171.d: "In the past few months, it has become clear to the Baron and the court that his rule is constantly in danger. Therefore, he has declared it time to examine our current military staff, and decide whether they are loyal to the Khanate, or whether it is time they see a bullet."
 mon.171.a: "We must root out the traitors!"

 mon.172.t: "Status of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren"
 mon.172.d: "Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren has fought on the side of Mongolia for decades, taking part in Mongolian independence back in 1911. Though he opened dialogue with the MAN rebels at the time, he was arrested by the Chinese, and almost died in his cell. He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall. He constantly makes it clear that he doesn't serve us, rather serving Mongolia directly. Maybe it is time for the old General to meet his end."
 mon.172.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.172.b: "End him."

 mon.173.t: "Status of Nikolay Kazagrandi"
 mon.173.d: "Nikolay Kazagrandi is a man who gains much ire from the Baron. Having worked with Ungern-Sternberg during the Russian Civil War, Kazagrandi nevertheless staunchly detested the Baron. Parting ways as the Baron led his men into Mongolia to depose the MAN Revolutions, Kazagrandi would see continued, and even brilliant, service in the Russian Military Staff. Skilled, reasonable, and with ties to the Socialist Revolutionaries, and to various fellow Siberians such as Aleksey Grishin, Kazagrandi was chosen as the official attaché to Urga in 1931. Ostensibly, he serves to cement the Russian-Mongolian relationship, however the Baron is under suspicions that Kazagrandi is merely there to keep watch on him. Despite his competency, the men have still not reconciled. Perhaps his appointment leaves him perfectly helpless to Ungern-Sternberg's machinations."
 mon.173.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.173.b: "End him."

 mon.174.t: "Status of Khatanbaatar Magsarjav"
 mon.174.d: "Khatanbaatar Magsarjav's situation is similar to that of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. The old man formed an anti-Chinese guerrilla group in Inner Mongolia in 1907, for which he became a Mongolian hero. He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he collaborated and formed the alleged \"Nobleman's Group\", a precursor organisation associated with the MAN revolutionaries. This is where the worry about Khatanbaatar Magsarjav lies. He has been considerably loyal to the Khanate and Regency, and is one of its most valued commanders, having served as Minister of Defence for a tenure unbeknownst to any predecessor. However his ties to MAN, even if it was in its infancy, could they have persisted? Is he at least, sympathetic?"
 mon.174.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.174.b: "End him."

 mon.175.t: "Status of the Officers"
 mon.175.d: "The officer class have proven their disloyalty over the past few months. With many officers deciding to align themselves with the opposing rebel groups, it is clear many of their loyalties do not sit with us. Perhaps it is time for the officer class to be cleansed of anyone who dared declare themselves for an opposing faction."
 mon.175.a: "They are fine."
 mon.175.b: "Decommission the lot of them."

 mon.176.t: "Status of Altanochir"
 mon.176.d: "Altanochir is a notable prince from Inner Mongolia, who only very recently travelled to Urga, after recommendation from Prince Demchugdongrub. It should already be clear as to why he is on the chopping block. Demchugdongrub pushed to gain power during the chaos of the Western Revolt. It was his clique of princes and nobles who almost led to our downfall. Altanochir, still being quite a low level military leader, should be an obvious one to be purged."
 mon.176.a: "He is trustworthy."
 mon.176.b: "End him."

 mon.177.t: "The Purge has Ended"
 mon.177.d_small: "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Whether it can even be called a purge is up for debate, due to the relatively minor amount of actions that were taken against possible traitors. The military leaders of Mongolia who survived breathe a sigh of relief, though some may still scheme against us."
 mon.177.d_medium: "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were exiled or otherwise demobilised throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."
 mon.177.d_big: "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were exiled or otherwise demobilised throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."
 mon.177.a: "One's own heart must surely bleed."

 mon.178.t: "37 People Die in Factory Explosion"
 mon.178.d: "Following Ungern's continued policy of industrialisation, construction of new factories, sponsored mostly by Russian businessmen, sprung up across the nation. With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Russian entrepreneurs. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly built bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. The businessmen merely deflected any resulting blame, directing the accident instead as the fault of the Mongolian workers."
 mon.178.a: "\"You should damn well watch what you say!\""

 mon.179.t: "Mongol Ardīn Nam Cell Destroyed near the Russian Border"
 mon.179.d: "After receiving information from one of our informants placed in the MAN, we learned the location of a major MAN cell, just on the Russo-Mongolian border. So, under the command of Mikhail Tornovsky, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Tornovsky moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Tornovsky rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and detained them for questioning. After going through all the papers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After gathering all the decent information out of the area, Tornovsky burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through our secret police."
 mon.179.a: "Finally, peace can be secured."

 mon.180.t: "Hundreds of Soldiers Imprisoned for Refusing to Pledge Allegiance to the Khan"
 mon.180.d: "With new measures implemented recently, forcing every soldier to pledge their full allegiance to the 2nd Bogd Khan, hundreds have refused to do so. Many of them claim that they do not serve the Khan, but rather serve the nation of Mongolia. However, what they fail to see is that these are one in the same. For this betrayal, these soldiers have been imprisoned, so that they cannot spread dissent against us."
 mon.180.a: "We are all but humble servants of our monarch."

 mon.181.t: "Battle Between Peace Preservation Corps and Mongolian People's Army"
 mon.181.d: "Many of the rich nobles and princes of Mongolia have their own guard with them at all times, almost like a private army. After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the population, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian People's Army were sent in, under the leadership of Damdin Sükhbaatar. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MPA in. Sükhbaatar said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Sükhbaatar gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MPA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."
 mon.181.a: "Those who refuse to follow the revolution must be forced."

 mon.182.t: "Russia has Fallen"
 mon.182.d: "It appears the worst has happened. Our great allies in the north, the Russian Bear, has fallen. Unable to withstand the calamitious tide of the world's superpower. Now, we are forced to go it alone. Someday, perhaps, we might free the people of Russia, and perhaps restore the rightful Tsar to their throne. For now, however, we will struggle to survive."
 mon.182.a: "We must go alone."

 mon.183.t: "Overtures from Mongolia"
 mon.183.d: "An ambassador from Urga arrived today, professing his support for our regime in the face of great nations seeking to invade our territories. Following the toppling of Sternberg's repressive rule by the Buddyn Zövlöl, spearheaded by the 7th Changyka Khutukhtu, our two nations have become ever more connected. In order to ensure that our legacy endures for future generations, it is only reasonable to strengthen our common Buddhist beliefs within our theocratic governments, should someday a growing force in China, India, or Russia dare to jeopardize our security."
 mon.183.a: "Together, we will stand against the tide of history."

 mon.184.t: "Declaration of the new Pan-Mongol State"
 mon.184.d: "Banners of the Soyombo (the Mongolian National Symbol) were raised high across every city, especially in Urga, after having fulfilled the complete unification of the \"Whole Mongolia\". Our armies, battered and bruised, clashed against many a foe, including the Russian horde in Siberia as well as the elite forces of the Chinese. However, despite the deaths of thousands of brave Mongolian soldiers in the honour of our great state, Mongolia stands triumphant against all enemies. A parade was organised in the capital as our loyal troops return from their hardened posts to reunite with their families across the country. Many see these victories as the signalling of a brand new Mongolian golden age, a suitable return to part of what our ancestors controlled many centuries ago."
 mon.184.a: "The cyclical nature of history repeats once again."

 mon.400.t: "Refuting the Ungern Legend"
 mon.400.d: "The Buddyn Zövlöl has forbid the utterance of Baron Ungern's name in Mongolia henceforth. Much like the infamous bandit Ja Lama, his power over the people is measured in has reverence and infamy. The grounds where Ja Lama and Baron Ungern fortified were briefly treated as hallow ground, but truly spirits such as these must be banished from our lands, not revered."

 mon.401.t: "Agvan Dorzhiev Condemned for Russophilia"
 mon.401.d: "The Buryat thorn, Agvan Dorzhiev, has been banned from entering Mongolia. Agvan's manipulative use of the Kalachakra tantra in Tibet portraying the Russian Tsars as the reincarnations of the Ārya Tārā. This kind of heresy will only invite additional foreign mercenaries to attempt on our sovereignty. The Ārya Tārā is also obviously Tsendiin Dondogdulam, the Bogd Khan's wife."

 mon.402.t: "Barchenko's Curious Expedition"
 mon.402.d: "Though we are extremely wary of further Russian exploration, Alexander Barchenko distinguishes himself from the usual transparent spies. Barchenko claims to be a true believer in Tantric Buddhism, and claims to be writing a scientific paper on the health benefits of a monastic lifestyle. [MON.GetLeader] was ready to approve of his study, only to be stopped by a minister with one of Barchenko's other papers. This paper, entitled 'On the Transfer of Thoughts To A Distance' is some kind of scientific paper on divination. Alarmed at what appears to be another Russian conman's ploy to exploit Mongolia's culture, a deeper consideration of his plan is in order."

 mon.403.t: "Status of Traditional Mongolian Sacrifices"
 mon.403.d: "Spoken around campfires among Mongol soldiers, there are few forms of bravado so popular as to claim you have removed an enemies heart. This act, which was banned under the Qing amban for decades, has returned to prominence due to Mongolia's instability. Commanders have requested [MON.GetLeader] use his influence in politics to ban this practice, stating that it will hold back our military's reputation."

 mon.404.t: "Ak Jang Practitioners Arrested"
 mon.404.d: "From the Oirat mountains, near the land of Chinggis Khaan's birth, comes a revival of his old ways. A shaman, Chet Chelpan, has reported wide seeing a rider in white, the White Burkhan. Chet has organised Buryat churches in order to revoke Buddhism in the land of our ancestors, and is oppressing our history with his claims that the Oirat will be liberated by some white saviour. This is obvious Ungern mythmaking, and should be treated as another attempt to immortalise the bastard."
 mon.404.a: "Imprison Chet and his shamans."

 mon.405.t: "Foreign-names for Toponomy Banned"
 mon.405.d: "The Buddyn Zövlöl has banned all references to the Marco Polo, Humboldt, Ritter, Alexander III, and Prajevalski mountains. These names are attempts to impose their history onto ours, and are tantamount to imperialism. We must rename them to honour the Mongol heroes of our history."
 mon.405.a: "We assert our identity"

 mon.406.t: "9th Jebtsundamba Health Scare"
 mon.406.d: "The young 9th Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu recently fell ill for a few days. Monks were called out to find the source of the illness. It is presumed that one of the lama-monks have broken their vows and cursed the child's health. After much searching and interrogation, it was discovered that a monk had eaten a fish on the day the young Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu became sick. After this monk was justly defrocked and beaten, the child recovered from his illness. To the lamas attending to the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu, this validated their belief that moral health of subjects confers health to their leaders."

 mon.407.d: "Mongolian author Tsendiin Damdinsüren has managed to find and translate a copy of The Secret History of the Mongols from its Chinese text into Khalkha Mongolian. This has enabled the story of Temujin, Chinggis Khaan, to be authoritatively told.

Agvan has presented Ungern with a Kalachakra tantra reportedly written by the late 13th Dalai Lama proclaiming the deceased Tsar Nicholas as the Ārya Tārā, the White Tara. This evidence appears to Ungern as validation for his monarchistic beliefs, and the two have stuck up a strong friendship. Although Agvan's influence has been reduced by the Regency, this friendship will undoubtedly bring Ungern's regime closer to Buddhist theologians."

 mon.427.d: "From the Oirat mountains, near the land of Chinggis Khaan's birth, comes a revival of his old ways. A shaman, Chet Chelpan, has reported wide seeing a rider in white, the White Burkhan. Chet has organised Buryat churches in order to revoke Buddhism in the land of our ancestors, and is oppressing our history with his claims that the Oirat will be liberated by some white saviour. This is obviously referring to the great Baron Ungern himself, and so Ungern's officers suggest inviting Chet to Urga to preach his message of hope.\n\nThou peopling within thyself, in gold and silver, A nation, White Altai! Thou who illuminest the day— Sun—Burkhan! Thou who illuminest the night— Moon—Burkhan! "

 mon.428.d: "The former captive Officer Ossendowski has written a book immortalising Baron Ungern. The book is mostly mythological, and contain the superstitious claim that Baron Ungern's brother, who allegedly died in the Russian Civil War, haunts his enemies and former friends. Despite this candor, Baron Ungern is concerned for the mental well being of his polish commander. The years of steppe life and his inability to return home is reflected in the book, which takes a fatalistic approach to the future of Mongolia."

 mon.429.d: "Quartermaster Vladimir Roerich, brother of famous painter and orientalist Nicholas Reorich, has suddenly deserted his post and taken a hoard of valuables with him. Vladimir was always a rebellious sort, which was initially why Baron Ungern allowed him into his Asiatic Cavalry division. Now Baron Ungern has put a warrant out for his arrest. It is suspected that Vladimir had received help in leaving from underground MAN members. It is unknown where he will head to."

This has enabled the story of Temujin, Chinggis Khaan, to be authoritatively told. In the spirit of Ungern, Tsendiin Damdinsüren included a forward claiming that the events of the Secret History teach a lesson to all Mongols. This lesson being 'Such a prophetic life as Temujins has happened many times after. In Russia, under Peter the Great, did a great conquest take place that restored the honour of the Mongols.'"
 mon.431.a: "All true"

 mon.446.t: "Memorial to the Red Hat Rebellion"
 mon.446.d: "A memorial has been built in Inner Mongolia to memorialise the thousands that died from Chinese persecution and fled Inner Mongolia during the Red Hat Rebellion. This has been coyly referred to as the 'Jindandao incident' by Chinese propaganda. Many still living remember the hundreds of thousands that were lost, and to which the western observers celebrated as a triumph against our faith. The Noyodyn Zövlöl government promises to avenge their deaths."
 mon.446.a: "Soon we shall return"

 mon.436.t: "Renovate Memorial to Chinggis Khaan"
 mon.436.d: "The long storied history of the relics of Chinggis Khaan is on the rise, recognised by scholars like Zhang Xiangwen, who proclaimed Ejin Horo as the site of the Khaan's burial. It is essential that we recall the relics of Ejin Horo's memorial to Urga, in order to safeguard them from treasure seekers. It is already rumoured that the vicious warlords of the south have plundered tombs of lesser emperors and disgraced their names in their own vain bids for immortal fame. However, us Mongols have the will to draw what we hold dear inwards for protection."
 mon.436.a: "I hope the Buddhist monks do not mind"

 mon.437.t: "Chinggis Khaan Relics Stolen, Taken to Gansu"
 mon.437.d: "Disaster has struck our efforts to secure the relics of Chinggis Khan from Chinese robberies. It appears that a contingent of rogue Guominjun soldiers have intercepted the relics in transit and have fled with them to Gansu. Firmly within the hands of the steadfast Ma families, it would appear that the relics are out of our hands for the foreseeable future. That is of course, what our adversaries would think."
 mon.437.a: "They're just like Feng"

 mon.438.t: "Guominjun Rogues Ransom Chinggis Khaan's Relics"
 mon.438.d: "Our infiltrators have entered Gansu and are unable to locate the relics of Chinggis Khaan. Locals reported that most relics that pass through are sold to visiting explorers, officers and landlords, despite none of these groups claiming ownership of any relics currently. A breakthrough came when a Mongol emissary was contacted by a Guominjun defector, who claims that he can arrange a ransom for the relics and a peaceful transaction, for a price."
 mon.438.a: "Any price is worth our history"
 mon.438.b: "New deal, the relics or your head!"

 mon.439.t: "Guominjun Rogues Lied, Search Continues"
 mon.439.d: "Despite our best efforts to deal with the Guominjun defector, it turns out that he was lying the entire time. Months of effort is wasted, and the infiltration is presumed a failure. [MON.GetLeader], however, has refused to accept this loss. A second, more thorough investigation has been announced that will track down potential agitating elements in the Western Provinces that would have an interest in Chinggis Khaan's legacy."
 mon.439.a: "We are NOT giving up!"

 mon.440.t: "Chinggis Khaan's Relics Found in Kumul"
 mon.440.d: "Our second investigation made a breakthrough in the far western land of Kumul, thousands of kilometres from Inner Mongolia. It appears that the family of the Khan of Kumul had wrestled the relics of Chinggis Khaan from their first buyers, and have claimed it as their own owing to their Chagatai legacy. This offence done by the Muslims would have resulted in war, if not for the diplomatic grace of [MON.GetLeader]. For a very large fee, the relics of Chinggis Khaan are recovered finally, and the Khan's family compensated more than adequately."
 mon.440.a: "An easier deal than expected"

 mon.441.t: "The Hunt for Japan's Herald"
 mon.441.d: "Recently, word has spread across Inner Mongolia of an Imam, Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev, that is agitating Muslims toward Fengtian. Long have the banners opposed any political influence of Islam in Inner Mongolia, and until now no institution dared to challenge us in this regard. But coming out of Shenyang are pamphlets called 'Japan's Herald' written in Arabic and Chinese calling for Muslims to emigrate to Fengtian, promising them a return and holy victory against Buddhism. This is just the threat the Kalachakra tantra predicted, and it is our duty to find and capture the Imam advocating for this apocalyptic conflict."
 mon.441.a: "Monks must protect ourselves"

 mon.442.t: "Japan's Herald Found, Imprisoned"
 mon.442.d: "Our agents have finally located the radical imam Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev, who has been agitating Muslims against Buddhists. The Imam was apprehended by our agents after a mysterious man in Shenyang, Vladimir Roerich, tipped us off. It appears that this Imam was a former ally of Baron Ungern to boot, which only reinforces the idea that Baron Ungern cared not for us Buddhists. The imam Kurbangaliev shall be detained indefinitely, and hopefully the Japanese cannot find another such as him to do their dirty work. Vladimir Roerich has been well compensated and we hope his Tri-Artel Commune continues to help the beleaguered in Shenyang."
 mon.442.a: "What a curious ally"

 mon.444.t: "Barchenko's Curious Expedition"
 mon.444.d: "Though we are extremely wary of further Russian exploration, Alexander Barchenko distinguishes himself from the usual transparent spies. Barchenko claims to be a true believer in Tantric Buddhism, and claims to be writing a scientific paper on the health benefits of a monatic lifestyle. [MON.GetLeader] was ready to approve of his study, only to be stopped by a minister with one of Barchenko's other papers. This paper, entitled 'On the Transfer of Thoughts To A Distance' is some kind of scientific paper on divination. Alarmed at what appears to be another Russian conman's ploy to exploit Mongolia's culture, a deeper consideration of his plan is in order."
 mon.444.a: "Out! We are not a curiosity"

 mon.445.t: "The Secret History of the Mongols Rediscovered"
 mon.445.d: "Mongolian author Tsendiin Damdinsüren has managed to find and translate a copy of The Secret History of the Mongols from its Chinese text into Khalkha Mongolian. This has enabled the story of Temujin, Chinggis Khaan, to be authoritatively told. In the spirit of nationalism, Tsendiin Damdinsüren included a forward cautioning Mongolians from selling this book to foreigners. Damdinsüren's forward states that 'Mongol history must never be warped or stolen by foreigners ever again.'"
 mon.445.a: "Could we be in another golden age?"

 mon.450.t: "We have secured Dzungaria"
 mon.450.d: "Due to the success of our raids, the government of [SIK.GetNameDef] has ordered a total withdrawal of their military and garrison forces of Dzungaria, thus allowing our forces to easily march in. Our raids throughout the past months (with varying degrees of intensity) have proven to be successful and we have now rightfully reunited our country with Dzungaria, thus strengthening the Mongol nation henceforth."
 mon.450.a: "A brilliant victory."

Born with the name Dugar, he would assume the religious name Choibalsan at 13 after entering the local Buddhist monastery of San Beysiyn Khüree where he would train to be a Lama. Fleeing to Khüree, or Urga, with a fellow trainee, he would work odd jobs until meeting a sympathetic Buryat teacher known as Nikolai Danchinov who enrolled him in the Russian consulate's Russian-Mongolian Translators' School. A year later, Choibalsan would be sent to study at a gymnasium in Irkutsk.\n\nWith all Mongolian students in Russia recalled back to Khüree by the Bogd Khan's government following the October Revolution, Choibalsan would nonetheless become enamoured by Socialist doctrine following his time in Russia, and upon his return would join the Socialist Consular Hill Group under the assurances of his former teacher, Dogsomyn Bodoo. Serving as the bridge between the group and the Russian Consulate, Choibalsan's contacts there would usher in the unification of his group with the more nationalist-oriented Züün Khüree.\n\nParticipating in the formation of the Mongolian People's Party, Choibalsan would become a part of the famous \"First Seven\" of MAN. Receiving military training in Irkutsk alongside Sükhbaatar, Choibalsan would slowly adopt the legendary hero as a second mentor.

Joining the Pavel Military School in Saint Petersburg, he would become interested in Buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, serving in Renenkampf's Cossack Army. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after being restricted from fighting for Mongolian independence.\n\nIn the Great War, Ungern fought first in Galicia where he was wounded five times, and yet kept returning to the frontline with unhealed wounds. Being awarded a series of medals for his repeated bravery, he would then fight in the Caucasus under Baron Wrangel with his friend Grigory Semyonov. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the Whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently against the communists.\n\nHaving been involved in Pan-Mongol affairs as early as 1918, Ungern would seize the opportunity to involve himself in the Mongolian struggle against the Chinese. Invading with his famous Asiatic Cavalry Division in 1920, Ungern would drive out the occupiers, and put down the successive MAN rebellions of 1921 and 1924. Austere and with great reverence for the traditions of Mongolia, he would assume the title of regent, awaiting the day that the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu comes of age.
