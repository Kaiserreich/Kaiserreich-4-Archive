 ### Characters ###

 SAR_wu_chan: "Wu Chan"
 SAR_wu_chan_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 31st 1904, Haifeng County, Guangdong Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Originally known as Wu Zantian, the leader of the Sarawak Anti-Imperialist League's humble origins began in the Guangdong countryside, born to a once wealthy peasant family that had fallen on hard times. He spent his youth working the fields, until in 1925 he joined most of his family in emigrating to Sarawak. They settled in the Kuching Chinatown and became grocers at the Siniawan markets, financing an opportunity for Wu to travel to Japan the next year and seek a higher education. He was able to apply at the Tokyo Higher Normal School, where he changed his name to Wu Chan.\n\nDespite being born and raised in the southern heartlands of the Chinese Revolution, it was not until his arrival in Tokyo that Wu became acquainted with radical politics. At this time he was primarily influenced by Chinese Anarchism, the Japanese Left and the Third Internationale. By the early 1930s Wu abandoned his studies, citing the ongoing Japanese imperial meddling in Manchuria as a burden on his conscience that prevented him from continuing to study at a Japanese school. He moved to Shanghai where he made contacts with the local chapter of the Kuomintang through some fellow ex-students and founded a local newspaper entitled \"Freedom\".\n\nWu's time in the city did not last long however, after the Shanghai Uprising of 1932 he fled China for fear of being persecuted over his political ties. Though some comrades offered to help escort him to the Kuomintang Base Area in Longyan, Wu declined and instead chose to return to Sarawak, taking the lessons of what he had learned in Tokyo and Shanghai back with him to the overseas Chinese community.\n\nHe became a teacher at a local Chinese school in Bau, eventually rising to the position of principal, and later served as editor of the Sarawak Daily newspaper in Kuching. Inspired by the political efforts of the Kuomintang and the Shanghai trade unions, he founded the \"Sarawak Anti-Imperialist League\" to unite social bandits, student radicals and trade unionists from all of Sarawak's ethnic groups in order to oppose both Japanese and European imperialism in Asia."

 SAR_ong_kee_hui: "Ong Kee Hui"
 SAR_ong_kee_hui_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 19th, 1914, in Kuching, Raj of Sarawak\n§YPolitical Career:§! The great scion of the Ong family is practically the face of younger Chinese Sarawakians who distinguish themselves not through resting on their wealth and privileges, but instead through political organising. Hui was born into the family of the \"Kapitan China\", a position given to community leaders among the Chinese of Sarawak by the Rajah himself. Bearing the legacy of being the great-grandson of the first Kapitan, Ong Ewe Hai, as well as the grandson of the incumbent Kapitan, Ong Tiang Swee, it was natural that Hui would one day inherit the position and so was groomed to become a leader of the Chinese community.\n\nHe was strictly raised within the Confucian faith, though privately expressed interest for Christianity in his adult years, and was later sent to attend prestigious private Chinese Schools in both Sarawak and Singapore. He later graduated from the Serdang College of Agriculture in Selangor, returning to Sarawak to join the Raj's Agricultural Department in 1935. Hui became renowned for his expertise in paddy farming, his frequent travels into the \"Ulu\" (a term for Sarawak's remote jungles that lay up-river), as well as his ability to relate to the problems of the impoverished.\n\nHe was later recalled back to Kuching, where he helped manage his family's private farms and factories. There he became acquainted with the local student movements in Kuching while also growing sympathetic to the proletarian \"Night Schools\" and ephemeral labour unions that were forming around his family's businesses. Though belittled by his old money peers and shunned by some of his newfound comrades as an \"upper-class socialist\", Hui had seen the toils of Sarawakian peasants, workers and students, of all the nation's different peoples, and was not afraid to use his family’s wealth and influence to extend them a helping hand. In particular, his support and de-facto leadership of the All Students’ Representative Delegation as well as his later affiliation with the Sarawak Anti-Imperialist League caught the most attention, distinguishing him as a political starlet who has sought to reconcile the Chinese merchant families and their guilds with the growing labour movement."

 SAR_charles_vyner_brooke: "Charles Vyner Brooke"
 SAR_charles_vyner_brooke_regnal: "Vyner I"
 SAR_charles_vyner_brooke_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 26th, 1874, in Westminster, London, England\n§YPolitical Career:§! Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke was born abroad, during one of his mother Margaret's many sojourns away from the White Rajahs' adoptive homeland of Sarawak. Though groomed to one day inherit the Raj from his father Charles Brooke, his strict upbringing in British high-society and his education at Winchester and Trinity College had initially left Vyner shy and unassuming. Upon his return to Sarawak in the late 1890s he was appointed his father’s aide-de-camp and sometimes his regent. He had an impressive martial career, quelling native insurgencies in Sarawak and serving in the British military before and during the Weltkrieg. Gradually, Vyner broke out of his shell and came to enjoy the privilege he held as heir presumptive and later Rajah.\n\nUpon inheriting the throne in 1917 he used his middle name to distinguish himself from his father, and initially ruled in tandem with his younger brother Bertram, believed by many to have been Charles' preferred choice of successor. His brother was something of his opposite; a once bold and charismatic man who had grown introverted with age. As such, it did not take long for Vyner to dominate Sarawak's government as the brothers' shared responsibilities fell entirely on his Vyner’s shoulders.\n\nSchemers such as the \"White Caliph\" Gerard MacBryan and Vyner's own wife Sylvia became able to excerpt significant influence, at the same time as the Rajah ceded more and more control to the British Colonial Office and the North Borneo Company. The culmination of this was Vyner's attempted \"cession\" of Sarawak itself in the early 1920s, offering his kingdom to the British Empire in exchange for a lifetime stipend he could live comfortable off. When this scheme failed, Vyner continued to reluctantly occupy the throne, even after the German protectorate was enforced over the region following the British Revolution. Even today he continues to shirk his responsibility and maintains the dream of a more exciting life in the ballrooms and soirées of Ottawa, among his old friends from Britain."

 ### Ideas ###

 SAR_paramilitary0: "Sarawakian Paramilitaries"
 SAR_paramilitary0_desc: "While the troops of [SAR.GetNameDef] may have achieved great renown for their achievements and valour, especially the Rangers, [SAR.GetNameDef] formally lacks a single unified army and instead continues to rely on a more decentralised approach of multiple different paramilitary units. Despite it not being as effective as a regular army in conventional warfare, fighting in the lands of Borneo is rarely conventional, and may grant [SAR.GetAdjective] troops the advantage when the time comes."
 SAR_nbcc_influence: "NBCC Influence"
 SAR_nbcc_influence_desc: "The British North Borneo Chartered Company is one of the only foreign corporations that have ever been granted economic concessions to in Sarawak. From this they have long been exploiting Borneo’s resources for their own profit, much to the detriment of the local peoples, especially those in Sabah and Labuan. In these two eastern territories, the company was and effectively still is the only form of law and government, competing with the government in Kuching."

 SAR_white_rajahs_idea: "Reign of the White Rajahs"
 SAR_white_rajahs_idea_desc: "The Brooke family have ruled Sarawak ever since the territory was first granted to James Brooke, the first White Rajah, by the Sultan of Brunei. It was under this dynasty that the nation of Sarawak would emerge, and continue to thrive and survive under both British and German protection. With Sarawak now nominally independent, a White Rajah continues to sit on the Raj's throne, ready to lead the nation forward into this new future."
 SAR_white_rajahs_oligarchy_idea: "The Sarawakian Oligarchy"
 SAR_white_rajahs_oligarchy_idea_desc: "The Brooke family have ruled Sarawak ever since the territory was first granted to James Brooke, the first White Rajah, by the Sultan of Brunei. It was under this dynasty that the nation of Sarawak would emerge, and continue to thrive and survive under both British and German protection. With Sarawak now nominally independent, a White Rajah continues to sit on the Raj's throne, bringing with them great reforms to the nation, although ones that have so far benefitted few but the ruling circle."
 SAR_white_rajahs_democratic_idea: "A Modern Raj"
 SAR_white_rajahs_democratic_idea_desc: "The Brooke family have ruled Sarawak ever since the territory was first granted to James Brooke, the first White Rajah, by the Sultan of Brunei. It was under this dynasty that the nation of Sarawak would emerge, and continue to thrive and survive under both British and German protection. With Sarawak now nominally independent, a White Rajah continues to sit on the Raj's throne, bringing with them great reforms to the nation, which have planted the seeds of democracy that shall hopefully spring forth a modern and renewed nation."

 SAR_perlembagaan_rakyat_idea: "Perlembagaan Rakyat"
 SAR_perlembagaan_rakyat_idea_desc: "The Perlembagaan Rakyat, or People’s Constitution, is the document which has set in motion a great number of democratic reforms in the state of [SAR.GetNameDef]. The new constitution has put forth significant reforms to the Council Negri to attempt to make it a democratic legislature for all citizens of [SAR.GetNameDef], the rights of all citizens no matter their race have been legally guaranteed, and the special status of the other states in North Borneo have been officially recognised. While only time will tell how effectively and thoroughly these constitutional elements will actually be implemented, it appears that [SAR.GetNameDef]'s future will be a democratic one."
 SAR_birth_of_a_republic_idea: "Seeds of Democracy"
 SAR_birth_of_a_republic_idea_desc: "While political interest groups and organisations have always existed in [SAR.GetNameDef], the reforms made to the Council Negri have led to these groups officially reorganising themselves into proper political parties ready to operate within the system. It will certainly take time for these new parties to fully ingratiate themselves into the system, but with every step made towards this goal the people of [SAR.GetNameDef] are becoming more and more confident in the new constitution and the state as a whole."

 SAR_executive_idea: "Empowered Executive"
 SAR_executive_idea_desc: "While [SAR.GetNameDef] may be free from foreign rule, and reforms have been made to the Council Negri to give the nation's people a greater voice, true power in the nation still sits firmly in the hands of the small ruling circle, with nothing being done on a political level without a direct order from the top."
 SAR_ketuanan_melayu_idea: "Ketuanan Melayu"
 SAR_ketuanan_melayu_desc: "As far as the ruling Pergerakan Pemuda are concerned, [SAR.GetNameDef] is a state that belong solely to the Malays who inhabit it, and they have made clear of their intentions to ensure this remains the case. While not outright hostile to the non-Malays living within the nation's boundaries, the government has left no room for doubt that it will always prioritise the rights and desire of the Malay people over these non-Malay 'guests' who still make up a significant portion of the population."
 SAR_datu_patinggi_idea: "Reign of the Young Malays"
 SAR_datu_patinggi_idea_desc: "Even with the White Rajahs no longer in power, control over [SAR.GetNameDef] still rests firmly in the hands of a strong executive ruler and those favoured within his ruling circle. Despite not being as corrupt as the Vyner regime of old, to many little seems to have changed outside of the removal of many 'colonial remnants' which served to potentially restrict the ruling circle's influence."

 SAR_three_stars_idea: "The Three Stars of Sarawak"
 SAR_three_stars_idea_desc: "Socialism has reached North Borneo, and its people have been united under a three starred banner, representing the three main ethnic groups of the Malays, the Chinese, and the Dayaks. It is through uniting these people under one socialist banner that the government of [SAR.GetNameDef] hope to free the nation from the legacies of colonialism, and bring it forwards to a bright red future."
 SAR_three_stars_three_principles_idea: "Three Stars, Three Principles"
 SAR_three_stars_three_principles_idea_desc: "Having been liberated by a Kuomintang led government, the leadership of [SAR.GetNane] have taken great inspiration from the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and other Kuomintang leaders when shaping their vision for the new state. While North Borneo may not be China, they believe that concepts such as the Three Principles are truly universal, and can guide the nation forward no matter where it may be located."
 SAR_nusantara_socialism_idea: "Nusantara Socialism"
 SAR_nusantara_socialism_idea_desc: "While many regard socialism to be at its most developed extent in western nations, the government of [SAR.GetNameDef] believes that ideas formulated at home and amongst the citizens of its neighbouring regions are a much more valuable source of inspiration. Taking elements from thinkers from mainland Malaya, those across the sea in Java, and even in the Philippines, they hope to develop a brand of socialism that truly fits the peoples of Southeast Asia."

 SAR_army_idea: "Tentera Darat Sarawak"
 SAR_army_idea_desc: "The old paramilitaries that used to make up the bulk of Sarawak's armed forces have been swept aside in favour of the development of a proper standing army to defend the nation. While unlikely to ever compete with the armies of the world's great powers, in time it is hoped that an army strong enough to defend the nation from any reasonable threat can truly be developed."
 SAR_communal_militias_idea: "Copying the Communal Militias"
 SAR_communal_militias_idea_desc: "To the socialist government in [SAR.GetNameDef], no soldiers have ever better exemplified the true spirit of the cause than the militias of France. While Borneo is no France, and its people may not be as energised as the French were, it is hoped that if even a fraction of it is emulated the soldiers of Sarawak will fight as hard as the nation needs them to when the time comes."
 SAR_svobodniks_idea: "Studying the Svobodniks"
 SAR_svobodniks_idea_desc: "While [SAR.GetNameDef]'s paramilitaries may have been disbanded in favour of a standing army, it does not mean that the nation's government does not recognise how effective the tactics employed by such troops can be. Seeing the paramilitaries that aided in the rise of Savinkov as the exemplary example of such tactics, they have begun to introduce elements into the army's training inspired by these Russian loyalists they have come to admire."

 ### Events ###

 sarawak.1.t: "Succession in Sarawak"
 sarawak.1.d: "While we may have chosen to reaffirm the rule of the White Rajah's over Sarawak, it has ultimately been decided by the Council Negri that Rajah Vyner I's return would be of little benefit to anyone. Instead, the council has moved to officially confirm Vyner's abdication and has begun to deliberate on the choice of successor, although the process has been complicated owing to Vyner's lack of male children. Discussions have however been narrowed down to two candidates from the Brooke dynasty, and the Council has requested advice on which to favour.\n\nThe most obvious choice to take the throne to many is Bertram Brooke, Vyner's younger brother who has for years acted as his heir apparent. Much like his brother, Bertram has expressed views that seem to favour the conservation of the status quo in Sarawak, although through a much more pragmatic lens than Vyner and so would be willing to take a step back from direct duties if that is the will of his people. Bertram has however also made clear his lack of desire to take up the crown, and despite not outright rejecting the idea he has directed the Council to instead consider if his son Anthony would be the better pick.\n\nCompared to his father, Anthony is regarded as somewhat of a radical firebrand, or at least as much as a prince can realistically be, with him notably presenting proposals for reforms to his uncle that received a very lukewarm response from the old Rajah. While willing to take a back seat to a more democratic government, if presented the opportunity the young prince will certainly make attempts to reform Sarawak into a much more modern monarchy fit for the current age.\n\nAll that is left for us to do now is to decide between these two candidates, and the Council shall take the final steps to officialise Vyner's abdication of the throne and confirm the appointment of the successor favoured by our advice."
 sarawak.1.a: "Sarawak would certainly be in steady hands under Bertram."
 sarawak.1.b: "Young Anthony seems very promising, the throne should go to him."
